B002ZG977Y|1.0|WOW, I am so glad I only spent $1 at a Red Box vending machine to see this. It is terrible. No story, stunted acting, cartoon CGI. Give me the original any day. This was a classic example of the film makers thinking all they needed to do was throw a bunch of money at the screen and it would be a success...    A total waste of time...

B002VPE1Z2|4.0|This is a small pouch, about 4 inches wide, 6 inches tall, and 2 inches deep. It consists of  one main, large area, with a small zippered pocket on the pouch front. A flip over top cover secures on the front with hook-and-loop material, and covers the zippered pocket when closed. The top cover has a vinyl, leather-look patch on the front.    The pouch is made of a lighter weight Cordura-type nylon material, and has a large (1 and 1/2 inches) belt loop  on the back, which also secures with a healthy patch of hook-and-loop material.    The inside is padded and lined with a soft material to avoid scratching the contents. It is roomy for its size, and flexible enough to allow items which may not be exactly the right square shape.    It is well-made, with seams all even and tight, and no sign of cutting corners. A good little pouch which will get a lot of use from a pack-rat like myself.
0596007124|5.0|This book is aimed at the absolute beginner and it delivers what it promises in quite a different writing style than the usual one, with floating text and diagrams all over the page and curvy arrows pointing here and there. I think it makes a potentially dull topic that could spawn endless walls of text available to a wider audience, making the reading easy and attractive.    Sure, the examples might be oversimplified and far from being directly deployed in real life, but I do not mind that for a beginner book. The book not only teaches design patterns, but also the OO design principles that support those patterns; while the examples may not be too realistic, I think the book succeeds at educating the reader towards making good OO design decisions and fully understanding the nature of the patterns presented.    If you're a programmer on your journey to the OO world and you're wondering how others are tackling the design issues you are facing then I'd say this book is a right place to start.
B002VPE1X4|4.0|This pouch is well made from neoprene material, with a D-ring connector and a thick hook-and-loop closure web belt loop on the back. Included is a strap with a strong nylon string for attaching to the D-ring, the way many cameras and other small electronic items do these days. The top cover closes with a substantial patch of hook-and-loop material.    I found the pouch very nicely made, with all the seams well sewn and quite sturdy. The inside is divided into three sections which could hold different items, such as a phone, Mp3 player, camera, batteries, or other small items.    It is roughly 4 inches wide and 5 inches long, and totals about an inch thick but the internal pockets vary in size, with the one in front being the smallest. The neoprene material is quite stretchy, which would be good for odd-sized items. I could get  an LG-7000 TENS unit in the middle pocket easily, but my Canon A720IS camera was a very snug fit which required a bit of extra effort to put in. There are an huge number of small electronic items like this which would fit nicely.    The material is very soft, yet substantial enough to provide a pretty good measure of protection from normal everyday use.    I would buy more.

B001EC3JME|4.0|I have a Surefire G2 that was given to me as a gift and I love the light.  I even have a red filter cap installed and I recently purchased the LED upgrade.  The only problem I had with the light is that I couldn't find a holster that would hold the light without having to take the filter lens on and off.  It kind of blew my mind that Surefire wouldn't offer something like that (they really don't, I emailed their customer services twice).    So I was on the hunt for a flashlight holster for my G2 and stumbled across this offering from Nite Ize.  Having used Nite Ize equipment before for my Mag-lites, I thought I'd give this holster a shot.  Here's my evaluations thus far:    Pros:  - The G2 fit in the holster with the Red Fliter installed.  No need to remove!  - The rotating clip is a pretty slick feature if you need to use both hands and don't have a headlamp available  - The actual clip itself is able to clip on and off your belt without having to remove your belt  - Construction seems very sturdy and rugged (high grade nylon, plastic, elastic)  - The holster holds the light very securely.  No need to worry about it falling out.    Cons:  - The holster is a very tight fit on the G2.  It's not bad taking the light out, but putting it back in the holster seems almost impossible.  Hopefully continued use will stretch it out.      So a pretty solid holster if you're looking for a cheap soultion to your flashlight storage dilema.  Also, they're probably available at a local big box hardware store if you don't want to wait for shipping.  You'll have to pay a couple dollars extra though!  Hope this helps.

B003JTHETY|2.0|I watched the video.  The video itself was nifty, and the song sounded good.  I listened to the download for El Dorado.  Ok, I've heard better, but Maiden songs tend to grow on you over several listens so I didn't think much of that.  I pre-ordered the album...    I got the album, and didn't listen to it right away for some reason as I usually do.  I finally listened to it yesterday, and I was confused.  What happened to the Iron Maiden that made A Matter of Life and Death?  Bruce's vocals, instead of being like the air-raid siren that he was nicknamed after, sound very faint and weak. Putting Bruce's vocals in this album up against These Colors Don't Run, The Longest Day, and Lord of Light, I don't know...  Either he wasn't up to full vocal capacity, or someone got the levels wrong on the mixer board.  The guitar work sounds really muddy.  The lyrics... they go on and on and never take a direction.  It's like reading bad prose that's pretending to be poetry.  I don't understand it.  I really liked the direction the band was taking when Bruce rejoined, each album seemed to get better than the last, but this one feels like a throwback to the No Prayer for the Dying/Fear of the Dark period when Maiden admitted they were losing their creative direction.  I like singing to Maiden, either aloud or in my head, and there's nothing on this album that really jumps out.  No riffs to get my attention, nothing I can chant with feeling!  It doesn't have that same power behind it that I'm used to hearing.  Is it better than most music out there today?  Absolutely.  Is it as good as it should be for an Iron Maiden album?  Not to my ears, and I've got them all.    As for the Mission Edition itself... the shiny case is nice, the artwork is nice, but there's no bonus disk.  The extras are all web-based, which was a huge disappointment after getting the bonus DVD with A Matter of Life and Death.  I won't say to not buy the album, as it is Iron Maiden, and hey, if you're into Maiden you'll own it.  That's just how we are.  I did feel I needed to give fair warning though.  Don't expect this to be a powerhouse album.
0439023513|4.0|Alright. Here we go.  I'm going to start off with a spoiler-free review and then I will post a warning once I start getting into spoilers.     I, personally, first heard about The Hunger Games when I was looking for Summer reading books a few years back.   I asked on an online question site with some details about books I enjoy and someone recommended The Hunger Games.   I bought it but didn't read it until a couple months ago. I was missing out!  I loved The Hunger Games. I have not written a review about it but I would give it 5/5 stars.   Catching fire also did not disappoint and I would have rated it 4/5 stars.  Here I am rating Mockingjay 4/5 stars.     The reason I got into the series was because I was interested in this world where someone/some place (the capitol) is in charge and the people have no choice but to obey. Yes, for a moment, I did get caught up in the Gale/Peeta argument but that was never the main point of the books for me.   I was more interesting in how Katniss and basically all the districts would try to overcome the evil that is the capitol.   It was never a love story to me.  And this book is not a love story.  It's a war story.  A story of battle, destruction, death, hopelessness, and even a little light.    ***spoiler time***    This book, as did Catching Fire, in my opinion, starts off a little slow.  We learn that District 13 is nothing like we could have imagined.  And although most of the natives seemed happy, to me it sounded like a concentration camp.  They wake up every morning to have their daily schedule printed on their arms.  Strict rules, harsh punishments- nothing that I would have imagined this place to be like.  Like I said earlier, I was never really into this book for the love story.  But I have to admit my heart sank when Peeta returned as a brainwashed robot.   The part where he attacks Katniss had me on the edge of my seat!  Just for clarification, books are pretty much movies in my head. I get really into them.   Slowly, though, we get glimpses of the Peeta we all remember.   Toward the end of the book, the action picks up greatly but it does get a little confusing with all the traps, mutts and whatnot.   I am going to have to read at least Part III again.     The ending, though, felt a little unfulfilling.  Throughout the book, I couldn't wait for Katniss to kill President Snow.  I wanted her to basically light him on fire and make some crude reference to him being \\"The Man on Fire.\\"  But instead, THIS HAPPENS TO PRIM.  My god, my heart sank so low.  If I had to pick a couple to be in love with in this book, I'd pick Prim and Buttercup.  Every chapter/page/paragraph/sentence with them just made me smile.  In the end, though, things are kind of okay?   I mean, Snow is dead. Not from Katniss, but he is dead.  Katniss finally started to become more like her old self.   She began hunting again after spending months just sitting in the house.   We even learn that her and Peeta go on to have kids and such.              ***END spoilers***          What's not to like about this book?  Like I said earlier, if you're looking for the love aspect of the last two books to be prominent in this book, you WILL be disappointed.  If you were in it for the action this whole time, you'll love it as I did.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I got these for my girlfriends brother. He thinks they are the cats meow. I have not tried them out yet myself but he loves them.

All in all well worth the purchase.

0439023491|5.0|This is a very dark series for young adult readers, but it's definitely sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy too. Katniss, the heroine, lives in an increasingly-repressive and deeply stratified society where the majority (the oppressed people in the \\"districts\\") suffers while the minority (the pampered residents of the capitol) lives in luxury. As punishment for a long-past rebellion, the districts are required to send two teens per year to participate in the Hunger Games: a brutal competition to be the last person alive (by killing everyone else) that is televised as entertainment (and as mandatory viewing in the districts). Dark enough for ya?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins does an excellent job of creating the incredibly unfair world in which Katniss and her family and friends live. Most of the characters are well-drawn (though Katniss' sister, Prim, is still a cypher). The story is incredibly compelling; I found myself staying up far later than I meant to, and it was hard to get the story out of my mind when I wasn't reading it.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for adults and teens. I'm debating whether to give these books to my very bright 11-year-old nephew. I know he'd understand them; but ... as I said, this is some dark stuff.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|This album is just a triumph! it is not only a great bolero standards album but also thanks to Buika's soulful interpretation, a great latin jazz album, she is able to walk between the two worlds enriching both styles instead of diluting them. The other great thing for me personally is that it transports me to my childhood when my mother used to listen to and sing many of these songs. The arrangements by Chucho Valdes are also masterful, this is I hope the first of many other collaborations between these two artists.  Buika proves again that she has no musical limits.

B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|1080p or not 1080p. That is the question. I saw this last on VHS. Holy balls of awesome. This blu-ray is like seeing the movie again for the first time. I have a bias. This is my favorite movie version of Hamlet. This version is the reason I started Rash & Bloody Deeds Productions, and directed Hamlet at university. I'm not going to review the film. Just the blu-ray. If you don't own a 70mm print of this, this blu-ray is the best way to experience these performances. The inky blacks, the depth of blood, the deepness of the resolution. I watched this on 50\\" plasma. I wish I had a 150\\" projector/screen to absorb all the detail encoded in the picture. I haven't seen too many reviews of this blu-ray. I wanted to kick in a 5-star vote, both for video and audio. The clarity of the speech by the Player King. And I loved the commentary.

B00284G2IA|5.0|This is an absolutely stunning concert.  I really wish that I could have been in Helsinki in 2005 to see it live. I finally ended up buying the Blu-ray after renting it from Netflix and realizing that I had kept the disk for two months and watched it at least 15 times. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes Nightwish and/or Tarja.     The Blu-ray is well produced as far as concerts go.  I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about the audio quality.  There are a couple minor issues to be aware of with the video and menus if you are an A/V snob:  - No popup menu to select tracks while playing (you have to return to the main menu or skip blindly)  - Chapter selection is not perfectly aligned with the start of all the songs.  - Not perfect 16:9 aspect ratio.  Ratio seems to change by up to about 20 pixels between some camera shots.    Despite these few flaws, this is an excellent concert that I feel any fan should own.
0439023513|1.0|Let me begin by saying I loved the first two books!  They were a captivating struggle of good vs. evil and freedom vs. manipulation.  But, this last book has lost all the goodness and freedom, leaving only a depressing, uninspiring conclusion to what could have been a great series.    If Suzanne Collins' purpose in writing this book was to beat-up young readers with the \\"evils of war\\" theme, she has certainly accomplished her goal.  But, unlike other reviewers, I think this view of life/war is not only unrealistic, but it also makes for boring, almost propagandist, literature.  In any human struggle there are those who hold on to goodness, who sacrifice themselves for something greater, and who love against all odds.  These are the redeeming qualities of mankind.  These are the elements that were so riveting in the first two books, and they are completely lost in Mockingjay.      Prepare to be disappointed.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|If you've listened to their earlier albums, then you'll notice how different Korn sounds in this, their seventh album called See You On The Other Side. The songs here are drastically different: many of them have a lighter tone and a more melodic feeling when compared to songs like \\"A.D.I.D.A.S.\\" or \\"Falling Away From Me.\\" But to be honest, this sort of change is not really a bad thing. A majority of these songs are still very good and very listenable. The change in the music doesn't really matter to me; all that matters is that they're all performed by one of my favorite all-time rock bands. Songs such as \\"Twisted Transistor\\" and \\"Souvenir of Sadness\\" are very enjoyable, despite them not being as heavy as other classic Korn songs. \\"10 or a 2-Way\\" is probably the weakest one here, but it's not really that terrible. \\"Throw Me Away\\" is my favorite song on this album: it's wickedly beautiful and melodic.<br /><br />I can't really say that SYOTOS is Korn's weakest album, because there's still plenty to offer here. Again, this album features a different, more lighter sound from the band, but I'm not really disappointed.<br /><br />Grade: 7.5/10
B002ZG983M|4.0|MILD SPOILERS<br /><br />...And that line was spoken by the eleven year old superheroine of this film. KICK-ASS is a cornball classic that is definitely headed for a kind of immortality as a camp set-up of BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN. It's the story of ordinary Dave Lizewsky of Queens NY, who one day decides to take up the job of local superhero for lack of any other ambitions.<br /><br />Dave has problems being a superhero. Unlike Peter Parker/Spider-Man he has no unnatural super powers (except \\"being invisible to girls\\"); he lacks the technological skills of Tony Stark/Ironman; and he has no millions to spend on creating a persona like Bruce Wayne/Batman. Instead, he buys a lime green wetsuit and mask from a sporting goods store, arms himself with a couple of wooden batons which he can barely hold, and names himself \\"Kick-Ass.\\" He's strictly a bargain-bin superhero.<br /><br />His first \\"assignment\\" is to rescue a cat (\\"Mr. Bitey\\") from a tree; he falls out and concusses himself. In his second assignment he tries to stop two punks from breaking into a car. They throw him a beating and stab him in the gut. While he's crawling away from the fight he gets struck by a hit and run driver.<br /><br />The run-down is serendipitous. Rendered largely neuropathic from the accident, he feels little pain, and most of his bones are replaced with titanium plates and rods. When he recovers, he goes back to getting a beating for crime, this time trying to break up a street fight. It's a draw, but someone posts the video online, and overnight, Kick-Ass becomes a folk hero for tryng to save the victim.<br /><br />What nobody knows is that two real superheroes, \\"Big Daddy\\" (in a Batman-like costume) and his sass-mouthed, weapons-qualified preteen daughter \\"Hit Girl\\" (think a four-foot Robin with purple hair) are terrorizing a gang of mobsters.<br /><br />In the meantime, Kick-Ass is reveling in his fame and enjoying his sweet new girlfriend. What he doesn't know is that the mobsters think he is the superhero who has been tormenting them. They try to lure him out by baiting him with a possible sidekick \\"Red Mist\\" (the superheroic names in this movie are intentionally lame), and this leads to the grand battle between Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl on one side and Red Mist and the mobsters on the other.<br /><br />By far the best character is not Kick-Ass himself, but Hit Girl.

B003O85W3A|5.0|With the recent downturn or recession in the U.S. economy many of us have been searching for a reason or meaning to it. Why did everything seem to fail from wall street to government to big business? How did this affect the little guy and where do we go from here? These are the questions that Arcade Fire's The Suburbs try to appeal to in this wonderful album. It is a probing, a longing searching, an attempt to find something real that suburbia has displaced from humanity. To tell you the truth I can't stop listening to this album!     The sounds and the chords can appear ordinary and even boring upon first listen. Many of the songs tonally sound similar but taken as a whole the mood is unflinching and overwhelming in its power to communicate displacement and longing. This is an album. It should be listened to that way and taken as is for that. If you want a quick brainless 3 minute song then this is not the place to look. If you want something that will make you raise your fist to the sky, scream in release and make you long for something forgotten then get the suburbs!

Thoroughly enjoyed the various disguises and thought Val Kilmer did a fabulous job.  Romance was sweet and exciting.  Villans were corrupt and relentless.

B0000024RQ|4.0|As I kind of mental exercise, I recently tried imagining listening to this record as though it were 1963. It wasn't as easy as all that. I WAS alive in '63, but I was 10 years old and only vaguely aware of the \\"Great Folk Scare\\" that was taking root at the time. I would go on to get into Dylan in a big way as a teenager, but that was the ELECTRIFIED Dylan. The early stuff seemed like something to be respected, even revered, but even though no one could deny the strength of \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" or its rightful place in music history: even if you thought \\"Highway 61\\" was way cooler. So re-listening to FREEWHEELIN' and pretending it was totally fresh and I had no idea who Bob Dylan was going to become in a few years and the significance he'd take on, well, it was a challenge.     But it did yield an apercu or two. The Dylan I came to know and love as a teen in the late 60s sang with an audible sneer. The Dylan I wasn't listening to as a pre-teen sang (relatively) sweet and sincere. Yeah, the vocals are rough in an almost sweetly self-conscious way. It's the voice of an earnest young man--albeit one with a sense of humor--who venerates his musical forebears. But you can tell that he's also seeking to find his own voice. It's easy to imagine the excitement that his very apparent musical development had to have generated. His first album had only a couple of original tunes, neither truly great. This record had not only \\"Blowin' In the Wind,\\" but \\"Masters of War,\\" \\"A Hard Rain\\" and \\"Don't Think Twice.\\" AND the truly lovely \\"Girl From the North Country\\"--which strategically placed as the album's second track, proved that the young songwriter could be as tender as he was tough and acerbic.     And if you CAN begin to listen to \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" with new ears, you may find yourself agreeing that this is THE best version ever recorded. Now, I've always aligned myself with the camp that says nobody does Dylan like Dylan, but I'm not sure that I always believed that. Therewere several lovely versions of \\"Wind\\" by more polished singers that helped sell the song to the masses as the anthem that it would become. But even though I give Baez and PP&M their due as popularizers, I've come to realize that even if no one else had recorded or performed the tune, Dylan's version alone would have been enough to ensure its status as a classic. His vocal is achingly sincere on this track. There's none of the world-weariness that would later come to characterize his vocals. He's that good, and that touching.     Dylanophiles will tell you that every track the master recorded is significant in some way, and strictly speaking, that's true. Nat Hentoff's notes give every track on the album its due, and his observations--like those of many other critics and commentators--can be insightful Nevertheless, I'm going to commit a minor heresy (among Dylan fans anyway) and say that for most contemporary listeners--and for many in 1963--there's a fair amount of filler on Dylan's second studio release. All those talking blues numbers seem dated and often a bit silly now. And even when I play my \\"time machine\\" game, I find it hard to believe that even his most adoring fans got particularly excited over \\"I Shall Be Free,\\" a title that promises so much, but devolves into silliness about \\"makin' love to Elizabeth Taylor\\" and \\"catching hell from Richard Burton.\\" Yes, they were in the news in '62, but since these are actually the very last lines on the record, they reduce an otherwise enduring album into an inevitable period curio. In short, a mistake.     The silliness was doubtless even a response to Dylan's own budding genius. If people were appropriately blown away by \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" and \\"Masters of War,\\" the young poet, and certainly his handlers, must have thought that providing a leavening touch of whimsy and humor was a good idea. In principle, it was, but that's the material that hasn't aged so well.     One \\"minor\\" track that has aged well though is the young songwriter's thoughtful meditation on the aging process itself and the attendant loss of youthful optimism, friendships and \\"fun,\\" \\"Bob Dylan's Dream.\\" Oddly enough, this is one of three \\"dream songs\\" on the album and the only one that is not surreal and dreamlike in itself. It is also, along with \\"North Country,\\" Bob Dylan at his most tender and sincere. It's a song well worth re-discovering.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|What's great about this show is that the concept hasn't been done before. It's not a chewed up version of a similar show or a spin-off. It's good writing, acting and directing. Dexter always leaves me wanting to know more and more about him. And this season's finale was a total shock. I never saw it coming!
0767817664|5.0|Love this movie.  I believe it's Roddy McDowell's last film.  He's terrific as is the rest of the cast.  Chris Sarandon is such a sexy vampire.  Perfect blend of comedy, camp and frights.  Good special effects.  I rarely buy movies to keep at home but this one is a classic.
B002ZG9788|1.0|This movie is garbage. I consider myself a tolerant movie goer. I almost never walk out of a movie or turn my DVD player off before a film is finished. I usually give movies a chance to redeem themselves in the end. The last time I wanted to walk out on a movie was Batman Forever. This movie I turned off about 20 minutes in.     First of all, it has absolutely nothing to do with the original, a movie I grew up loving as a child. Secondly, it has absolutely nothing to do with the actual Greek myth it is based on. And thirdly, it is full of plot holes and inconsistencies as to make the story a farce of itself.    As you are watching you are forced to wonder things like, how does Perseus manage a buzz cut in Ancient Greece when everyone else in the movie has authentic hair? Why do the gods sit around wearing shiny armor when they are . . . you know, gods? Why do the humans build a gigantic statue of Zeus and then, in rebellion, destroy it? After all, aren't they just destroying their own work? How does Perseus mother know she has been raped by Zeus when he transforms back into god form . . . did they have photos of him somewhere? How does Perseus' father survive a lightning bolt? And why does he develop superhuman strength afterward, enabling him to lift a coffin with his wife and baby in it? The nonsense goes on and on.     And I can't get over the whole man vs. god thing. It's ridiculous and has nothing to do with how any ancient person would ever think. Nor can I imagine how any society could try to kill the gods, when the gods give them the air to breathe, food to eat, water to drink, etc. The original film understood the myths and portrayed ancient Greek mentality much more accurately. This movie is just garbage, plain and simple.
0439023513|2.0|I'll save everyone some time...just read the first two books. The reason why I gave 2 stars instead of one, is because SC is still an awesome writer. The direction of the finale to this series however, will turn me away from her future novels. I loved how articulate and mind boggling the first two books were. The third book was just splattered paint on canvas, instead of delicately painted portraits.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I haven't gotten the third season yet, but I can't wait!  Being fans of 'Two and a Half Men', my husband and I wondered if the creators could do it again with 'The Big Bang Theory'.    The Big Bang is even funnier then Two and a Half Men, and we never miss an episode.  We have watched from the very first one, and we even enjoy the reruns they're airing at present.    I was pulling for Leonard and Penny to get together, and her scenes with Sheldon are some of the most hilarious I've ever seen -- one of my favorites is the laundry scene in the Panty Pinata episode.    I'll never forget my husband's reaction when Leonard finally asked Penny out.  He said, \\"It's about time!\\"  We'll continue to be fans.  We own Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD, and we'll definitely get Season 3 when it's released!    Whoever thoughts nerds (as they clearly are) could be so funny?  Maybe nerds are the new heartthrobs!
B00006GEXQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! it is so well written and HG plays this part perfectly. He always does. I like how this is a story which could be reality based too, not some silly movie based on 3D or computer graphics with no depth. It is meaningful, very funny, charismatic and wonderful. A must see!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I've seen this one several times and finally bought it to keep at home.  Great story, great ending, great actors.

0143038419|5.0|This is the most calming book I have read in a very long time.  Bravo to you Elizabeth for writing such an amazing book.  Gets you thinking, it did me.  Enjoy this one, especially all you women out there stuck in the middle of something that you can't quite get out of.
0307594777|5.0|I continue to be well pleased with Amazon's service and offerings. My most recent purchase of the \\"Dragon\\" trilogies was no exception. I love the books and really appreciated the service offered by Amazon.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Excellent movie. One of my favorites, great cinematography and message. I enjoy the two disc set, one in Blu-Ray and one regular DVD so I can enjoy watching it on either player.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have to apologize to the Crawford and Brightman crowd: I loved the film. It's true that Wilson might have come off better (perhaps if his hair hadn't been so long making him out to be more of a \\"pretty boy\\") or perhaps less wooden as others have suggested... However, I found the production touchingly done, the chemistry between Butler and Rossum perfect, the symbolism evocative, and the story moving and compelling. The pathos and irony were appropriately thick. All the supporting cast were superb. I bought the soundtrack too. I guess I'm just unashamed.
B002VH7P4O|3.0|While the audio quality is certainly the best that has been available since the originals have been released, the documentaries add nothing to people who have already seen the anthology and are provided in very low quality.    The covers and booklet art are placed in a 1993 style CD-ROM cumbersome interface, at screen resolution only. Not a great alternative to printed materials. The makers didn't even bother to use a non default skin for the flash video player. Because the videos are embedded in the flash - you have no access to them and can not play them outside the player or on a tv. Overall, the additional material is disappointing and feels as if not much thought and effort went into its creation.    The apple that houses the USB disk is very nice, smaller than I had originally expected, however, its weight lends it a sense of quality.    A side note:  The white album had an official mono version that was significantly different from the stereo one - for some reason, this was not released with the remasters, even the mono ones.
0060935464|2.0|The copy I received was filled with hand written notes throughout the text. I was very disappointed in this purchase.
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|Now my nose is gonna be stuffed up for at least another hour.  Yeah.  It is a tear jerker.  I had avoided this one because I'm not a big fan of Miley Cyrus, but I will say I forgot who she was about 20 mins into the film.  Yey!<br />They didn't focus on her singing and performing too much and made her more of a piano player, but it was the very smallest of features.  She really did a great job.  The story was terrific and I did compare both of N.S's films... this one and \\"Dear John\\" and the other one doesn't even come close.  Dear John was very slow and I thought terrible, but this one is a first class winner.<br />I hadn't realized Greg Kinnear was in this and of course Kelly Preston who seems to pop up in every other movie in these small (but nice) roles.<br />Fantastic story.<br />Wonderfully made.<br />I give best acting credits to the little kid that played Miley's brother Jonah. Wow. He was amazing.<br />There wasn't one slow min of this movie at all.  They really did a great job of telling a great story all the way down to the racoon and the baby turtles.  Wayyyyyyy too cute.  That's all I'm gonna say about that, except knowing me I'd spend all those the nights at the beach to make sure they got to the ocean safely also...:o)<br />This is a family movie and everyone over 12 should see it. The little bit of piano music that is played throughout the film is beautiful.  I even backed the track up to listen to it over again a couple of times before letting the movie continue.<br />I gave it a complete five stars not because it was like Titanic, all mega budget and all, but because there was something for everyone.  Everyone walks away from this with a little something extra and a lesson learned about love and forgiveness.  Don't miss this one.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Excellent movie, after renting it several times (older movie, scratched) I decided I wanted to own my own copy. I also bought the soundtrack from the movie, another excellent choice.

030726839X|5.0|As I finished the last words on page 486, I yearned for more. Except for the acknowledgements, bibliography and such, there was no more.<br /><br /> The excellent writer and detailed-obsessed military historian Max Hastings had brought us to the end of Churchill's reign as the war leader of the British Empire.<br /><br /> You can measure Churchill, the man, by the thousands of books, movies, documentaries and other expositions about him.<br /><br /> In Hastings, we find much that is new. As with many contemporary histories of WWII, more than a little comes from the once again closed Soviet archives. But much more comes from the diaries and unpublished letters of people, particularly the little people, the ones who in a democracy elect those who lead.<br /><br /> Hastings leaves us in absolutely no doubt of Churchill's unique accomplishments - and his failures.<br /><br /> For many months, the future of any vestige of democracy in Europe and perhaps the world rested on Churchill's shoulders. Through his oratory and pluck alone, Churchill encouraged  battered and, in fact, defeated Britain to rally itself and fight on, despite the fact that literally all its artillery, amour, small arms and military vehicles had been left on the battlefields of France. Churchill pleaded and cajoled to get Franklin Roosevelt into the European war, but Roosevelt basically wouldn't budge.<br /><br /> For a while, it was Churchill, a few hundred brave pilots, a few thousand ground crew and radar plotters who kept Britain in the war.<br /><br /> Hastings tracks the public opinion of the day. Churchill had long been a divisive character, long relegated to the back benches of Britain's ruling class for his outspoken opinions on the dangers of a rearmed and resurgent Germany. Neville Chamberlain had captured the support of the people who believed that giving Hitler what he wanted was the road to peace.<br /><br /> It was not and the 66 year old Churchill, called a war monger by so many, was asked by the King to become Prime Minister.<br /><br /> It is now widely agreed that Churchill was the only man who could have saved Britain.<br /><br /> Hastings keeps his focus on Churchill as war leader, but lets us see how the world around him reacted to his larger-than-life presence. He irritated and frustrated his military leaders by his constant interference and demands for action now. He lifted the spirits of his people in his visits to the bombed out streets of London. He bestirred the Members of Parliament (and controlled them) with his wit and guile. Finally, he roused the world through oratory of a brilliance rarely seen.<br /><br /> Churchill, as Hastings endlessly points out, was not perfect. Far from it. His military plans were more often than not entirely impractical and when he did succeed in getting his ideas acted upon, they often resulted in disaster. But strategically, Churchill was ahead of his generals who for the most part never rose to anything near Churchill's greatness.<br /><br /> Hastings correctly believes that it was the military of the Soviets that defeated Germany and that Britain and the United States played a subordinate role militarily. No serious student of the period can disagree. It was the Soviets who broke the armies of the Germans and their allies. But Churchill believed he enjoyed some kind of personal relationship with Stalin, a delusion he persisted in almost to the end of the war.<br /><br /> It is fascinating to read the letters and diaries of the average citizens, many, if not most, of whom revered Churchill the war leader, while reserved about Churchill the domestic leader. The letters of the committed leftists are chilling to read. Military men and Churchill's staff left behind copious memoirs, published and unpublished, about their impressions. Hastings draws upon all of this and more to produce a truly in-depth history of Churchill's six years as the most powerful leader in British history and one of the most remarkable men to have appeared in Western civilization.<br /><br /> The pity is that history is no longer taught in American schools and what has replaced it has little relation to history. Thus the children of today will grow up with little idea of how close the freedom they abuse came so close to being snuffed out were it nor for Winston Churchill who roused the West to save itself.<br /><br /> Next time, perhaps, we will not be so fortunate as to have a Churchill.<br /><br /> Hastings makes it clear just how remarkable Churchill, as the war leader of his people, was.<br /><br />JerryAmerican schools and what has replaced it has little relation to history.

0545101425|1.0|I can't really describe how utterly disappointed I was in this final book in the Hunger Games series. After I finished the book, I tossed it aside, sighed, and just went to go lay down. It was a heartbreaking letdown.     There's multiple things to address here, so I'll lay it out as clearly as possible.     1) The butchering of characters. Katniss went from a feisty, if reluctant heroine, to a dimwitted, sullen child. And I understand that she's been through so much terror, and that how she reacted can be considered a realistic response. But it's truly difficult to like a book if you cannot like the main character. I loved Katniss in the first two books. Hated her in this one. And it was strange how inconsistent her character was. Sometimes she was reasonable and full of compassion, and on the flip side, she's willing to let Captiol children die at the hands of another hunger game. That cold brutality can do nothing but force readers to abandon her as a main character worth anything. Was that the point? Was the point to force you to dislike everyone who touched the war in any way? Did the anti-war message have to be that strong to the point where enjoyment of the book is obliterated? Gale was similarly butchered. I think what grated more with Gale's switch in characterization was that it seemed incredibly obvious that the only point in making Gale a harsh and unfeeling character was to make the decision in the romantic triangle that much easier to make. But I would have preferred Katniss choosing between two good guys, instead of one good guy who went crazy but was still good, and one good guy who turned into a brute.     2) The writing itself was so amateurish. How often did Katniss black out and end up in the hospital in this book? Two, three times? It became to the point where I rolled my eyes when it happened. And was seriously about to throw the book at the wall when it happened YET AGAIN at the very climax of the book. Such lazy writing. And the entire structuring of the book felt off. The whole sequence leading up to the President's mansion was the epitome of lackluster and unfulfilled.    3) The story was so bleak, the anti-war message so strong, that there was no enjoyment in the book. You couldn't root for the rebels. You couldn't root for Katniss. You couldn't root for Gale or Peeta. You couldn't root for the Capital. So what was the point? Just to read something and think, \\"my god, war is BAD BAD BAD!\\"     4) The unnecessary deaths. Really, did the author REALLY have to kill off so many people? Killing off well liked characters for shock value is trite and make me weary.     5) The epilogue was so lame. So tacked on. The entire ending of the book felt so rushed and half-hearted.     If this was the author's vision, then I guess I can't really argue against it. But I'm superbly disappointed in the direction she chose to take. It probably wouldn't have been so disappointing if I hadn't enjoyed the first two so much, and if I hadn't been so eagerly counting down the days until this book's release. Maybe lower expectations would have made the book easier to swallow, but I doubt it. There were just SO many problems in this book. Too many.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Finally a great movie that does justice for Hypatia, a sadly unknown name it seems in history (at least in the U.S.). Great detail was put into the making of this movie and it shows. Rachel Weisz is perfect for the title role & is surrounded by good actors & performances.   This movie moved me in many ways & is not one you will soon forget!
B0036EH3XE|4.0|first off let me say this,LOST is an amazing show to be on network tv. it is probably one of the best ever on abc,nbc,or cbs.  i did not watch one episode the entire time,preferring to wait for the dvd. the dvds are stunning. great picture and vibrant colors. i got caught up in this show and give every season but 6 five stars, i would have given season 6 a better rating if not for the ending, i mean, come on, this is the exact ending we all HOPED wouldn't happen, right? so cliche, certainly not up the the standards the show had set right up to that point. but ending a great dramatic show must be very difficult.  i can only think of two that ended with grace and the dignity that the shows deserved. they were SIX FEET UNDER and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. LOST, at least in my mind, deserved a better ending. does that negate the entire series?  hardly! this was a very good dramatic series. i certainly looked forward to getting each new season on dvd, usually watching it in four or five nights. i was very into it. i highly recommend it.  i just wish they had reached beyond the TWILIGHT ZONE and OCCURENCE AT OWL CREEK to find a more fitting and creative, as well as maybe give a few explanations, ending. apparently, from reading other reviews, many people are happy with the ending, and that is fine. also, there are many people who feel very ripped off by the ending. i can understand that.  in a nutshell...i loved the series. i do no care for the ending and had definately hoped for something different. the writers really seem to have taken the most obvious course to end the show and that is exactly what i had hoped they would not do.
B002N5N5QQ|3.0|just finished watching the UK version..... still good acting and lots of action,  but the story is full of big holes and the ending is very weak......  very disappointing after a great season one!
B003L20IDS|4.0|Scott Pilgrim, Canadian slacker, has broken hearts before and had his own heart broken one too many times, but now he seems to have reached a new low.  He's 22, between jobs and playing bass in a not-so-great band, and he's dating a high schooler.  Sure, her name is Knives Chow, which everyone has to admit is kind of a cool name, and she's got mad skills in the arcade - but they haven't even kissed, and they probably shouldn't, and everyone around him knows this is not really moving on, and it's not fair to the young woman whose heart he is sure to break.  Sure enough, he does decide to move on the moment he sets eyes on the colorful and enigmatic girl of his dreams (who also happens to be around his age): but she's got some serious baggage.  In order to date her, he has to defeat, in arcade game style mortal combat, her seven evil exes (all played with panache by a number of cameo stars).<br /><br />It's like a colorfully stylized musical, except instead of breaking into song when conflicts arise or emotions boil, they break out impossible kungfu moves, complete with colorful Batman-tv-era \\"kerplunks\\" and \\"pows\\" written onto the screen.  I read a New York Times review from an unimpressed game critic who seemed to want it to mean something, or to better reflect the reality of contemporary video games.  Maybe it doesn't do those things, but I don't think it needs to.  My wife and I saw it and walked out enchanted and amused.  (My only complaint is that I thought Scott Pilgrim and Knives Chow were in fact a far better match than he and the bright-haired Ramona Flowers.  I just never saw the sparks between Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead - so that in this unrealistic fantasy that was the one thing that really felt fake.)  Hollywood will always be telling love stories - and I hope that every once in a while they get around to making them as inventive and funny as Edgar Wright managed to make this one.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|At over two and a half hours, Once Upon A Time In The West has the feel of an epic western. The opening scene alone might be the greatest in classic western history. But how does this Spaghetti stock up to other Leone films (he's really the craftsman of the Italian western)?<br /><br />I feel it stacks right up there with the Dollars trilogy. Many sites focused on westerns rank Once Upon A Time In The West as the best western ever made. You have a trio of excellent actors in Fonda, Bronson and Robards. Leone had actually wanted Bronson to play the Man With No Name in the Dollars trilogy.<br /><br />I streamed this using Amazon Video On Demand through my Roku player and it worked extremely well. The picture and sound were great and I'm glad that I purchased it in this format.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|My first experience with this movie was in a college debate class. I was very surprised about not only the content of the movie but also the real world practicality. The Movie follows Nick Naylor as he goes about his daily life as a spokesman for big tobacco, but don't be turned off by where he works. The movie is less about who he works for and more about the sheer brilliance of a good speaker and the effect it can have upon whatever information they choose to relay. One of the classic examples is the movies discussion of which was better, chocolate or vanilla. Nick Naylor manages to create a witty, sarcastic, and enjoyable political satire, while poking fun at most of the major agencies, and branches of work. All in all a very clever work, definitely worth watching even if only for the comedic aspect. I recommend watching this movie with an open mind, and listening to not WHAT is said, but HOW it is said and the outcomes he is able to achieve. Enjoy Nick Naylor and the MOD squad!
B001F12J0C|5.0|The movie's are awesome. Plenty of action, spy thriller, will keep you glued to the screen.    I recommend these to anyone who likes action, excitment and seeing the underdog get his justice.

6302250269|5.0|Smokey& The Bandit for modern women. Where's Burt Reynolds on this movie? He belongs on it! Excellent script, storyline with a shocking ending that you will never see coming and will pull your heartstrings. Although aimed more at a female audience, if you like Convoy or Smokey & The Bandit- like movies, this is a must-have! Geena Davis is HOT in this as well with a steamy sex scene. Get it!
B003LL3NOK|2.0|is this one better than the one with dennis hopper? yeah but that ain't sayin' much. i liked \\"diary of the dead \\" better than this one but it's watchable, that's about it. and as george tells you at the beginning of the movie, \\"don't forget to laugh\\".
B002SRQ214|5.0|I have always loved the innovation and value AMD has shown since it first released their Athlon processor.  Since that time they have lead in innovation ahead and more soundly than its' competitors.    I chose to return again to AMD and compared what it does with its' competitors abilities, application and value (cost to performance) and AMD still comes out on top!    This processor is no exception.  The core runs fast and the heatsynch is great without the need to going third party.  I have not needed to consider overclocking this processor as it works well with the system motherboard AMD 890 chipset that it is seemless in working.

The only hit not included that I REALLY wish was is \\"One\\" but you name a Metallica hit, chances are, with only a very few exceptions, it is included. \\"Sad but True\\" sounds a lot like the \\"Demolition\\" entry music in the WWE many years ago. Metal at it's finest IS Metallica!
0439023513|3.0|What drew me into the first two books was the personal narrative, and this is what is lacking in Mockingjay, and why I think I and so many others felt that sense of emptiness at the end.  I understand that this was primarily a \\"war\\" book, but even in that context, it is still the personal interactions between characters that provide the gravity that weights the story, gives it its soul.  Look to \\"Band of Brothers\\" again for this, a series already alluded to by one reviewer.  The first two novels did this beautifully, but this one fell short.    And that brings me to the regrettable absence of Peeta in much of the novel.  To me his role in the first two books was more than just a part in the love triangle arc - he was to me the moral touchstone of the series, the pearl that Katniss kept returning to for support.  (And I think there really was no question Katniss really loved him deep down and who was going to be the \\"winner\\" in that triangle.) Without Peeta's presence or a similar steadying force in this third book, everything just comes across as a chaotic, confusing maelstrom of events without meaningful reflection.  (Not to mention the loss of the romantic tension that was undeniably a significant draw of the first two books.)  True, Katniss is a wounded soul, suffering from post-traumatic stress, but without Peeta around either physically or mentally, there is no one else to really be the voice both of reason and kindness (even imperfect but essentially good Haymitch is marginalized).  But maybe that is what SC is ultimately trying to convey - the utter chaos and often senselessness of war, and the ugly actions it brings out even in those justified to defend themselves.    Lastly, I do agree that the ending deprived and \\"cheated\\" the readers of a satisfying, fleshed-out narrative describing Katniss's emergence from her emotional stupor post-war - the healing, the sparks of feeling coming back, the rekindling of romance (stated in more than just a paragraph!) anda sense of some joy glowing out from beneath the embers.  But this emotional transformation is glossed over, rushed. As they say in creative writing class, \\"show, don't tell\\". But despite the rushed, glum ending, I think SC meant all along for the optimism and love that is embodied in the character of Peeta to win out - both over Katniss and the reader.
B001993Y2C|5.0|It seems most of the negative reviews on here are in regards to the packaging and lack of organization in the discs, as they don't have an episode list. Also, the discs are kind of cheaply put in the case. But this should not detract from the real reason you should be purchasing this...FOR THE FRAKKING TV SHOW! If you are only concerned with the packaging in this purchase, you have more problems than I can help you with here.    So where to start? I have watched this series twice. I watched it once by myself while deployed at my unit. Then after falling in love with the show, I felt compelled to spread the love and show someone else. So I showed it to my fiance. She doesn't play video games, doesn't like SciFi shows, etc. But after watching the first 10 episodes, she was hooked. She was dragging me out of bed to continue watching the show to finish it.    The acting, the story, the surprises, the soundtrack, just EVERYTHING about this show rocks. In Bluray, it looks amazing. It also sounds amazing. If you have a subwoofer, expect to have the entire room shaking. Bear McCray, the composer, uses a lot of drums and bass in his music...and it really gets you immersed in an audio scale..    So there you have it, this show will immerse you with its beautiful images in high def, immerse in full 5.1 surround DTS which sounds amazing, and terrifically put story line. There is a reason this show is award winning throughout the world...and you NEED to add this series to your shopping cart. It is well worth the purchase.
B00288KNL8|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and bought it for myself as a Christmas present. The plot is excellent, character development is awesome, the animation and soundtract are very good. The movie is based on a book, and in my opinion is it several times better.      Be warned though--this is not a movie for children. Even though it has a cartoonish look and many humorous scenes, the plot is dark and some of the ideas are frightening enough that my college friends and I were discussing the \\"freakiness\\" of the movie as we exited the theatre. If adults think that this movie is freaky, kids are going to find it frightening.      I haven't tried the 3-D version myself, but according to other viewers, it's not worth the effort of watching.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|The best of the Fast&Furious movies. Vin Diesel meets Crockett&Tubbs describes this perfectly. This sequel is more like Bad Boys than a racing movie. Upper level crime meets street rods. Nuff' said.
B000001F7E|5.0|Rod Stewart made quite a splash in the rock world with his first two solo albums. By the time this third set arrived he was poised to make it big in on the charts. And he did that on both fronts with this album and then some. As everyone knows,because of his public persona from the late 70's on Rod Stewart became something of an easy punchline in terms of once respected stars having sold out to the n'th degree. All the same,it's obvious this album is a product of the time before any of that started to happen. Produced in much the same manner and with the same basic personel as [[ASIN:B000001FD0 Gasoline Alley]] any rough edges in the arrangements there were cleaned up for this album that basically presented Rod in the same types of settings as he'd been before and,also matched to more carefully crafted originals. The title song opens the affair with a strident five minute plus folk/soul rocker that set's the stage for the proceedings. Once again Rod's talents as an interpretive vocalist are exercised here on wonderfully polished yet also tough grooving versions of \\"Seem's Like A Long Time\\" and Dylan's \\"Tomorrow Is Such A Long Time\\". A mix of instrumentation ranging from folksy acoustic guitars,bubbling and funky basslines as well as the use of mandolins all combine for a strong rhythm section that wraps itself like a blanket around Rod's voice. That effect also makes itself noticible when the tempo goes up on versions of \\"That's All Right\\",coupled with the closing chorus of \\"Amazing Grace\\" and,of course \\"Maggie May\\",the tune that put Rod Stewart on the map as a hitmaker. Interesting that would wind up happening on an album not exactly intent on producing hit singles necessarily. \\"Mandolin Wind\\" is another excellent song on this album,a folksier turn of style again only unlike before the grittiness present in his previous forrays into this style is replaced with a more polished sheen. On a cover of Norman Whitfields Temptations classic \\"(I Know) I'm Losing You\\" Rod not only works the tune to death but turns up the funk even further with some pointed funk/rock touches and closes the album with a breezy countrified rock rendition of Tim Hardin's \\"Reason To Believe\\". Despite his later reputation everything people usually say about this album is absolutely true and then some. It represents Rod Stewart's early career promise and ambition very well and even if there are mild hints lyrically of the free spirited decedence to come it's presented in the most appealing possible of ways.Know) I'm Losing You\\" Rod not only works the tune to death but turns up the funk even further with some pointed funk/rock touches and closes the album with a breezy countrified rock rendition of Tim Hardin's \\"Reason To Believe\\".

B00144VBBS|5.0|I loved this Cd every song was great I would recomend this to all who like Toby Keith.
0380977788|1.0|I absolutely loved the movie version of \\"Coraline\\" and just finally got around to checking out the original book. I was greatly disappointed. The writing style is too simplistic and doesn't paint a vivid picture. The characters are flat, and you feel no connection with any of them, including the main character. There really isn't any moral lesson in this book--Coraline happens to wander into the world twice, sees some weird stuff and her parents coincidentally get trapped there. I didn't like the illustrations; especially a picture of one of the actresses and her dogs, which are clearly described as Scottish Terriers but look more like long-haired poodles in the drawing. The movie does a much better job of showing that her parent's disappearance and all of the \\"wonders\\" of the Other World occur because Coraline has shown dissatisfaction with the changes in her life. I had to force myself to keep flipping pages.<br /><br />Go watch the movie. It takes the overall creepy theme of the book and does a fantastic job of making a wonderful, offbeat film. The characters are well-developed and memorable, especially Coraline, who you see as both a spoiled teenager and a girl who is very lonely because she has been uprooted from her home and ignored by workaholic parents. The animation is fantastic and you can see that it took thousands and thousands of man-hours to create. The soundtrack is very good. Be warned, although it may look appealing, this is not a movie for children.
0800178394|5.0|Miami Vice combines with Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire to make an outstanding combination of extreme action, comedy, and thrills. One of my favorite movies ever made. It has everything you could want in a movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000001FEW|5.0|Rod Stewart was riding high with the almost surprising breakthrough [[ASIN:B000001F7E Every Picture Tells a Story]] and he followed it up with another record following along with a similar sound but he was subtly changing things up here. Some of the heavy folk and country elements in the music are replaced with more of an emphasis on a rock n roll rhythm section often produced with somewhat more multi layored drums and horn charts. Originals such as \\"True Blue\\",\\"Lost Paraquayos\\", and \\"Italian Girls\\" all illustrate this wonderfully with that Stonsey groove that not only was Stewart utilizing with The Faces at the same time but also served to indicate that he wished to continue using this sound to advance his own musical style outside the group. There's another Dylan cover (he seemed very fond of interpreting Bob Dylan in his early days,didn't he?) with \\"Mama You Been On My Mind\\" and a great version of Hendrix's \\"Angel\\" around the middle of the album that emphasizes more of an internal rhythm sound than the heavy guitar theatrics Jimi himself might've offered. Stewart always deeply personalized his cover songs,both vocally and musically and this is another superb example. \\"You Wear It Well\\" is a great single,a little predictable maybe considering how closely in style it resembles \\"Maggie May\\" from the previous album but it was probably the safest bet at that time in terms of a follow up hit. The album ends with a wonderfully harmonically advanced \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" as well as a cover of Sam Cookes \\"Twistin' The Night Away\\" that rocks up the original in the guitar sense more considering the kind of adjulation Stewart seemed to have to Cooke's music. This wasn't exactly the last album he'd produce for Mercury but represented a string of four creatively (and in the case of the latter two) commercially triumphant albums that really put Rod Stewart up there as a major contender in terms of being one of rocks most eclectic and clever artists of the time.time.
B001FB55L2|5.0|The movie show you a terrible truth about what is the life that live our soldiers when they come back from those \\"CONFLICTS\\".  The movie arrived sooner than I expected and in perfect conditions.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|Aside from a couple of interesting episodes this season had to have been the biggest letdown in television history.<br /><br />Dozens of intriguing plot lines leading nowhere.  No. Really. Nowhere.  It's not open to interpretation.<br /><br />The saving grace coming from the privilege of watching great actors such as Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn.<br /><br />We hoped for depth.  We hoped for intelligence.  We believed that we were about to witness something that had never been achieved in television before.  Instead, the writers shamelessly led a dedicated audience of six years into a abyss of absurdity.<br /><br />A 10-year-old child could have written a better ending.<br /><br />After discussing the last season with friends, the conclusion we came to was that the name Lost could only stand for the hours we lost trying to make sense of a story that made no sense.<br /><br />There are worse things in life.  Still, it is a shame to see a unique show with so much potential meet such a pathetic ending.<br /><br />Season 6 of Lost? One of Shakespeare's great quotes comes to mind: It is a tale told by an idiot, filled with sound and fury, signifying nothing.
B00004XMVH|5.0|In the tradition of The Enemy below and Midway comes U-571. If you like the classic World War II Navy/submarine warfare movies, this is a modern movie that actually does the classics some justice. Star power galore. Excellent action and suspense with good effects and underwater graphics. If submarine warfare is to your liking, THIS IS IT. Modern movie with classic, quality action and acting. My personal favorite submarine war movie ever made. Crimson Tide and Hunt for Red October, although very good, are similar but not quite as good as U-571. Highly recommended.
B003LAH7MU|5.0|Saw Sting in Concert singing all the songs. Great Concert and great to listen again and again

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|WOW!!! This album is great in sooo many ways. Nas and Damian's chemistry in this album is amazing. They both feed off each other and every verse has true meaning to it. Must have if your into conscious music.
B000005RUV|4.0|Most of Wham's hits are included in this collection. \\"Wake me Up before You Go-Go\\" is a popular hit included in this. One not included is \\"Careless Whisper\\" which is rather surprising and a little angering. All of the other ones you remember are here though. If you liked Wham in the 80's or George Michael in general, this is a good collection to have. Nuff' said!
B001ECPJZO|2.0|This seems to be a well made product BUT it does not come with any directions on teaching kids how to actually tie the shoe!  Now I have to purchase another product WITH directions, which of course also comes with something to practice on.  Now I have no purpose for this product.  Plan Toys-Is it really that hard to include instructions for a product instead of a thick catalog trying to promote other products by your company?  I already have real shoes at home to practice on!
B000001FDQ|2.0|2 1/2      Brought down by its passionate tribute to all things corny in eighties metal, instrumental passages nonetheless can often transcend their cheesy confines.
B00005JNQA|5.0|I love this movie.  It has the right amount of suspense, action, and mystery without unnecessary violence and sex.  The viewer is teased by the sexual tension between the two lead characters.  It's all class, no crass.  It handles very real very serious issues and has a believable plot.  Sydney Pollack has my vote...Excellent movie, excellant acting, all and all, a wonderful flick.
B000HA4WT8|4.0|Tokyo Drift, although very good, lacks the overall feel of the other Fast&Furious movies. Part 4 is the best with parts one, then two, being second and third. Tokyo Drift is an excellent movie but just not as good as the others. I still would buy it though. Clearly, I already did.
0439023513|4.0|I just finished Mockingjay and I have to say that overall I really liked it. I think what is irritating a lot of readers was their expectations of the series, but what people are forgetting is that The Hunger Games trilogy is dystopian! If you've ever read anything dystopian, such as 1984, The Giver, or The Forest of Hands and Teeth, then you know that a trademark of the genre is that things don't really turn out the way you want them to.    With that in mind, I thought that Suzanne Collins struck a good balance between her genre and our expectations. The main plot lines resolved well--the rebellion and its aftermath made a lot of sense to me, and although Peeta's and Gale's stories were not what I expected, I thought the whole love triangle worked itself out in the best way it possibly could (I mean, really, no ending would have made everyone happy.) Katniss did find peace, even if it wasn't in the dramatic \\"girl on fire\\" finish we were all expecting.    What bugged me most overall was, as others have said, Katniss did kind of fall apart instead of coming into her own. I thought that was logical and even clever in some respects because most authors don't do that, but on the other hand, most authors let their protagonists triumph because it makes their endings way more satisfying. But, again, dystopian. I'm not making excuses for a certain moral decision Katniss made near the end, though--it made no sense, was out of character, and just plain horrible (if you've read it, you know what I'm talking about; if not, I don't want to spoil it, so sorry for being vague.)    If you read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, you may be expecting a Harry Potter-esque tone and resolution from Mockingjay. Instead, I say expect something more like 1984, and have tissues on hand. You'll appreciate the story a lot more.
B000002N2P|2.0|While some of the energy may be intact, songwriting abilities were becoming all-too-predictably limited.
B000TXG3YA|5.0|I really listened the first time because of the art cover, but the sound was also as delightful. I didn't become a fan yet, it seems to me that their other albuns don't appear to have instantiated the criativity of this one.<br />But I can say that: this one here is VERY GOOD!<br />Very worth listening once and again!
B00004XOWM|5.0|Hip-hop metal at it's finest! If you like Run-DMC, Kid Rock, Faith No More, or Linkin Park, you will love Limp Bizkit! \\"Rollin'\\" is my favorite. \\"Bring Tha' Noize\\" by Anthrax and Public Enemy sounds similar. ECW and WWE both set videos to it for the Undertaker and an ECW tribute. Rap and Rock combine for an unbeatable sound! Highly recommended!
0767817710|1.0|I watch this movie and it was terrible. Leonardo character was always trying to please his dad. And Sharon Stone; I don't know what her charater was all about. she was suppose to be big and bad. This movie was plain stupid. Don't buy it or rent unless you are desperate to be bored.
B002N8A14M|5.0|Purchased this for my new Nano.Sturdy, hard, case, strong clip . Not waterproof.    Works great so far.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Not just their best album, but really astonishing music!<br />If you never listened to Incubus, dare yourself not be caught by it after listening to this album.<br />Very Good!
B000002UZ4|5.0|80's new wave at it's finest with pop rolled in. These guys and Depeche Mode are my two favorite new wave bands from that time and I did'nt like a lot of them. I was more into hard rock bands like Scorpions, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, and Whitesnake with Dokken and Warlock thrown in for good measure.  \\"West End Girls\\" is my favorite in this collection. \\"What Have I Done To Deserve This\\" is another good hit. Pet Shop Boys at their finest! Nuff' said!
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|This is a aweasome movie. The action scenes were great. And love the black leather jacket Kenau was wearing. A very bad awesome movie. Love the running up the wall.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  It might be the most amazingly well-crafted t.v. show ever, along many dimensions.  I agree with all of the positive comments of other reviewers.  I don't have one negative comment to make, even though, I, too, miss Zach and thought he was a terrific character, well-acted. I even think the Daisy character provides an important role in the balance of the cast, as long as she is not there all the time.  No show is complete without little jabs from a distracting annoyance.  (Remember Eddie Haskell on \\"Leave it to Beaver?\\")          On the other hand, EVERY review that I read left out what, to me, may be the most important dimension of the show.  The unspeakable gore and horrifying plots would be meaningless and perhaps sadistic if regarded as entertainment alone.  The scientists, each using his or her unique area of expertise, employ the most subtle of clues to recreate an individual's identity and dignity.  In addition, often the victim's family and friends are able to obtain closure on the person's disappearance and death. It is a story with a noble theme.       The acting, the characters, the group and individual dynamics, the continuing subplots, and the humor are absolutely extraordinary.  Those attributes would be seriously compromised almost to the point of superficiality, however, without the serious outcome of the lab's work. The lab's skill and commitment provide the viewer with the powerful experience of redemption as the horror becomes gradually transformed into dignity.  To me, that element is the absolute core of the series.  Everything else is built around it.    I can't wait until Season 5 is available and until Season 6 begins.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|MY GOD! MY GOD! MY GOD! MY GOD! GET THIS IF YOU HAVE TO SELL YOUR BODY PARTS! All bow down to the Hendrix! You will comply! Hard rock from the 60's(the..60's!) that still rocks hard! \\"Star Spangled Banner\\", \\"Purple Haze\\", \\"Voodoo Child\\"(Hulk Hogan's entry music for several years in the past)\\"All Along The Watchtower\\" and a LOT MORE. F'N CLASSIC METAL THAT STILL SELLS! If you released this album even today, it would still sound not completely modern but very, very close. One of the best metal guitarists OF ALL TIME! If you like rock and do not have this collection, may the gods of metal strike you dead! I mean it! Shame on you for not buying this if you don't!
0767811070|3.0|I really don't like a bunch of black movies because they turn out ghetto;potraying blacks as ghetto. Not this one. It was kind of a joy to watch just like soul food. Not stupid at all. Someone finally got it right.
B003L77TZI|2.0|I don't like the way this was produced at all. They aren't definable songs like her debut CD. They're just mind-numbing dance tracks without character to the vocals, the best quality Katy has that many do not. It's not until the last 3 songs at the end (before the dumb remixes) that I found something of more interest. My only favorite is the last song \\"Not Like the Movies\\", and \\"Hummingbird\\" and \\"Pearl\\" are ok, sort of. It's the only one that has some relief to it. I believe you can make a club CD and still instill some creativity in the hooks. You won't find much of that.     The intent of this album is obvious, just a club CD. I was just hoping for more variety, quality, something fresh with creative mixing and production. What we have is just one big commercial production intended to make as much money for the label as possible without regard to the artist's best qualities. I'm sure it will be a huge commercial success but not for any good reason.
0790735172|5.0|Bruce Lee's most popular movie ever made and considered by many to be the best martial arts movie ever made, PERIOD. Although not modern in many ways, it doesn't have to be. It was meant to look a little more natural. The movie that started it all from Bloodsport to Mortal Kombat to Above the Law. All of them owe Enter the Dragon their success. Nuff' said. Pil Sung!
0439023513|5.0|again,to clarify, i am not reviewing this book, i have not completed it yet. i wanted to voice my unhappy opinion on the shipping of preorder items. in my opinion preorder items should arrive to me on the date of release(or shortly after). with all the coupons and discounts available to consumers these days it is no longer necessary to preorder books on amazon to get a cheaper price only to have to WAIT almost a WEEK after the release date to receive your book. i will not be preordering books anymore and will pay a few cents extra and make a purchase elsewhere if this is not remedied.    **i edited my star rating because my review is about amazon not the book**
B002HFJ77S|3.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle a few months ago.     I initially wanted to read it because I enjoy Sophie's previous books.     The concept was there but it seemed it took a while for the story to really grab ahold of you (about halfway through when Sadie becomes much more vocal and bossy).     After I was hooked and wanted to know what really happened and why Sadie wouldn't go away; I couldn't put it down. You really begin to relate to Lara. The family she comes from as well as her work situation with Natalie as well as her love-life.     Enjoyable read but you do have to get through the intro chapters of setting up the story which seemed to be a bit lengthy.
0201633612|5.0|Fantastic book, although written a while ago, it's extremely beneficial to be aware of the patterns raised in the book. Really well explained and gives great examples.
B002ZG983M|5.0|Very entertaining movie.  Great plot, acting, and action.  Complaints about language and violence are greatly exaggerated, but it is not suitable for young children.  Highly recommend this movie.
B002ZG9968|3.0|I've always been a fan of Jennifer Lopez (or J. Lo) and think her movies can often be cute chick flicks.    I watched this last night after coming home from a weekend trip.     It was under 2 hours which always make me weary as I worry there isn't much substance to the story and/or it's rushed.     **Spoilers**    The movie seemed to be in fast forward as the trailer showed most of the funny scenes already. For those who aren't familiar with the plot; Jennifer's character decides she wants to have a baby.. by any means possible. She goes to the clinic and magically is pregnant on the first attempt. Within 20 mins or so, she is pregnant and has to tell her new beau as she is having morning sickness at all hours of the day.     In typical rom-com style, he stays and they try to make it work. Then they have a row and split. But by the end, they are back together.     The only parts that I really found to be realistic or funny were when she had issues fitting into her clothing and feeling fat. The rest seemed very \\"movie magic.\\"     She was a business owner yet didn't seem to ever be \\"at\\" work.. she didn't seem worried about suddenly having to support twins. Time also elapsed quickly as they resolved all their issues within the hour and 45 min run time.     It's a movie you can watch and chuckle on in the background but not one to keep you riveted or have any depth to it.
B002CAWNEM|2.0|This film is almost an exact copy of Fatal Attraction...you know the thriller starring Michael Douglas and Glenn Close. It felt like the director didn't even care about the plot of this movie, and to make matters wrose he figures \\"Hey, let's cast Beyonce!\\", that'll be a sure way to draw a crowd to see this movie...and it did.  Like most of Ms. Knowles films, her fans don't care what the movie is about as long as she's in it. (Remember her in 'Carmen: A Hip-Hopera'?) The majority of people watched that film with no prior knowledge about Bizet's Carmen...or at least Dorothy Dandridge's 'Carmen Jones' as long as Beyonce's in it who cares right? I do...    Besides 'Obsessed' not being that great of a film with a recycled plot, Beyonce's performance is average at best.  She forces her lines too much and her acting skills don't come naturally to her.  Her dialogue in the movie makes you want to roll your eyes and facepalm, and you almost feel sorry for her.  Though she has a few films under her belt, she could still use about 2 years of acting school. Then again her role in this film didn't require much talent, all she had to do was play the black woman who's 'not having it' when a white woman tries to sink her claws into her man.    I would say the only redeeming attribute of the film is Ali Larter.  Even though she plays the cliche jilted vixen who eventually goes pyscho over her completely fabricated love affair with Idris Elba, her performance is still strong, as well as Elba's. I've just got to say that the main attraction of this film(Beyonce)is what drags it down.
B003JYOFIW|4.0|This album really grew on me.  At first it didn't really seem to have the hooks that I'd come to love from DEVO, but like most great records, this was a slow burn.  After I played it a handfull of times, I realized that these songs with no in your face hooks, did in fact have great hooks that attached to my mind like a virus.  Lyrics that I couldn't get out of my head all day -- in a good way, that makes me smile when they pop up.      Yes, this is in fact a true return to form for DEVO.  With lyrics as brilliantly ridiculous as \\"don't taze me bro!\\" from \\"Don't Shoot (I'm A Man)\\", remind us that DEVO can still tell stories unlike any other band.  This record also features one of DEVO's most serious and introspective songs, \\"No Place Like Home\\", with a heartfelt piano intro that soon blends with the rythmic elctronic drums that keep the song chugging like a runner in slow motion.    The energetic album opener \\"Fresh\\" is enough to make get a ticket for going to fast on the freeway.  \\"Mind Games\\" keeps up DEVO's tradition of analyzing love and relationships to the riff of a video game-like synth loop.  The production of the album is top notch and not only harkens back to DEVO's great records like \\"Oh No, It's DEVO\\" and \\"Freedom Of Choice\\", but also stands it's ground as a great record for our current time.    DEVO once again prove that they have what it takes to lead the music-loving masses through the future while not forgetting the roots of our past.  To quote the boys on their final track of the record, \\"March on!  March on!\\"
B00000K3D4|5.0|I can honestly admit that I had no idea who he was when I saw this movie, but I love him! I remember seeing this movie on the Disney channel when I was about 8 or 9, especially around Halloween. I would watch it and bop my heads to the songs and I really liked this film. It wasn't until I was 19 and I happened to describe this movie to a college friend who instantly recognized this movie as 'Labyrinth' and almost immediately we jumped up and drove to the local Walmart to pick this little number up!  I didn't even realize that Sarah was played by a young Jennifer Connelly until then.    David Bowie is timeless and gorgeous in this film!  I love his glitzy costumes and everytime he appears on screen my breath hitches in my throat.  Bowie's not even from my generation and I'm a die-hard fan-girl of his.  His music is sublime in this film especially 'As the World Falls Down' in the fan favorite ballroom scene(the scene I used to describe the movie when I forgot its name). I also like 'Within You', 'Underground', 'Chilly Down', and of course 'Magic Dance'! Yes, if you watch this film and love it the first thing you will want to get your hands on is the soundtrack.    The DVD extra's are heart-warming and I felt priviledged to see the making of the film as well as commentary from the actors and of course Bowie himself.  The bloopers are also very fun to watch as well.  Oh, let's not forget the fact that this film wouldn't even be possible without master puppeteer Jim Henson.    Jennifer Connelly is so adorable as Sarah.  Her character goes through some growth from the start to finish of the movie.  She starts out as a selfish, bratty, immature teenaged girl whose tired of her baby brother, Tobey, cramping her life.  She wishes him to be taken away by unknowingly declaring the 'magic words' and before she knows it the Goblin King(Bowie) grants her wish.  Realizing what she's done she strikes a deal with the duplicitous king and enters the labyrinth as she races against time to save her brother or he will forever remain in the Goblin King's clutches. Along the way she meets and befriends some interesting characters to aid(or sidetrack) her in her journey.    Some may say this movie will have either creeped you out as a kid or seems too strange and corny to watch as an adult. I disagree. This is a fun film to watch and if you've seen it as a kid and watch it as an adult you will be hit with a wave of nostalgia! I highly recommened this film for kids and adults alike(especially if you're a Bowie fan)!

0439023513|1.0|Greatly disappointed.  Often times when you wait for the next book in a series to come out, the anticipation raises the expectation.  I was afraid that was going to happen with Mockingjay since I thoroughly enjoyed Hunger Games and found Catching Fire absolutely riveting.  This novel was a chore to finish.  It had some catch-your-breath moments, but they were too few and surrounded by redundant, depressing minutia.  I had predicting a variety of possible endings, but none as boring or as anti-climatic as the actual novel.  Do yourself a favor:  If you liked the first two novels, do not taint them by reading this book.  Your imagination will far surpass the author's.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Powerful CPU! I bought the bundle Amazon suggested and very please with AMD CPU's couldn't be happier!
B002ZG9788|5.0|Clash of the Titans was a great movie.  And to add that the price was great!  Thanks Amazon
0439023513|5.0|After I finished Mockingjay, there were no words to describe just how I felt about the book. I think I sobbed for about an hour. But now that it's had time to sit in my head, I can't find enough words to convey just how much I loved this novel. It's grueling, heart-stopping, heart-breaking, intense, depressing .. but so, so epic.<br /><br />I will admit that there are a few things about this last book in the series that rubbed me the wrong way, but they were so small compared to the overall impact that the book had on me. Katniss is still a puppet to others, even in her new home, and it gets her thrown into some severe situations. But what I loved the most is reading her break. She goes from somebody who will comply with every request given to appease people, to somebody who has been torn in so many directions that she's slipping out of her mind. And if you're a reader like me, it's so emotional that it affects you.<br /><br />I couldn't guess anything in this one. When I thought this person would die, they didn't. When I didn't expect this person to die, they did. The many twists and turns and unexpected happenings and unfortunately, deaths (there are quite a few of them in this one) can be somewhat dizzying at times, but they're a large part of what made this last book so incredible. When I can't predict the outcome of a book, an author has done something right.<br /><br />And this book will appease both Team Gale and Team Peeta fans, at least for a little while. Peeta had his time to shine in the last two books, but now it's Gale's turn. I won't spoil anything, but each character has their ups and heavily downs in this one. Poor Katniss. What an emotional rollercoaster!<br /><br />Overall, Mockingjay has landed a place on one of my all-time favorite lists. Even though it doesn't have a fairytale ending (and honestly - if you were expecting one, you haven't really grasped what the series is about at all) it's raw and real and just insanely epic. If you're a fan of the first two books, run to the bookstore and get yourself a copy of this one NOW. Just .. wow. That is all.bookstore and get yourself a copy of this one NOW. Just .. wow.

1452896305|5.0|Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.<br /><br />Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.<br /><br />These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.<br /><br />I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.<br /><br />This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite.live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.

B003NHRIVQ|3.0|In watching `The Last Song' over the weekend (to be honest, I actually wanted to do this), I decided that it was probably best to present this review in three sections; the pros, the cons and my verdict.<br /><br />It just makes more sense this way.<br /><br />THE PROS:<br /><br />The beachfront setting of the film, not unlike a previous Sparks film adaptation `Nights in Rodanthe', is stunning and certainly creates a mood, the same mood that follows a lot of Sparks' stories.  You can feel the love in the air from the moment the sandy shores are revealed.  The acting here is also quite decent, with the exception of Kelly Preston who is just really bad at whatever it is she is trying to do.  Greg Kinnear is always a welcome presence, and he layers the stereotypical `dad' role with enough personality to make him endearing.  Liam Hemsworth is like a talented Paul Walker (they look very similar) and that is becoming.  I see a career in front of him that may (and I'm not really joking here) lead him to some award recognition in ten years or so.  That said, the star of the show has a decent three-quarter turn here.  Once here character gets out of the `I'm trying to be distant and rebellious' stage she actually shines.  So, I'd say that a good 75% of Miley Cyrus's performance is pretty darn good.  I'll tell you this, the main performances (and the nonchalant way the film is edited in parts) goes a long way to making this film entertaining, since there are a lot more cons than pros here.  But, before I switch gears, I want to mention the biggest pro here and that is the theme song to the film.  `When I Look At You' is beautifully sung (yes, I'm talking about you Miss Cyrus) and effortlessly captivating.  It actually yanks at your heartstrings more than this movie does!<br /><br />Ok, we must move on.<br /><br />THE CONS:<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks has absolutely NO imagination.  Really, it's like he wrote this one book many, many years ago and decided that it was so successful and so well written that, instead of challenging himself to try anything new, he was just going to `rinse and repeat' for the rest of his life.  Like you may have guessed it, Ronnie meets Will and falls in love.  Will is from a different social standing than Ronnie.  They don't initially get along but they fall in love quick.  There are problems within the family dynamic.  Oh yeah, someone dies.  Typical Sparks' material.  That said, Sparks usually shines in this genre, but this film feels forced for me.  I think the biggest issue is that Sparks doesn't understand modern romance.  He totally gets that dated love that shines in films like `The Notebook', and he even understood the aged romantic dynamic in `Nights in Rodanthe' and even `Message in a Bottle', but the way he crafts modern teenage romance is stilted and phony to the taste.  It just doesn't seem real, and then when he tries to pepper in modern issues (like the abusive boyfriend with the homeless girlfriend) it looks very skeletal in form and unbelievable.  Another issue here is the first 25% of Miley's performance.  It is so forced, and that comic relief she tries to deliver with the whole sea turtle bit (that whole subplot was poorly executed) was atrocious.  I wish I could wipe that whole section from the film.  The films rapid deterioration as the film draws to a close is also a tad underworked.  When a certain character winds up sick, the sickness comes on so ridiculously rapidly that one is stunned as to why NO ONE NOTICED IT BEFORE.  It just doesn't make much sense at all.<br /><br />I also want to say this; Miley Cyrus is not the most attractive girl in the world.  In fact, the way she holds her face can be comically off-putting at times (and it is also what made the first part of her performance so out of place), but her funny looks could play into her favor once she hones her acting skills.  She obviously has some talent (her emotional breakdown upon hearing some tragic news is remarkably intact and believable) and I can see her developing into a nice actress one day.  The fact that she isn't afraid to look ugly (I know that sounds harsh, but if you are a cinephile like me you'll understand that that isn't really meant as an insult) will help her create more reality within her characters.  We all know that NO ONE is pretty all of the time.  Notice the way that Miley holds her face even towards the films end, when she is looking off or standing in a crowd.  She looks lazy and frumpy and at times like she smells something gross.  In other words, she looks natural.  It works for her in parts, and honestly, if she keeps that up and begins to understand a little better HOW to emote completely I could very well see her getting on the track she claimed she desired (not too long ago she mentioned that she wanted to be like Kate Winslet - great aspirations young lady - and do a dramatic film like `Revolutionary Road').  I don't see her as the next Kate-the-Great (that would be a stretch), but the next Natalie Portman?<br /><br />Give her five years and ask me that again.<br /><br />And still, the film is worth seeing at least once.<br /><br />MY VERDICT:<br /><br />It could have been a lot better.  Even `A Walk to Remember', which is saddled with some clich&eacute;s that surround everything Sparks' writes, manages to be a lot more realistically sound than this film, and a lot more endearing (this movie didn't even bring me close to tears, and it really needed to).  Still, it is a decent summer romance movie and it certainly has everything the tweens are looking for.  My brother loves this movie (for reasons I am sure we don't share) and I'm sure you're twelve year old will too.  If the day is rainy and the mood is light, I'd have no problem watching this film again, as long as it's on cable TV and I'm not paying for it.a nice actress one day.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|Sure, it's fun to see movies like Inception, Predators, The Expendables. I enjoyed all three of those movies I saw. But then again, it's also fun to get a release and go see one of those cute films that is just a nice little fun, clean release. And \\"Despicable Me\\" is just that! I did indeed see Toy Story 3 and loved it, but believe it or not, I may have enjoyed this movie just a bit more.<br /><br />Despicable Me is 90 minutes of pure fun. It's safe for the whole family, and is wacky, out there FUN. Parents will not have to worry about seeing their characters looking at death straight in the eye in an incinerator, or there being rude jokes aplenty, because your kid will love this and so will you. You'll be surprised at how great the characters are, or how quirky and fun the minions can be, and how much you'll be laughing. And to top it all off, this film in 3D has some of the best 3D I've seen!<br /><br />The film is about Gru, a foreign criminal who is skilled in stealing massive objects. He has stolen many things in a lifetime alone, from the Times Square Jumbotron to the Paris Eiffel Tower. He runs an army of cute yellow minions, and he plans to steal the moon, his greatest crime. However though, a copycat named Vector, who is smarter than him too, has stolen the pyramid of Giza and replaced it with an inflatable one. To add insult to injury, he now has to adopt THREE little girls. As if working too hard wasn't enough? He's gonna have a hard time running those lives!!!<br /><br />This film has it all. Great humor, cute animation, Good 3D (STAY THROUGH THE END CREDITS!!!), and some good voice acting. If you want some good clean fun, be sure to see this movie!
0307474712|3.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers that this book does seem to paint a realistic view of life after college and the struggle to find your place, identity, career, love, etc. but I found NOTHING unique about the characters in this book that would lead me to recommend it to others. Sure, the idea of each chapter taking place on the same day over the course of 18 years is interesting - in fact it was what finally sold me on this book - but it shouldnt have. The banter is witty at times sure, but the characters are not lovable or even unlikable enough to really make a good story or make them characters that will stay with me over time like Cleave's Little Bee. I will admit it kept my attention enough to finish the book - I was intrigued enough to learn how the story of these two would finish but with hundreds of other great books out there - I wouldnt let my friends and family waste their time on this one. I liked this book better when it was called There Should Have Been Castles by Hermann Raucher. It's out of print but you can get it used on Amazon - THAT you will thank me for :)
B0035V35PI|5.0|The fantastic story combined with some of the most advanced cinimatic magic makes Ninja Assassin the most exciting, graphic, action packed movie full of suspense and special effects that look amazing.  This is a movie worth the extra couple dollars for the BlueRay.  The digital sound and picture quality makes the movie just as dynamic as it was on the silver screen.  I love this movie!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I ordered this for my son and wow does he love it!  I love the old \\"real\\" animation that's not digital.  It really brings me back.  It's relatively short (75 minutes or so) so it's long enough to distract a sick kid, but not so long that he looses interest.  Great movie!
0446563048|5.0|This book provides amazing insight into the life and times of Tony and Zappos. I found this to be one of the more interesting and relatable biographies recalling an amazing journey to success.  Delivering Happiness is highly recommended as the tales both inspire and awe. I've always loved shopping with Zappos but even more so now. Because of this book, I'm looking forward to following Tony and Zappos in the years to come.
030726999X|3.0|I felt strangely let down after reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. The plot is simple: Lisbeth Salander is in the hospital recovering from gunshot wounds while an old conspiracy is revived with the intent of burying her in order to cover up old crimes. However, several factors made this a rather unsatisfying read:<br /><br />1) Not enough Lisbeth. Lisbeth is by far the most interesting character in these books. No one even comes close. Unfortunately, she is either absent from much of the narrative or merely passive. I understand that getting shot in the head can slow anybody down but her absence detracts from the interest of the story. It's only rather late in the game that she really gets going and the story really starts moving.<br /><br />2) The Keystone Kops Konspiracy. I have a couple of problems with this conspiracy. First, its introduction requires far too much exposition, which brings the story to a stop. This should have been a more gradual process began in an earlier book. Second, the conspirators are just not that smart, or perhaps simply too old and sick. They always seem one step -or two- behind their opponents, which drains much of the tension from the story. If these guys are Sweden's best, no wonder the country chooses to remain neutral.<br /><br />3) Too many perverts. You know, most of us go through our entire lives without once witnessing a man trying to murder his wife, or encountering a sadistic rapist-lawyer, or dealing with a vengeful stalker. Yet these are almost everyday occurrences to the characters in these books. In the current volume we find out that a character has thousands of images of child porn on his laptop. My reaction to finding this out was an eyeroll and thinking \\"Not another one!\\" Yeah, he's not a nice guy but still... The Sweden of these novels is a sewer of misogyny, depravity, hypocrisy and corruption. Nothing like the enlightened Social Democratic paradise of legend. I'm glad I don't live there.<br /><br />4) Too long. Frankly, the whole \\"Erika at the newspaper\\" subplot was unnecessary and seemed like padding.<br /><br />So why three stars? Well, the book remained a compulsive page-turner despite the problems. The character of Lisbeth Salander is one of the most fascinating in modern fiction. And it's nice to see things wrapped up, more or less. Although who knows, perhaps the legendary fourth book will one day see the light of day. Until then, ciao Lisbeth!ika at the newspaper\\" subplot was unnecessary and seemed like padding.     So why three stars? Well, the book remained a compulsive page-turner despite the problems.

0756603749|3.0|I have gotten about 3/4 of the way through this book since my purchase.  The first few knots you learn are very easy but once you get further in and the knots become more complicated, the description on what to do seems to get more confusing and less clear.  I have had to turn to friends for help with a few but all in all this book is OK.
B002NWRMVS|1.0|I expected much more from Nora Jones.  The turn-off is with the very first piece on the CD.  The band sounds like something a bunch of high school freshmen would put together in a garage.  There is absolutely no \\"musicality\\" to it.  I couldn't listen even through the first number.  I should have read other reviews first!
1416550550|4.0|The Forgotten Garden is a perfect summer read--escapism but with a woderful story.  The author's style of weaving several pasts with the present animates the story and keeps you hooked.  The presentation allows the reader to iagine several different outcomes, but the author's ending is satisfying.  This is a good selection for a book club as multiple topics for discussion arise.
0345479092|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Everything Tracy writes makes perfect sense because really, it's just common sense. It seems so much better to follow her routine than something like Baby Wise just because you are listening to your baby and what he or she needs as opposed to forcing a very strict schedule on them. She also gave advice on a lot of topics that I was wondering about as I am expecting my first baby. I can't wait to use all of her tips and tricks once my baby is born.     I will definitely be reading it again, and I enjoyed it so much I sent a copy to my friend that just had a baby!
B003XU7VM4|4.0|\\"Heat Wave\\" is a fun, easy-to-read book that's just like an episode of the TV series \\"Castle,\\" only the characters' names have been changed. The murder/mystery part of the plot was predictable, but the relationships between the characters and the witty dialog really kept the story moving. The story did have a couple of problems, however. First, the \\"real\\" Richard Castle would never have written about Nikki Heat's flashback to the night her mother was murdered. Castle rarely seems to take things seriously, but underneath he's a pretty sensitive guy, and he would have respected Kate's privacy about that painful subject. I also don't think he would have repeatedly referred to Nikki's blushes or fluttering heart because Kate would have taken him down verbally, if not physically. Second (and this is a MAJOR complaint) the type size in the paperback is ridiculously small and the print extends so far toward the binding that it's practically impossible to read the book. Still, I persevered, and really enjoyed \\"Heat Wave.\\"
0812550706|5.0|Not much of a review but a pretty bid reader. I just wanted to give kudos where kudos was do, great book for all ages. I read it my first time when I was 15 and it's just as good now in my 30s.     The follow-up books aren't on par but are still pretty good reading.
0439023513|5.0|This is the third, and final, book in The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins.  If you read the first two books, you will read this one.  All I can say is to be prepared for one heck of a ride.  A lot happens in this book and Collins doesn't hold off on killing off a lot of people.<br /><br />The book starts where Catching Fire left off.  Katniss is in District 13 with Gale, her mom, and her sister Prim.  The Rebel group based in District 13 is trying to get Katniss to take up the Mockingjay symbol and become the face of their revolution.  Katniss is unsure if she wants to go this route or not.  Peeta is still missing and presumed captured by President Snow and being held in the Capital.  Katniss's journey eventually leads to the capital itself and a final face-off with President Snow.<br /><br />This is a hard book to review without spoilers but I will give it my best shot.  The pace of this book is relentless.  Collins does not pull punches when it comes to killing off large groups of people, as well as people we love and care about.  This is a dark book, and that is putting it mildly.<br /><br />As far as characterization goes we begin to see even more of what defines Katniss as a character; she is not sentimental, she is a survivor foremost and that it what sets her apart from others.  A lot of the decisions made by Katniss in this book are driven by that personality trait.  In fact at one point Gale and Peeta are discussing Katniss and who she will \\"choose\\".  Gale sums it up perfectly when he says something to the effect of \\"Katniss will choose whoever she can't survive without.\\"<br /><br />On to other characters.  The ruthlessness we saw in Gale at the end of the Catching Fire is built upon in this book.  Gale is ruthless and practical to the point of dislike at times.  He begins to look like a character that likes what Katniss stands for, rather than who she is.  At the end of book two I was Team Gale all the way.  I thought that Gale and Katniss had more in common in survival instincts and could pull off a good relationship based on those characteristics.  As this book starts and continues, we see a side of Gale that is more ruthless and dispassionate than ever before.<br /><br />In order to avoid spoilers I won't say much about Peeta, except that he is back in the story for the second half of the book.<br /><br />Collins does an excellent job at showing both sides of the story.  You get to see both the good the rebel forces do, and the harm they cause in rebelling against the Capital.  As Katniss and team enter the capital, Collins relates the Capital takeover as yet another type of dome just like previous \\"Hunger Games\\"  this is an interesting idea and ties the three novels together well.  In each of them we see our teams of characters struggling to stay alive, doing things no one should have to do.  In each book there are brutal deaths.<br /><br />There's quite the twist at the end of this book.  People may be surprised at who Katniss kills.  All I have to say about this is that I was satisfied with the choice Katniss made, and had actually been hoping that Collins would have it play out that way.  Katniss's actions at the end seemed like the best way to follow Katniss's beliefs, while trying to ensure the best ending for humanity as a whole.<br /><br />The epilogue was interesting.  It was kind of nice to get a definitive ending to everything that played out before.  It wrapped things up nicely. Still, I didn't think the epilogue was necessary and I think the book would have actually been a bit better and more thought-provoking without it.  As with the previous books the writing style of this book was incredibly readable and engaging; no matter people think of the plot, you have to admit Collins is one heck of a great writer.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was an excellent conclusion to the series.  Readers may not like how some of things play-out; but I thought they played out realistically and I liked thedecisions Katniss made at the end...I thought her decisions really stayed true to the core personality trait of her character, which was to survive.  I am eagerly awaiting whatever Collins comes up with next.ed true to the core personality trait of her character, which was to survive.  I am eagerly awaiting whatever Collins comes up with next.

B003INBOEM|5.0|We rented this and then I was thrilled to find it on Blu-Ray here, so I ordered it for my husband's birthday.  He was so thrilled we've already watched it twice more.  I highly recommend this movie as it's not just a \\"kung-fu fighting\\" movie, but has an amazing plot - and it's all based on a TRUE STORY!  LOVE IT.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games are the ultimate reality show: A fight to the death among 24 young people (the tributes), one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts, while the rich and spoiled people of the Capitol watch on, and bid for their favorites. Only a winner is allowed. A winner that will never be hungry again or forced to participate in the games.<br /><br />The Games take place every year in the Capitol and are run by the government that rules the twelve districts, the remnants of the land that once was called North America. The Games are a reminder that \\"resistance is futile\\" as the Capitol has the power to destroy the districts if so wished, as it destroyed number thirteen seventy four years ago during the last rebellion.<br /><br />As the book starts, sixteen years old Katniss volunteers to compete in the Games when her twelve years old sister is chosen to represent the 12th district. Katniss, who lost her father in a mine explosion at thirteen and has been since keeping her mother and little sister fed with her hunting, is determined to stay alive whatever the price. For Peeta, the male tribute from the same district, things are not so simple. Is it possible, he wonders, to play the Games without losing his humanity?<br /><br />Those who think YA and/or Fantasy books are light fare may have to reconsider after reading this book because the question The Hunger Games asks: would you kill to stay alive? Would you kill an enemy, a friend, a lover? is not easy to answer.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins's premise in The Hunger Games is that yes, when hunted, we all become hunters. But killing a human being comes with a high price and the survivor will forever be haunted by the dead.<br /><br />Being a Young Adult novel, the story ends with a note of hope (and BTW that is why I read/write YA novels). Yet the question remains, taunting the reader: how much of your humanity/your core beliefs will you give up to stay alive? to make a living? It's a question we all havehad (or will have) to answer sometime in our lives, even if the circumstances are not as extreme as in the novel and the price to pay for failure not as high.
030726999X|5.0|My purchase of The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was the very first hardbound that I have ordered through Amazon.  But I just could not wait for the paperback to come out.  I will miss Lisbeth Salendar, but I am happy for some stability for her. I hear that someone may write up her sister's story.  I may try that as well if it ever comes to pass.  Her passion, bravery, brilliance and creativity are examples to us all.

To see how people are treated in this film will keep you in the movie.  Master Yip Man never wants to fight or be challenge by others. He just wants to live in peace with his family.

B003VWC4AS|5.0|John Carlin's work is a thrilling, spine-tingling effort.  Most of the book's protagonists can't recall their meetings with Nelson Mandela in regards to 1995's Rugby World Cup without breaking into tears.  Carlin's genius is to make you see why this is the natural reaction.  Here's a man who, as one player aptly puts it \\"spent 27 years in prison and came out with love and friendship.  All that washed over me, that huge realization, and the tears just rolled down my face.\\"<br /><br />Though Mandela is as close as there is to a god walking this earth, it's his one-on-one people skills that take the day.  His will is to win them over, one person at a time.<br /><br />I read the originally released hardcover version of Carlin's book, which was called 'Playing the Enemy.'  The working title of Clint Eastwood's movie was, for a short while, 'The Human Factor.'  ESPN also produced a film based on the book as part of their excellent '30 for 30' series ([[ASIN:B003BEE288 ESPN Films 30 for 30: The Sixteenth Man]]).  I rank these efforts as follows:<br /><br />1. Playing the Enemy - The other two creative works are derived directly from Carlin's reporting and dramatic narrative.<br /><br />2. The 16th Man - Cliff Bestall's work is a direct retelling of Carlin's story; 15 years on, it's stirring to see the players still so visibly moved about the their place in history and the events of those days.<br /><br />3. Invictus - This sappy, sloppy adaptation ranks as one of Clint Eastwood's worst movies.  And, having the 5' 9\\" Matt Damon portray the 6' 3\\", 230 lb Springbok captain Francois Pienaar sticks a blowhole of unbelievability in the middle of the tale.
0316098337|5.0|My reaction to this book was visceral. For the first 10 pages or so I felt nauseated, so outraged and heartbroken I wasn't sure I'd finish it. But a friend said once you get further into it things get easier to handle. Well, somewhat.<br /><br />I admired the \\"Ma\\" character for her dedication to raise Jack as normally as possible, if anything in that sort of situation could be normal. I questioned her telling him the world outside wasn't real, presumably to shield him from what he was missing and make him think their life was just how things were. But, in another way, I could understand that. Why upset a child unnecessarily?<br /><br />The way she raised him, the thoroughness with which she cared for him, making sure he enjoyed a strict, reassuring schedule, was just so impressive. Teaching him life's morality and values, under such conditions, illustrates her innate strength, as well as the bond the two shared.<br /><br />But as far as depressing books go, this one hit me hard. It blindsided me, and in at least one way - the curious speech pattern of Jack - annoyed me. As far as books I've had difficulty reading, for their downer quality, this one may win the prize. Such feelings of hopelessness are just too real, too close to home for me to approach the story without stress and fear creeping into my mind.<br /><br />So, why five stars? Because, despite my own upsetting experience I think Donoghue did a fantastic job portraying a sickening situation. I won't say the whole book was perfect, but the portrait she drew felt accurate in most ways. And who am I to say what such a situation would be like? I'm no expert. I can only go with my gut feeling, that despite how emotionally draining the book was there was so much artistry that went into it.<br /><br />So, I would recommend it, with the caveat some may find themselves as upset as I did. I'll probably never forget this book. It may show up in my nightmares. But as far as Donoghue pulling off what I believe she meant to achieve I think it's brilliant. And that's a writer's job, not to please every reader but to create a believeable work of art. And that she certainly did.that's a writer's job, not to please every reader but to create a believeable work of art. And that she certainly did.

1401307450|3.0|If 100 people lived the same life Kiedis lived, 99 of them would be dead and forgotten by now. Kiedis is the remaining 1%.  Kiedis is not a great, talented or inspiring person. In fact, he is pretty much despicable, But his life and the environment he lived in are interesting, since they reveal much of the chaos our society and especially the show biz are.    Kiedis' bio can be found at wikipedia and is simple: he was the son of a drug dealer, used dope since he was 11 and came in and out of the habit about a 100 times. In the meantime, he wrote bad teenagerish verses and \\"sang\\" with his band. I am amazed that anyone can call him a  musician: I wonder what people with years of rigorous training in music think about it. Kiedis didn't have any serious commitment  to music, never learned to play anything and was carried on the shoulders of his band mates all the time. He is the farthest a person can be from an artist. His \\"art\\" sounds more like the ramblings of a romantic teen girl writing in her diary. Bukowski, he is not     Some interesting facts that tell a lot about our society:    - His father was a criminal: a drug dealer, someone who gave pot to his 11 year-old son, a whore monger and perhaps a pedophile. However, he never spent much time in jail and lives well in his old age, while many of his clients are dead. What kind of judiciary system is this, where some kids serve long sentences for marijuana possession while such a criminal is at large?  - Kiedis' carrer start was due to the fact his father was a dealer to show biz stars. There is a sick environment that encompasses actors, musicians, prostitutes, groupies and drug dealers in groups in  Hollywood. I guess it won't be long until we see a band formed by the sons of prostitutes to the stars. Once again, we are reminded of the talented people who study hard to be artists, but lose their chances to drug dealers' kids.  - Success in show biz is totally random and not related to talent at all. What matters are the connections, and luck.  - The women in the show biz environment are basically prostitutes. Their whole lives revolve around getting a famous guy for them to ride on. Or many guys, at least until they start a \\"fashion label\\" or an \\"alternative band\\".     In a positive side, in the first part of the book, Kiedis at least recognizes he was a jerk, and one develops  some sympathy for him. But this is limited to the way he treated his friends.   Driving under the influence, crashing his car on a tree, he never once says that he could have hurt someone, a child in a passing car, for example. He never once thinks about having a productive life. And what is worse, in the end of the book he tries to give an impression that his pathetic dealings with drugs made him someone special, with a mission to help others. He lacks the humility to see how lucky he was, how his fame and fortune are totally undeserved.     His mission on life, if he had one, was to sleep with as many girls as possible and consume as much dope as a human being can.    PS: I listened to the audiobook, The narrator is superb.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|No scratches, no breaks, and no skips.  My boyfriend was impressed I got a new CD in perfect condition and still wrapped on Amazon for next to nothing. Thank you!
0596806027|4.0|Not a bad book, just too little depth on HTML5 goodies like canvas, storage (client side), and geolocation. Excellent history (emails from back in the day) in the 1st couple chapters, but this is not the reason one would buy this book. HTML5 is the next step in the evolution of the web, and this book will definitely open the door to the possibilities, but not take you that much further.... I also found it repetitive at times.
B00406UK7S|2.0|A disappointing formula-film, but disappointing for reasons that are quite hard to put a finger on. I think perhaps it has to do firstly with the nature of the bad guys. For the purposes of the plot, the Picts are not small, scrawny, naked with blue woad patterns over their entire bodies, and ginger - instead they're huge brawny Gaulish types who ride big clean horses along good roads. They do daub their faces (very neatly) with woad, though. This won't matter to Americans, but then there are also some gaping plot holes - such as the Picts keeping no dogs or geese in their main city, which could act as warning of infiltration at night. Nor any guards. I mean, these people are at war with the greatest fighting machine in the world, and they don't post guards at night? Ridiculous. So, forget historical accuracy. But if we're doing away with that, then why not introduce a very subtle touch of \\"is-it-supernatural-or-isn't-it?\\" to spice things up and make the film far more interesting. Or at least explain something in depth of the mystical beliefs of each side - this is attempted for about three seconds and falls flat, yet the witch could easily have deepened this aspect of the film in a minute's dialogue, aided by some foreshadowing in the plot. As it is, we are very much in the human world of human actions and agencies, and there we firmly remain. Yet for these people the pristine landscape was alive with gods and spirits. There are some other more basic silly plot points, as when someone falls and breaks their leg _just_ as the baddies find them. Ridiculous. The film is however extremely well photographed and costumed, and the Scottish scenery is magnificent. The colour-grading and slight bleaching of the film in places gives a certain bleakness at the right moments - but in that respect Centurion can't match the sheer beauty of a film such as Solomon Kane. There are a few unnatural wheeling helicopter shots, but most of the time the landscape is much more sensibly and beautifully portrayed from ground level and with cranes. The film's landscape was actually filmed in the Scottish Highlands, the national parks of England, and the woods of Hampshire - not in some cheapie tax-dodge like Czechoslovakia. The music is very formulaic and just a touch heavy-handed - but usually doesn't get in the way. Overall, I think Centurion's main underlying flaw is that the plot is simply \\"too modern\\" to be believable. It starts with the allusions to the present-day Iraq War in the introduction, and from then on there's a continual dabbing-on of little hints and references to the contemporary. Which just continually drags the audience away from belief in the setting. It's like a schoolmaster looking up while reading a good story, to explain the relevance of the exciting bits to the class. But Centurion seems to be a film aimed at teenage lads, so I guess the director felt the need to slip in some jolts of propaganda. The intended audience of teen lads probably also explains why the female leads are both far too \\"glam\\" and modern-looking, like they've just stepped out of the centrefold of Busty Babes and thrown a few leaves in their mussed-up hair. I did rather like the believable performance of the witch, though. To sum up, Centurion is not a terrible film - although it is terribly gory and I might have snipped out a minute or three of the most gory frames. But by adding a few more dashes of intelligence and mystery to the story, and a genuine sense of the alien, it could have been so much more than a teen gore flick. It's British, so I'd love to be generous and give this three stars - but it really only deserves two.
B00003CXUM|4.0|This is one of the most beautifully photographed films I've ever seen.  The movie is worth watching for its intricate textures, rich colors, lovely compositions of light and shade, and wonderfully complex backgrounds.   The story, however, is a little bit faint.  But that's maybe because I was completely distracted by Maggie Cheung's totally stunning outfits.
0938045768|4.0|At first when I purchased this book, I was a bit hesitant of the material and the methods by which bodyweight conditioning could help me increase my strength.  But after I purchased the book from a local retailer and took many hours looking through the progressive steps, it was well worth the money I paid.  The author focuses on 6 major excersizes and actually gives you the background as to how this excersizes came about and how they evolved into what he has printed in his publication.  Anyone looking for doing some serious bodyweight training and conditioning or looking to add some to your already existing workout routine, by all means, GET THIS BOOK!!  Granted, the process by which the author gives the steps for progression are long and slow, but hey, better safe than sorry.      The only thing that I didn't like (and this may have just been my book) but it appears that the copy that I received has the entire chapter of the 'squat' excersizes missing!!  I'm glad I already know how to do 1-legged full squats, but thats not the point.  Otherwise, I was very happy with this book and I can see that I will be spending many days and years devoting myself to this training program.

B003L16FAE|5.0|For those unfamiliar with what \\"DNR\\" is, it's \\"Digital Noise Reduction\\". Old/outdated/no longer preferred film technology had imperfections that resulted in a grainy picture. It's why your old 1980's \\"Batman\\" picture doesn't have the punch on Blu Ray that a film like \\"Dark Knight\\" has.<br /><br />\\"DNR\\" is a technology that processes the old picture and removes some of the artifacts so that it looks more like current film technology. The haters like to point out that things like shadow detail is sometimes lost in the process, but, to me, the sacrifice is completely worth it!<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: academic debate aside, the picture of the Ultimate Hunter Edition of Predator feels like it has more punch than other Blu Ray adaptations of older films and it's precisely BECAUSE of the DNR processing! I buy Blu Ray so my jaw drops at how good the picture looks as I watch some scenes and it's rare that I get that feeling with unprocessed grainy films.<br /><br />Shadow detail doesn't matter if it looks like you're watching the movie on a TV that's getting bad reception, and that's exactly how grain makes me feel.<br /><br />So anyway, I just wanted to throw my voice into fray to offer an alternative viewpoint to the DNR haters. This film looks absolutely wonderful (among the better Blu Ray films I've seen) and Predator and Blu Ray fans who like to feel blown away by films like Avatar will be similarly blown away by this version of the film.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|THE DARK KNIGHT    When the Batman franchise was reopened I unlike a lot of other people around was excited for the possibilities of the film. If someone could come in and make a real good Batman film that would be great plus to be honest [here it is] I never hated any of the Batman films. The old school one is just that and that makes it fun, the first two Burton ones were really good in my opinion, and the final three were very cartoon/comic style fun. There I said it I found a reason to like each one even though they got less great as they went along. Then came \\"Batman Begins\\" which is arguably the best in the series and of all comic book films, I can see the case made for it.     So after that one I knew the next would be just as good if not better with the inclusion of the Joker. The hype surrounding this film was extraordinary but I think it was well deserved as I loved this film. Now sure there was a lot of additional hype since one of the stars passed away right before the films release but even without that I think this film would still have done the numbers it did. I mean sure that added some I am sure but there is all the batman fans, DC comics fans, comic fans in general, fans of the film before this one, action fans and well fans of just good movies. There was a lot this film had going for it and thankfully it delivered on all fronts.    With excellent writing and picture perfect direction from Christopher Nolan this film could not help but be great. The best thing about it still is the performances and of course you know who I mean. Heath Ledger did an outstanding job on this film with his portrayal of the Joker. Now the Joker is very arguably the greatest villain in all of comics, in fact I really thing he is. But he could also be the greatest villain in all creative history, especially this version of him. Now the comparisons started immediately with Ledger's Joker and Nicholson's Joker but to be honest you can not compare the two. They are two different versions of the same character in two different films, each one very much compliments and steals the show in their respective film.    Aside from Ledger [I could go on about his performance but every one else has] there is our lead Christian Bale who like in the first does a great job here. Aaron Eckhart is absolutely wonderful as Harvey Dent better known as Two Face, great performance there. Michael Caine once again is the perfect Alfred for these new films as is Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal is the new Rachel and a better one I think, and of course the always brilliant Morgan Freeman is just that, brilliant. On a side note I loved that Cillian Murphy reprised his role of the Scarecrow in this film, brief but great.    I am sure you all know the story by now, a crazed madman [I guess they mean the same thing] comes lurking into town and offers the mob his services in killing Batman. His name is the Joker and he knows what he is doing, he is very good at doing that in which is what he does. Basically he knows how to cause chaos better than any one ever, and he is very very good at it. Enter Batman who is there to take up the challenge but Joker has a side game going, one that involves a man named Harvey Dent. When all is said and done the Joker will be changing the outlook of this city.    The reviews are many on this film so for more in depth details about any of this read those, I am very late to the party reviewing this mainly because I never felt the need to repeat every one else. But alas here I am stuck in my ways and have to get something out there. So here it is world I very much recommend this film and if you have yet to see it, BUY IT NOW.
B003J27WFW|5.0|This is a great documentary that chronicles the beginning of Rush.  With early footage, lots of interviews and great editing we really get to see the members of Rush as real people, and not as people on a lighted stage... this is a must see for any Rush fan.
0439023513|5.0|This series has been intense from the very first page of \\"The Hunger Games\\", and \\"Mockingjay\\" does not break that mold. The suspense is laid on thick in the final book in the series which makes it a real page turner. I found the story to have a hopeless feel to it and even in the end I was sad. There are some things I would have liked to change, but as per usual, nothing is poppy fields and sunshine in the books and I just have to accept that. I was satisfied with the way the story ended, not an easy feat for a series to accomplish in general.<br /><br />What I have always loved about this series is its ability to inspire thought. It is impossible to read one of these books and not ponder the deeper meaning behind the events that occur on every page. Overall this is an excellent series, and not just because of its popularity.
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|This is the third book in the Steig Larrson trilogy and IMHO he could have added a chapter to book two and skipped this one altogether.  If you're an avid student of cold war Swedish political history you might enjoy this book. I'm not and I didn't. You could skip over whole chapters and never lose the story line. There were enough characters named to fill a phone book and most of them never appeared more than once in the story. Who has a burning need to know the name and history of every cab driver and waitress in Sweden? Since there was a book three you can pretty well surmise that Liz-Lisbeth-Pippi-Sally-Salander survived book two and went on to garner her revenge.  Such a disappointment! for some reason the ending had me thinking of an old limerick : \\"Sally, with a taste for gore, nailed her brother to the door.....\\"
B00006F2TV|4.0|We have this movie on VHS, but i wanted it on DVD to have a full set of Spiderman on DVDs.  Love it.
0307912957|2.0|Frankly, after reading a spoiler about the ending, I simply have no will to continue on, there is just no pay-off after enduring this depressing tale sprinkled with occasional one-liners. Granted, I am never opposed to taking a good dose of drama, but melodrama I detest.<br /><br />This story is about a man and a woman who one day come together as lovers, then break up, but stay connected. Their relationship is followed through the next 20 years by presenting just one day - July 15th - out of their lives.<br /><br />This is indeed a great premise (and technique), but I wish they were used on different characters and situations. Both Dexter and Emma are not likeable enough for me to care to see how their relationship unfolds. I dislike watching Dexter waste his life on partying and hooking up and Emma - on pining over him for years. There is nothing remotely romantic, deep, or compelling about it IMO.<br /><br />I agree with one of the reviewers here who said that the author didn't quite know his target audience. One Day is neither a literary fiction (which can spin the star-crossed lovers theme in a meaningful way - see Atonement), nor a light-hearted chick lit (some reviewers mistakenly compare this novel to the movie \\"When Harry Met Sally\\"). It is somewhere in the middle, which is, IMO, a decently written relationship melodrama, perfect examples of which are The Time Traveler's Wife and Nicholas Sparks's tear-jerkers. But alas, this is not my favored genre.

0385532458|3.0|I'm a huge fan of John Grisham and have read all of his books.  I was excited to read his short stories and was, generally speaking, not disappointed.  The stories were all well written and had great set-ups.  I think what kept these stories from being great were the ways in which Grisham tended to end them.  For the most part, the stories end exactly the way you knew they would when the story began and were somewhat anti-climactic.  I found myself wishing (hoping) each story would end with a \\"blow your mind\\" moment.  We don't get that which isn't unexpected but is slightly disappointing.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I had heard such wonderful things about this book. I purchased it in my Kindle and have been regretting it ever since. It is difficult to follow and the translation is sometimes awkward. I can see how the story is good but there is too much unnecessary fluff.

B000NU2CY4|5.0|I broke down and purchased this blu-ray taking a chance as to the quality of the disc. I have to keep in mind that this is a first generation blu-ray disc and that all videos are not created equal. Some videos are simply Standard DVD transfers with nothing done while others are given the royal treatment before being released. One example of a standard transfer may be Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves while one example of a movie that gets the royal treatment may by Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. Gladiator does seem to fall in between this as there was no WOW effect after watching the movie nor was there a let down either. I have a 32\\" Sharp Aquaos 1080i with a Sony Blu-ray player hooked up to an Onkyo HTS-6200 Receiver via HDMI. So this would vary according to your setup.<br />While I read a lot about the exchange program I was skeptical about taking the chance. However, I read The Digital Bits website and [...] web site and decided to take the chance. Contacting Paramount I got hold of one of the nicest customer service reps I've ever talked to in a while. She was patient with me as it was not easy to verify what they were asking for. Paramount if you read this I sent you the wrong disc and I will be happy to send you the right one. SO please contact me.<br />So in about 3 weeks I received my corrected disc with the \\"R2\\" on the play side and I rushed it ahead of my other disc and I definitely had the WOW effect. I say if you have any questions just call Paramount and they will be glad to help you. I'm glad I did.<br />I just wish the studios are companies that have the rights to release a movie won't rush it to market just to make a sale. As a film enthusiast between SD-DVD and BD-DVD I would prefer the best picture possible along with the best audio possible (Dolby Digital 5.1 / True Dolby / HTS Master audio). We consumers can wait and may be able to pay a little more (Gone With The Wind 70th Anniversary blu-ray collector's edition for example) if the film is released the best way it can be without us having to double are triple did some time in the future.<br />I'm not sure if this belonged in the review section are a forum; but, I just wanted to share my experience.t way it can be without us having to double are triple did some time in the future.

0439023513|1.0|Like other reviewers, I could not wait for this book to come out.  I am not a particular fan of science fiction but \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\" were possibly two of the best books I have read in a long time.  I felt the writer fully pulled me into the world of Panem, and I genuinely cared about all the characters.  I started reading \\"Mockingjay\\" the moment it came in the mail (I pre-ordered it), and was fully engrossed immediately.  Then I suddenly began to realize that the author did not really seem to know how to write this book, and it started to feel incredibly disjointed.  Where in the previous books I felt as if I knew the characters and really liked many of them despite (and maybe because of) their flaws, in this book I began to dislike everyone, including Katniss.  It seems as if the author became confused between the statement she wanted to make (\\"War is wrong no matter what\\"), and good storytelling.  Peeta, Gale, Katniss, Haymitch etc. took on a paper doll quality and I many times became confused as to what was going on.  The book dragged on and then ended in a rush with no insight into why the characters behaved the way they did.  I was particularly disappointed in the portrayal of Peeta.  Where he was a large part of the previous books, he is but a brief part of this book; like he was an actor that asked for too much money so she wrote him out of the plot!    All in all, I felt betrayed by Suzanne Collins.  I wish she would have stayed true to the characters, and given us a book to treasure, a trilogy to read over and over.  Instead, I just want to write my own end to the story.
0971407614|4.0|Great book delivers just what it promises (once you get past the childish military bravado).
0439023513|4.0|When one looks at the wide variety of ratings for this book, he must keep in mind how highly anticipated this installment of the series was.  Each reader of the previous books had his own emotional investment in the story.  However, we really must keep in mind that this is the story Suzanne Collins has chosen to write, not the one we, as readers, would have necessarily liked to read.    I hear a lot of criticism about the romance being shoved into the corner and ignored for a majority of the book.  However, if one reads the first two books again, the romance between Katniss and her two suitors, Gale and Peeta, was never the primary story.  The Hunger Games series is about the effect of corrupt government and war upon the innocent.  And, with that being said, Ms. Collins did a fantastic job in completing the series.    *spoiler alert*  I will say that the scenes in the Capitol with Katniss' squad felt very heavy and difficult to read and understand (some readers felt as if it felt like a video game, and I must agree).  I lost interest during the darkness of that battle.  I had to wonder what the point of all those varied \\"Pods\\" was when they could have just picked the deadliest of them all and used that one.  Also, a certain character's demise in those scenes was so heart wrenching to myself, but barely seemed important to Ms. Collins at that point in the book.  I would have liked a bit more of an emotional narrative when he was pulled down to his death. *end spoiler alert*    As for the rest of the book, it was a fantastic exercise in demonstrating how war changes the individual.  Not a single person came out of this with his/her psyche intact.  We may not like the end result of our characters' personality changes, but that's the reality of life, and makes for a darn good piece of fiction.    By the end of this book, I was depressed and hopeful at the same time.  Now that's the best recommendation an author could ever receive.
B003TEO3EI|5.0|This is an amazing album.  To me this album sounds like a mixture of [[ASIN:B0000561YN Imagination From Otherside]] and [[ASIN:B00000HYXB Nightfall in Middle Earth]].  It is obvious that they spent some money making this album.  The booklet is beautiful with excellent illustrations on each page.  The orchestra they used makes the songs sound even more epic.  If bands are wondering if they should get a real orchestra or just keys all they need to do is listen to the sound on here to know that a true orchestra is the way to go.    This album also has the fast thrashers that we loved from earlier Blind Guardian albums and the epic immersive tracks from the later albums.  Two ballads in the Bard's Song style are included but do not feel like rehashes but songs that build on they style.  The drums in Curse My Name make the song my favorite Blind Guardian ballad yet.    Highly recommended.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|A quietly superb film from Clint Eastwood, Invictus is another genre defying entry, from a director with a long track record of them, that is not quite a sports movie but neither is it a biography of its world famous central character Nelson Mandela.     Anthony Peckham's clever script is nominally about Mandela's support - over fierce objections from his own party - for the hated national Springbok rugby team & how their improbable victory at the 1995 world cup finally overcame the bitter divisions of the apartheid era to unite the country at a point when civil war between blacks & whites looked inevitable.     But what we have here is equally a subtle study in Mandela's brilliant grasp of strategy & leadership (he has his aides test him on the names of the Springboks so that when he meets them for the first time he can greet them like old friends) & his shrewd recognition that unless the black majority can demonstrate forgiveness to a sceptical & suspicious white minority - one that controls the banks, the police & the army - the country is doomed.     Key to this is attracting much needed foreign investment (the eyes of the world are watching anxiously) & when Mandela learns that a billion people will be watching the rugby cup final he instantly grasps the PR significance of this for his country & for the world if the Springboks can win the cup.     Freeman is impressively understated here not only capturing Mandela's physical mannerisms (the hunched shoulders from spending decades in a tiny cell) but also leaving it up to the audience to decide whether his public concern for those he must work with - expressed through a succession of carefully calibrated speeches - is genuine or simply the work of a brilliant tactician shrewdly exploiting his media image as a saint. There are hints, here & there, of Mandela's estrangement from his own family & these touchingly remind us that behind the public image is a man who paid a very high personal price for his actions.A convincingly beefed up Matt Damon is also excellent as the Springbok Captain Francois Piennar. Francois doesn't pretend to understand the politics of the situation but he can intuit immediately that the situation he's in concerns something far greater than just a sports victory as he tries to convince his sceptical team mates. As per Freeman it's delightfully understated acting & it's a very good demonstration of Damon's versatility.     There's also a satisfying parallel storyline to Mandela's efforts which centres on his bodyguards. These guys are perpetually fearful of an assassination attempt & it's a task not made any easier by Mandela's habit of wanting to leave his entourage to go on impromptu walkabouts in the crowds. His security detail are a mixed team of black & whites who on first meeting view each other with barely disguised hostility. Indeed, on their initial encounter the first question out of the mouth of the black guard is 'Have you come to arrest me?'! In the hands of a lesser director & writer this would have descended into cringe-making backslapping & we're-all-brothers-under-the-skin proclamations, but Eastwood is too good a director to fall for this & the slow recognition that both teams are on the same side simply develops organically, without ever seeming forced.     The climactic rugby scenes are satisfyingly crunchy, clearly filmed (there's a refreshing absence of Paul Greengrass-style shaky-cam shots) & the gist of the game is communicated clearly even if the specifics remain obscure. There's also a jaw-dropping scene involving a 747 Jumbo that is one of those outrageous moments so WTF? that it could only have come from real life (& indeed did actually happen).     The stadium sequences depicting thousands of cheering supporters are pretty staggering & demonstrate just how far crowd software has come since Gladiator's famous arena shot. As impressive as that was I always felt there was something not quite right about it but the CG crowds packing Ellis stadium here are completely convincing, indeed overwhelming at times. Invictus is also, I think, superbly edited & it seemed to go by remarkably quickly for a two hour plus movie.     As for Eastwood, he's a directorial marvel avoiding so many of the pitfalls inherent in this kind of material. There's no sense of self- importance about Invictus. The film is epic & yet intimate, if that makes any sense. It wears its themes lightly, as if aware that the material is so strong it doesn't need amping up. Eastwood's understated, unemphatic approach amusingly drives the lazy, the impatient & the immature viewer up the wall but I find his firm, gentle style so stirring it had me welling up with tears on more than one occasion.     Whether it's Francois telling his stunned family he's been invited to tea with Mandela, an absolutely exquisitely judged sequence on the infamous penal colony of Robben Island, where Francois imagines Mandela reciting Invictus in his tiny cell, a blink & you'll miss it moment as a tough white bodyguard hurriedly puts his sunglasses on to hide the fact that he's tearing up at his team having reached the final, or gently underscoring the reconciliation theme by crosscutting the climactic match with a black kid outside the stadium slowly edging closer to a group of white cops listening to the match on their car radio, Eastwood makes this kind of ambitious filmmaking, so littered with obvious booby traps look so bloody easy.     Granted Invictus is unabashedly feel good but there's nothing wrong with that provided it's as well done as it is here. It's a film that leaves you buzzing & although corny to say it - yep - uplifted. Recommended, but do try & catch it on the biggest screen you can.

1416550550|5.0|One of my favorite novels prior to reading The Forgotten Garden was Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. The originality of Kate Morton's book is incredible. The characters were multi-layered and the plot mind-blowing. I was totally immersed in this book and read it twice. My daughter said, \\"why read it again, you know how it ends?\\". I told her, yes, but it is the getting there that makes it worth a second trip.
B001R22TBI|5.0|Great voice. Enjoyable CD. Has become my wife's favorite. Everyone who hears her wants to know more about the CD, about her. Seems to be a hit with everyone.    CD arrived on time and in excellent condition.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|I received my copy of the blu ray complete set a couple of days ago. It came packaged in a very nice outerbox (someone already posted a picture of this already) and the entire set really has a lot of nice heft to it. I particularly liked all the raised texture you can feel all over the box, which is constructed with really high-quality paper. Opening it, on the underside of the lid is an overview map of the island, but locations aren't marked on it ... just as you might see it in the air or something.    Yes, I am giving this entire set five stars. I have invested lots of my time invested in the series over several years watching it, participating in online forums and listening to several podcasts. We talked about the series amongst ourselves at great length at work. I like this series because it was interesting, added a bit of mystery and suspense, action and some fun thrills. I am certainly not going to get into a great debate over the series finale or how disappointed one would be without every single question answered.     If you had questions after the finale ended, well good thing this box set came out, because several things were answered in it. You get some clues in the \\"New Man in Charge\\" on the season 6 features, and you get some others on the box set's exclusive disc that is hidden within the packaging. I spent my entire weekend watching that disc, and I appreciate the series even more now than I did in May when the last episode aired.     This whole box set is a real labor of love from the folks at Lost and ABC. They produced a quality product with SO many extras (I never laughed so hard after watching those Lost Slap Downs on the extras discs) plus hours and hours of official Lost podcasts.     The only thing I couldn't find easily were directions for the Senet game. My husband had to look that up for directions. However we spent several hours yesterday playing the game together and having a good time. He and I plan on doing an entire series rewatch soon. He rarely watches television with me since our tastes differ. I think this set again is worth the five stars because we get to spend lots of time together enjoying it. And that's why LOST was created. To entertain.

142313494X|4.0|Percy Jackson is used to getting in trouble at school and missing details about his surroundings. It's kind of part of the territory when you're dyslexic and have ADHD besides. Then there's the fact that Percy isn't just any twelve-year-old. He's a trouble magnet--which might be how he wound up a private boarding school for troubled kids (his sixth school in as many years).<br /><br />So, really, it probably isn't that surprising when his evil math teacher blames Percy for a fight he didn't even start.<br /><br />What is surprising is when she sprouts wings and tries to kill him on a trip to the Metropolitan Museum to look at Greek and Roman artifacts. And his accidentally vaporizing her with a pen that turned into a sword is a bit of a shock as well.<br /><br />Things only get worse from there.<br /><br />It turns out all of the Greek and Roman myths Percy has been learning about aren't so much myths as real. And kind of angry. And maybe ready to start a war over a suspicious theft.<br /><br />With the help of some unlikely friends, Percy has ten days to find the stolen property, return it, save the world from the wrath of the gods, and figure out where he fits in this whole crazy mess in The Lightning Thief (2005) by Rick Riordan.<br /><br />This book is the first in Riordan's series \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians.\\" With its episodic chapters, snappy narrative voice (courtesy of Percy), and non-stop action, The Lightning Thief is an obvious choice for reluctant readers. Although the story is slow to get to the core of the story (or the Olympians of the series title), the plot does move along at a steady pace that will work for readers of any ilk. The plot's twists and turns (and a surprise ending that fooled this reviewer) are also nice additions to a fun story.<br /><br />On the other hand, readers might wonder how a twelve-year-old who is not a big reader himself or a fan of school will know words like \\"debunct\\" and \\"mournfully\\" and choose to use them in his narration.<br /><br />While some of the mythological figures come across more as caricatures than characters, Riordan does present figures and facts from the ancient Greek (and Roman) mythology in an original way. This might be a New Yorker's point of view, but there is something very fitting about New York City being the portal to Mount Olympus and Los Angeles leading . . . well, elsewhere. Nitpicks aside, The Lightning Thief is an interesting blend of mythology and a fun, exciting story with a lot of humor and heart. A promising start to a clever series.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Temping Fate by Esther Friesner, A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K.

B000R8YC18|3.0|I decided I had to get this movie based on all of the hype of an Oscar winner and a De Niro defining role after hearing that my new boss was named Hinkley.  A co-worker asked if that was the same name as the man who attempted to assassinate Reagan.  After looking up the Reagan assassination attempt and finding out it was Hinckley, rather than Hinkley, I also re-learned about his obsession with Jodie Foster in this movie and how it led to the assassination attempt.  She won (I was going to say earned, but not so much) an Oscar for her role in this movie and it has become a \\"modern classic\\".<br /><br />Overall, the story was nothing more than okay - a loner who is torn between his disgust of the seedier side of New York City and his inability to not be consumed by it.  His \\"relationships\\" with Cybill Shepard (very young and demure here) and Foster are at best superficial and barely explored.  The movie relies on a warped soundtrack that I was tempted to mute and go to subtitles because it was so annoying and the unusual cityscape of New York to propel it forward.  There was virtual no useful dialogue and none of the characters seemed to have any idea what they wanted or why they were where they were.<br /><br />How Foster was even noticed by the Academy is a shock - she couldn't have been on screen for more than 6 minutes.  She was convincing enough as a young prostitute, but not at all compelling or memeroble in my opinion.  De Niro did a fine job as a near-lunatic ex-marine and he looked the part with a chisled body, but his headlong no-holds barred pursuit of Shepard in her office was completely out of character and not believable.  Even more unbelievable was that he would simply not be interested in her later in the movie, given where he was at that particular point in his life.<br /><br />For her part, Shepard was not much more than eye-candy.  She was a necessary plot link between the streets of new York and the good Senator, but in the end served no greater purpose than that.<br /><br />The climactic shoot-out was the only highlight in the movie and that's only if you can stomach some rather brutal imagery that makes you feel like you were there.  During the shootout, I wasn't really sure what I wanted the outcome to be.<br /><br />While I haven't seen all of the \\"special\\" features what I have seen so far was pretty plain vanilla fare with little to no great insight.  \\"It was a movie that we had to make.\\"  \\"We didn't think anyone would watch it.\\"  \\"We really didn't talk much about what it meant, we all just knew.\\"  It sounded as if they were just going through the motions.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'm glad I watched it just to know what it was and to see the original \\"You talkin' to me?\\" scene, but definitely not a top-notch movie in my opinion.limactic shoot-out was the only highlight in the movie and that's only if you can stomach some rather brutal imagery that makes you feel like you were there.

B002POVIMS|2.0|I downloaded this album a week ago because I became absolutely hooked on the single \\"bulletproof\\" after hearing it on the radio half a dozen times. La Roux really epitomizes pop/synth at its finest. The vocals are not the best but adequate enough to get through the arrangements. While the music is immediately catchy and fun to listen to, it does not go the distance in terms of depth, style, and originality. I became bored of the music somewhat quickly. Its a throwback to bands like Erasure but it will never come close to being as good as Erasure.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Received mine today! I am very glad this compilation did not take too long to be available for sale.  I love the way they put this together.  It is a complete collection that any LOST fan will love.  The packaging is excellent and well made.  I don't see myself playing with the game any time soon but I think the blue light is cool.  I am going to start my marathon this weekend.  I have already watched all the new features on the final disc.  As a LOST fan who didn't want it to end, but enjoyed it all, I was looking forward to this complete set for a while, with the bonus features.  I was only disappointed in the bonus 'episode': The New Man in Charge.  I was expecting it to be a bit longer and more informative; I liked what they gave us in it, but wish there was more.  Overall though, no true lost fan will be disappointed in buying this!

0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay, the final book in this trilogy, takes its name from the symbol Katniss has become, the symbol of resistance to the unjust authority of the Capitol and of President Snow. The Mockingjay is a bird genetically engineered by the Capitol to spy on the rebels-it can learn anything said and repeat it. The birds became useless as soon as their purpose was learned, but hold symbolic value as the Capitol's failure-as does Katniss.    The book is hard to put down. Each page draws you into the next. The writing is flawless and nuanced, but this is still a hard, hard book. Katniss begins the book emotionally torn and lost, walking through the ashes of her home and blaming herself for the deaths of the thousands in it, the deaths of so many who loved her or tried to help her . . . and those she had to kill in order to survive. And yet her family survived and Gale survived. Shockingly, the Capitol airs an interview with Peeta. Peeta survived and seems to have turned, to be trying to stop the fighting.    Katniss is a survivor. She is surrounded by users, by people for whom personal ambitions or the bright cause for which they fight is more important than the lives or the pain of other human beings. And they all want to use her, but Katness still cares. She has a fierce loyalty to those she loves and her hatred for those who destroyed her district and so many she cared for burns through the pages. Again and again as she reaches out to people or they to her, they are killed brutally and ruthlessly. Katniss becomes distant, dissociated. She cannot care whether she lives or dies, but there are still others who do, and so do we.    This is really a book for an older young adult. While the level of violence and pain in the book is high, we are never left with the feeling that killing is glorified or even that ends justify means. The people who die here are people, not ciphers. It is a worthwhile book, but it is one that should be talked about.    [...]
030726999X|4.0|This is the third installment of the trilogy,and I am getting a little burned out,on Sweden and Stockholm. The first two books were unable to put down,but I'm only 150 pages into the third and it will get better and peak my interest totally soon. Stieg Larsson was a great writer and I wish he were still around to keep tantalizing us with new stories. I also ordered the movies(SwedishVersions) out on dvd and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a great movie.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I've read the books, and despite all the hype decided to watch New Moon and Eclipse this week. I was really impressed with Eclipse. What the first two movies lacked was direction, in each scene of Eclipse the actors understand their motivation and we get a lot of true emotion. The movie is also very beautiful, as it should be. Every time I've visited the Peninsula I've been blown away by its beauty.    I thought this was Robert Pattinson's best film, he revealed Edward's vulnerability and heart. This is a man who has faced losing the woman he loves and now only wants what is best for her. He seems like the bad boy, and yet he won't let Bella go too far without marrying him!     Taylor Lautner has been very believable in both New Moon and Eclipse, he's the loyal nice guy that you would take home to your parents and buy a house with. In Eclipse he was raw emotion without going over the top. He appears briefly in the first movie Twilight, and is really sweet. Again this is the kind of boyfriend you want ladies!      Kristen Stewart plays Bella, and for me she is what a lot of us were as teenagers: depressed, lacking self confidence and unaware of how beautiful we are. Kristen has the hardest role, being torn between two men she loves in different ways. With all of their appeal, how could you decide? Why would you want to choose?
B003S6T62Q|5.0|The video was great I can watch it over and over again!... Joe is on his A game, his performances are always on point and he is one of the best R&B singers around.

B0034G4OYU|5.0|Not much to add that hasn't already been written in the other reviews.  The only bad thing was the running time but the ticket price was not that of other Imax 3D shows so that was slightly offset.  I was in awe and can't figure out how the audience was able to navigate through space via the Hubble telescope images.  Highly entertaining and makes you feel humble by the size of what is out there.
0439023483|5.0|I got this book for my 13 y/o son and I love it just as much as he does. The story is great and filled with thought provoking situations/themes. I fell in love with the main characters and can't wait until I read the next book. There is some tough reading. Kids are placed in an arena and forced to fight to the death until there is one person left. My son and I had many talks about other countries where civil war is a everyday occurrence.

0439023513|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins comes to a bloody end with Mockingjay, the series' final volumes. (I reviewed the first two volumes here and here.)<br /><br />The story takes place in North America, sometime in the future. A civil war between the Capitol and its thirteen districts resulted in the annihilation of District 13 and the imposition of the Hunger Games on the remaining twelve. For seventy-five years, each district has sent one girl and one boy between the ages of 12 and 18 to kill or be killed in the arena.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark represent District 12. At the end of that year's game, Katniss and Peeta are the final contestants. Instead of killing one another, however, they deliver a choice to the Capitol: either both live or both kill themselves.<br /><br />Catching Fire picks up where The Hunger Games ends. The Capitol lets Katniss and Peeta live. Knowing, however, that Katniss (especially) is a threat to the Capitol's political interests, they inaugurate a new hunger game, where previous victors fight one another. At the end of the book, a rebellion breaks out, with Katniss being rescued by forces from the long-thought-annihilated District 13 and Peeta being held captive and tortured by the Capitol.<br /><br />Mockingjay begins several weeks after the end of Catching Fire. Katniss is recovering from her wounds, when District 13's leader, President Coin, recruits her to serve as the face of the rebellion against the Capitol. The rebellion rescues Peeta, who has been tortured and brainwashed, but in the process of the fight, Katniss learns that neither President Coin nor District 13 are on the side of the angels.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a very dark and violent book, especially to be produced by Scholastic for the \\"young adult\\" market, i.e., teenagers. It doesn't glamorize war. Indeed, it verges on moral equivalence. But it does raise profound questions about nationalism, war, terrorism, and moral choice.<br /><br />My primary criterion for good fiction is whether I can put it down once I've started to read it. Starting with The Hunger Games, I couldn't put this book down, and I could barely wait for the next book of the series to be published. Now that the series is over, I'm looking forward to Suzanne Collins's next series.iction is whether I can put it down once I've started to read it.

0385532458|1.0|I love John Grisham's books, but I believe the only reason this book was published is because John Grisham wrote it. If anyone else wrote this book it would not have been published. The stories Blood Drive, Fetching Raymond, Fish Files, Michael's Room, and Funny Boy I did not like. Blood Drive and Fetching Raymond are the first two stories in the book and if you must read it I suggest skipping these two. The two stories I found interesting were Casino and Quiet Haven, but the rest of the book was a chore to read.

1401923119|5.0|Very interesting reading throughout.    A great review of cellular biology for people like me that haven't given in a second thought since high school. (first several chapters)    Thought provoking conclusions as to how our own thoughts actually influence our lives. We all know from experience that bad thoughts breed more bad thoughts and positive thinking can help bring about great changes in our lives.    I recommend this book very much.
0143118420|1.0|I love to read almost anything, but this book just is not good.  I had no idea I would be reading about someone's depression.  I too, went through a divorce.  But this is just ridiculous.  Get over it already.  I guess I'm only reviewing the 'eat' section, since I could not get through it to make it to the other sections.  I love Julia Roberts so I thought the book might be good.  After trying to read it, I don't even want to see the movie.
B003JTHETY|2.0|My rating for this is based on the extra content that was supposedly part of the mission edition.  Like others have mention, what was expected was a second disk with bonus content, or at least an enhanced CD.    As far as the music goes, it great Maiden, not as good as Number of the Beast, Powerslave, Fear of the Dark, etc. but as good as A Matter of Life and Death.  A solid 4 stars for the album itself.    Again like other have gone into detail about, the bonus content is web based and required the CD to be in the drive to unlock it.  My feeling is that I payed extra to own the bonus material not to borrow it from a poorly designed website that will go away in a few years.    Now why do I say poorly designed website?  The content is actually organized well and is ok.  It's poorly designed as it uses a custom plugin from the hosting company that doesn't run in many browsers.  Linux isn't supported at all, Windows requires you to use Internet Explorer and possible Firefox if you don't run the usual array of popup and ad blockers.  Yes it doesn't work with Safari or Chrome on the PC.  On the mac the website says No IE but yes to Safari.    And of course none of this is mentioned on the package when you buy it.  All that is mentioned is the website to go to.    Save your money and buy the standard edition.  The mission edition isn't worth the extra few bucks.
1416589473|5.0|Excellent book, really brings the world of Guild Wars to life. A required read for any Guild Wars fans, or anyone planning to buy Guild Wars 2, and especially for those who fall into both categories. I was not able to put it down once I started reading.  My only real complaint is the lack of magic; I only remember one spellcaster in the whole book. But I'm guessing that was because the Guild Wars 2 team didn't want to give away too much about the new game, so early. Other than that, great read. Fits the history--the events between Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2--neatly into the dialogue in a believable way.  Read it.

B003W5C0VM|5.0|Pure dirty Exile-era Stones.  Serious about the music.  If you need to learn what all the fuss is about and have only witnessed later concert films (the inferior \\"We're the Stones You Should Love Us Just Because\\" vibe of \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\"), this document sets the record straight.<br /><br />The Stones are working hard at this show, looking as if they have something to prove.  And prove it they do.  It's 1972 and there is still an element of danger in the air for this band. They're deadly serious and are leaning into these numbers.  Mick Taylor--the sequel to Brian Jones and the prequel to Ron Wood--stands stock still and delivers those chilling licks that made Exile on Main Street legendary.  Heck, even good ole honorary Stone Nicky Hopkins is on board for some rollicking piano fills.<br /><br />This show just builds and builds.  By the time they crash head on into Midnight Rambler you feel as if there's no other rock 'n' roll band.<br /><br />And there IS no other rock 'n' roll band.  THIS is the Stones.  You SHOULD love them. Because of THIS.

B00006DEF9|5.0|I find nothing not to love about this determinedly unpretentious musical comedy from MGM. Sure, it's hammy. Yes, the \\"Broadway Melody\\" goes on too long, especially the out-of-place ballet that seems nothing more than an ego trip for Gene Kelly. Nobody in this movie is any great shakes as a singer. The songs are random and don't advance the story. Still, the comedy bubbles along nicely in the Hollywood-transitions-to-sound plot. Jean Hagen as the shrill silent beauty Lina Lamont and Cyd Charisse as the emerald-clad femme fatale in a nightclub keep me in stitches. Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly dance up a storm in their early career montage and \\"Moses Supposes\\" numbers. Newcomer Debbie Reynolds holds her own in the relentless \\"Good Morning.\\" Somebody's having an acid-trip good time with the colors and costumes, especially in the \\"Beautiful Girls\\" sequence, which borrows heavily from Busby Berkeley's 30s-era choreography at Warner Brothers (\\"Big Lebowski\\" fans take notice). And of course there's the title song and dance. Plenty of catchy popular songs to carry around in your head for the next several days, plenty of giggles and belly laughs, and some of the best dance you'll ever see on film. Pop it in your DVD player on a cloudy day and, no matter how tone deaf you are, you'll be singing in the rain too.
B003HFFVDQ|5.0|This album is so great...get it..listen to it in a room with speakers on full (no headphones)..The songs are very Exit Planet Dust-ish.     I would place this album in their top three.     It doesnt have any slow songs (like Asleep from Day, for example)..its all upbeat or soundscape-ish    GREAT arena music..

0307474712|4.0|I love a book with a good gimmick, and One Day has a great one: the story takes place on the same day over the course of 20 years. Each year, we check in with the two protagonists--Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley--on July 15 (which, as Dex tells Em is St. Swithin's Day) and see how their lives and relationship are developing.<br /><br />The thing with gimmicks, though, is that an author might come up with a great gimmick but not be able to execute it effectively. I'm pleased to report that David Nicholls writes a book that lives up to (and even exceeds) his gimmick.<br /><br />The easiest way to describe One Day is as a \\"literary version of When Harry Met Sally\\" ... if Harry was a handsome TV personality with a drinking problem and Sally was a plain-looking, bookish nerd and the story went on for a few year after the happy ending. The real comparison, of course, is that Dex and Em are meant for each other (the reader knows it, Em sometimes knows it, Dex seems blissfully unaware of it) but--for one reason or another--keep missing each other because life (jobs, relationships, success) constantly gets in the way. Seeing their friendship and lives develop over the course of the book was a true pleasure. I thought Nicholls did a brilliant job of handling the \\"one day\\" check-in each year without making it seemed forced. The story develops naturally, and we get invested in Dex and Em and their relationship ... so much so that I was stunned when Nicholls pulled the rug out from under me towards the end.<br /><br />Nicholl's writing feels genuine whether he is writing from Emma or Dexter's point of view. There are quite a few amusing scenes that had me cracking up, but Nicholls provides emotional heft as well. When reading, I found myself utterly absorbed, and I was always wondering where the next July 15 would find Dex and Em and what they would be doing.<br /><br />The only real quibble I had with the book is that I wish Nicholls hadn't chosen to give Dex and Em such \\"glamorous\\" careers at various points. I didn't think the book needed it to \\"goose\\" up the drama/comedy, but it is a minor complaint.<br /><br />If what I've written so far hasn't convinced you to check this book out yet, how about a few excerpts?<br /><br />EXCERPT: Emma on being a writer: Sometimes, when it's going badly, she wonders if what she believes to be a love of the written word is really just a fetish for stationery. The true writer, the born writer, will scribble words on scraps of litter, the back of a bus tickets, on the wall of a cell. Emma is lost on anything less than 120gsm.<br /><br />EXCERPT: Emma on being a writer (again): ... but she was discovering once again that reading and writing were not the same - you couldn't just soak it up then squeeze it out again. She found herself unable to think of a name for her detective, let alone a cohesive original plot, and even her pseudonym was poor: Emma T. Wilde?<br /><br />EXCERPT: Dexter caring for his baby daughter: How much longer until she can speak? A year? Eighteen months? It's insane, an absurd design error, this refusal to master speech just when it's needed most. They should come out talking. Not conversation, not repartee, just basic practical information. Father, I have wind. This activity centre leaves me jaded. I am colicky.<br /><br />EXCERPT: Emma thinking about her friends: What has happened to her friends? They used to be funny and fun-loving, gregarious and interesting, but far too many evenings have been spent like this with pasty, irritable hollow-eyed couples in smelly rooms, expressing wonder that baby is getting bigger with time, rather than smaller. She is tired of squealing in delight when she sees a baby crawl, as if this was a completely unexpected development, this `crawling'. What were they expecting, flight?<br /><br />My Final Recommendation<br /><br />This deliciously fun and engaging story of a relationship developing over the course of 20 years is told in a \\"gimmicky\\" fashion(we check in with the main characters on the same day throughout the book) but transcends the novelty aspect to be a heartfelt, genuine, realistic look at modern life and relationships. An engrossing, fast read that will tickle your funny bone and touch your heart. (How much did that just sound like a blurb on the back of a book jacket? Perhaps I'm turning into a \\"real\\" book reviewer!)<br /><br />Note: This book is already being made into a movie starring Anne Hathaway as Emma and  Jim Sturgess as Dexter.s the novelty aspect to be a heartfelt, genuine, realistic look at modern life and relationships.

1556438850|5.0|With the increasing number of training programs for yoga teachers and the proliferation of yoga studios, many people, and especially yoga students, are demanding higher standards from their yoga teachers. There have been many debates as to whether or not it is advisable to have the yoga profession, and particularly the training of teachers, regulated.  In 2007, the Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that in the previous three years, around 13,000 Americans suffered yoga-related injuries as reported by doctors' offices and emergency rooms.  Many injuries are the result of teaching practices from incompetent teachers. Many teachers have not received proper training or do not have any certification; it is estimated that among the 70,000 yoga teachers in the United States, only three quarters have any sort of certification. Furthermore, while there are strict training programs that demand a minimum of 200 hours of training, others provide a diploma after a few days of exposure, or just by e-mail.    In the middle of such a situation, the arrival of Mark Stephens' book is more than a blessing. The author has trained more than 700 yoga teachers and is the Director of the Teacher Training Program at Santa Cruz Yoga (CA). He has studied various yoga styles (Iyengar, Ashtanga Vinyasa, yoga therapy, and Vinyasa Flow) and is well versed in yoga history and philosophy. The book includes various practical tables for easy consultation, numerous photographs, a rich bibliography, a very helpful list of yoga teaching resources (yoga websites, yoga associations, and institutes and research centers), a comprehensive list of yoga poses, and a summary of the yoga sequences followed by six major yoga schools.     The first four chapters present the roots of modern yoga and the physiological and mental components of yoga practices. Other chapters deal with teaching yoga poses, breathing techniques and meditation.  Three excellent chapters (5, 6 and 10) give useful guidelines andtips for yoga teaching, such as options in conducting a class, the teacher's language and voice, the relationship between teacher and student (including how to deal with feelings of attraction), the use of props and music, how to organize the sequencing of a class, and many other critical subjects. In these chapters, Stephens shares with the readers the lessons he learned as a seasoned teacher. He properly illustrates his instructions with the philosophical foundations of yoga, based mainly on Patanjali's almost two-thousand year old Yoga Sutras.     Inspired by the idea that in yoga, like in travelling, what is important is the journey, not the destination, Stephens affirms, \\"Yoga is not a practice of attainment; it is an unending process of self-discovery and self-transformation,\\" and teachers are just facilitators and guides. Through the entire book, he is guided by the idea that the role of the yoga teacher is to assist in the discovery of the inner teacher that all of us have inside ourselves; this is indeed the Socratic approach to teach. He also insists on the beneficial powers of adaptation and innovation in teaching yoga to better respond to the needs of every student. The last chapter is dedicated to the yoga profession; here, Stephens mentions some difficult topics such as regulations, teachers' fees, liability insurance, teacher's training and certification, how to start teaching as an apprentice, and other interesting subjects. Although he does not provide his personal views on many of these points, he raises them and alerts us to give proper consideration to them.     This is an excellent book, full of wisdom and information for anyone interested in yoga practice or in teaching. Nevertheless, the book could be improved by taking care of some caveats. It is desirable that in a revised edition the index would incorporate all the authors, as well as the yoga poses mentioned in the text. The name of the poses should appear with both the Sanskrit and English names.

A high-powered lobbyists with plenty of secrets is given a conditional pardon by the outgoing President of the US of A. He is then on the run, with plenty of people out to kill him or, at the very least, double-cross him. He is isolated and can trust nobody.    In northern Italy, he lives a precarious life for a couple of months. After that? Well, you'll just have to read the book.    I can promise you heaps of excitement and tension in abundance.    Very much recommended to all of my friends.

0802714544|5.0|This classic tale of espionage during the Cold War certainly lived up to its billing.  Le Carre paints a vivid picture of Cold War Europe and the various operatives doing their best to usher forward the \\"end of history\\" and those opposed to the march of communism.  The book examines the moral trade-offs and ambiguities of the spy business as well as the complexities of signaling and communication in a world where everyone has an incentive to lie and no one can be trusted.  All in all, a thrilling story.
0920668372|1.0|The little boy is throwing toilet paper around and flushing his mother's watch down the toilet. The teenager seems ignorant and tracks mud throughout the house.     I'm sorry, these are not suggestions I want to give to my child. The sentiment of loving the child forever no matter what is cute, but it's creepy the way the mother goes about expressing her love for her child.     And the end of the book? Well, I know reality is good to teach and we'll all die someday, but the implications of the mother dying after being too sick to talk/sing are very dramatic take a potentially sentimental story to a very sad level. I recieved this book as a gift and it is being donated to goodwill. Perhaps someone else will find the value in it.
0385528752|4.0|Another great book from the Heath brothers.  Tackling the difficult subject of change, the Heath's present a readable exposition on how to alter behavior in even the most resistant environments.  They provide a three-part framework for creating change: 1) direct people's rational instincts 2) motivate people through their emotions 3) shape the structure and environment to make it easier for people to comply with the desired behavior.  What I like about the book is that they pay attention to each of these three elements equally.  They ignore the false dichotomies of rational vs. emotional decision-making and individual vs. structural causation, instead offering a balanced framework that acknowledges the combined impact of these different factors on human action.  I especially like their methodological choice to highlight \\"bright spots\\" or \\"positive deviants\\" in order to determine what actions and strategies should be pursued to solve problems (akin to the use of the most-likely, least-likely method in qualitative analysis).  My one issue is with the lack of rigor regarding the framework.  In their first book, Made to Stick, the Heath's inductively determined the factors that lead to message/idea retention.  In Switch, there does not appear to be a pre- or post-analysis study linking their framework to change.  We are left with a number of (admittedly convincing) anecdotes rather than a fuller validation of their proposed solution.  Overall, Switch is a great read and resource for anyone trying to create change in a settled environment.

0321701763|5.0|Speaking as an Adobe Certified Photoshop Instructor, I think the Photoshop CS5 book is terrific. If you don't understand workspaces, selections and layers, you will not get very far in Photoshop. This book does an excellent job of teaching the basics, and then allows you to continue on to learn masking, working with type, compositing and more. Sure, there are some areas that could use a little more explanation, but that's why we choose to use them in our online Photoshop classes. When you combine this book (or any of the Classroom in a Book titles) with an experienced instructor, there are simply no better materials out there. I've been using the series since I started teaching Photoshop version 3, and my students have always loved the exercises and given very high ratings to the books. So far, Adobe Photoshop CS5 Classroom in a Book has been very well received by our students at Rocky Mountain Training.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I haven't finished this book yet but so far I like it. However, I prefer the first two books. This one seems to be a bit too depressing, there is just too much wrong and it brings the reader down into despair, althought I supose that is how the main character, Katniss, feels. The last two books of the Hunger Games contained a great deal of hardship, but Collins still managed to lighten the mood, and create an engrossing read. The third book on the other hand, feels as though it has lost this necessary buoyancy. I understand that the book is in the midsts of war but the Hunger Games weren't much better as far as the level of hardship goes.<br />Hopefully by the end of the book I will have changed my mind...

B00004W50T|4.0|While Music From Big Pink is an exceptional album, the one thing it lacks happens to be the one thing I like most about the Band- their roots rock style.    Most of the songs on here are mellow to the point of borderline balladry.  \\"Tears of Rage\\" and \\"Lonesome Suzie\\" are perfect examples of exceptionally mellow tunes.  While extremely melodic and effective in coming close to bringing me to tears in a few spots thanks to some amazing range in the lead singers voice, it's a *tad* disappointing that the album includes a couple other songs in similar style (the smash hit \\"The Weight\\" being another obvious example).  These are the kind of songs that we only need one or two per album- not four or five.      Also, maybe it's just me, but \\"Tears of Rage\\" sounds like a *major* influence for George Harrison's \\"Beware of Darkness\\".  Both songs feel like they're written almost exactly the same way.    However the album does have its share of excellent rockers as well.  \\"To Kingdom Come\\" excels in a super melodic display of guitar soloing, and this version of \\"Chest Fever\\" defeats all other versions (especially the instrumental version from Sugarloaf's debut) because of its incredibly catchy vocal melody and that organ (or keyboard?) solo in the middle.  Terrific stuff.    I don't know what to think about a song like \\"In a Station\\".  It's melodic, yes, but it fails to really grab me and feels somewhat dated (and honestly reminds me of circus music a little bit).  I understand the Band is an underrated experimental band that occasionally explores such adventurous territory, so I'll give it a free pass.    I can definitely see why everyone makes a fuss about Music From Big Pink, but the Band's next three albums are honestly a bit better.  Yes, even Cahoots is growing on me more with each passing day and has the potential to surpass this album in the listenability department.      Still, Music From Big Pink is a highly melodic, emotionally charged effort that's just as rewarding as most of the reviews make it seem.  Just don't expect an instant classic or the very best album the Band has to offer.

B000000OAL|4.0|October 1973........  I remember when the music director at Central Michigan University's student radio station handed me a promo copy of a newly released album from a new group called \\"Queen\\".  The very first time I heard \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" I loved it. Then I flipped the album over to side two and played \\"Liar\\". \\"Oh....my....God!!!\\" was my comment to the music director of WCHP, Mt.Pleasant.  \\"I've never heard ANYTHING  like this before.....\\"  I'm so glad I heard the very beginning of Queen's adventure. Nearly 40 years later, I still smile when I think about that memory.

0439023513|2.0|I came onto Amazon's reviews in order to find out if I was the only one who felt so disappointed with this third book, and lo and behold! I am far from alone.<br /><br />Like everyone else here, I loved the first two books and eagerly awaited the release of Mockingjay. I knew within the first 50 to 100 pages that it was going to be a big snoozefest, which is a surprising term to use for a book that is relentless, fast-paced action from beginning to end, but somehow Collins pulls it off.<br /><br />I felt not only disappointed but actively ANNOYED. I intensely dislike when books and films veer into plot developments that are completely unrealistic and silly. Are we really supposed to believe that the government of District 13 is going to let a teenage girl lead a band of elite soldiers into the front lines of a war? Come ON!<br /><br />The hallmark of bad writing is when the author tries to live vicariously through her larger-than-life heroine. Thus the heroine, in this case Katniss, is treated like a superhero throughout the book. She's strong, fearless, sexy, powerful, she has two men in love with her, she can hold her own in a roomful of high-level government officials and get them to do her bidding... Are we really supposed to believe that a teenager is on equal footing with the leaders of 13? That she can dialogue with people much older and wiser than she is and that they take her completely seriously? PLEASE!<br /><br />I find it absurd that, over and over again, Katniss and Gale, who are CHILDREN! are called into these high-level meetings with the leaders of 13 and are expected to take active roles in the planning of how to overthrow the Capitol. This superhero treatment of the \\"Mockingjay\\" just made me roll my eyes. Is it ever the case in wartime that teenagers are given such star status and made room for at the central command table? Um, I don't think so.<br /><br />The hallmark of good writing is characters who are human - not exceedingly good-looking or sexy, not possessing superb skills or strength that awes the reader with how badass they are, like comic book heros. What makes these types of characters so compelling is their fragile humanity - we see ourselves in them. This is what separates writers like Dostoyevsky and Austen from writers like John Grisham (the main character in his famous book The Firm, Mitch McDeere, is a classic example of what I am talking about). Honestly, I got tired of hearing over and over again what a badass Katniss is, and how \\"she doesn't realize the powerful effect she has on people.\\" Everybody's just IN LOVE with Katniss, and if they're not (like Coin) it's because they're afraid of or intimidated by her. I found this to be increasingly tiresome. None of the other winners of the Hunger Games are treated like rock stars.<br /><br />Ironically, Collins does not pull the \\"look at what a badass my heroine is\\" in the first two books. We love Katniss because she is a normal teenage girl, and we can relate to her. She is a relatable, sympathetic character. Not so in Mockingjay.<br /><br />This third and final book reads like the script of a fast-paced action movie. It's all action, no heart. Like other reviewers, I got the strong sense that Collins was in a hurry to bang this out. She doesn't take time with character development. There is little dialogue. It's just all command-room scenes and battle sequences. The pace is so quick that it's sometimes difficult to figure out where you are and what exactly is happening. One page a bomb goes off! Bam! Somebody important is dead. The next page they're confronting a mutt or some evil arena device! Oh no! Another one bites the dust. Page after page of this, interspersed with worship and reverence of Katniss from the others when she's not off being a rebellious teenager and asserting her independence.<br /><br />Katniss comes off in this book (to me) as brittle and petulant. And I thought the wrap-up with Gale was just sloppy. Okay, so we get thatKatniss can only choose one. Personally I thought she would choose Gale, but whatever, Peeta's a good guy. I assumed one of them was going to have to die in order for this conflict to resolve itself. Instead Collins takes this very strange and cowardly exit by sloppily trying to demonize Gale thru association with Prim's death, robbing us of a goodbye between he and Katniss, and then having him pop up, for no apparent reason, with some cushy job in District 2. How lame. Gale was one of the more interesting characters in the series. What a disappointing wrap-up for him!se Gale, but whatever, Peeta's a good guy.

B001C4AFOY|4.0|The Young Victoria tells the story of Queen Victoria in the first years of her reign and just before she took the throne.  This is a unique vantage point as many past stories have focused on her as an older woman, mourning the loss of Prince Albert.  While this is primarily a love story, it shows how  both Victoria and Albert became lovers as well as co-rulers of Great Britain.     Granted this is not designed to be a documentary, such events as Albert being shot by a would be assassin never actually happened, but what is important is that the relationship between Victoria and Albert became one of true partnership and the closeness the two felt for each other becomes obvious and makes the pain felt in some films such as Mrs. Brown seem so much stronger.     This is a very good movie. It features great acting, wonderful writing and a true understanding of what life was like for Victoria growing up.  I would strongly recommend this to anyone.

0307266303|5.0|Once upon a workout dreary, while I trotted, weak and weary,  over many quaint and furious heel-strike, feet now throbbing sore,  while I stumbled, nearly bumbled, suddenly there came a stabbing,  as of someone cruelly stabbing, stabbing at my insole's door.  \\"Tis an odd pebble,\\" I muttered, \\"stabbing at my insole's door-  only this, and nothing more.\\"    Ah, distinctly t'was but likely, from the dark pits of my psyche  as each separate worn out Nike, wrought its mark on arches sore.  Lo, though I felt idiotic; - vainly I implored my new orthotic-  mend my arches, end my sorrow- sorrow for my poor foot's core  For the rare and radiant arch once named within this biped's core-  nameless here for evermore.    And with painful step uncertain, pulled aside my mental curtain  Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,  \\"'Tis some pebble entreating entrance at my poor foot's core-  Some odd pebble entreating entrance at my poor foot's core; -  This it is, and nothing more.\\"    Presently the pain grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  \\"oww,\\" said I, \\"You pebble, though small have made running such a chore  And as I run my strength sapping, and so quickly you came rapping,  And so forcefully you came tapping, tapping at my poor foot's core,  That I scarce was sure I felt you\\"- here I un-shod the poor core,  empty there, and nothing more.    Deep into that Nike peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no runner ever dared to dream before;  But the silence was unbroken, and the emptiness gave no token  The only word there spoken was to this biped's unshod core  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back, \\"ouch- foot is sore\\"  merely this, and nothing more.    Back into the Nike turning, all my joints within me burning,  Soon again I felt a tapping somewhat harder than before.  \\"Surely,\\" said I, \\"surely that is something in my orthotics:  Let me see,then what therat is, and this mystery explore -  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -  'Tis a poor fit and nothing more.\\"    Now I stood and flung the shod, though not far, it landed whence I trod,  Now stood I, bare and stately, looking on pale feet once sore  Not the least pain in my feet; they smiled back as to entreat  Now set freed and perched below me was my pale white core  Perched in dust and now unshod there was my pale white core  Perched and bare, sore no more    Then this bony foot beguiling my sad frowning into smiling  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.  \\"Though thy form art shaped and true, thou,\\" I said, \\"art sure no shoe,  Ghastly grim and ancient foot wandering from the Nike shore -  Shouldn't I shod you to protect you and your fallen core  Quoth my foot, \\"Nevermore.\\"    Much I marveled this ungainly foot to hear discourse so plainly,  Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  Ever yet was blest with seeing naked foot in dust to adore -  Foot or toe upon the dirty brown dust now below me, that I now adore,  And now to shod \\"Nevermore.\\"    Now my foot, standing lonely in the dirty dust, spoke only  That one word, as if its soul in that one word it did outpour.  Nothing further then it uttered- no step had it stuttered-  Till I scarcely more than muttered, \\"other shoes I've tried before-  On the morrow you will pain me, same as shoes have left me sore.\\"  Then my foot said, \\"Nevermore.\\"    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  \\"Doubtless,\\" said I, \\"what foot utters is its only stock and store,  Caught from some cruel Nike master whom unmerciful Disaster  Followed fast and followed faster till its steps turned arches sore-  Till the dirges of its Hope when shoes turned arches sore-   Cried' Never - nevermore'.\\"    But the bare foot still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,  Hastily found I seat next to my dearfeet, looked at arches once held sore;  Then upon the dirt road sinking, I betook my feet though stinking  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this fallen arch often sore  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and fallen arch often sore  Meant in croaking \\"Nevermore.\\"    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing  To the foot whose fiery soles now burned into my bosom's core;  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining  On the dirt road dusty lining that the bright sunlight gloated o'er  But whose dusty dirty lining with the sunlight gloating o'er,  shoes shall wear, ah, nevermore!    Then me thought my stride grew lighter, like footwork of a prize fighter  Stride like Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the dusted floor,  \\"Doh!,\\" I cried, \\"thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he hath sent thee  Respite - respite, delight, from thy memories of foot once sore  Quaff, oh quaff this kind respite, but won't the foot again become sore?\\"  Quoth my foot, \\"Nevermore.\\"    \\"Barefoot!\\" said I, \\"how very odd! - better still than shoes of devil! -  Whether Nike sent, or over-pronation caused thee foot to sore,  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this dusty path enchanted -  On this sole by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore -  Is there - is there relief by shoe to be had? - tell me - tell me, I implore!\\"  Quoth my foot, \\"Nevermore.\\"    \\"Barefoot!\\" said I, \\"how very odd! - better still than shoes of devil! -  Whether Nike sent, or over-pronation caused thee foot to sore,  Tell this soul with fit orthotic, makes me run as though robotic,   Shall mine foot have pain thought chronic and remain ever sore?  Clasp arch fallen and broken, which has been forever sore?  Quoth my foot, \\"Nevermore.\\"    \\"To you oh shoe this word in parting, shoe or fiend,\\" I shrieked, upstarting -  \\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!  Leave no black swoosh as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!  Leave arches to be unbroken!- quit thepain that makes me sore!  Take thy print from out my heart, and take thy form from off my floor!\\"  Quoth my foot, \\"Nevermore.\\"    And the shoe, never fitting, still is sitting, still is sitting  In the pallid dust of the trail just where my once shod feet were sore;  And the Nikes have all the seeming of a demon that is dreaming,  And the moonlight o'er them streaming throws its shadow on the floor;  And my sole from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor  Shall be lifted - Evermore!
0525423842|4.0|My 11-year old son and I are reading this book together at night before bed.  We are just about to begin chapter 12 and we both love it.  We are hopeful that there will soon be a Theo Boone series by Grisham, but until then, we will continue on, eagerly anticipating the outcome of this trial.  So glad to see Grisham tapping into the younger generation!!
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Silent hill is a movie based off a game series. Most of the time this results in a really bad movie, however silent hill did a fair job. If you are looking for action, then this movie isn't for you. There is a lot of blood and suspense. What makes this movie good though, is the art behind the story. The movie is much better from an interpretative point of view. The movie and artwork speaks about the dangers of extremism, fear, hatred, and staying silent when someone else is getting hurt. It does an excellent job of taking those emotions and displaying them on screen.
0060557818|5.0|I had heard of Neil Gaiman from a friend and finally decided to give his works a try, starting with Neverwhere. I found out from my local used bookseller that the television series came first and then the author wrote the book based upon the min-series.    Neverwhere is a highly captivating story that takes place above and below the London streets. The story's protagonist, Richard Mayhew, unwittingly becomes involved in this underworld network after he helps a young girl, named Door, whom he found injured and bleeding in the London Underground. Richard's good samaritan deed plunges him into a darkly, disturbing world below the streets of London as to his dismay, he ceases to exist in the London above inasmuch as no one above remembers him. Soon Richard joins Door in a quest through the shadowy and dangerous London below to help her find who murdered her family.    This wonderful novel has intrigue, mystery, and scary villains but it is the richly drawn characters that make this story exceptional. I found Gaiman's world to be fascinating, nightmarish, comic, and realistic. Very highly recommended.
B000002OX7|4.0|This kind of rock never truly resonated with me for some reason. When I was younger I would have thought it was too old, and now I tend to go after stuff that's a bit less traditional in some way. Still, I can't deny that this is a good album. Everybody in the band knows what they're doing with their given instrument, it just sounds so big, the use of synthesizers is really groundbreaking, and of the half dozen Who songs I could name you before I listened to it, four of them are here. Just a really important, and more importantly enjoyable album. The CD comes with seven extra tracks, demos or alternate versions of songs that weren't released until later or ever, although I found that the album flowed better when I didn't listen to them. You never want a band to wear out its welcome before the disc stops spinning, but if you take the oddities on their own, they're mostly pretty good, if a bit jammier than the normal album songs.    The Who played a factor in the development of so-called \\"arena rock\\", and the first and last tracks on the album proper are pretty much built for that. \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" are just huge songs, with extended synth breakdowns, big choruses, and they just sound totally loud. \\"Bargain\\" is less anthemic, though just as solid a rock song. \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" is another famous one, starting out kind of mopey, but it ends up kicking a lot of butt too. The five songs sandwiched in between those four are less well known, but also entertaining. They tend to at least have singable choruses, and \\"The Song Is Over\\" is one of the more complex and interesting on the whole record. The songs on this album came out of a wildly ambitious idea by guitarist Pete Townshend that ultimately was never realized in its original form, involving live music creation, crowd participation, and a film. Compared to the vision of Lifehouse, Who's Next seems almost tame in comparison. But that doesn't prevent it from still being a good rock album, and one that likely won't ever be forgotten.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|The acting was good to outstanding, script, very good the camera work it was excellent, good close ups to get the feelings across, good fast sequences in the combat shots, your imagination filled in. good use of weapons, most of them on pare with only a few liberties taken. If Hollywood wasn't full of left wing loons this move would walk with at least one Oscar for the tools talk about Bosnia.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|A lot of times when they do a broadway or stage play they put it on location etc. This is the way a \\"Musical Play\\" should be done. It is like you are sitting in the best seat in the audience. The sound is perfect and when you wish you could see a little closer..... you don't have to pull out the binoculars. You can understand the words or put the text on the bottom for a sing along. As a community theatre director I like to see the details and hear it well. This was a joy to watch. Very well done. It is the master Andrew Lloyd Weber after all.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headset is a combined microphone and over-the-ear headphones.  The unit is wireless, and functions with a transceiver plugged either directly into the computer USB port, or plugged into the 'puck' that doubles as wire storage.  The headset is battery-powered and is recharged by plugging its 'puck' wires into the USB port and into the headset.<br /><br />Headphones:  The unit feels solid and is comfortable to wear, with a soft cushion on the headband and soft ear surrounds.  The sound inside the ear cups seems to be great, with music and voices sounding natural.  The bass is low without being boomy and muddled.  There is very little sound leakage when listening at normal volume.<br /><br />Regarding the 7.1 effect -- I wondered how they could do that with just the ear cup.  The installation CD has a test WAV file that demonstrates all of the channels.  And sure enough, I could hear the difference between the back surrounds, left and right surround, and the front channels.  I don't know whether they do this with sound delay, or by placing the drivers in the ear cup, but it's noticeable with their demo.  I also watched a portion of the movie Pearl Harbor to see if it could reproduce the full 7.1 movie track.  The LFE channel was impressive for headphones, but I have to admit that I really could not distinguish surround from front channels.  The effect was there, but very subtle.  This is with the default settings -- I could have tried playing with the software to tweak channel volumes.<br /><br />Microphone:  The microphone on this headset is high quality.  Voice sounds very natural, I was impressed.  The auto-mute was pretty sensitive and only cut off milliseconds of your first words when speaking.  The microphone can only be used on the left side of the headset - it is not reversible.<br /><br />Software:  The CD must be installed on your computer to be able to use the 7.1 surround feature and to program the G-keys.  I did run into a snag with it when installing - my computer is older and has an Athlon XP3200+ processor running Windows XP.  When I tried to install the CD, it would not continue with a message that said that the processor is not powerful enough for the software.  I wrote to Logitech about somehow bypassing the CPU check, but I don't have an answer yet.  The software did install OK on a laptop with a faster processor running Windows Vista.<br /><br />The software also has a fun toy in it that lets you morph your voice with several choices of Alien, Giant, Gremlin, Chipmunk, and others.  It also has an equalizer panel and its own volume and mic gain control.  You can control the volume individually on each of the 7 channels as well - so I think you could fine tune your own setup so that you can really distinguish between the back and front channels.  There are also preset for several types of voice software, like Ventrilo, Skype, etc.<br /><br />\\"G keys\\": There are three buttons on the side of the headset that you can assign different functions in their software.  For example, assign them as FF, PLAY, RW buttons for Windows Media Player.<br /><br />Regarding the 'gaming' aspect, I could not test it with any PC games.  It was not clear to me that this headset was only for the PC.  I assumed since it has a USB plug that it would work for console systems, but no.  I used to play World of Warcraft though, and I think this headset would work well with it.  If you like PC games and need the sound field of a 7.1 system without waking up the neighbors, I recommend this headset.  If your use is limited to only stereo music or Skype type applications, I think I would look for something cheaper.an Athlon XP3200+ processor running Windows XP.

B003VOUGV0|5.0|Love this stuff. very good vibes, especially coming out in the middle of summer. As I have said before, it reminds me of a mix of Petula Clark and M83. very listen able from beginning to end.  I have always been partial to bands that have that 60s rebirth sound (the Coral, Caribou), but Best Coast takes the cake.
0786948523|2.0|The Monster Manuals of 4th Edition have one good point and that is that the monsters and their powers are very clear cut and easy for a DM to run. For that I give them two stars. The missing three stars are because the 4E Monster Manuals lack the details, information, and soul of previous editions- particularly the 1st and 2nd Editions of the game.<br /><br />Those earlier editions were like encyclopedias of knowledge about the monsters, races, demons, and dragons contained inside. There was information about their habitats, behaviors, and a plethora of other useful (and non-useful but entertaining) material. There is also a lack of physical descriptions for DMs to use, just illustrations (some good, some poor).<br /><br />I really enjoy 4th edition as a DM, and I hope a lack of details in the books isn't a trend they take into the next edition (hopefully years off considering the investment I've made!).
0061914177|5.0|CRUSH IT<br /><br />By Brian Harris [...]<br /><br />Which Review Should You Choose?<br /><br />  With customer reviews on \\"Crush It\\" approaching 500 (and possibly more by the time this is posted), how does one decide which review provides the most accurate overview of this book?  After all, the author talks about the need to be honest, so which review in fact be the most honest?<br /><br />  Although I must confess that I haven't read all the reviews posted here I did attempt to scan as many as possible at each star level.  As I read a 1 star review I find myself agreeing with the reviewer that the reviewer's comment that \\"success has as much to do with the strategy, the team, and preparation as it does the desire to crush it.\\"  In looking at a 2 star review,  I also find myself agreeing the reviewer's thoughts that Gary Vaynerchuk started his \\"crush it\\" journey by tapping into his father's already successful wine merchant business.  Yes, most people who might read this book and have a desire to \\"crush it\\" simply do not have a successful family business to build on.<br /><br />  Moving on to a 3 star review, I find one reviewer who notes that although this book is inspiring, it lacks detailed information to help readers \\"become successful using the methods he promises\\".  Once again, I think this is an accurate comment to describe the book \\"Crush It\\".<br /><br />  Next, I looked at the 4 star reviews (and I also immediately noted that there are more 4 star reviews than all the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews added together).  Here, I note a reviewer who quotes \\"The promise of Crush! is that technology has disrupted the historical boundaries of business, making it possible for anyone with knowledge and passion to build a business that capitalizes on that experience.\\" The reviewer then states that he supports this quote (and the reviewer also notes that he has personally started five businesses that seem to provide some credence to his thoughts).  I think it is also significant to note that the same reviewer talks about the expertise that is required to crush it and perhaps this is one weakness of the book.  I agree.<br /><br />  Finally, I come to the 5 star reviews (which is abundantly clear comprises the greatest number of reviews).  From these reviews, one of the words that I see mentioned frequently is \\"inspirational\\".  One reviewer in the 5 star category states this slightly differently by using the word \\"catalyst\\".  It would seem to me that anyone who wants to be successful in any endeavor needs some inspiration or a catalyst to take action and if the content of a book provides that catalyst then I would think that in spite of any other weaknesses, this book would deserve a high rating.<br /><br />  So, the reader might now wonder, \\" How many stars would I award Crush It!?\\"<br /><br />  In responding to this question, I think my overall star scoring for the book is directly related to how it might help me to be a more successful as an author and as an entrepreneur?  After all, $[...] is a small price to pay if there is just one practical idea or resource in the book that can make a professional difference in my life (and I wouldn't necessarily rate this book in terms of personal growth because we can all enrich our lives by living our passions without ever \\"cashing in\\" on them.  Living our passions and the resulting happiness does not have to be tied to money).<br /><br />  In reading Crush It!, I first of all noted that the author defines passion as:  \\"It means that when you get up for work every morning, every single morning, you are pumped because you get to talk about or work with or do the thing that interests you the most in the world.\\"  As a professional career counsellor for more than twenty years I agree with this statement, and happiness might come a little easier to a lot more people if you could identify and live your passion (even if your passions don't relate to your job or earning money).  The flip side of this though is that some people get so caught up in the adrenalin rush of their passion that their relationship with others suffers.<br /><br />  In looking at the next comment I highlighted in this book, I note Gary's words \\"EVERYONE needs to start thinking of themselves as a brand.\\"  While this may be very important for some people in, I can't agree that everyone needs to think of themselves as a brand (unless we expand the notion of \\"branding\\" to being \\"the best parent\\", or \\"the best friend\\", etc.).  From my experience in working with people, some people are quite comfortable (and it is okay for some people to be comfortable) being followers or going to work each day and following instructions.  Along the same line, I disagree with the author's comment that \\"Learn to live your passion, and you'll have all the money you need plus total control over your own destiny.\\"  How many parents are there whose passion is their family, and who will never have all the money they might need because their family comes before ungodly hours at work?  Are there many people who lived their lives more passionately than let's say someone like Vincent Van Gogh?  And yet, if history serves me properly, Van Gogh's passions never led to personal wealth.<br /><br />  So how then was Crush It! useful to me?  While Gary's comment that \\"you gotta be you\\" is not earth-shattering advice, none-the-less, it is advice that we all need to be reminded of from time to time, and I include myself as someone who needs to be reminded of this.  For me, most important of all (and yes this is a theme in some other books) is the emphasis that the internet is providing an opportunity for anyone (with the right expertise as we have already noted) to market their product or business in a manner that didn't exist just a few years ago.  As an author who has sold many books (\\"The Millionaire Lifeguard, my newest book)with a great deal of money and time spent on traditional advertising, this \\"new\\" way of doing things has the potential to make a significance in my success as an author. I appreciate Gary's passion in talking about this and his practical thoughts about various platforms to user in promoting a product.  This was useful advice for me and although simplistic, for someone who was resisting using platforms such as Facebook or Twitter, it led me to read more in-depth books about Wordpress, Facebook, Twitter, etc. (in other words Crush It! was a catalyst).<br /><br />  Finally, one word I read a several times in the book is \\"hustle\\".  While this is a word that sometimes has a negative connotation, overall I think the author's emphasis here is passion will not lead to success unless this passion translates into action (work, hustle, however you want to say it).  In fact, the author states \\"Expect this to be all consuming\\".  From my experience this is very true (although I do feel the need once again to point out that it is okay if your passion is your family or a hobby that never leads to the gaining of wealth or the growth of a business).<br /><br />  In conclusion, I give Crush It! 5 stars.  This is a book that as others have said is inspirational (in spite of any other shortcomings).  For me, I was inspired to read more in-depth books on some of the topics that the author briefly touched on.  I believe that any book that actually motivates to take some kind of action that contributes in a positive way to achieving my dreams deserves to receive 5 stars.<br /><br />  So which review should you choose?

0312356854|2.0|This book was listed on several sites as being a good book club selection -- so enjoying this book was my real expectation.  However, it did not deliver.    Learning about a certain event during German occupied Paris was interesting.  But good historical fiction will take you deeper into the time period and into people's lives.  The author strings out the one event as effectively as she can, but there was much more she could have added with the story.  The author herself brings up the point of what were the police thinking at that time.  Huh??   Great angle for the book!  It was like she mentions it but realizes it would make the research more time consuming.      Another reviewer mentions the emotional tie with the current time protagonist is missing.  Absolutely!  For this story to be successful, being connected with Julia's obsession and personal journey has to be believable. We are forced to buy into her obsession.  Her personal story was even more of a disconnect --everyone around her thinks she had married a jerk.... surprise!  she figures out she married a jerk.  It only took her years.   I had no empathy for her.    A major problem I had was with the manipulation of making you feel like you can't put the book down.  The story or writing isn't complex enough for you to really \\"read\\" the paragraphs.  The spacing on the pages and content are light enough for you to breeze through it quickly.   I did read this quickly and afterward felt like I had read the equivalent of two whole chapters in other books.    Good historical fiction does not need to switch between time periods -- the reason the author has picked a time period is because it alone is interesting!      If you want a light read on a rainy day, this is your book.  You do learn a little about Nazi occupied Paris.  But read Suite Francaise if really want to experience the pain of that time period.
0439023513|5.0|So-- I am not really going to review this one right now, I might whenever people have plenty of time to read and process.<br />I will say that I loved it, Collins writing gripped me once again. I flew through this book, and felt all sorts of emotions. Her writing is superb, and she weaves a beautiful story. I give it 5 stars, and I appreciate the way that she ended the book. I am not quite sure what I wanted but she did better than I ever could. It is as happy an ending as could be warranted by this series.<br />Katniss remains strong and true to her character, though she is of course drug through even more hell.
B003A4IFGY|2.0|Not real excited about this latest offering from TP & H.  The single \\"Last time you're gonna hurt me\\" is good, but everything else is really slow - probably a good choice if you like Petty's more bluesy stuff, but it didn't do anything for me.
B003D1ACOM|5.0|This album is the most emotional guitar album I have ever heard. Not so much far out flashy wild guitar, but smooth effective highly emotional guitar. Since I bought this album I almost can't listen to anything else. But maybe he just ring my chimes like no one else.
B003XU02QG|4.0|CENTURION may not be a great movie - very entertaining, but not great - but it does make some points that are worth considering today.  The concept of a big power (here the Roman Empire AD 117) making a preemptive war on a smaller, 'different' culture (the Picts of Scotland) cannot help but muster comparison to current US preemptive (and unsuccessful) attacks in the Middle East.  Though it is doubtful that the writer director Neil Marshall's cinematic vision included this idea, the historic decimation of the Roman Ninth Legion's failure to conquer the Picts is poignant food for thought.<br /><br />But on to the story.  In 117 AD one of the few areas not controlled by the Roman Empire was the northern portion of the British Isles, land of the Picts, a strange tribal like people with determined, terrifyingly ferocious fighting techniques.  General Titus Flavius Virilus (Domenic West) is given orders from the Roman Emperor to capture that stronghold, and he is off with the Ninth Legion to conquer.  A born leader and beloved by his troops, Virilus fights valiantly but is captured and there is only one man deemed his replacement - former gladiator Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbinder, a major actor remembered for this disparate roles as in `Hunger', `Inglourious Basterds', `300', `Band of Brothers' etc). Centurion is finally left with a handful of men (JJ Field, Lee Ross, David Morrisey, Liam Cunningham, Noel Clarke, Dimitri Leonidas, Riz Ahmed) who attempt to complete the mission.  One mute female warrior Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a Pict turned Roman Guide, quickly turns her allegiance to her homeland and becomes the most treacherous fighter of them all.  At one point the son of Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen), the leader of the Picts, is killed by a Roman and the ferocity of the battle is heightened.  The Roman troops endure untold hardships, are given hospitality by a Pict castaway Arianne (Imogen Poots) with whom Centurion becomes enamored, and eventually only Centurion remains as the sole survivor of the Roman Ninth Legion. The effect of his experience and knowledge of the war failure causes the Roman Empire to decide a fate for him and the rest is best left unsaid.<br /><br />There is little dialogue, but what there is is solid. The battle scenes are appropriately gory and the cinematography by Sam McCurdy and the musical score by Ilan Eshkeri sustain the atmosphere.  Michael Fassbinder proves that he is indeed a major talent, and the entire cast is excellent.  It is a great little film for diversion, it could easily have been extended (only 98 minutes) for better fleshing out of the characters, but the final words of the Centurion suggest that there likely will be sequels.  Grady Harp, August 10s as the sole survivor of the Roman Ninth Legion. The effect of his experience and knowledge of the war failure causes the Roman Empire to decide a fate for him and the rest is best left unsaid.    There is little dialogue, but what there is is solid. The battle scenes are appropriately gory and the cinematography by Sam McCurdy and the musical score by Ilan Eshkeri sustain the atmosphere.  Michael Fassbinder proves that he is indeed a major talent, and the entire cast is excellent.  It is a great little film for diversion, it could easily have been extended (only 98 minutes) for better fleshing out of the characters, but the final words of the Centurion suggest that there likely will be sequels.

030726999X|5.0|If you've read the first two books, you must read the exciting conclusion. Although it delves into Swedish government a little more than I'd like, it's a great read.
B002MJV75O|3.0|I watched Dawson's Creek whe it originally aired and bought the box set too, I still love the show but I don't like that it does not have the same music it originally aired with, In some cases the music makes all the difference, imagine watching Star Wars without John Willimas Music Playing in the background, obviously it's not that bad, but if you are like me and watched the show you will notice a difference.
0439023513|5.0|Never has a series touched me like The Hunger Games series. Every moment, every heart ache, every bit of dialogue is real. The characters reactions, moments of clarity, moments of insanity, pain, loss, love, hate, anger, hurt, even their drug induced stupors are real, real real.<br /><br />Parajunkee loved this book? Real.<br /><br />REVIEW: The culmination of Katniss' adventure comes to an end in the 3rd installment of The Hunger Games, Mockingjay. She has been pulled from The Quarter Quell Hunger Games, forced to leave Peeta and a few other tributes behind and take up shelter in 13. District 12 has been reduced to ashes. Thousands have died, all because of her.<br /><br />Within the confines of District 13 she finds no solace at the heart of the rebellion. She is torn between a multitude of emotions, to give in, to flee, to take too many pills, to hide --- but most of all she is driven by revenge and an underlying love that she is unable to define herself. She knows she has to see this to the end, she must kill Snow, she must protect Peeta and her family. If that means sacrificing herself, well so-be-it. From Katniss' POV she has no future, the pain is just too great, the nightmares just too real, she doesn't see an end to the pain.<br /><br />Hearth-wrenching at times, gruesome at others,  Mockingjay led me through a plethora of reactive states. I stared wide-eyed at the pages as death and destruction were described. I sniffled as Katniss' peers and friends tried to reaffirm to her that they did care about her. I hissed when the big baddies made their appearances and did not-so-nice things to Katniss and her group. I giggled at the description of some of the Capitol wear. I awed at moments of touching lovey emotional scenes and I think I might even have thrown the book once when there was a deceptive moment. I even parried...back and forth between Gale and Peeta, but not too much, because there is no question in my mind where Katniss belongs.<br /><br />Read the books. If you haven't read the series, you really should. This isn't a Twilight phenom, these are really good books, with awesome plots, great characters and should go down as one of the best YA series ever. This is, this generations Wrinkle in Time type series.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: Fans of Ender's Game - this is a must read. Westerfeld's The Uglies - must read. YA fans, dystopian fans, people that don't even know what dystopian means...who cares, find out what it means by reading this book. Adults, older teens, men, women - it is cross-generational, cross-gender and cross species {mutants might be offended with the mutt talk though}. There is a lot of violence though, so I would stick with older teens, or mature younger ones.ou really should.

B002C1BHIO|5.0|Yes, you can pay Monster a ridiculous amount of money for their cables but I'm not sure that most humans' eyes and ears could tell the difference.  These cables work great and they're a tremendous value.  Way to go Amazon!
0812550706|5.0|I read this when I was in 7th grade and I remember this as the first book that got me hooked on a series.  The reason why I've been hooked to the story is because I like the characters Ender and Bean and find myself caring about what happens to them.
B00006JIA4|2.0|It's beyond me how some knucklehead can put together a 3 disc Queen \\"greatest hits\\" and leave off \\"Tie Your Mother Down.\\"  If I'd been paying attention I probably would not have bought this.  Now you know...

Especially if you're like me and you've only had that lousy, first generation CD to listen to all these years.  This is a kick ass record and now its sound truly matches the material.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I was so excited to purchase the entire series plus the 2 movies. My children were young when the show was on TV and I missed a few episodes and one of the movies. I am on the 4th season now and can't wait to see the rest. Every night I try to watch 2 episodes and my family says that I am addicted. I love the way the writers portrayed American history along with the fictional characters. If you loved Dr. Quinn, you must purchase this complete series.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|They cancelled it and we are never going to know what happens, so what is the point of buying an incomplete show?
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Within the first five minutes, if you watch the characters talk in the book publishing office, you will gain an appreciation of how Polanski uses casting to relay the message of this movie.  I won't give it away, but look at race, age, and accent, and you may be able to decipher subtle metaphors of how different countries stand in relation to each other today.<br /><br />Down to the two Asian caretakers who are sweeping up the mess even as the wind blows.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Polanski's work, ever since his first jazzy, beat Knife in the Water in 1962.  As with that film - this exiled director returns to a taut, tension-strung method of story telling.  In the extra, he himself references Raymond Chandler, whose signature is that sense of the diabolical, lying just beneath an uneasy calm.  There are no huge car chases with exploding barriers and Parkour jumps across buildings, the CGI is reserved for static backdrops (window vistas) and scenery color.<br /><br />A noteworthy ensemble, combined with Polish cinematographer Pawel Edelman's (The Life Before Her Eyes) gorgeous steel grey landscape, and Alexandre Desplat's Philip Glassian score complement each other.  McGregor's nameless ghost does make many careless albeit convincing mistakes as a writer who apparently has no clue about the company he is in - international espionage, CIA, etc.<br /><br />An august Eli Wallach makes a delightful cameo.

0765326353|4.0|Here we go, folks: The Way of Kings, at over 1000 pages, is the first volume of Brandon Sanderson's projected ten-book series, THE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE. At one book per year, we probably won't see the end of this series before 2020, especially given that Sanderson is first planning to finish up Robert Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME. So, if you're looking for a new series to read, this one has some advantages and disadvantages: on the plus side, there will be a lot of reading material coming your way; on the other hand, it'll take quite some time for all of it to get here. Luckily, The Way of Kings  is a very promising start to the series. Unlike what seems to be most of the fantasy audience, I haven't been a huge fan of all of Brandon Sanderson's work so far, but The Way of Kings is easily his best work to date.    The book has three main characters (Kaladin, Shallan and Dalinar) and a host of side characters, who occasionally also have chapters or \\"interludes\\" written from their point of view. The main story focuses on Kaladin, a surgeon's son forced to become a bridgeman -- a form of military slavery that involves carrying siege bridges in Alethkar's ongoing war with the Parshendi, who at the very start of the novel assassinate Alethkar's king. Dalinar is the late king's brother (and uncle of the current monarch), who along with nine other High Princes is running the war effort against the mysterious Parshendi. And finally, on the other end of the continent, there's Shallan, a young noble girl who wants to become the apprentice of Jasnah, a princess and famed scholar -- although Shallan's motives for seeking this position are not what they initially seem...    Of these characters, Kaladin is the most fascinating and well-rounded one. Brandon Sanderson does a fantastic job building up his history and explaining his motivations in a series of flashback chapters that gradually ratchet up the dramatic tension and turn Kaladin into his most memorable character to date. On the other hand, the witty, independent Shallan was a bit too recognizable: add color-changing hair and you could almost confuse her for one of the sisters in Warbreaker. The heroic Dalinar falls somewhere in the middle: he's the lone wolf warrior noble, the only High Prince to follow the ancient Alethi Codes of War, and someone you can admire -- while at the same time being able to predict what's going happen to him in the midst of nine other, less noble High Princes.    The book's blurbs inevitably point out that there's yet another main character, the world of Roshar -- but in this case, there's really something to this. It's hard not to be excited about a brand new fantasy universe at the start of such a long series. Brandon Sanderson performs a fine balancing act here, showing enough hints of the vast history and depth of this new world without revealing all of it. From the mysterious \\"prelude\\", showing events that happened 4,500 years before the start of the story, to the intriguing fauna and flora, to the nature and origin of the High Storms, to the question of what exactly a \\"spren\\" is... you'll end up with more questions than answers by the time you turn the final page, but you'll be intrigued and eager to read more. A testament to the quality of this book: it's rare for me to read a book that's more than 1000 pages long and still wish I could immediately read more.    Part of the reason for this is Brandon Sanderson's completely transparent prose. Some authors write prose you need to savor slowly -- Guy Gavriel Kay, Catherynne Valente, Janny Wurts. Their prose invites contemplation and appreciation of the rhythm, rhyme and sheer elegance of the words on the page. By contrast, Brandon Sanderson's prose has very little artifice to it: it just exists to tell the story. It's plain as can be, doesn't draw any attention to itself, and rarely if ever stands in the way of the story. However, it would be a mistake to underestimate how difficult it is to write a novel in such a way that you sometimes completely forget that you are, in fact, reading. Sanderson's prose never stands in the way of the reader's complete immersion. As someone who is usually very aware of what I'm reading and how many pages I've read, I often was surprised to look up and realize that I'd just read 30 or 40 pages without even being aware that I'd been reading. There's a real art to writing a compulsive page-turner like this, and Sanderson, who teaches Creative Writing at BYU, is becoming an expert at it.    Not that The Way of Kings doesn't suffer from some of the same flaws as Sanderson's other works. Characters are often still a bit one-dimensional, and some of the plot devices the author uses are too predictable and transparent. The start of the novel, describing the assassination of the Alethi king, reminded me strongly of some of the action scenes in the MISTBORN novels, with the assassin using his magic to perform gravity-defying stunts, but fortunately the rest of the novel doesn't read like a video game's magic system turned into a story. It's also written more tightly and with less filler (which, again, comes as a surprise given the length of the book). The end is filled with rousing heroism and a moving, truly exciting climax, but after the Big Final Battle, there are a few big revelations crammed in a few short pages, and while those were fascinating and definitely sparked my interest to read more of the series, they also felt a bit rushed and anti-climactic. Still, The Way of Kings is, in almost every way, a better book than anything Brandon Sanderson has produced so far, and if the rest of THE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE keeps up this level of quality, we may end up looking back on the MISTBORN trilogy as an early practice run leading up to a work with better balance, better writing, and a much larger scope.    Finally, The Way of Kings is also a lovely book in terms of artwork. From the stunning cover illustration by Michael Whelan to the interior artwork, this book simply does everything right. Every few chapters, you'll find a full page of artwork, e.g. some pages from Shallan's sketch book showing Roshar's native animals and plants, or an illustrated page from the Alethi Codes of War. These aren't just beautifully done, but also relevant to the story. I've never really seen an epic fantasy integrate art into the novel in quite this way.    The Way of Kings is an excellent start to a promising series that's sure to dominate sales charts and bookstore shelves for many years to come. If you're already a Brandon Sanderson fan, this book will blow you away -- and if you're new to the author, you now can get started with the author's finest work to date.
0374158460|3.0|Writer's colony writing. No heart. Turns of phrase that ring toneless after being passed by writing professor. Not the Dreiser, Dostoevsky, Steinbeck, Patrick White, etc. as paraded by the major news outlets. A man who learned to write in the classroom. Permanent adolescence. Worth reading.
B001HN694K|4.0|Everyone's entitled to their opinion, of course. But it seems to me that too few people are able to really sit down and let themselves go and be taken along for the ride in a movie these days, while too many prefer to watch a movie with a cynical eye, actively looking for things to criticize (perhaps in seeking to write a \\"witty\\" review later on).  If you're going to watch a movie based on a child's tale, watch it from your inner child's viewpoint, OK?      After recently seeing Alice in Wonderland, and then searching online for reviews afterward, I was very baffled by some of the venom I saw directed at this movie.  Maybe it's just an aversion to the story of Alice in Wonderland itself, more than anything.  I admit that, growing up, I never much liked this story.  However, seeing the genius with which it was brought to the screen (and DVD), I simply can't take seriously any of the bashing.  This was beautifully, masterfully, and bizarrely-done (and bizarre is definitely appropriate for this).  Perhaps there was too much CGI, as some have pointed out.  I'm not a fan of overdoing CGI.  (As much as I love most of Cameron's work, Avatar left me somewhat cold, as CGI just has an empty and soulless feeling to it that we sense, no matter how real it appears to our eyes).  For Alice in Wonderland, I suppose the amount of graphics tinkering was necessary, though, because the story itself, as well as the characters, were deeply distorted in all imaginable ways.  It managed to avoid having too much of that empty CGI feeling, though, since they combined the effects largely with the actual actors.     This movie made me feel like a little kid, as I watched it wide-eyed and oo-ed at the Cheshire Cat, and ah-ed at the settings, and giggled at the doormouse.  It challenged my poor brain with its shape and relative-size distortions, physics-defying moments, and general madness.    And on the subject of madness, ah, Johnny Depp as the Hatter.  Nuts for sure, but with silliness and an unexpected vulnerability brought to the part which really caught me off-guard, and which made him so endearing.  All the casting was perfectly done, in fact.  But I'm mad about the Hatter.  :)    I take away 1 star for several moments in the movie where some lines were delivered too muttered, too quietly, and were unintelligible.  Maybe it's not the actors, but the audio mixing, and I notice this more and more with movies lately.  (And yes my hearing is very good.)  Dialogue too quiet, loud parts too loud - dynamics issues.  I read a lot of reviews where people mention this about a great number of movies, and they having to turn subtitles on to catch the quiet dialogue.  \\"Alice\\" suffers just a little bit from this problem.    Other than that....     Bravo Tim Burton!
B002N8A14M|4.0|I got this armband mainly for running with my iPod Nano. The armband is very lightweight and actually pretty comfortable; I hardly notice it's even there when I'm wearing it. It fits me pretty well too (I would say my arms are a little bigger than average).    One thing to note is that the actual iPod holder is a plastic clip that you clip on to the armband. The armband holds the iPod very well so there are no worries about the iPod falling off. The plastic clip is great because you can use it by itself and clip the iPod to your shorts/pants, backpack, or whatever else you want.     My only complaint is that the plastic holder for the iPod is too small on the edges. It is difficult to get the headphones to connect securely to the iPod through the tiny opening, although I have gotten it to work every time, it just takes a little more effort. Also, the hold button is a little hard to access, but that's no biggie.     Overall, the armband fits great and the iPod clip is very convenient for when I want to have my iPod and just clip it to my shorts. I would recommend it if you can live with the headphone inconvenience mentioned above.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|THIS is a fantastic box set worth every penny.     As a UK customer, I couldn't wait to buy this locally so ordered it from the USA. No regrets, because it is beautifully packaged and a worthy collectors set for what was one of the very best TV series of recent years.    Just to confirm, although all of the blu-ray discs say they are region A, they are actually region free APART from Season 3 and Season 4, so be warned.
0007206070|5.0|thank you for the book. my son loved it and was thrilled when it came so quickly.
B0036EH3X4|4.0|I'm not going to go through the plot of \\"LOST\\" but want to focus on the overall Blu-ray.  By saying that, I did enjoy this sixth season and loved the finale.  But again, I've debated this enough on \\"The Fuselage\\" and other forums to know that this series and its finale has striked a chord among the viewers (positive and negative).  Here is my feelings of the overall Blu-ray release of \\"Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season\\" (note: Didn't find many easter eggs this time around on the BD release).<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season\\" is a series that looks incredible on High Definition. Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly. The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean. Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and \\"LOST\\" is no exception. This final season's offering continues its wonderful presentation on Blu-ray. You can see the skin pores much more closely, even the stubble or sweat on the faces of the characters, the mucky water, detail of the plants in the dense jungle, the rocky earthtones, the brownish/reds inside the Dharma buildings and just regular objects, the stained blood on the skin of the characters, you can actually see that the blood is actually dry and much, much more.<br /><br />There is a lot of detail that you just don't see on television and when you see it on Blu-ray, especially for \\"Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season\\", you can't help but be amazed. The colors are just fantastic as blue oceans and blue skies are surrounded by beautiful lush greenery. Blacks are nice and dark and skin tones are natural.<br /><br />Another wonderful presentation of \\"Lost\\" on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />As for the audio, \\"LOST\\" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1. The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle. This season tends to have used more panning and audio directional to certain speaker channels much more evident than the first season. Also, sounds of the smoke monster and the growls to the ambiance of the island, explosions, earthquakes, the chanting  of the voices of the island and if anything, they really went all out in destruction and chaos with this latest season.<br /><br />Audio comes quite clear through the various surround channels. Also, good use of surrounds and LFE. Dialogue is crisp, clear and understandable and the music also comes out alive during certain scenes.<br /><br />I love how the music for the series sounds and how it really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome. So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!  So, once again, \\"Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season\\" delivers in lossless audio.  Fantastic!<br /><br />Subtitles are featured in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of \\"Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition and 480i Standard Definition.  Audio is in English 2.0 Dolby Digital with subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish. Included are:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Lost Starter Kit - (8:26) Get up to speed on what has happened in \\"LOST\\" from the last five seasons.<br />  * Audio Commentary for \\"LAX\\" by Executive Producers and Co-Creator/Executive Producer Damon Lindelof and Executive Producer Carlton Cuse.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary for \\"Dr. Linus\\" with commentary from Executive Producers and Writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz along with actor Michael Emerson.<br /><br />DISC 3:<br /><br />* Audio Commentary for \\"Ab Aeterno\\" with commentary from writers Melinda Hsu Taylor, Greggory Nations and actor Nestor Carbonell.<br /><br />DISC 4:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary for \\"Across the Sea\\" by Executive Producers and Co-Creator/Executive Producer Damon Lindelof and Executive Producer Carlton Cuse.<br /><br />DISC 5:<br /><br />  * Lost University: Master's Program - For those who have Blu-ray 2.0 profile players and are hooked up to the Internet can be part of Lost University. An excerpt from the explanation of \\"Lost University\\": Viewers will be able to join LOST executive producers Carlton Cuse, Damon Lindelof, the cast of \\"LOST,\\" and a panel of esteemed experts for a vast array of courses at LOST University, delving into the themes and storylines regularly explored on the groundbreaking television series. The main campus of \\"LOST University\\" will live on the \\"LOST: The Complete Fifth Season\\" Blu-ray disc and will be powered by BDLive. Upon launching the innovative interface, students immediately get access to their personalized lesson plans, compelling HD Audio-Visual presentations and communication from the LOST University faculty and staff. Like any real university, campus life at LOST University is not solely focused on higher learning, pop quizzes and homework. Through an extended web experience, students will be able to pay visits to the campus bookstore to purchase LOST U merchandise, or discuss their school experience and \\"LOST\\" theories through study-groups on the LOST University message boards. Potential students will even have the opportunity to prep for the LOST U experience in advance on [...] with story and character refresher courses and advanced reading suggestions.<br /><br />With that being said, I did try out a few classes, watched a few professors (actual college professors) give their lectures on several subjects such as literature and then I took two exams on the first day.  I actually like the concept of how the Lost University is implemented on the Blu-ray releases and probably one of the best uses of BD-Live thus far.  The video streaming was fine and I didn't have any problems with this feature at all.<br /><br />  * The New Man in Charge - (11:55) The epilogue which has been hyped in many publications in which executive producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof have been teasing us with.  Answers to a few questions that people have had.  This epilogue features Dr. Ben Linus, Dr. Chang, Hurley and Walt.

You will access the following easter egg: (:53) Yunjin Kim, Daniel Dae Kim and Josh Holloway goofing off behind-the-scenes in the submerged sub.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Lost\\" was an amazing experience since the beginning.  Meeting new friends and debating topics that I have never done with a TV series before, it was just a fantastic ride with its ups and downs and each episode just capturing my attention and for the most part, just embracing everything that had come out.  From the audio books, the web episodes, the videogame,  the podcasts, the magazine, you name it...I was loving every minute of \\"Lost\\" and what the writers had to provide for us.<br /><br />And then it came to this final season and I admit that the flash-sideways episodes were a bit confusing.  In fact, I was wondering where this was all heading and right after each episode, I would head to the Fuselage to see how everyone else was interpreting these flash-sideways storylines.  Was I missing something?  Was I not enjoying these flash-sideways as much and I was more into the original timeline?<br /><br />But the more we got into the series and to see how Desmond had this connection between the two timelines, I just started to have this silly grin on my face while watching this series because we had a sense that Desmond had to play an important part in this series and then things slowly started to unravel.<br /><br />But then the original timeline also started to unravel and we didn't know who would turn evil, we don't know what would happen with Sayid and what will happen between Jack, Kate and Sawyer.  And for me, I was so happy to see Jin and Sun back together but then to find myself devastated and sad after watching \\"The Candidate\\" where favorite characters we have followed for years, were killed off.  We knew something was going to happen, we just didn't know who.  And I admit, I was so bummed out, it affected me the day after.<br /><br />And then it was time for the final episode and I just felt it was the most fantastic ending for a series on television that I have seen.  Granted, the final episode had a lot to do with faith and if anything, your appreciation for the series as a whole.  I found myself going online and having to explain the finale to so many people.  But it was quite interesting to read of how the finale affected people.  Many, like myself, who absolutely loved it and then those who were upset with the finale and a lot of loose ends not being tied up.<br /><br />And here we are with the Blu-ray release of \\"Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season\\".  Hyped by many publications and even brought up on the night after the finale on the Jimmy Kimmel \\"Lost\\" special about how Executive Producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof will tie up those loose ends on the Blu-ray and DVD release.  So, needless to say, many fans of the series have been awaiting this release.  And with all said and done, the 12-minute epilogue was satisfying.  It may not answer all questions but it does answer the question that relates to Walt (and also the polar bears).<br /><br />Like every previous release of \\"Lost\\" we are treated with a good amount of special features.  I wish there were more audio commentary featured (especially for the final episode) and I wish the web episodes or even the Jimmy Kimmel special was included on this Blu-ray but overall, you do get many special features like the previous season box sets and you also get the latest version of \\"Lost University\\" (note: you must have a Blu-ray 2.0 player to play this.  So, if your Blu-ray is connected to the Internet, you can view this feature).<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release of \\"Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season\\", the picture quality is again, amazing.  The detail can be easily seen on Blu-ray and  things that never caught my attention when watching the episodes on television, have now caught my attention this time around. From the skin pores and even the hair on one's arm, to the lush plants and the coarse rocks, the blood, the sweat... the amount of detail that pops is simply amazing.  Audio quality is also used very well through all channels and because we see the smoke monster quite a bit and also quite a bit of explosions and destruction in this final season, lossless audio was well utilized and sounds fantastic on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Overall, this series was a fitting conclusion to this fantastic series.  Many months since the conclusion of the series, people continue to debate the series finale and I'm sure with the epilogue, there are people who will continue to debate the series throughout the rest of the year.<br /><br />But in the end, the series did touch millions of people worldwide.  May they be content or upset of how the series unfolded throughout the six seasons, it's all subjective.  But overall, for me, I was quite content with how the series played out from beginning to end.  Do I still have questions in regards to the series?  I sure do (especially when it comes to the characters of Eloise and Jacob).  But on the grand scale of how the writers resolved many of the important questions of the series, I was content with how the final season played out and I admit to feeling a bit saddened that this series, which had become a favorite of mine for six years, is now over.<br /><br />\\"Lost\\" is definitely the most compelling, entertaining and enthralling drama series to air on television and the cast and crew made sure to end the series on a positive note.  If you have purchased all seasons on Blu-ray, this is a no-brainer and easily a must-buy.  Highly recommended!ehind-the-scenes in the submerged sub.    JUDGMENT CALL:    \\"Lost\\" was an amazing experience since the beginning.  Meeting new friends and debating topics that I have never done with a TV series before, it was just a fantastic ride with its ups and downs and each episode just capturing my attention and for the most part, just embracing everything that had come out.  From the audio books, the web episodes, the videogame,  the podcasts, the magazine, you name it...I was loving every minute of \\"Lost\\" and what the writers had to provide for us.    And then it came to this final season and I admit that the flash-sideways episodes were a bit confusing.  In fact, I was wondering where this was all heading and right after each episode, I would head to the Fuselage to see how everyone else was interpreting these flash-sideways storylines.  Was I missing something?  Was I not enjoying these flash-sideways as much and I was more into the original timeline?    But the more we got into the series and to see how Desmond had this connection between the two timelines, I just started to have this silly grin on my face while watching this series because we had a sense that Desmond had to play an important part in this series and then things slowly started to unravel.    But then the original timeline also started to unravel and we didn't know who would turn evil, we don't know what would happen with Sayid and what will happen between Jack, Kate and Sawyer.  And for me, I was so happy to see Jin and Sun back together but then to find myself devastated and sad after watching \\"The Candidate\\" where favorite characters we have followed for years, were killed off.  We knew something was going to happen, we just didn't know who.  And I admit, I was so bummed out, it affected me the day after.    And then it was time for the final episode and I just felt it was the most fantastic ending for a series on television that I have seen.  Granted, the final episode had a lot to do with faith and ifanything, your appreciation for the series as a whole.  I found myself going online and having to explain the finale to so many people.  But it was quite interesting to read of how the finale affected people.  Many, like myself, who absolutely loved it and then those who were upset with the finale and a lot of loose ends not being tied up.    And here we are with the Blu-ray release of \\"Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season\\".  Hyped by many publications and even brought up on the night after the finale on the Jimmy Kimmel \\"Lost\\" special about how Executive Producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof will tie up those loose ends on the Blu-ray and DVD release.  So, needless to say, many fans of the series have been awaiting this release.  And with all said and done, the 12-minute epilogue was satisfying.

B003JTHESA|4.0|After listening to this album for a few months, I raised my rating of it from 3 to 4 stars. \\"The Alchemist,\\" \\"The Talisman,\\" \\"Starblind\\" and \\"Mother of Mercy\\" simply kick too much ass to label this a 3 star album.  Below is my original review.    I have really enjoyed TFF and the 3 albums that came before it.  \\"Brave New World\\" was an awesome return to form from a reunited Maiden.  \\"Dance of Death\\" was my favorite since the return of Bruce - an album filled with variety.  \\"Matter of Life and Death\\" took time to grow on me, and I would now say about 70% of it is a solid effort.  Likewise, \\"The Final Frontier\\" took 6-12 listens to grow on me, but - unlike AMOLAD - I wasn't looking at my watch as Bruce sang the same lyric 30 times in a row!      I agree with three negative remarks about TFF that people have aired here.  First, Bruce is not working his full register as much as he did on his early recordings with Maiden, and he occasionally sounds strained; a new producer might help in pushing him to be more dynamic.  Second, the first 4 tracks are more \\"experimental\\" with the band's signature sound, yet they can still grow on you.  \\"El Dorado\\" especially grew on me.  Last but not least, TFF doesn't feature any \\"instant classics,\\" i.e. Maiden songs that appeal to you on first listen (like \\"Sanctuary,\\" \\"Killers,\\" \\"The Trooper,\\" \\"Number of the Beast,\\" \\"2 Minutes to Midnight,\\" \\"Ghost of the Navigator,\\" or \\"Rainmaker\\").  Personally, I judge a song to be \\"classic Maiden\\" if I can easily recall my favorite bass runs (e.g. \\"Number of the Beast\\") or guitar solos (e.g. \\"Powerslave\\")from memory alone.  Thus far, none of the TFF songs have stuck with me in that way; I think a similar experience is what leads some fans to trash the album completely.    TFF lacks the variety of BNW and DOD; what variety there is seems forced, especially on songs where the vocal melody and the guitars are exactly the same.  Every song from track 3 on, however, left me feeling that TFF was clearly influenced by the band's recent immersion into their older material on the \\"Somewhere Back in Time\\" tour.  From track 5 on, this album is a solid effort, neither the best nor the worst of Maiden.  If you can overlook the poor choice of singles and promotional ads for this album, you might enjoy Tracks 5-8.  If I had known this before buying the cd, I would have bought just those tracks as MP3s.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|In 2009, as the popular drama series \\"LOST\\" was on hiatus until Feb. 2010 on ABC, many people were wondering what series ABC would have for viewers in the meantime. Fortunately, the network had a new sci-fi drama series titled \\"FlashForward\\" based on the 1999 novel by Canada sci-fi writer Robert J. Sawyer set for debut in Sept. 2009 and a total of ten episodes aired through December and set for a return in March 18th after the 2010 Winter Olympics.<br /><br />So, in order to get people prepared for the second half of the series, ABC is releasing \\"Flash Forward - Part One, Season One\\" on DVD featuring the first ten episodes and will be releasing the complete series on Blu-ray and DVD later in August. Fortunately, abc studios is including a $15 coupon with this DVD release, if people plan to upgrade to the complete series.<br /><br />The series revolves around a few main characters and what happens to them when every human in the planet loses consciousness for 2 minutes and 17 seconds. During that time, each person was given a glimpse of their future six months later. The FBI are trying to find out the source of why this happened, while everyone is trying to deal with what they learned of their visions of the future (good and bad).<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"FlashForward\\" is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 16×9 television.

So, for those who want enjoy the series and prefer it on Blu-ray, the complete series will be available on Blu-ray in August. For those who want the series on DVD should be happy that the picture quality is very good. There is little compression artifacting, especially since there are five episodes on each DVD disc.<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />As for audio, \\"FlashForward\\" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series has quite a bit of action in the ten episodes from cars crashing, gun shots, glass breaking, tables being flipped over. As mentioned, \\"FlashForward\\" would probably sound much better via lossless on Blu-ray if you are an audiophile. As for the DVD, the series sounds good via Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The series is front and center channel driven. I preferred to watch the series with stereo on all channels set on my receiver for a more immersive soundscape.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"FlashForward - The Complete Series\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 5:<br /><br />  * Architects of Destiny - (20:06) The cast and crew talk about their experience on working on the first day of \\"FlashForward\\" and talk about how they were cast for their role.<br />  * Flashforward on Set - Featuring five featurettes of \\"FlashForward\\" on set: Tempting Fate (5:19) - Featuring the scenes at the Blue Hand Club, When Nature Calls (2:13) - Featuring a reshoot of two scenes from the pilot and the building of a bathroom set, Emergency Operation (3:02) - Filming the scenes from the hospital during the FlashForward, A Day in the Park - The making of the bus crash scene (3:33) and Crash Forward (4:22) - Filming a car chase.<br />  * Meet Yuko - (5:49) An introduction to popular Japanese actress Yuko Takeuchi and her first day on the set and meeting with the cast and executive producers.<br />  * Interviews from the Mosaic Collective - The following features interviews with people about their FlashForward experiences.

I felt that \\"Lost in Mars\\" from 2008-2009 had so much potential but ABC ended the series after its first season and here we are with \\"FlashForward\\", a sci-fi drama series which features a few talent from \\"LOST\\" with a pretty cool concept and a lot of potential.<br /><br />I am enjoying the series thus far and have enjoyed the first ten episodes a lot. I like where the series is going but the big question is if this is the type of series that can continue for multiple years. One of the things that \\"LOST\\" has been successful is that with each hint given, there is more mystery also added in each episode. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't but nevertheless, it was enough to keep the series going for six years straight. With \\"FlashForward\\", the main premise is the investigations to why these FlashForwards are happening and people having to deal with their own visions from the future, good and bad.<br /><br />When the first DVD featuring the first 10 episodes was released, I wrote in my original review:<br /><br />So, far the series has done a good job by drawing the viewer in and I can imagine, if the series during its return followed \\"Lost\\" during the 10:00 p.m. Tuesday time slot, the series will do quite well. It's a very cool series with a good amount of sci-fi, action, mystery and also a series with a lot of potential. I really hope this series lasts more than a single season because it's very good!<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"FlashForward\\" received news that it was being canceled and for those of us who did get into this series, knew that this series was planned for a five season run, not one.  To make things worst, the last episode was created as a cliffhanger for a second season which would never come and thus, we are left with this major build-up to a series that ends with a cliffhanger and no resolution. I wish ABC would have given the series a better timeslot and for the most part, a chance.<br /><br />I really hate when this happens.  And many were hoping that the series would go to a new network but with other cast members now on other shows and writer and director David Goyer working on the third \\"Batman\\" film, it looks like we're not going to get any closure with this series.  But fans are now hoping for the series to be picked up at a new network and many are hoping social media can help find this series a new home.<br /><br />Let me say that I enjoyed this series.  I will have to admit that perhaps there were too many characters that the series tried to focus on that some FlashForward storylines for supporting characters felt out of the blue at times but for the most part, I really enjoyed where this show was heading especially if the writers were able to get a second chance.<br /><br />The acting was well done and a big kudos to Joseph Fiennes and John Cho who did an awesome job in the series.  Also, it was great to see a really cool cast of former LOSTies such as Dominic Monaghan and Sony Walger and even a few \\"Battlestar Galactic\\" talents show up on the series as well.  This was a series that had a lot of characters and in many ways, it was very demanding that you had to watch each episode without missing one.  But for those who were loyal followers to the series, this first and final season was enjoyable.  In fact, I watch this series throughout my whole weekend, nearly non-stop because I enjoyed it so much.  I found the series to be compelling, entertaining and once again, a series with so much potential.  So, it's a little bittersweet to know that you enjoy a series so much and there is no closure.  I wished ABC would at least have given the series a chance for the writers to tie things up.  It's really unfortunate.<br /><br />As for the DVD release, fans of the series will like the fact that the series comes loaded with special features and easter eggs (not that hard to find).  Some with scenes that appeared in the last DVD but for the most part, plenty of new special features that will make fans happy with DVD box set.<br /><br />Also, if you purchased \\"FlashForward, Season One, Part One\\", you get the $15 coupon which can be applied to this set and also a manufacturer's coupon for $10 off additional if you purchase any other ABC related boxset that has been released in August-September.<br /><br />Overall, \\"FlashForward\\" has turned out to be quite a riveting series and definitely a series worth watching!  Many wonder if I can recommend a series box set knowing that at this time, there are no plans for  a second season, if you are afan of the series, then yes.  But with the way the series ending on a cliffhanger with an expectancy that a second season would be coming and looks like it won't be happening ever,  it makes it even harder for me to recommend because this is actually an awesome DVD box set.<br /><br />But if I had to review this DVD based on its overall package and its first season alone, then I will have to say that it's definitely recommended and you get the bells and whistles that comes with this DVD box set.  So, for fans of the series, this DVD box set is recommended.  For those who are curious about the series, it's a great series that had a lot of potential, but a potential that will never be realized due to its cancellation and that is unfortunate.<br /><br />NOTE: There are reports that Starz is interested in giving \\"FlashForward\\" a second season.  Let's hope so!.

B00005R2IS|5.0|In the not-too-distant future, the roads are ruled by anarchy. Gangs control the streets, destroying anything in their path and killing as they please. A rouge cop sets off on a suicide mission to take out these ruthless thugs after his wife and child are murdered out of spite by the gang leaders. As opposed to the over-the-top action that drove THE ROAD WARRIOR in the years to follow, MAD MAX is a much more character driven film, with all of the heart and soul that was missing from the subsequent sequels. Mel Gibson provides a powerful breakthrough performance as Max, a man pushed over the edge by hatred and grief. Director George Miller creates a series of dynamic chase sequences filled with incredible stunts and heart-racing suspense. While the film appears to be extremely graphic and violent, Miller tastefully implies the most horrific moments off-screen. In the most devastating sequence where Max's family is run down by Toecutter and his gang, the camera focuses on the road just past the action, as the bikers speed past and a small shoe and ball sprawl across the pavement. The combined effect of George Miller's fast-paced action, beautiful cinematography, and timeless revenge plot make MAD MAX one of the most exhilarating post-apocalyptic thrillers in the genre.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000062XE1|5.0|Well I guess that is a matter of opinion. However, it is not easy to outperform the BBC. This is a great collection from \\"The BBC play of the Month\\" Series.<br /><br />It is not so much the stories of Oscar Wilde but the witty dialog and moldered attitude that make his plays stand out. In this case, the whit is perfectly delivered by the excellent cast.  Each play brings with it a moral and an enriching ending.<br /><br />\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\"<br /><br />This play has been played and copied by many of the well and not so well known actors. It would be strange not to have it preformed on a local stage. So before watching this \\"BBC Play of the Month\\" production you will come into it with a certain expectation and standard. Found Coral Browne's who also is in \\"Lady Windermere's Fan\\", acting clearly overshadows that of the other actors. The big advantage of this production is that it is a play and everyone knows it.<br /><br />Jack Worthing (Michael Jayston) a gentleman by adoption makes frequent visits to the town to visit his fictitious brother Earnest. There as Ernest he can be unscrupulous at will. That is until he meets Algernon Moncrieff's (Julian Holloway) cousin and falls in love. As luck would have it, Algernon's cousin Gwendolen Fairfax (Gemma Jones) was always in love with the name Ernest. Now Jack must tell Algernon what he has been up to. Algernon seizes the opportunity while Jack is in the town, to play his mysterious brother Earnest. Now Algernon falls in love with Jack's ward, Cecily Cardew (Celia Bannerman) of who mysteriously has always been in love with Ernest.<br /><br />Oh what a tangled web we weave. How can either Earnest explained that he is not Ernest and is this true? On top of this Algernon's aunt, Lady Bracknell insists that Gwendolen can only marry a true gentleman by birth. Keep an eye on Miss Prism (Lally Bowers.)<br /><br />\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\"<br /><br />Who wants to look young forever?<br />Basil Hallward (Jeremy Brett), who up until now was a mediocre painter. after meeting Dorian Gray (Peter Firth) a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Basil's friend Lord Henry Wotton (John Gielgud) influences Dorian Gray.  Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.<br /><br />At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted.  He falls in love with a beautiful young actor Sibyl Vane (Judi Bowker) who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about.  Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she is just a common girl.<br /><br />Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery.

B00175GCEU|1.0|America's self-titled first album is likely the best effort the group ever had. The cohesive mix of songs (excluding the worn-out \\"A Horse With No Name\\" which was NOT included on the first release, but was added later by studio executives hoping to sell more albums from its inclusion following the song's hit status as a single) was unmatched by any of the group's subsequent efforts. Moreover, the quality of the original recording, mixing and mastering was extraordinary for a freshman effort, especially from a heretofore unknown group of *almost* teenage guys. Unfortunately, the Friday Music release, whether due to the mastering efforts of Joe Reagoso or others, is HORRIBLE! The sound is reminiscent of that produced when singing through a toilet paper tube - pinched, flat, and lifeless. To confirm that it was this release and not the master tapes from which it was spawned, I compared it to the original Warner Bros. first-pressing, green label release, which I also own. The original release contains all the detail, life, and genuine good sound for which the album shines. If you like this album, and you like it on vinyl, DON\\"T BUY THE FRIDAY MUSIC RELEASE. Instead, find a good used original copy. You'll be glad you did.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|SO I picked up one of these at Toys 'r US yesterday and thus far I must say i'm impressed. The reason I picked up this controller in the 1st place is because I primarily play a lot of shooters on my Xbox 360 and the transition to the PS3 controller was always a bit of a PITA (pain in the a$$) due to the placement of the analog sticks and the shoulder buttons as well as the fact that for someone with larger hands, using the analog sticks became painful after extended play.<br /><br />Design-wise it's a handsome gadget, flat black with buttons that light up (a nice touch, especially for a $35 controller), a bit on the light side, but that's not a deal-breaker. For the most part it feels solid and well-built and has a textured grip that feels great in my hands. It comes with a USB dongle that has to be plugged into one of the USB ports on your PS3 and to charge it has a mini-USB cable that attaches from the controller to the dongle. It would've been nice if it was bluetooth out the box, but hey, it's a $35 controller and still managed to include sixaxis control and rumble. It took about 40 mins to charge fully once I got it out the box. Setup took a min or two for syncing.<br /><br />This controller to a large degree mimics the layout of the 360 pad, especially in the placement of the analog sticks-spaced further apart so my thumbs don't start hurting after extended play. Just as importantly, the shoulder buttons (primarily the R2 and L2)have been lengthened  slightly to give them more of a \\"trigger\\" feel that for me improves play when using for shooters.The only thing I don't particularly like about the analog sticks is they have a bit too much give and could've been a bit stiffer. The D-pad seems ok, I don't play a lot of fighting games, so it's not something I can give much input on.<br /><br />Overall,I think for those of us who have issues with the standard PS3 controller this is a great buy. I'm thinking of going back through some games collecting dust as it really does give a whole new life to playing on my PS3 again.life to playing on my PS3 again.

0061205699|5.0|Harper Lee's book is perhaphs one of the most moving, touching nd genuinley charming tales in literature.  The central themes, prejudice, honor and bravery, could come off as moralistic or dry in the hands of someless skilled, but Lee delivers with pure warmth.  The grave trial of Tom Robinson (falsely charged with rape by the a family that is the epitome of 'white trash') is balanced with the voice and humorous insights of Scout, the novel's nine-year-old narrator: for all of the import of the trial and the town's divisveness on the race issue, we have Scout's insights, when watching Calpurnia cook, that \\"there may be some skill in being a girl after all.\\"  Each character is brilliantly brought to life, from the graceful Miss Maudie to the enigmatic Boo Radley,   but perhapps none more than Atticus Finch.  Perhaps the most honorable character in literature, Atticus (an attorney) takes the unwinnable task of defending Tom Robinson because if he did not, \\"he would not able to look his children in the eye.\\" Atticus does what is right regardless of personal sacrrifice. This wisdom and heart is immedialtey evident in Jem and Scout, who, almost insincitvely carry themselves with the same honor and sense of right.    But what makes this book great is not just the bravery in the face of hate or the dignity of the Finchs. What makes the book memorable is the charm and humor: the games the children played to coax Boo Radley out of his home; the children's keen observations of the adults around them; and the puppy love tale of Scout and Dill.  With each page the characters and the setting come alive and cannot help but evoke a smile.  This is a book to read again and again, revisiting just how wonderful it is.

B0035G9ABQ|4.0|So I ordered this CD recently here on Amazon.  I have to say I'm impressed as usual with the style of the album, but it definitely is a bit of a departure from the Gorillaz usual sound.  The Snoop Dog track just sounds like a Snoop Cameo song.  It rocks, it's just way more Snoop and way less Gorillaz type feel.  That being said, White Flag really has the usual mix-up great feel they are known for.  It mixes all sorts of styles together in that perfect way.  Rhinestone Eyes...my favorite song on the album for sure.  It's easily a classic by them and is pure gold.  Stylo has a very retro feel and is a great song, but a bit too downbeat disco for me to want to play it over and over again.  Superfast Jellyfish....is just a plain odd combo of styles.  The dialogue is not really needed and just nonsensical.  That being said, the main parts of the song are fun and light with Damon Albarn's vocals.  Glitter Freeze is primarily instrumental but very much an amazing song.  On Melancholy Hill is lighter/somber but very fitting.  Sweepstakes is also quite fitting and great.  The other tracks....really fall a bit short in my opinion.  They just don't flow with the whole feel.    As a whole this album is very different in it's entirety than Demon Days.  Demon Days has a certain flow and completeness to it that this album lacks.  While this album doesn't have a cohesive feel the songs on it definitely justify the purchase.  Some songs though, just kind of fall flat though.  Some Kind of Nature and Cloud of Unknowing stand out most in my mind.  Anyways, it's a worthwhile Gorillaz album, but definitely no Demon Days.  The CD itself was suprisingly a paperback.  I really don't mind (I put it on my Droid anyways) but it was odd.  I guess it helps them save costs.  Gotta love the cover art and insert =)

B000ICL3KG|1.0|This Inconvenient Lie by the paid shill Al Gore used computerized material from the movie \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" as some proof of what was attempting to be pushed. It is common knowledge by now that Gore's shockumentary has been completely disproven. The \\"hockey-stick\\" graph was forced to be removed due to the manipulation that created it. It was found that the rise in temperature is then FOLLOWED by the rise in CO2, not the other way around. The IPCC has been caught in numerous lies and data manipulation, and is now being told to stop reporting on Climate Change. Anthropogenic Global Warming has been completely disproven and only misinformed conditioned idiots still believe in it. The planet has actually been cooling since the late 90's......but it will begin to rise, and then cool, and then rise, and then cool, etc. - just as it always has. The earth, sun, and surrounding planets all go through cycles - they always have and always will. When the earth was warming and blamed on AGW, so were the surrounding planets.....I suppose the same temperature increases on Mars must have been due to SUV's and corporate pollution too!     This all for the purpose of restricting what humans can do while implementing a Carbon Tax (futher robbery) and a Global Tax. Carbon is necessary for plants to breath, in turn producing oxygen so we can breath. Restriction, profit, and eugenics are the aim here. Gore was being sued by 30,000 scientists and climatologists for this, but I am sure most have not seen any of this on the owned corporate media propaganda.    I am all for reduction of polluting and the way we treat the earth, but I am not falling for this propaganda! Do your homework people!!! Stop allowing them to form your belief systems.....stop being lazy.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Disclosure: I generally do not like CGI effects, however, in the case of Trek I am very impressed. Gene Roddenberry must be smiling in Trek heaven at this generally noble restoration and enhancement of his most effective baby. While there are some episodes (generally in the later years' episodes, such as The Tholian Web and Elan of Troyious) that were better off than before the upgrade, the overhall was quite worth the wait. The Gallileo 7, Arena, Space Seed, and A Taste of Amageddon, stand out as greatly improved with substantial new material.     The video, as many describe here, does suffer from some grainy issues, but generally, the enhancements are effective and plentiful, giving brand new views of the Enterprise, new space shots and compellingly effective views of shuttlecraft and the many alien planets, which are color cooridinated to the look of the shows'skies (a brilliant move!).     One thing that really gripes me is the intro Space: The Final Frontier speech is very poorly rendered, and is almost inaudible in stereo, and hardly better in 5.1 surround. That is unacceptable as it a trademark of the show. It is almost as if the separate channels of the audio are out of phase with each other, therefore cancelling each other out. Very poor 2 stars for that.     Otherwise the audio I rate at 3 to 4 stars, and occasionally rising to five stars in a few episodes, as they are jpeg for the most of us. It is not unusual for the alarn klaxons to be mixed in stereo, and many of the audio effects that were formerly mono, are now in rich stereo and dolby 5 channel. I believe most of us that do not have the HD DVD are precluded from accessing the HD portion (with the exception being the money grabbing Blu-Ray format) of the video.     Jpeg Dolby 5.1 audio was very expensive in its day and is still pretty steep for most of us now. How many of us really have big 5 channel stereos and a sub? You have to have that to get even a glimpse of Dolby 5.1. Blu-ray's superior audiocan only shine if you have multi thousand dollar 5 or seven channel stereos, and how many consumers have that? Even my doctors, with all the money they make, say that studio monitors, which is what blu ray HD audio requires, is out of their reach. Truth is Dolby 5.1 audio was good enough for the majority of us. I have a 5.1 system and believe me it sounds nearly perfect. Dumping all my gear and getting new amps and receivers and a blu ray system would be nuts. I refuse to be a studio chump and dump my good gear for some studios and electronics stores to make a mint off of me is not gonna happen.    I have to agree, this is overpriced and it is true that the packaging being cheap plastic, leaves much to be desired.     This being Star Trek, the show material is first rate and most of us here love Star Trek or we would not be considering this DVD set. This is all I can write for the moment. I will add more later...
0321687299|5.0|Rarely is it a joy to read a tech book. Yes, the information you glean may be a wonderful, if it helps you increase your skills, but the book itself can be fairly mundane. This book blows that mold apart. I found myself chuckling my way through it, looking forward to the next little wise-crack. And lest you think it's a couple good writers without a lot of knowledge--think again. The information is top shelf as Bruce and Remy have been involved with the development of HTML5 and absolutely know their stuff.    Read it cover to cover or skip around in the chapters as a reference--it's well laid out, logical and highly informative. They don't mince words about what works and doesn't right now. As a front-end developer myself, I'm extremely into the practical--what can I implement in my work now--what needs to wait? This book has enough pages to really give you a feel for this evolution of HTML as well as some of the new APIs that will soon be at your fingertips.     As to the previous people removing a star for the book's printing problem--while I get what you're saying, it's a shame to make this book seem like any less than 5 stars. It's about the information. I got one of the messy books (they've been reprinted now) and to be honest, my books look like that in no time anyway--well the good ones that I dog ear anyway. ;) It's a shame the printer flubbed the first run since anything other than a 5 star average for this book is just wrong (many won't read the reasons and will just look at the overall average).     Regardless of the initial issues, this book is a must have in the library of anyone that is keeping their eye on the future of our craft and wanting to stay ahead of the masses.
0634022296|3.0|This book IS complete, all the songs are here.  The only problem is the binding of this book. It is almost impossible for anyone who is actually USING the book to play songs on the piano or guitar or any other musical instrument that requires two hands in the production of music. A spiral binding on this book would make it MUCH more user friendly. Then the book would stay open and not fall off of a music stand. I bought the book and a friend in the book binding business carefully removed the original binding and put it into a spiral binding. TA-DA, it is now actually a usable book of chords for musicians. If you are just gonna sit on your sofa and look at the chord/words and maybe sing the tunes, then I would give it 5 stars.

0670021652|4.0|If you can think for yourself, are passionate about questioning assumptions and open to a bit of subversion read this book! Here is your chance to have your mind opened if you will allow it.   Gilbert gives herself to the conundrum of commitment as only a very bright questioner of authority could. She gamely challenges her own nagging doubts about the institution of marriage. She explores the twisted route (or roots) of its transformation, and maps its frequent changes over the last few centuries.  If you are perfectly comfortable following the prescribed societal routines, if you are deep fried in any kind of fundamentalist religious beliefs and opposed to discovering historical context that might rattle your adamantine notions, if you expect this book to sing the praises of the bloated undertaking that is currently assumed to fulfill all a girl's princess-shaped fantasies, go elsewhere.

0439023513|5.0|I'm still shattered from this trilogy, and dealing with its emotional impact by finding literary and historical parallels. One of the most obvious parallels is the Roman Empire, eventually brought low by the ramifications of its own decadence (President Snow is quite the Caligula; the Hunger Games themselves are straight-up gladiatorial contests, with Finnick's trident as an obvious allusion; and there are even the emetics at the banquet from one of the earlier books). The Capital depends on the provinces for everything, including its military, which was part of the reason for the fall of Rome as well.     I found the different reactions of each character - Kitniss, Peeta, Gale, Prim, Finnick - all very realistic. Some will break, some of those can be fixed, some will go hard and unbreakable, some will find their path, some will just be sacrificed and yes it's totally unfair.    What happened to the Romans when the Vandals came through the gates? And what happened in Germany, and in Britain, and in Ireland, and in North Africa? History, like Collins' epilogue, shows that while civilization goes dark, life and light can still go on.

B003L20IHE|4.0|Overview: Charlie and his younger brother, Sam, are enjoying the last few weeks of summer before Charlie goes to college on a sailing scholarship.  Tragedy strikes and Sam's life is lost while a tormented Charlie's life is saved.  Instead of going on with life, he lives alone in the woods and starts working at the cemetery.  Why does he stay behind?  Because he can see his dead brother and promises to meet him every day to practice baseball.  Thus begins the story of Charlie St. Cloud, a young man who \\"stops living\\" because he can see dead people and does not want to let go of the memory of his brother.<br />Good Content: Charlie's dedication to Sam (alive and dead) is a good example of being a good brother.  Even when Sam has died, Charlie keeps his promise to Sam.  Later in the film Charlie turns out to be a rational young man as he makes a choice between \\"himself\\" and another person's life.<br />Spiritual Content: The fact that Charlie can see dead people is not necessarily creepy.  It's more of a psychological thriller than anything.  Charlie and Sam have a conversation about what would happen to Sam if Charlie broke his promise and stopped visiting him.  Sam is concerned he will \\"cease to exist\\".  Charlie's life was \\"saved\\" by a paramedic who is a strong Catholic.  Later in life the two meet and the paramedic asks Charlie why he was \\"given a second chance to live\\" and if he will use this second chance for a good purpose.  The paramedic believes saving Charlie was a heaven-sent act.  He wears a pendant of St. Jude around his neck.<br />Sexual Content: Charlie and his girlfriend Tess spend a night together in the cemetery.  Nothing is seen because the camera cuts out right before anything happens but cuts back in afterwards.  Same tells a few crude jokes (I only got one of them because another audience member was laughing as if it was a dirty joke).<br />Violent Content: We see some aspects of the car crash that Charlie and Sam are in.  We see them while they are in the ambulance-Charlie's face is somewhat bloody.  Charlie gets in a fist fight with another young man.<br />Profanity: a total of about seven or eight profane words ranging from h-- to s--<br />Conclusion: Unnecessary elements (such as the cemetery scene, some language) make this a PG-13 film.  While the idea of the plot seems \\"iffy\\"-a young man spending time with his dead brother-it doesn't really touch on anything spiritual in terms of life and death.  Rather, it is more of a psychological, \\"think about it\\" film.  Borderline tragedy, chic-flick, drama, this film is recommended for mature audiences who are not opposed to somewhat \\"unrealistic\\" stories.e-Charlie's face is somewhat bloody.

0385736002|2.0|Magic, mystical creatures, and of course alchemy are all wrapped up in \\"The Alchemyst,\\" by Michael Scott, but  do all of these factors really make up for the big faults with this book? Every book depends on great dialogue, great characters, and a great plotline to make the book interesting. This book seems to be lacking in all three of those departments. With all the cliché dialogue, an unrealistic plotline, and the unimaginative characters, this book is very bland.       Twin siblings, Sophie and Josh Newman, have their first encounter with the magical world of alchemy when Josh's employer \\"Nick Fleming\\" has his book store destroyed. The stereotypical heroic protagonists come to Fleming's aid to rescue the poor book store owner, and as they go to help Fleming the twins meet the evil alchemist, Dee. Dee begins showing off the powers of alchemy while trying to steal a powerful book, called the Codex, from Fleming's store. Just as Dee is leaving with the book, Josh stupidly runs up to the powerful Alchemyst and rips some pages out of the book. Dee successfully escapes obtaining the book that could destroy the human race , and capturing Fleming's wife. As Fleming and the children run away from the half destroyed book store they begin to roam around San Francisco. Nick Fleming then informs the twins that he is a powerful alchemyst, named Nicholas Flamel, they are the chosen ones who can save the Earth, and they all must all work together to awaken their powers so they can use them, while protecting the page's that Josh ripped out of the book. From there the rest of the book is about Flamel trying to track down elders that could awaken their powers.         One of the biggest problems with the plot is that the solutions to the main character's problems are very absurd. In the book the Codex is the most powerful book in the world and Josh, by luck, ripped out the only two pages that could end the human race. Flamel even notes how absured these chances are by saying \\"ifJosh had wanted to take two pages from the book, rendering it useless, then Josh couldn't have chosen better than those\\" (pg.27).Out of the millions of pages Josh could have ripped out he ripped out two most important pages, and the probability for that seems highly unlikely. Later in the book Josh again has this miraculous luck again as he saves everyone from destruction by \\"running Dee over with a truck breaking the spell he was chanting\\" (pg.356). The author continues to favor using this technique of defying the odds by luck as though he had written himself into a hole, and that was the only way to keep the story going.        The character's importance and roles in the plot make them seem as though they should have personalities larger that life, but in fact the characters are very dry. Flamel's wife is the classic damsel in distress, needing to be saved by the hero. The twins are the historic good twin versus the evil twin, trying to fight to the death. Dee is the bad guy trying to conquer the world. Even their appearances seem stereotypical such as the evil alchemist being a \\"pale, unhealthy- looking gray- white skin man\\" (pg.5), and the twins being \\" blonde hair, and blue eyes\\"  (pg. 16) . It's as though the author has based all of his characters off of old television shows, and movies that have the same stereotypical looking character for every role in it.  He doesn't try to create any uniqueness with his characters by giving them flaws in appearance or personality. He makes all of his characters bland to the point that everything the characters do or say feel fake.       These characters fake persona is also paired with their cliché dialogue. In school, every English teacher tells their students not to use clichés in any of their writings, because it'll take away from it. If students know better than to use clichés, then why would an author use one? The dialogue is so predictable that when Sophie saves Josh they have a classic brother sister moment, where Sophie rescues Josh, anyone could guess that Sophie would say, \\"you're my brother! I'll never abandon you\\" (pg. 364). Any reader would assume that this wouldn't be so bad if the author only used clichés every once in awhile, but the author chose to use every cliché he possibly could. He even made the last sentence of the book cliché when Flamel's wife is facing her capturer, and he says \\"it is ending mortal \\"and she unoriginally says \\"one the contrary, it is only the beginning\\" (pg.369). One of the most commonly used endings, and out of all things an author could write for their ending, Michael had to use the biggest cliché there is. It's these kinds of things that make the book increasing frustrating to read.        The quality of a book comes down to the characters, dialogue, and plot line. Overall, this book is not fun to read. Everything is predictable, the characters are unimaginative, and the dialogue is very obnoxious to read because of the multiple clichés. This book is basically the same as ever other fantasy book there has ever been, because there is simply nothing new or original about it. Unfortunately this book seems to be a waste of time, even though it originally seems promising. This book is defiantly a letdown for all fantasy genre readers.

Peeta and Katniss are favorites of the Capitol and unwitting heroes to the rest of the districts that compromise the country of Panem. But one man despises them and he's the one who seems to hold all the power. In a surprising twist of events, it's back to the hunger games for them- and though Kat is certain this time it truly does spell the end for her, she's determined to keep Peeta alive- and have him take the Games.<br /><br />Catching Fire is of course a stunning sequel to the surprise hit, The Hunger Games. Although I LOVED where we ended- even though it leaves us hanging over a fairly big precipice- it took the book a while to get there. Between Kat pussyfootin around who she truly cares about and lost in the malaise of the surprising twist of events of the first book, I felt like the story got kind of lost for a little...<br /><br />...Until the Peacemakers come to District 12. The day Gale is caught, is the day it gets serious- and thus the story.<br /><br />As I said after I read The Hunger Games, post apocalyptic fiction doesn't get much better than this- especially Young Adult fiction!<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 from me- Almost a 4 because of the slow beginning, but the ending definitely kicked it up a notch! :P

0066251982|5.0|Beautifully written book. I fell in love with the story and author's words. The condition and shipment was pristine.  I am so pleased to have placed this order through you.  Thank you.
B0000YEE7Q|5.0|I liked this story so well when I first saw it, I wrote a musical to it which was performed for 5 nights at the St. Timothy Theater in Baltimore.  I couldn't have done it without having first seeing this film which followed the book so carefully.  Thanks for putting it on DVD!  I will enjoy going back in time and seeing it again.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|As other reviews have stated, WM20 is one of those events that would have a very hard time living up to the hype that had advertised it dating all the way back to Survivor Series 2003.  In some lights, the event lived up to the hype, and in others.. it didn't.  There are a few things that stop this WM from being a 5 star show.      United States Title:  Big Show vs. John Cena  This is the last time you will see John Cena on the undercard of Wrestlemania, or any WWE PPV event for that matter.  This dates back to the times where Cena was a \\"rapper\\" and would give the crowd a little rhyme before the match began.  The match was pretty good and probably the best choice for an opener to get the crowd going.      World Tag Team Titles:  Rob Van Dam & Booker T vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak  As stale as this match was, I liked WWE's attmept to get a lot of its tag teams involved in Wrestlemania.  The match was nothing you have never seen before, and could have used something else.  I suppose the competitors are not to blame, because the talent was all there.        Christian vs. Chris Jericho  This is one of the matches where you can watch over and over again.  It lasts for a lengthy 20 minutes or so, but the action never stops.  The psychology of the match with the love triangle with Trish Stratus adds to it as well.  This is debatable one of the best matches on the card.  The ending is something genius as well.      Mick Foley & The Rock vs. Ric Flair, Batista, & Randy Orton  This whole handicap match was mostly focused around the storyline that Mick Foley and Randy Orton had going.  I guess the main point of the match was to further their storyline and create an impact with the Rock returning to the ring after a year of absence.  The match itself was predictable and nothing you'll remember tomorrow morning.  Perhaps just that Foley loses to Orton at WM in a quick and sudden pinfall.      Evening Gown Match:  Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Miss Jackie & Stacy Kiebler  This is the type of match where you just have to take it for what it is.  No, the wrestling quality is not all there, but I don't think anyone is honestly expecting it to be.  The match is somewhat amusing.        Cruiserweight Title Cruiswerweight Open:  Chavo Guerrero vs. Rey Meysterio vs. Tajiri vs. Akio vs. Billy Kidman vs. Jamie Noble vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Funaki vs. Nunzio vs. Shannon Moore  Odddly enough, this was my favorite match on the card.  The stipulation for the match is a brilliant idea.  With all of the different superstars going in and out of the match, it enables the pace to continue, giving plenty of high flying arsenal and different finishers.  The psychology added to the match helps it as well.  The only one thing that brings it down is the ending.      Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar; w/ Stone Cold Steve Austin as Guest Referee  I feel that the WWE really lost out on this one.  The storyline going between these guys was not very believable and the hype was a little annoying.  Both men would leave the company right after this match.  But this is a review of the match, so as for the action, it was a little sparse.  The men tried to build our \\"raging suspense\\" by waiting several minutes before they would lock up.  The crowd was torn throughout the action, but was very much alive.  My favorite part was the ending when Austin gave both Lesnar and Goldberg a stunner.  How appropriate.      WWE Tag Team Titles:  Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Farooq & Bradshaw vs. Bashams vs. Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin  No, it is not Deja Vu, just a repeat in stipulation from the raw tag title match.  Although still stale, this match was a little bit better than the previous one, but that still isn't saying very much.  Worth a look, but probably does not belong on the card at Wrestlemania.      Women's Title:  Victoria vs. Molly Holly  I'm sure WWE had to pay Molly Holly a lot of money to get her to have her head shaved once she lost to Victoria.  WWE usually does a pretty good job in booking solid women's matches for Wrestlemania, and they continued to do so here.  The match was nothing spectacular, but flowed nicely and was botch-free.  When comparing to the divas division today, I will definitely settle with this.      WWE Title:  Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle  In my opinion, this match outdoes the triple threat main event from raw.  The match had plenty of time and delivered throughout.  Eddie and Kurt are always reliable for good matches, especially when they are paired with one another.  The grapples and counters were solid and enjoyable.  You could definitely tell that the two men put a lot of effort into their work on this night.  The ending slightly brings this down.      The Undertaker vs. Kane  This was nothing in comparison to their match at Wrestlemania 15.  The hype for the match was perfect and the entrances were excellently done.  As for the match, it was again, nothing special or memorable.  At this point, I think we are all pretty much sold that Taker will never lose at Wrestlemania.  What can I say?  I was amused.      World Heavyweight Title:  Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Beniot  I was very satisfied with the caliber of this main event for WM20.  Like I stated earlier, this was not as good as the Smackdown main event, but it still did deliver.  I think we all knew the outcome going in after Beniot won the Rumble after entering number one.  Aside from it being a nice time in history, it was just a good main event, nothing outstanding.  But again, I was satisfied.    While I think that this event is important for many reasons, it still lacked a couple of things.  Most of the matches delivered for the most part, but none of them really went to the next level like they potentially could have done.  I enjoyed this Wrestlemania thoroughly, but wanted a little more.  It is also noteworthy that both of the main event winners are now deceased.  I recommend.
0786939532|5.0|Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome. Okay, now I got that out of my system. Here is an example of one of the most superb writing styles that I have ever encountered. There is a masterful balance of action, adventure, and character/plot development that is rare to see. Typically, heavy action detracts from everything else, but not here.The characters are so well described and developed that they practically come to life.<br /><br />The book takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a world for Dungeons and Dragons. You don't have to be a gamer to read and enjoy this book or the other two in the trilogy although, if you are familiar with the world, you'll have that much more description going in.<br /><br />This book starts from the nitty gritty beginning with the birth of Drizzt Do'Urden, one of the most famous characters in Forgotten Realms. A drow (dark elf) by birth, he is born with strange lavender eyes and a good, moral heart that is extremely rare amongst his kin. In drow society, males are subservient to females so he is already at a disadvantage due to his gender. As the time goes by and he is exposed more and more to the evils and brutality of his kin and their evil deity, the Spider Queen Lolth, he realizes that he will never fit in with them.<br /><br />If you enjoy fantasy, I am quite sure that once you pick this book up you won't put it down until you are done or you are in desperate need of food.
0439023513|3.0|Not quite as good as \\"The Hunter Games,\\" but better than \\"Catching Fire.\\" This wasn't highly anticipated by me, so I guess I would've been fine with whatever direction Collins went with it, but I was hoping for a little more payoff. And why was this book so bloody and depressing. There isn't much humor in it, leaving it feeling very one-note. Good, but you'll probably forget it once you're done reading.

It was nice to take a peek at the characters again but it was more like all the same people were playing different parts.

B0013N7AD8|5.0|Makes the original Batman movie look really clear.  In my opinion these are more cartoonish and kinda colorful and entertaining.  I think the newer Batman movies (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight) are much better than these but still should be in every Batman fan's collection.
B001FB563E|4.0|Post apocalyptic movies usually fall into just a couple categories when it comes to the plot. Of course they all evolve around the world as we know it ending in some disaster, but after that what do the survivors do? The Road is the kind of movie that delves very deeply into that kind of thinking. Other PA (Post Apocalyptic) movies use this mostly as window dressing for the basic plot devices often found in this kind of movie. The Road ignores those rules and ends up with a pretty disturbing, outright depressing, but strangely satisfying sci-fi film.     So what happened? Maybe Mother Earth got tired of the bullcrap and started tearing everything up. Maybe those crazy humans \\"finally did it\\" and suddenly wrecked the planet in the process. Let your imagination go wild on how. The movie doesn't really say. That's the beauty of it too. Instead of having the audience fixate on some exposition on what happened before the start of the movie we are pressed to focus on what's going on now with the end result. It also keeps us from focusing on how to fix it or coming up with ideas on how to overcome it. We are stuck with the players in this film as to how to survive.     And that's where the plot comes from. This movie doesn't really follow the standard PA plot of having some overlord of the wasteland to overcome like The Road Warrior or The Postman. There is no mystical haven to find like Waterworld or to a lesser extent Cyborg. There is no solution to save the world like Reign of Fire or Children of Men. Technically there is no plot at all. It's more like a series of events that transpire in the lives of our intrepid father and son duo. The real story is behind the relationship with father and son, and if you are a dad this movie will move you. It's all about their actions and reactions to their surrounding situations and between themselves. You get some good character analysis with this movie.     This movie could have gone in many different directions, but it instead stays on a very dedicated track. Director John Hillcoat could have made this a very different movie. There are roving bands of raiders with a penchant for cannibalism, yet the violence and gore are downplayed. Less is more in this movie, and it gives you that chance to use your imagination on what kind of imagery and acts happen off-camera. Other directors may have taken this subject matter and milk if for all the sensationalism they can get (I'm talking to you Emmerich and Verhoeven).     The direction the movie did go I'm afraid isn't any easier to stomach for some viewers. This world on the film is bleak with very little happening to be encouraged by. Even the ending doesn't really give you that much sign of hope if you're looking for something to tie things up nice and neat. In spite of all of this The Road gives you a lot to think about regarding morality vs. mortality. If you aren't afraid to be challenged to think about such things then in the end this movie not only gives you a satisfying ending it also gives you a lot to think about.     Technically speaking the movie looks wonderful. The location shots they picked really sell the end-of-the-world feel of the story and there was very little digital manipulation of what you see. Sound queues take a more important role in this film as the noises both subtle and obvious take part in telling the story. Acting is great. Vigo Mortensen really threw himself in the role, but then again that's what he normally does in every role. The cast selection hits home on this movie.     This Blu-Ray looks pretty good and sounds pretty good, but don't expect to be wowed by the presentation. This movie is full of greys and a subdued soundtrack anyway so it wasn't meant to be a reference film. This is one of those disks that bugs you with a mess of previews when the disk plays (Sony... just stop force feeding us your blasted commercials). The extras are slim pickings with not much to make it stand out over the DVD release. Here's the list:    Audio Commentary: Kind of off the cuff, but does go into the book the movie is based on among other things. The director even admits not really being prepared for doing the commentary, which still makes this a better commentary than many.     The Making of The Road: A relatively short, but sweet documentary that focuses on several aspects of the film with a good amount of detail for a featurette running under 15 minutes. They talk about the book, the actors (including some intruiging tidbits from child actor Kodi Smit-McPhee) and even some production details.     Deleted and Extended Scenes: These are mostly short clips so there wasn't much taken out. Not really a whole lot we missed without it being in the film. Although one delete/retake did have some details that would have raised some interesting water cooler discussions about the ending for those paying attention.     Theatrical trailers: Two of them that don't really get the true feel of the movie. I remember seeing one of them on TV before seeing the movie. If that and that alone was what I wanted to see from The Road I would have been sorely disappointed. No wonder the movie didn't do well in the box office in the states. Now you can see why.     BDLive: A BR exclusive and is something I never really attempted to play with for any movie... ever.     MovieIQ: About the only semi-useful BR exclusive on this disk. When active it gives you a mess of background info on the movie, cast, soundtrack, etc.     The Road is one of those deep movies that challenges you to consider things most people normally don't want to. The Fountain is another such movie. The father/son dynamic is definitely something for the dads. If you're an action or comedy junkie this isn't the movie for you. Drama fans who can get into subtle character development can get into this movie. Serious sci-fi fans may eat this up due to the world-changing environment and implications. The Road is a great movie, but be forewarned it's noteverybody's cup of tea.

1591843065|5.0|The first time I noticed Dan Roam's name and the title of this book was from his liner notes on the back of Ken Watanabe's book - Problem Solving 101 (also an excellent book on its own).    I went curious since his liner notes there is quite different (instead of using words and sentences, he used hand-drawn images) and later on browsed his name thus stumbled upon his website ([...]).    Impressed with the website contents (which practically is the glimpse what the book contains), I immediately take a decision to purchase this book in Indonesia (where I live) but failed due to no stock in any Indonesian bookstore.    This book really changed my way of looking at things, perspectively speaking. It teaches me how to think in a more simple fashion. I am an in house lawyer of a multi-national company, dealing with complex problems everyday, raised by people from many different cultures and mother language to speak (and listen). This book really helps me in such a way I am now able to deliver improved and constructive advices by graphical and visual form - and I am talking about legal advices here!    Read the first chapter and go forward and you will come back for more. This book never find dust on the top of my desk, functioning as my daily reference. It also help in my coaching to my subordinates too.    First time I thought, well... problems now seemed easier to solve. Actually it is not. It was me (or all of us) who had not yet see the problems in a different perspective, instead to think more simple and efficiently. Previously I made a lot of presentations with zillions of slides with tons of boring descriptive sentences/words, but now everything been kept simple in just 3-4 slides - and GRAPHICAL. No more heavy and lengthy words in a legal presentation session - you cannot just imagine if you have not read this book.    I have to admit that this book was my first attempt of online purchasing via Amazon (another kudos to Amazon for convincing me to come back and buy more for sure).

0307712508|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks - Rebecca Skloot<br />5 stars<br />Audio version narrated by Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin<br /><br />I can't recall any other non-fiction book which held my attention so completely from beginning to end. Initially Rebecca Skloot set out to tell the story of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman whose cancerous cells provided the medium for much of current biological knowledge and technical expertise. Over the course of ten years of research, Skloot becomes closely associated with Henrietta's ancestors, in particular, her daughter, Deborah.  Lacks family history touches many of the saddest aspects of racial discrimination and exploitation.<br />As we all benefit from the advances in science provided in part from Henrietta's unknowing contribution, her children and grandchildren still bear the scars of the past.  Skloot makes much of the fact that while Henrietta's cells advanced medical science exponentially, her remaining family cannot afford adequate medical care. As a teacher, I was struck by another aspect to the problem. Skloot portrays the Lacks family respectfully. For the most part they appear as intelligent people. But they are intelligent people with a shocking ignorance of basic scientific principles. Add the lack of education to their well justified lack of trust, it's not surprising that the Lacks family harbors great anger and resentment to the medical establishment.<br />The audio performance of this book was very well done. It held my attention even through explanations of legal precedent and discussions of bioethics. An added bonus was an interview with the author on the last CD.

I caught wind of how good this album was, I was skeptical at first but after listening to a few songs on youtube I decided to pick up the album.

I won't say this is going to save rap because there is so much more crap being made than good music, but it definitely is a breath of fresh air.
0307460444|2.0|I have made about 5 of the cupcake recipes in this book.  I followed the directions exactly, used high quality ingredients- the works- and they all turned out bad.

Tisk tisk to Martha for not providing such a basic, baked-goods recipe element.

0439023513|4.0|Are heroes made, or are they born?<br />If you're on one side of a war, does that ALWAYS mean that your side is the right one?  Can everyone on the other side be that stupid?<br />When is it okay to kill someone else?<br />Are the enemies of your enemies truly your friends?<br /><br />Mockingjay seeks to answer these questions by showing us the brutality of war, and the author succeeds in making it clear that there are no true answers that everyone will agree to.  In completing The Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins manages to keep readers entranced by using Katniss, Peeta, and other familiar faces from the first two books in the series as focal points to the reality of war.  There are lots of stunning action sequences, plot twists, and human encounters in this volume.  There is not a lot of humor or fun, even though there is a lot of action and pace.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, but is kept from 5-star status because some of the plotting is too contrived in order to keep the book's length down to a manageable size for its target audience.
B001CFLHJA|5.0|The best jazz artists typically display a strong balance of developed chops and \\"soul.\\"  All of the personnel on \\"Invisible Cinema\\" do just that.  The compositions are also bold and fresh, while being relatively easy on the ear and even quite catchy.  The lack of complicated arrangements and tense harmonies make this a great album for jazz newbies. Hardcore jazzers will appreciate the virtuosity of the group and the emotional depth of Park's compositions.  Highly recommended.

030726999X|5.0|The pacing in this book is less even than #2, but overall it's more powerful.  This plot is intricate and there's a lot of information that needs to be presented, so sometimes that slows the action.  There are a number of groups working, sometimes in parallel and sometimes in cooperation, and it takes attention to keep straight who is working for whom.  But I found this book at least as engrossing as the 2nd in the series.  And when things started to come together at the end I just couldn't put the book down.  A very powerful end to a very impressive series.  These are some of the best books I've ever read.
1416589473|4.0|This book was a great adventure into the mysterious territory of not-yet-released Guild Wars 2 online game. I enjoyed reading it. I am a Guild Wars 1 game fan. The story helped acquaint the reader to the situation of the future Guild Wars (particularly Ascalon, but also other areas) in a engaging and enlightening way.    The writing was fun to read, but mediocre in places. There were a couple plot inconsistencies, possibly from re-writes in one part that left a related part skewed. Twice there were references later in the story remembering how the party had teleported via Asura gate from Destiny's Reach to EbonHawke, when actually they teleported from Lion's Arch to EbonHawke.    About Guild Wars 2 vs. this book: One of the main characters in the party was a blatant Necromancer, a profession only recently revealed (after I read the book) as a profession that will be available for Guild Wars 2 players. There were obvious elementalists and warriors. They never did tell what the profession of the main character was. He was like a theif, but I don't think that is a GW2 profession. He was good at getting past locks and traps. He favored a sword as a weapon but was only mediocre with it. It makes me wonder if he represents a new profession in GW2 that we don't know about yet. The books also had me wondering how much this matched what would be in the game. Would I be able to climb ropes, pick locks, travel sewers, summon rats, use flame throwers, etc like in the story?
0743298020|5.0|If you love Jane Eyre as much as I do, and as much as the author and main character of this book do, then you'll probably like The Thirteenth Tale. It is at once both an interesting story of its own and a love letter to books that book-lovers will see their own feelings reflected in.<br /><br />It took me a little while to get to the point where I didn't want to put the book down. The first few chapters, while interesting and well written, came before the introduction of any real mystery that I wanted to find the answer to. At some point, however, I did find myself reluctant to stop reading, which is a feeling I wish every book invoked in me.<br /><br />Frequently, I find I've discovered or understood things well before the characters in a story. Sometimes I don't mind this--sometimes that is clearly what the author intends--and sometimes I find it tedious. (But as much as I enjoy the infrequent occasions when I am surprised, what is by far worse than knowing everything already is when I'm utterly surprised at revelations because the author has not laid out the clues properly!) In The Thirteenth Tale, I usually figured things out only pages before the narrator did. Even when the conclusion we both reached was incorrect, this shows that Diane Setterfield laid her clues very well indeed. They were neither obvious nor unfathomable, they were simply elements that, when put together with other elements, produced a reasonable answer.<br /><br />Some people might complain that the references to Jane Eyre, along with other much-beloved 19th century novels, are not subtle enough or, because of some quibble with the writing style or quality or characterization, are too presumptuous. The thought of these people makes me happy that instead of nitpicking or being disappointed, I was simply able to deeply enjoy this novel.
0439023513|5.0|I devoured this book in almost one sitting. I loved the first two books and this final book was no different.  Read it - then read it.  It was so amazing.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  Can't wait for the movie!
1563890410|5.0|This volume of Sandman almost seems like a second attempt at a beginning for the series. We meet the Endless and learn a lot about them, and Dream in particular. We get to see another battle of sorts with Lucifer. We're introduced to a whole bunch of characters and ideas, the stories of which aren't completely played out yet. And of course the ending sets the stage for more stories to come.<br /><br />Since I wasn't a huge fan of the actual beginning, I think this is a great new jumping off point. Plus, I loved seeing all the various pantheons and the interesting ways they were depicted.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|A lot of hardcore fanboys dismissed this film for various reasons, one being that it might have had a few too many references to the original film. While that's somewhat true, it really doesn't lower the films quality whatsoever. I think the problem was that too many people WANTED to dislike this, but if you just take it for what it is, which is an awesome B-movie and just try to be entertained, you might enjoy it. That is, if you like the first two Predator movies.    Coming from a huge fan of both original movies, Predators does the franchise justice. The characters are nothing like the ones in the AVP movies, in a sense that you actually care about who dies. There isn't a substantial amount of development on every character, but the ones that grow the most throughout the film are the best ones to watch. Is Brody Arnold? Not really, but he does make a good performance here.     One of the coolest things the film introduces to the series, is essentially a new breed of super kick-ass Predators. I really liked how they captured the suspense, tension and fear that the original Predator conveyed in the first movie, especially in the first act.    It's not perfect by any means but it's still pretty epic. I would give it an 7.5 or 8 on a 10 scale, a good score compared to the AVP films.    Watch it for yourself and you be the judge.

0440237688|3.0|I had a class on dystopian fiction in college with one of my favorite professors, so between that and the fact that this is, essentially, a book for young adults, perhaps I am jaded. I mean, I see why so many people like it so much, but after reading [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]], [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]], [[ASIN:0316116513 1985]] and great heaping mounds of sci-fi, I find myself thinking \\"meh.\\" I had all the big twists figured out by about page 60, and the biggest well before that.    So, bottom line: if you're just getting started in the genre, this is a great place for it. If you've been in for a while, I think you can skip it, unless you have an obsession for thoroughness or just want to be able to participate in conversations about this book knowledgeably.
081095415X|5.0|I've become a big fan of Nick Brandt's work after a good photographer friend of mine mentioned him. I'm also a photographer and I can truly appreciate the skill and patience it took to capture these images. A shadow falls has a permanent place on my coffee table! I'm mesmerized by it looking through it again and again, as have all my guests. Wish I had close to as many amazing images from my safari in Kenya. But, no matter since I can enjoy Nick's.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|This is the music I want played at my funeral. Jeff Beck is a mature Zen master musician in full control of his talent and his instrument on this CD, with the good fortune to be perfectly supported by a multi-generational threesome with prodigious talents of their own. A performance that transcends genres, if this isn't worth five Amazon stars than nothing is. If you purchase the DVD, pay attention to the reactions of the audience. Most of them realized they were witnessing something unique and historic.
B00000IQW3|5.0|The Last Starfighter was one of my boys' favorites when they were growing up. It's great for the whole family -  a classic!
B003L77TZI|5.0|Are the other reviwers listening to the same Katy Perry cd I am ??  TEENAGE DREAM is simply the best pop/dance cd of the year.  I loved the first album, but this one is full of amazing, fun, consistent songs all the way thru... The public tends to forgets that Katy's lyrics are VERY clever for mainstream pop music as I can appreciate her talent in crafting hook-laden singles.  If you listen closely she infuses her songs with playfull and unexpected twists and turns, but ulimately delivers gem after gem.  As I crank this in my car I can't help but feeling like Katy has created songs which transform into cinematic landscapes (e.g. The One That Got Away, Firework).  Add in her creative videos and thearical delivery, Katy Perry is really the new Madonna, not Lady Gaga (who's chorus contain 2-3 word).  The world has been duped into think Gaga is the best pop diva today, Katy Perry blows her away on every level IMBO.
B00000JXVK|5.0|I love it. Even people that don't ride motorcycles seem to enjoy it. The colors and cinematography are classic and beautiful. This is an excellent film.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I know the title sounds very drastic or dramatic, but thats just how i feel. This movie simply puts the energy of love, in all her glory on display,for the world to witness,and lessons are taught as she is betrayed.I think one of the reasons why this movie is so profound to millions of people, is because straights can witness that gay love is just like theirs. Love is the common bond between all of us here on this green earth, and Brokeback Mountain illustrates that beautifully.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I really loved this book. It was insightful and I think a lot of women today can relate to some of Elizabeth's feelings and emotions. For those persons who say this is only for the rich who can fly around the world....absolutely not true. Elizabeth herself states that you don't have to pursue your self-actualization via her means, but what the book does, is that it opens your mind to a lot of things. It provokes thought and encourages you to look within yourself. I found myself on the same pursuits as her and it didn't require any trips to Italy, India or Indonesia. I also learnt quite a lot from the book; it was not only inspiring but informative and interesting as well    Elizabeth is an excellent writer. It was hard to put down the book; her story and words were very captivating. I am discovering a whole new me thanks to this book and encourage others to read it to see what I am saying.    \\"Your treasure - your perfection - is within you already. But to claim it, you must leave the busy commotion of the mind and abandon the desires of the ego and enter into the silence of the heart. \\" - Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat.Pray.Love
160094048X|5.0|Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar is nothing less than amazing. Every recipe I've made from this book has turned out perfectly. You can tell that the authors took the time to perfect each recipe before including it, and I really appreciate that. It's so nice to finally have a book that makes vegan baking delicious. So many stores and bakery only offer \\"healthy\\" vegan treats, and sometimes you just want brownies, ya know? Thanks to Isa and Chandra for giving vegans everywhere the ultimate guide to cookies.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|If you read the books but haven't seen the movies, don't expect them to follow the books. The Bourne Identity is loosely based on the book. The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum are based on the character but have nothing to do with the books. That being said, they are fun, action packed movies and worth watching.<br /><br />Movies are great to watch in Blu-Ray. Now I am jonesing for a 7.1 surround sound system.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray set is a no-frills set of disks. Nothing fancy. The special features were kind of dull, but they didn't affect my score. I don't expect much from special features, sadly.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I don't know what people are saying it is not portable. The thing is about the size of the new ipod shuffles. The wires do get annoying though.    But it's great. This will give your nice headphones the boost and loudness it needs. Battery life is great and it's really light. If you need music louder (especially at the gym) then this will be perfect for you.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|This one is better than the 2003 release. You see, the 2003 release only goes up to \\"10\\". This one goes up to \\"11\\".
1400052173|3.0|Well researched and an intriguing story, but the book is bogged down and mired in unnecessary details and asides. The author's passion for the subject shines through, and her strong, clear sentences help, but overall, the book was a let-down.
B000EXZI0A|5.0|I really like this album.  I like the songs that I knew and I like the songs that I hadn't heard before.  Really good set of Ramones music.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This is a must have for EVERYONE with a blu-ray player. The narration, music, HD Quality is second to none. People who never watch nature documentaries would appreciate it. I'm 27 years old and I put this on just to kill time with 5 my friends because we're waiting on some people. Friends came but in the end, no one wanted to leave the room until it finished, lol.
B0036EH3WK|4.0|I am confining my review to the Lost Complete Seasons 1-6 Blu-ray set.  I'll leave comments regarding season six and the ending to others.  Those are matters of personal likes and dislike.<br /><br />The biggest positive is that the blu-ray discs were well done, although I haven't had time to watch them all, as of yet.  Nor have I had time to view the extras.  The Senet game looks interesting.  The white and black rocks are a nice touch, and the ankh isn't as bad as another review stated.  The appearance and texture of the set is quite nice and you can tell a lot of thought went into it.<br /><br />That brings me to the biggest negative.  The way the discs are packed is the worst I've seen since getting the complete West Wing set.  These discs are far too valuable to be packaged in slide-in cardboard sleeves.  What were they thinking?  Having spent almost $200 on this set, I now have to spend another $25 for proper plastic cases.  The one aspect of this set reduced my rating from 5 to 4 stars.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I LOVE THIS SET!!!!!  I already had the seasons purchased and I purchased season 6 as well, but I knew this set came with extras (the bonus disk) which I just had to have.  I was very impressed with the quality of the packaging and it makes a great display on my shelf.  It's heavy and feels and looks expensive.  I was a little disappointed with the season 5 Dharma set but this set really makes up for it.  I especially liked finding the bonus disk on my own without help from the internet.  It is hidden somewhere in the packaging.  The bonus disk is really awesome and it was great to see new footage and interviews with the cast again after they finished the series.  I will really miss this show.  :-(

B002JVWR9U|5.0|My daughter is just beside herself.  I was a vendor for the vampire diaries. I worked with someone who was well.... quite awesome and she got us in to meet the cast.  I have to say everyone was so friendly and eager to take pics with my daughter.  She was ecstatic.  Ian (Damon) was the sweetest guy ever. He was so friendly and just plain FINE.  I can't wait until the box set comes out tomorrow.  I will be there early to get it for my daughter....and well, me too.
B00004RFCM|1.0|The delivery time was so long in the first place, plus the shipment got lost in transition, and the vendor didn't update the tracking.

1416589473|4.0|I really enjoy this book! It was one of few that kept me flipping pages when I should have been doing something else. It may help future readers to read up on the Guild Wars 2 races and some of the lore as a sort of prep for the book, but it's a great read either way.
0393312836|4.0|Although the condition of the book was a little iffy for its price, it was a great buy and a great book.  Thank you
B000957O7S|1.0|This dvd was advertised as beng in like new condition. There were a couple of skips early in the movie which I could live with.  However, one complete scene and most of another one is not playable at all because the dvd freezes up. Not satisfactory at all.
B000JQTWPO|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book. Betteredge is my favorite character. Sit back and let the story take you along on a twisting ride. If you figure out who stole the cursed diamond, good for you. But did you figure out how and why he/she stole it?
B000002KAT|5.0|He marched to his own drummer.  Never was, never will be anything quite like Astral Weeks.  How did his band keep up with him?  That great bass.  It all weaves together into a wonderful whole.  I turned that vinyl record over many times, many nights in the early 1970s, trying to figure out this world.  It still sounds crazy great. \\"And I will never ever grow so old again.\\"
B001EIOOVS|3.0|This movie has Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington.  I am having a great expectation that this movie is as good as [[ASIN:B000LPS4BG GoodFellas [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B001O7JHSE American History X [Blu-ray]]], and even [[ASIN:B003KSO3M0 Road to Perdition [Blu-ray]]].  I am hoping that this movie has a great historical significance to the American history. But no. They just talk and talk for 3 hours for how Frank was being hunted down by the good cops.  No action.  Nothing much to learn about Frank (except that he is very smart) or how it is like to live in the 60's. Russell Crowe is pretty good in this movie but all the rest of the casts including Denzel Washington are boring.    One interesting remark they make in the movie is how black people in the 60's can work hard to move up to the ladder even they are criminal. Even the Italian mafia want to see Frank fail. It is a similar remark Gene Hackman makes in [[ASIN:B000059TFO Mississippi Burning]].    I haven't seen the extra in the bluray disc yet. The package itself is just a box with one disc in it.    Nothing special.  3 stars.
B002XTBE8I|2.0|I love Eminem.....he is funny smart witty, hurting, sad angry happy all at once.  A little boy and man.  Incredible brilliance.  That said...this album sucks beyond belief.

044024238X|2.0|After loving almost all of Sophie's other books, this one was really a let down.  I understand that it's fiction, but this was so unbelievable it came off as ridiculous.  SPOILER:  I couldn't believe after Samantha's blatant back and forth wishy washiness that the law firm kept begging her to come back.  NO WAY.      Don't waste your time on this one.
1594481717|5.0|He is right. It looks like that this will be the reality in the future. The open question is only what will happen to the majority of the word population who is left brain dominated. Can the future word be populated only by artists and people able to syntetize? Where from will they take the data to be sytetized? What will happen, in the future, to the left brain directed people? Will they all have to be born in Asia and continue for centuries, to receive low wages?

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Save the best foro the last.   Need to read to believe how amazing this book is  Enjoy
B000UJCALI|3.0|\\"The Shinning\\" is a strange kind a film. After watching \\"One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" I had high expectations for \\"The Shining\\". I am also a fan of Jack Nicholson.    \\"The Shinning\\" is about writer Jack Torrance. He is a husband and father. One day he gets an offer at the Overlook Hotel being the winder caretaker. The reason he wants this job is because he is a writer and this hotel he will be working at is huge and isolated at night, so he can focus on his writing. While writing he would have frequent outburst when he was interrupted and having a hard time starting. His son has the gift of Extrasensory perception. Before they even move into the hotel, he has a vision of his father chasing him with an axe.    \\"The Shinning\\" has a very complex and confusing plot line that actually takes away from the rest of the film. I think part of the reason why the plot is so complex is because \\"The Shinning\\" is based off the novel by Stephen King.    Overall, \\"The Shinning\\" has good acting by Jack Nicholson. He is the reason why the film earns 4 stars. The plot is also good, but I think this is the case where the book is better then the film. I say this because I'm sure that in the book Stephen King can do a lot more explaining of the story.
B000JML7EC|4.0|A timeless classic I downloaded for my DROID phone.  HTC Incredible.  I am finally old enough to enjoy reading this because I am not being forced to do so, as I was when I was growing up.  I highly recommend you treat yourself to this timeless classic, sit back and just plain enjoy a great piece of literature!
0446691437|3.0|This book had some good tips, and it was an easy read.  It's nothing revolutionary, but it does motivate you a bit to get off your butt and want to complete an art project.
0545101425|5.0|I have read some of the reviews on the Final Hunger Games book, Mockingjay. Many of them were under two stars, I am surprised and a little disappointed for those who gave this book bad reviews. I say that because most of the reviews have comments such as, \\"They didn't stay true to the characters\\" or \\"Great Betrayal\\". But what hit me when I finally closed my tear stained book was, \\"Reality\\". This book ended the exact opposite how I predicted it was going to end. Was it sad? Yes. Was is surprising? Never been more surprised in my life. Was I worried about what would happen to the characters and the end? Yes. But what made it so great was that I closed the book feeling like I have finally read a story that doesn't lie to me. Suzanne Collins wrote a book that has some similarity to real life.         I was disappointed in the Twilight books because everything was perfect. Their entire relationship was perfect, their baby was perfect, their family was perfect. They never had a fight. I mean I would have been satisfied if they fought over what color to paint the kitchen! But no, they never fought, they never argued. It was perfect. And it is not reality. All these books set the standards so high. They produce these perfect characters that aren't flawed and make the plot of the story centered around their relationship. But a good writer can make a story be centered around a character that is more flawed than we believed in the previous books.         Katniss Everdeen is a character we believed to be strong and independent in The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. However in the perfect ending to the heart-wrenching trilogy, we find Katniss' past traumas catch up with her. She is no longer the strong person we thought she was, she is now a girl who is scared and afraid of how every move she makes might effect others. Personally I love the Katniss in the last book more than the other two. However it's not just Katniss's character that changes, it's Peeta, Gale, Haymitch,Prim. They are all terrified of what have become of the world they call their home. What evil's lurk in the shadows, what evil's won't escape their nightmares. What evil's won't escape their mind even after they wake.           I believe that people are disappointed in this book because it's a book about war and overcoming fears and betrayal. There is no more perfect guy. There is no more, scared-of-nothing Katniss. It's called real life. It's real feelings, real emotions, real traumas, real life that made this book the best book I have ever read. I closed the book feeling thoughtful and hopeful. I closed this book, crying because it was over. I cried because I finally realized how perfect a murderous war book can be.         Suzanne Collins, I take my hat off to you.
B000RBKM50|3.0|Interesting storyline that kept my interest; however, I must admit that I skimmed the philosophy lessons.  Reading about the great philosophers is a little too much like Philosophy 101. Would I recommend the book?  Probably not unless I knew the person was interested in Philosphy.
B000004CYT|5.0|The Academy of Ancient Music and Christopher Hogwood do a spectacular job with these epic masterpieces. This is not just one of the finest period performances of these works, it is simply one of the greatest interpretations that have ever been done.The recording quality is superb.I highly recommend this set to any one who loves classical music and especially to Beethoven Fans!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Wonderful DVD - I have watched it many times - and no TV commericals - yeah!!!
B003TEO3EI|5.0|4 years ago when \\"A Twist in the Myth\\" was released, I knew the band had finally released their masterpiece. It's hard to top the last album but this album comes pretty close. \\"At the Edge of Time\\" to me sounds like \\"A Night at the Opera\\" but with a way better mix. A lot of the songs are very technical and all over the place but there's a few straight forward numbers that can bring you back to their early days like \\"Tanelorn\\" and \\"Voice in the Dark\\". Blind Guardian's fantastic song writing skills and catchy choruses are as strong as they've ever been. A return to their roots? Nope, just a progression of music they've been doing from the last few albums. I don't want to see them go back to their roots, they've progressed and gotten more talented over time. The guitar sound on this album is monsterous. Hansi sounds as good as ever. One thing that I will say this album has over the last one is that the drums are phenomenal.<br /><br />Overall, this is my 2nd favorite Blind Guardian album...I still consider \\"A Twist in the Myth\\" my favorite. Good work to the band for staying true to their sound and not listening to people who whine for them to make another \\"Somewhere Far Beyond\\" album.
0307463745|5.0|My favorite part of this book was how easy it was to read the concisely well written chapters. So, I will do the same here and keep my review short and sweet. I find myself referring to a chapter of this book to a client, prospect or college about 3 times each week. It is that good.
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan has put together a fantastic view of the industrial food complex. His experiences in the Iowa corn fields, contrasted by his time spent on an organic farm, make for a very thought-provoking story. After reading The Omnivore's Dilemma, grocery shopping will never be the same. Engaging from the get-go, this eye opening book is a must read.
0385523386|1.0|Save your money... She makes prison sound like life in a college dorm -- parties, pedicures, beauty parlor, late night TV parties. She also makes herself out to be Miss Prom Queen. If this is prison, doesn't sound too bad. Kept waiting for something to happen to her, but it never does. Compare spending time in prison to spending time in Iraq and prison sounds pretty darn good.
B0000057D8|5.0|As usual, Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert give a musically and scholarly splendid performance. No doubt, one of the finest and greatest interpretations of these two sets of works, the Brandenburg Concertos and the Orchestral Suites(Overtures). This recording is a must have for any one who is a Bach fan!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Jesse Stone won't be out done.  This is another great movie in the series. Get it.
1844137872|5.0|It was a quick read of course, but the pictures and ideas in it will keep my mind running for a long time. Had to get it shipped from the UK since you'd be pressed to find it in the US surprisingly. Dunno why you can't find it anywhere here, especially since some his art has been in New York and in the US. Anyway, loved the book. It gave me a better look into why Banksy does what he does and I got a clearer idea of his messages. The tips in the back gave me some good ideas too.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|i am going to make this short and sweet...  mockingjay did not live up to books 1 and 2.  Katniss seemed very weak and emotional.  She is not the same hero as before...very disappointing.  please do not read just to find out who she is inlove with.
0812550706|5.0|This book is a classic, sci-fi or otherwise. I read it the first time many years ago and have lost count of how many times I've read it. I gave it to my teenage son, who is also a self-professed nerd and sci-fi fan, and he loved it. He said he couldn't believe that I had \\"held out\\" on him for so long. The ending will totally blow you away. This book is not to be missed
0393072231|4.0|I found this book an exceptionally well written account of the crisis from many different perspectives. As other reviewers have noted, we are introduced to a few people, primarily oddballs, who recognized the disaster before the markets did and profited beyond belief. Their stories are very entertaining as are the descriptions of all the bone-headed and greedy lemmings inside Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, etc.<br /><br />The story of Dr Michael Burry is just terrific. A one-eyed money manager with Aspergers, 3000 miles away from Wall Street, was the first to see what was coming and act upon it in a big way. His investors hated him for it, thinking it was a suckers bet that housing would crash. They threatened and bullied him right up until his \\"Big Short\\" came home spectacularly. Afterwards, when his investors were rolling in cash, virtually no one thanked him, or admitted that they were the ones who were wrong. Many of them cashed out of his fund. Just another example of greed and envy trumping gratitude and common decency on Wall Street.<br /><br />I found most interesting the authors description of the actions of the ratings agencies, like Moody's, upon whose gross incompetence the entire bubble was built, and had they done their jobs millions of people would still have value in their homes and 401K plans.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I was reading 4 books simultaneously with this one but it beats the other 3 coz i can no longer put my kindle down making my guesses along the way as to who committed the murder.<br />I told my kids about the book and they learned that its now a motion picture! A testament that its entertainingly addictive.
055357342X|2.0|I loved the first 2 1/2 books of the series.  Character development is an important part of the book to me.  I tore through the first 2 books and thought I had found another wheel of time type of series.  Now it seems, anyone I was \\"rooting\\" for in the series is dead.  I honestly stopped reading it.  Have no intention of going back.  This may be what other reviewers are calling not the usual fantasy.  I personally like the standard fare it would seem.  You know, where there are people in the story you have read about for a thousand or so pages actually live and overcome the obstacles put in their path.<br />The world and politics were well played through the first 2+ books.  That earned an additional star.<br />One thing this does seem to have in common with the wheel of time is an excellent story could have been told in 3 books.  This series (I understand) is supposed to be 7 in length.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is exactly the type of BBC series that I adore.  The characters and the storylines from a time log ago when technology wasn't even a word.  I bought Season Two and came back to purchase Season 3.  I hope there is a Season 4 to look forward to....
0307454541|1.0|I read 1/3 of the book, but wanted to stop from the start.  I kept telling myself that it will get better and to give it a chance, but it just didn't happen for me.  I'm glad it worked out for so many people, but for me it was terrible.  I tried James Patterson's \\"Private\\" and read it in about three days and liked it a lot.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br />G.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I wanted to use some headphones with my HD TV and I looked and looked for the right thing.  With the fiio e5, all I do is plug it in between the output jacks and some headphones.  Then I set the HDTV to use an external sound system, and instantly I have a headphone system that I can use to watch TV. No sound comes out of the TV speakers so no one in the house is bothered by the sound of the TV being on.  Excellent value, especially when I was told that the only option was to buy an expensive pre-amplifer.
0307454541|2.0|I had such high hopes for this book. I don't normally read murder mystery type novels but this book garnered so much national attention I decided to give it a try. It took me several months to read this book mainly because I kept getting so bored I would stop reading and buy another book that was more interesting. The beginning of this book was so drawn out and the background behind the Wennerstrom fiasco (as well as the resolution of it, for that matter) seems like useless fluff to me. I didn't really care what happened with it. I continued to read because of a recommendation from a well respected friend but I think this book just isn't for me. I did not enjoy reading the graphic detail of the multiple sexual assaults in this book and from what I gather this subject is continued into the next 2 in the series. I understand that the author was supposedly trying to bring attention to the violence against women in Sweden as well as atone for his own involvement in a situation, but I can't help but think that writing a series that almost glorifies the subject is counterproductive to the cause. The original title \\"Men who Hate Women\\" is definitely more appropriate...<br /><br />The actual mystery behind Harriet's disappearance is interesting and riveting in its own way, and Lisbeth is an intriguing character I came to love and for those reasons I gave this book 2 stars instead of 1. However, I don't think I'll be jumping at reading the next two books in the series anytime soon. I can't for the life of me understand why this book is so popular.
B002OFWG7O|5.0|We love this DVD. We bought this for the CD, but the DVD was a very enjoyable bonus. Great music, and some very funny music videos. Too bad there is not some sort of television network that just played music videos, wouldn't that be great.
0198326769|5.0|I was a little taken aback by the writing style that Boyne used, but as I kept reading I found Bruno to be a very naive yet endearing character. The pure innocence in both Bruno and Shumel's hearts were for lack of a better word, heartwarming. These boys' friendship despite the circumstances touched me and I found myself thinking about Bruno and Shumel after I finished the book. Bruno represents the thoughts of most young children, he doesn't see the difference between himself and Shumel, all he sees is another little boy wearing \\"striped pyjamas\\".
B003LXSY60|5.0|The Black Keys just get it. Talented musicians, well-produced album, catchy while also substantive, bluesy and gritty in all the right places. I keep listening to this album over and over in my car and I really can't find a single moment where I say \\"hmm, i hope this part's over soon to get to the better part later...\\" the whole damn thing is great. The Black Keys have really come into their own, and with the two awesomely hilarious and rockin music vids they've put out (see YouTube for Frank the Dinosaur and Tigten Up), I wouldn't be surprised if the Black Keys blows up into elite popularity in the next 6 months. Money. This album is money.

B003B02O14|3.0|I've read all of Grisham's books. About a third of the way into this one, I correctly guessed how it would end.  I kept holding out hope that I would be wrong, but alas, I wasn't. The plot and details were captivating but I wish the main character had a little more depth of soul.
044024367X|5.0|I have read all of the Jack Reacher books and found Nothing to Lose to be another great read that adds new dimension to the character. Reacher is a rugged individualist who doesn't blindly follow any conventional groupthink or ideology. This book apparantly has offended some readers who are not as independent in their thinking or ideology. While I would place this book in the middle of the pack of Reacher books(I still rank the killing Floor at the top of the list), it certainly is a better read than the majority of suspense/action books currently available.
0375842209|5.0|I've been reading a lot of the reviews for this book and I've noticed a recurring theme with most of them. Some have been saying that this is not a book that teens would enjoy, but I'm here to let you know that that is nowhere near the truth. Now I will admit that I am an old teenager (19 years old) and that I mostly read mangas (Japanese comics) but although I still love Japanese comics, I'm looking for more novels to read, because I've miss them so much from my days as an avid reader. The Book Thief is a beautiful work of art amidst the vampire phase spurred by Meyer's Twilight series *gags* that I can't seem to escape in bookstores (seriously there's vampire crap EVERYWHERE, and quite frankly I'm sick of looking at it), Marcus Zusak has fired up my desire to read regular books. I'm now constantly on the look-out for more and more great novels like this one and I will be reading more of Zusak's work. I highly suggest any adults out there with teens to let them have a go at this book.
B003TXS5AC|5.0|Overall album review:<br /><br />I've been an Iron Maiden fan since The Number Of The Beast and like a lot of Maiden fans love the post-reunion albums, especially Brave New World and A Matter Of Life And Death. I was reluctant about this new album when I first heard El Dorado but after listening to the whole album about 50 times now I'll say this is among their best work. Actually I've grown to like El Dorado after hearing it in the context of the whole album now. My only three complaints are: a) I wish Satellite 15 was it's own track (I tend to skip it a lot now); b) Bruce seems a little uninspired on the verses in El Dorado; and c) the guitar solos are a little too low in the mix. Otherwise I think this is a mind blowing album and love every track. If you liked any of the recent reunion era albums you'll most likely love this. If you hated any of them then skip this. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Edit and Vinyl review:<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br />I originally wrote this review before receiving my vinyl copy so I was going by the sound of the CD and have now had many times to listen to the vinyl version and take back my third complaint, the guitar solos don't seem as low in the mix on vinyl. Maybe it's my set up (amp, receiver, turntable cartridge, etc.), but the solos sound much better with this configuration. Which brings me to the sound quality of the discs: absolutely awesome! Even though these are picture discs which apparently may have compromised sound quality, I'm very impressed with how they sound and think they sound just as good as regular vinyl records. The only time pops and hisses are audible are in between songs or when the music is relatively quiet such as the first part of The Talisman which isn't that big of a deal and in my opinion adds to the experience of listening to albums on vinyl.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The look and feel and overall packaging is phenomenal. I couldn't expect it to be any better. The inside cover has sketches by artist Melvyn Grant on each side (page 12 from the CD booklet). The first sleeve has some of the lyrics on one side with a space illustration  behind them (pages 5-6 from the CD booklet), and the other side a huge Eddie skull logo. The second sleeve has the rest of the lyrics with another space illustration in the background (not in the CD booklet), and the other side a close up of the alien Eddie (page 1). Each record has a picture on each side: Side 1 is the album cover; Side 2 is the alien Eddie; Side 3 is a silhouette photo of the band (back cover of the CD booklet); and Side 4 has a sort of moon in the center surrounded by various Eddie skull logos. Aside from a few dings on one of the sleeves and a \\"pop\\" on one song, I'm thoroughly impressed and happy with my purchase and say buy this in a heartbeat if you're either a collector or have a turntable and want to hear one of Maidens best albums on vinyl.12 from the CD booklet).

0375826742|5.0|The Inheritance series is just excellent reading.  Amazing to think the author is so young!  My only issue is that it takes so long to get the next book written so I can continue immersing myself in the saga.  Great job!
B00288KNJU|5.0|I bought the blu-ray/dvd 2D/3D combo for a few weeks and haven't watched it until now.  I, my wife, and 2 kids finally watch this movie (2D - Blu-ray) and we all love it very much. The animation is absolutely amazing with crystal clarify and great depth. My children (3 ½ yr-old daughter, and 15 month-old son) glued on the sofa watching it without any interrupts (maybe they are scared a little ).  I've watched most of the family/kid animations, and this is one of the best that get a high score in my collections.   Don't be afraid based on the reviews, watch it and you'll love it too.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|After several listens I like each of the tracks. Unlike some of the other reviewers who only like the first track I think the first one is one of the the weaker ones.
0439023513|5.0|Wow where to begin. It's been a long time since I book made me feel so many different emotions. I don't know what it is about the last book of series but they always end up upsetting me for different reasons. Why the authors feel it has to be a huge roller coster ride is beyond me. But that was how this book was. I laughed, I cried, I felt sick and just whipped out at the end. I couldn't put the book down I just couldn't leave my characters hanging with things so unresolved. This book really shocked me with the amount of gore, violence, horror and death. It definatly surpased the other books. I don't know how they can call books like this Young Adult. I am having trouble with all that I read, I just want to sit down and cry, not for the characters but people who have actually had to live threw war and then face a lifetime of the memories.

B003X73QA8|2.0|Is this supposed to a concept album.  I don't know but it feels overblown though that other reviewer is WAY off anything on MTV is not indie...  and wow My Chemical Romance?  Anyway... I don't know why I don't care for it other than in my musical life I've always wanted to look back and not forward scouring what came before to see how what is popular today got here.  And inevitably I find myself more and more unimpressed with new stuff because it has all been said and done before.  I feel bad because it just get more jaded.<br /><br />This album feels like the tried to hard to make a message and rock it.  It feels like they really tried to put out something to make music critics drool over because the last album was just so good (I wouldn't know).  I don't care about indie that term is bunk anyway.  Jacqui Naylor is indie and she isn't on MTV or the radio so explain that.<br /><br />Anyway.  It is loud and rockin' and certainly better than most of the trash that we Americans collect and call music.  But it is not better than stuff from the underground scenes of the 60s, 70s and 80s in my opinion.  And I question when a band gets popular in the way Arcade Fire has.  Does this mean they have become so generic they appeal to a wide base?<br /><br />Sure this has always gone on but I would argue the quality was better back in the early days of rock. Dynamic range anyone?  In the it feels bloated and pompous and self important.  Not my bag.

0385504225|3.0|Brown is great at writing the scenes and keeping up the tension.  The overall content could be organized better -the idea of Noetic science and collective consciousness gets mentioned everywhere, seemed repetitive at places. However, I am glad he is telling the mass about it. We do need to move that way.    The story is gripping, but it's the same old monstrous, grotesque antagonist chasing and butchering Langdon and company. At the end I still don't know what the \\"lost symbol\\" was?  Is \\"symbol\\" exchangeable with the \\"word?\\"
0066620996|5.0|This one's been on my \\"to read\\" list for years until I finally got around to it recently.  I always wanted to know what differentiated a truly great company from the also-rans.  The book is incredibly well researched and details what makes a great leader, for example.  Surprisingly the \\"Level 5\\" leaders were the lower key executives - not at all like Steve Jobs.  These CEO's also placed a premium on getting the \\"right people on the bus\\" and found ways to keep them motivated so they'd stay at the company. Perhaps one of the biggest takeaways for me was how to create a culture of discipline - which frees you and your employees up - creates less bureaucracy and increases your competitive edge.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I was wanting to see this release and I finally saw it, just finished 2 minutes ago. I figured that I would, probably, enjoy this movie which is why I rented it. I had no idea at how much I would love this movie. This is an extremely well made animated feature. My eyes never left the screen. You can pretty much figure out who the Red Hood is within the first 10 minutes, and later on you find out how \\"he was made\\" which, in the Batman universe, actually does make sense and will not make you roll your eyes. The animation is very detailed. The voice-acting is spot-on. The Joker is voiced by a different actor now (Bender from Futurama) and though it might take a little of adjusting he does a good job; Mark Hamill is still the best, though. The story, though quick, is a good one. My only, real, complaint is that I wish there would have been a little more back-story of the Red Hood and the reasoning of his exploits. But overall this is a great, great, animated feature to add to the Batman universe. I hope, in the future, there is a continuation of this movie. In my opinion it beats the first 4 batman movies. I have to re-watch \\"Mask Of The Phantasm\\" to see if I like it better or not, but it definitely beats out the 4 Batman movies, easily.
0143113100|5.0|Doidge makes a convincing case for neuroplasticity by presenting a wealth of research and case studies that show the brain continually changes itself *throughout a person's life* (hence the title). His book shows that the human brain is more plastic than previously thought and lays to rest the long-held beliefs that (i) each brain function is localized (or mapped) to only one specific part of the brain (localization) and (ii) the neural pathways in the brain become more or less fixed after we reach adulthood.<br /><br />This book is easy to understand for any layperson and although a rudimentary understanding of how the brain is divided (i.e. left hemisphere, right hemisphere, the 4 lobes: frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, etc.) would be helpful, it is certainly not necessary. This book stands out from other books I've read on neuroplasticity because Doidge approaches the topic from a rather unique perspective. Throughout the book, he discusses neuroplasticity in terms of how we each can exploit it to our advantage. He shows, for example, that bad habits that have been deeply entrenched *can* be broken, and that it is possible for romantic love with one's spouse to last a lifetime -- all through the process of the plastic brain re-wiring itself.<br /><br />The Brain That Changes Itself provides a very in-depth treatment on a very fascinating topic. I had trouble putting the book down once I started reading it. I think you will likewise find it a very engrossing read from start to end.
0439023513|5.0|After finishing \\"Mockingjay\\" last night I feel compelled to chime in. I should preface this by saying that this is ALL of course just my opinion, and I respect the opinions of anyone, agreeing or dissenting. This is, after all, a book. Also I should state that **there are spoilers below**.    I read the book over the course of two evenings.  For those that did not feel entertained by this heart-rending and bittersweet tale, I have to wonder what book they were reading -- I couldn't put the thing down.  And I can honestly say my response to reading the last moments of \\"Mockingjay\\" was as emotional as almost anything else I've read.    The great joke (of the whole series, but it's brought to light particularly within the last half of \\"Mockingjay\\") is that this is not a 'young adult' series. It's an adult series with young adult characters.   People are seeing these books in the Young Adult section, because that's how the book is marketed, but William Golding (\\"Lord of the Flies\\") never went this dark or adult.     So my first recommendation to anyone I've pushed this series towards is to just remove the dust jacket and start reading. Don't pay attention to what section of the store this book is found in, or how it's categorized in Amazon. That's all a sort of red herring that I suspect occurred because the folks in publishing were trying to figure out the best way to distribute the story from an author previously known for 'young adult' works.     When the prejudice and expectation of 'young adult' is removed from this trilogy and the story is asked to stand by itself, what we find is a very overt allegorical tale that is written with expert pacing and a great respect for the audience.     It would have been very easy to form a romantic structure that \\"Twilight\\" fans are very familiar with here. Such relationships are enjoyable in their own way and provoke us to feel certain titillation. I'm not ragging on Twilight or stories like it. But \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy demands different things from its readers, and rewards us differently.      Suzanne Collins does something a bit different here.  She lets Katniss be an adolescent (that's an important component) that shoulders enormous responsibility.  Then, as an adolescent woman, through the series, she's exposed to feelings for two different young men while suffering the horrors of a broken family and war.  Gradually, the horrors of war win out.    Katniss is strong, but human enough to break down. Human enough to be damaged, irreparably, by the choices she feels forced to make. Human enough to become hollow, suicidal, running purely on instinct after she has bathed in enough blood. That's not depressing or dark, really. It's good writing, dimensional writing, writing that displays an understanding of psychology and our condition.    By the end of \\"Mockingjay\\" Katniss is a war veteran, and we realize that war is hell, and that though there are rewards for survival and perseverance, we can all be pushed to a place that breaks us. Despite this, despite being quite broken by the time \\"Mockingjay\\" nears its end, Katniss had just enough mettle to finish her mission. And these are who many of our real life veterans are -- men and women pushed to a place they cannot return from as a result of their internal sacrifice.     It was bold of Suzanne to resist the temptation to give Katniss, her family, Gale, and Peeta a truly 'happy ending'.  I am sure, if she is a writer who becomes emotionally invested in her characters (as I very much suspect she is), then writing this book came at a real cost to the author. Suzanne isn't pulling the wool over the eyes of the reader to get across a message, though surely the message is there for all to see. She's struggling through a manuscript because she probably wants nothing more for Katniss than to see her healed and happy, but a higher ethic forces her as a writer to deliver us the story as she knows it truly plays out in her mind and heart.  And that's how you respect your audience.    So, before anyone jumps to a conclusion about who Katniss ends up with, what happens to her family (the relationship with her mother), and Gale, I would ask anyone to stop and think for a few minutes about the process a writer goes through in culminating and completing a carefully plotted story. Nothing in the end of \\"Mockingjay\\" is done without care and forethought, including the fact that Katniss's mother and Gale are only mentioned in brief.  There's a reason for that.     The best fiction is not only entertaining, but challenging and provoking too. There's nothing wrong with an escape, but the best escapes eventually bring us back to reality, reveal interesting and important tools to deal with what's before us, and increase the depth and richness of our understanding. Suzanne Collins has attempted such, in my estimation with fair success, and I offer her praise for it.
B003UYUR10|5.0|Before we begin: DO NOT READ AMAZON'S MOVIE DESCRIPTION! It gives away too much of the plot.<br /><br />Now then: I don't hold out much hope for movies based on video games (or films involving Sir Ben Kingsley because of the many flops he's been in during the last decade+), but Prince of Persia (PoP) genuinely surprised me with its depth of characters, fantastic costume design, and entertainment value. I found myself totally immersed in the fiction and loved every moment of this film.<br /><br />For non-gamers, there's no need to know anything about the games this film is based on. I played the first PoP as a middle school student (20 years ago.. yikes!) and barely remember the basic plot. All you need to know is that this is a fantasy action-adventure set in ancient Persia. It is about love (between a father and his sons, the bond between brothers, and the love of a man and a woman), loyalty, courage, friendship, and betrayal. This kind of story has been done many times, but it's done very well here by Disney, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and director Mike Newell ([[ASIN:B000NQPZCO Donnie Brasco]], [[ASIN:B000Q6ZG52 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]).<br /><br />It's a \\"sword and sandals\\" epic: fantastic costumes, lots of sword fights, horses, men in armor, a beautiful princess, and a mystical dagger. For the guys, there's the lovely Gemma Arterton, who plays the same kind of character/love interest as in [[ASIN:B002ZG9788 Clash of the Titans]]. She is never difficult to look at. And for the ladies, a beefy Jake Gyllenhaal plays Prince Dastan, the adopted son of the King of Persia, a noble, wise, and just ruler. Dastan is later framed for the murder of his father and spends most of the movie running from his pursuers while trying to restore a sacred artifact to its rightful resting place. Along the way, he meets an cadre of unlikely friends. Though minor characters, they are very well-written and provide some of the film's best moments. I especially liked the gregarious sheikh, played by Alfred Molina (Dr. Octopus from [[ASIN:B000UR9T82 Spider-Man 2]]) and his M'baka companion.<br /><br />The sets, CG, and costume are all lavishly detailed and superbly designed. Everything looks wonderfully ancient and historically appropriate. The main characters all speak with British accents (and are British actors) though they're supposed to be Persian, but it works! Dastan has some really slick combat choreography. Parts of the film look like another video game, the more recent [[ASIN:B000P46NMA Assassin's Creed]] games, both because of the ancient Persian setting and the rooftop acrobatics. Add some super-duper bad-a** assassins and you've got good times here.<br /><br />A light-hearted and fun movie, this is what summer is all about, with absolutely no WTF moments for me to complain about. Highly recommended.by Alfred Molina (Dr. Octopus from [[ASIN:B000UR9T82 Spider-Man 2]]) and his M'baka companion.     The sets, CG, and costume are all lavishly detailed and superbly designed.

0439023513|3.0|I was very disappointed with this book, and spent some time deliberating about giving it a two or a three.  Ultimately I chose the three, because despite its flaws, Mockingjay did offer a resolution, albeit a rather unsatisfactory one.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book was that I felt like I lost all of the characters who had grown so dear to me since The Hunger Games.  I can't help but get the impression that in her push to publish the end of the trilogy, Collins lost her way.  Katniss is a shadow of her usual self, and because the book is told from her point of view, the story suffers drastically.  Collins also uses a lot of quick images and half sentences, especially towards the end of the book, in a breathy pace that speaks more to an author rushing towards the end than to the character's state of mind.<br /><br />You will find a resolution in this book, and it is bittersweet enough that you don't feel completely cheated.  It is nice to have an ending, but I wish this ending had been told differently.  In fact, I sort of wish Collins would come back out with Mockingjay, Version II ... but I find that unlikely.<br /><br />I'm sure people have delivered enough plot synopses that I don't need to go through the paces of saying what is what, but merely stick with what I felt was book's strongest failing point: we lose Katniss as a character, she becomes a deadened puppet, two-dimensional, and frustratingly selfish.  I felt that this was less Collins' attempt to show how Katniss was coping with the world around her, and more her inability to handle the complexity of emotions Katniss was suffering.<br /><br />That being said, you should read the book to finish the trilogy.  And you should read the first two books because they're so well done, so full of the talent and intricacies that Collins did not show in this third book.  I don't warn readers away from the last installment, but I do warn them to be prepared for a finish that does not do justice to the trilogy, to Collins, or to Katniss.

My reason to read the book was to understand the capabilities of the new HTML 5 features and browser support for them. The book succeeded.    The book covers Canvas tag, Video support, Offline storage, Geolocation, new Form input elements and extending HTML5. The only HTML5 feature not covered in too much detail are web workers.  For each feature the book explains support for major browsers and the iPhone and Android browser.     The book also explains a couple of potential gotcha's when implementing some features like the section on cache manifests. Very valuable.    The books style is chatty and informal. It provides a  useful links for further reading at the end of each chapter and is a great primer on HTML 5.

0765326353|5.0|Brandon Sanderson fills me with awe. He's so prolific, so inventive, so exactly what I want to read. I was lucky enough to receive an advance reading copy of The Way of Kings, and from the very beginning I was completely enthralled by this new world he's created. It's gritty, realistic, thought-provoking, completely unique, and fascinating. I enjoyed reading every single character's viewpoint, and that's a rare thing; usually in books of this length, there are the necessary but somewhat boring chapters woven cleverly in with the exciting ones to keep you reading. This wasn't at all the case with The Way of Kings; every character was one I was eager to spend more time with. Also rare, Sanderson managed to completely stun with a twist near the very end - one of those perfect twists that are so logical and fit so perfectly into the story that you wonder why you never saw it coming. I love that kind of storytelling, and if you can't tell, I loved this book. It's going to the very top of my \\"Best Books of 2010\\" list.    This is a must-read, folks.
0439023513|1.0|A year is a long wait when you're counting down the days to something you hope will be excellent and rewarding. Mockingjay is not excellent or rewarding. It is a disappointment. If I had known a year ago, after finishing Catching Fire, that what I would recieve in this book is yet another lecture about war, yet another lecture about how unfit we are as humans, yet another lecture about how we are not preserving the planet, yet another lecture... I would have finished the series with that book. Instead I spent my hard earned cash on a book that let down not only me but also every character in the book. Suzanne Collins ruined the characters. Katniss whiny, self-absorbed and hopeless, Haymitch drinking again, Gale conveniently unforgivable, Peeta... well, let's don't go there, and little Prim, district 13, everything... a disappointment.    What a shame. Suzanne Collins didn't solidify herself in my mind as someone who can change the world through her message. She solidified herself in my mind as someone who would use my feelings towards her characters to get me to purchase a sloppily written book in which she intends to proprogate her agenda. Mockingjay is her agenda. The movies will be about her agenda. Unfortunately she cannot rewrite this book, she can't undo what she did and she has lost fans; fans who would have paid good money to see the movies. Why bother now... it all leads to a lecture.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|I wanted to see this in the theater but never got there.  I wasn't disappointed.  I was very pleased that the violence wasn't gratuitous; there was no sex and the story-line was good and pretty unpredictable, which was nice.  They didn't re-do the movie as the exact match to the original, which was great.  Not that the original wasn't good for it's time, but it made seeing this version more interesting and suspensful.  Sam Worthington did a great job and he was fabo eye-candy...hehehehe.  That Gemma chick was a nice addition and the effects weren't over the top, but was left to a blendable, believeable quality...something that Hollywood doens't usually get; OD-ing on CGI is the usual problem with these kinds of films, not so here.    All in all, a great film that wasn't too crazy and actually had a decent plot/story line.  Good actors, good direction and it wasn't so long that your butt went numb...great!  Am going to purchase this one...a keeper.
0321687299|5.0|It seems that one way of making sure your web site is ultra cool and can do anything you ever wanted it to with no browser problems whatsoever is to use HTML5. Or, at least, that's what a rather worryingly high number of publications and web sites might have you believe. The reality is somewhat different, though. HTML is an evolution, not a revolution, and while it attempts to standardise a number of practices that developers have been using over many years, it won't necessarily fix existing problems. Actually, using some HTML5 will introduce fresh problems if you don't apply it right. What you need, then, is a book that takes a pragmatic approach, doesn't sell it as a cure-all fix, identifies the nasties and even sticks its neck out when it feels that the HTML5 spec has got it wrong. I say 'it' but of course, this is a book written by real people, in this case Bruce Lawson and Remy Sharp. Both have been very much involved with the development of HTML5 and its related technologies, and there are few people who I'd trust more to give you the real picture.<br /><br />I began reading the book with the full intention of zipping straight through but found myself repeatedly putting it to one side while muttering to myself \\"I can implement that now, shouldn't take long\\". This is a good thing - none of your 'cloud cuckoo land' thinking here, just sensible advice and examples that you, as a web developer, can implement now or at least be starting to experiment with.<br /><br />Technical books are not always the most enjoyable of reads. It may be a clich&eacute; that techies can sometimes be a bit weak in the area of easy-to-understand communication (and, some might argue, personal grooming) but this is not an accusation that you could level at Bruce or Remy. Reading this book is educational but also fun. You can just tell that the two of them had a few laughs while writing their respective chapters and also seeing which colloquial phrases (with dubious double meanings) they could sneak past the editors (the answer to this is 'quite a lot'; I won't reveal them, you can find them for yourself!). If you find sitting in a seminar room with amphitheatre style seating, learning from a stuffy professor (possibly bearded, maybe wearing tweed blazer) a bit difficult, perhaps you'd prefer a straight talk down the pub with a couple of guys who really know their stuff and will enthusiastically explain it to you as long as the bar remains open, then this is the book for you.ditors (the answer to this is 'quite a lot'; I won't reveal them, you can find them for yourself!).

0345472322|1.0|I was referred to this book by a colleague in my efforts to understand the \\"mindset\\" of a couple of challenging students.  I muddled angrily through the first three or so chapters, yelling at the author for her foolish conclusions and spurious anecdotes, easily contradicting her time after time, and finally ditching the effort.    Anybody who has taken psych 101 will recognize that life and learning isn't this simple.  And anyone who feels their life has changed after reading this book is going to need serious talk therapy down the road.    Dr. Dweck has, apparently, a \\"fixed mindset\\".  Anybody who can categorize all learning and motivation styles into two neat camps is stuck.  Period.     Avoid!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The greatest COMEDY on TV at present.  Sheldon is the BEST by far,  he just cracks me up, the way Penny and Leonard treat him, you would think they where his parents, I just love the whole interaction between the three of them.  Wolowitz, OMG, he really does think he's hot stuff, and good on him for thinking that, as for the relationship between he and his Mother, HILARIOUS.  Raj, well what can I say, I just love him... I laugh myself senseless when when he switches accents, that is just brilliant piece of writing, he and Wolowitz are terrific together, they could even do a spinoff, and it would work.  I do hope that Penny and Leonard never get back together though, there really is no need for a romance in this show.<br /><br />Love it and just can't get enough of this show, we, in Australia are spoilt for choice at the moment as we can access TBBT on DVD, TV, and on cable, we are not called the 'The Lucky Country' for nothing...
B0000VCZKM|5.0|A great movie - my granddaughter got it just in time for her \\"Annie\\" Camp performance.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This CD has all the classics and is the only way to own the new song 'More Than a Memory' which I can't get enough of.  It has a few other new songs as well that are good too.  If you like Garth this is a great buy!

B002ZG997M|5.0|There were many mixed reviews of this movie, but I thought it was great! The ending had a twist and took me by surprise.
1416594787|5.0|The other reviewers have written much more eloquent points about the topic of this book than I could manage so I'll just keep this short.<br /><br />To put it simply, the book is written beautifully. Dawkin's is someone who all I've had to go on previously were the rantings of fundamentalists who were furious with his previous texts or quotations. I expected to find a sarcastic and somewhat sparse discussion on a topic that interests me deeply (science and biology in general).<br /><br />He was pleasant, his words were expertly chosen, he made sure to emphasize when something was his own subjective point and when it was an objective scientific finding. This book went out of its way to be cut and dry, fact is fact, fiction is fiction, no in between. I really appreciated that, I liked how he was willing to say \\"Look, this could very well be because of evolution but frankly I think it is just coincidence and here is why.\\" He didn't grab every single straw that could support the theory, he acknowledged that many folks defending it and many attacking it are extremely flawed in their understanding.<br /><br />The entire experience has been overwhelmingly positive, if you've wanted to read a book that teaches you in a manner that is friendly, non-condescending, and eloquent this is that book.<br /><br />I don't know if the judgments made against him are true, but as of this book he seems like one of the neatest folks in literature. I would love to meet him and discuss the topic. Largely because I now have even more questions and am even more deeply interested in biology. This book will spark your curiosity and surely lead you down the road to learning which I figure is one of the best roads to get walking on.<br /><br />He is to biology/evolution what Neil DeGrasse Tyson is to Astrophysics, they make it relate-able and help prepare you for a topic that can be very complicated but isn't inherently so.
B00371QQ0M|1.0|I had been waiting for the bluray version; but his is poorest quality not even 720p more like VHS transfered to cd. Don't buy if you expect to have a sharp non-pixled picture!
1439110123|5.0|Great book.  A must-read for anyone interested in energy, natural resources, environment, political science, international business, and wanting to understand how we got to where we are now.    The book covers the entire history of oil since its discovery in Pennsylvania in mid-19th century up to the contemporary events.  Though it is thick, the book is rich and thoroughly engaging.  You will not be bored!
B0019N95IK|5.0|For the past 3 years, HD Net has been showing Enterprise in full HD and it is GORGEOUS in HD. Unfortunately, as of yesterday, HD Net is no longer going to show Enterprise (their customer support said their license to play it ran out and they will not renew). I suppose it had to happen after continuously cycling through the 4 seasons repeatedly. However, this is the one Star Trek than I can watch over and over again.    Sci-fi is showing it but not in HD. I suppose I will have to resort to that. I refuse to buy the DVD version, holding out for the Blu Ray. What's the hold up?? As previously stated by others, this one would be so EASY. No re-mastering required, it was filmed in HD for gawd's sake!    Since HD Net is now out of the Enterprise biz, let's get going with this people!
0061537969|5.0|Daughter recommended. I ordered rush and took it with me on a road trip to Montana. This book sustained me at my bleakest hour. I walk daily at a dog park with Bugs and Ernie. I tell everyone about the book. I have not gotten any takers. Oh well this is a classic keep. It will stay on my favorites book shelf for sustenance as needed. This book deals with the big picture.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This amazing story will consume you to the point where you're sucked into the world of Panem. It's oneof the greatest books that I've ever read.
B000NY62MI|5.0|My title is self explanatory, and I myself as a critic, have no derogatory comments on this book. It'll make you happy, make you sad, make you cry and make you laugh. Anyone who is into self discovery and different aspects of life would enjoy this as much as I did.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I JUST BOUGHT THE SAW TRILOGY AND READY TO WATCH THEM THIS MORNING. AFTER 1 MINUTE INTO THE MOVIE. I HAD TO TURNED IT OFF AND NOT ABLE TO WATCH IT ANY LONGER. IT'S MAKING ME DIZZY. THIS IS A VERY LOW BUGET FILM. THE SHOOTING OF THE MOVIE WAS BY HAND AND NOT STEADY, THE SCREEN KEEP FLICKERING......
B0001I561E|5.0|Very fast shipping.  Item exactly as described.  Would purchase from this seller again.
B000BNX4MC|4.0|Enjoyable movie.  One kind of weird thing about this DVD from Amazon (on sale) was my computer (played it on the computer) kept saying that the movie was \\"Pretty in Pink\\", other than that it was in good shape.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|When I received this, there was this bold statement on the cover: \\"Best. Vampire. Movie. Ever\\". This movie did not live up to this glowing statement. The acting was particularly weak, the English was dubbed, and very droll, as most dubbed English is, and dramatic highlights from the book were left out. The story was fantastic. The movie deadened the characters. For me. For example, there was supposed to be a romantic affection developed between the two leads, but that never really happened. This was a huge disappointment to me. The \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" was infinitely better than this. Honestly. But it might be worth your while just to see the very interesting story. The hype is overblown though so keep that in mind.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|this is a great action movie , with suprises in each part a must have movie for all who like action lovers
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I've always liked Cyndi Lauper, but to me, this is her best!  All the tracks are great, but \\"Early in the Mornin\\" is my favorite.  If you like the blues, check this one out.  Reminds me of Janis Joplin on some of the tracks.
142313494X|4.0|I have to give credit to Rick Riordan.  He really know how to put the gods together, under  one smashing roof.      The story is put together nicely with all the Greek Gods, hitting head to head under a false conspiracy that Poseidon's (Sea God) son Percy Jackson, stole the lightning bolt   from Zeus (Thunder God).  News spread like wild fire.  Other Greek Gods were not happy.  Camp half-blood, it community, and demons are running in a panic, hoping for the thunder bolt to be returned   safely to it rightful owner, Zeus.    I Enjoyed reading this exciting tale.  The movie was also good, however, the book provides more information,   and focuses and defines on each of the characters and places.
B00008G8LN|5.0|I had not watched this flick in about 10 years, but it was a good as I remembered.
0307454541|5.0|Another great novel. I loved this book as well as, \\"The girl who played with fire\\". can't wait to read the last book of the sequel.
B002GKXV3K|3.0|Even though this show was all Hollywood gay scene, it did hit on some very important issues concerning society. This Last season was a huge let down because crucial questions weren't really answered.
0199536724|4.0|Being a fan of Wilkie Collins, I have read many of his novels, my favorite being The Woman In White. Some will say The Moonstone is his best work; although, I tend to differ. I found it a bit slower than Woman In White, but still a good victorian read that no one should miss.
B002N8A14M|5.0|This case has worked very well for my ipod nano 5g...I like that you can use the armband or the clip-only.  I use the clip a lot at work.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This season proves that the series is still a fast-paced, exciting and worthwhile bit of entertainment. The acting, directing and production quality was awesome this year, but the writing was absolutely flawless. As a writer of fiction myself, I can tell you that there are very few well-written sci-fi shows out there, but the writing in this series kicks ass! The story line flows logically and secrets are only revealed in small increments at a time, which keeps up the mystery of the characters and of where the writers will eventually take them...Brilliant!
B001CT877Q|2.0|In brief and put simply swapping to the Blu-ray version of THE ERASER was a complete waste of money and it is only because had we not given away our DVD copy to a friend we would have put the BR version back on the market!!!.  Why:?  The Picture and The Sound.  Firstly the picture:   We watch any DVD or Blu-ray(BR)item on a budget priced DLP projector and we do not make any apologies for what we see as our brain comprehends what we are viewing and so the techo's could say rightly \\"well you won't get a good Blu-ray picture on that thing\\"! Perhaps they are right but! hear us out.    When one does view a good BR disc (say any of James Bond BR's or SAHARA or VAN HELSING or THE THING or TERMINATOR SALVATION or I-ROBOT or ERAGON for example) the beads of sweat to hair follicles to facial lines do show up even on our projector. Even previous DVDs when compared to the BR version are noticeably clearer, sharper, more colour and better blacks.  In fact we have concluded using a budget price projector as we have is an ideal way of checking out a Blu-ray transfer as it is more evident to our brain if either poor master print was used or good transfer was carried out and as such any DNR or EE may be noticeable quicker to our brain. We don't know but whenever we see a good BR which has a good review on our projector we cannot but agree with the reviewers point of view not really understanding why as we are not techo'. Our brain does it for us we guess.    The Sound:  We state up front first we are not advocates of DD-TueHD sound but have never been disappointed with any DTS codec either on DVD or BR's (yet that is) and feel the movie companies put the soundtrack of many, many, many so-called BR sound transfers into some form of computer program which transfers the sound from DD to either a genuine DD-TrueHD or a fudged DD-TRUE HD to suit their purposes and for this picture (like a few we have heard)the conversion doesn't work for us. So stick with your DVD copy of this movie if you are looking to hear a BR experience.    Summary:  This picture is one of these anomalies as is COLLATERAL DAMAGE another. The original DVD's were in Dolby Digita (DD) 5.1 and like COLLATERAL DAMAGE sounds no different in BR. The assumption is anything in BR should be better and it is time many buyers realised this is not so. Many supposedly transferred sounds into DD-True HD are not succesfull and that is the truth.  That is what our ears (brain again)tells us any way and yet there are many good transfers from DD to DD-TRUE HD out there too! Such as the BLADERUNNER and 300 are good transfers to our ears.   However because of our AVR's sound codex switched to hear DTS-HD Master Audio we like what we hear from any BR disc which has been done in this format. Especially THE GOLDEN COMPASS which also takes sound to yet another level by being encoded in 7.1 channels as well as DTS-HD Master Audio too.     Conclusion  This is our first review ever for any organisation and please note our comments have nothing to do with the story line, the actor's ability or date of the actors likableness it has to with the two major reasons we buy BR's and that is BR is supposed to give us improved PICTURE and SOUND. We suggest and this is proven by a number of reviews out there to not be the truth meaning we are not getting this from the movie companies. Not yet but we should!!!!.    If this picture came out in DTS-HD Master Audio it would be a good beginning but the picture transfer needs to be worked on.  We feel all the movie companies know what is happening, they don't care and they only care for one thing and we all know what that is. THE $.!!!    Even in my country when USA and the UK were experiencing DTS on DVD's our stores were being stocked in mostly DD and rarely saw a DTS DVD and had to go overseas  to purchase and sought multi region players to compensate.  Indeed here we cannot readly purchase a multi zoned BT player yet and the main player SONY would not come to the party and multi zone my new SONY player even though they sold them overseas. Strange but is not SONY a MOVIE COMPANY!!!! It is simply not in their sales interest to offer multi zoned BR's it would cost them in BR sales wouldn't it!!     Even with BR in the US and UK you can buy for example TRANSPORTER 3 recorded with soundtrack DTS-HD Master Audio however we see it on our shelves here only recorded in DD-TRUE HD.   The movie companies look for widest diversity they can hence REGIONS and ZONES were introduced and when the US and others wake up to it we are all being deceived for one real reason and as a result there is no real freedom of choice - things need to heat up for the very hungry movie companies.     Having read the review of GLADIATOR SAPHIRE Edition and being guided by the reviewers NOT to buy this item we decided to play a part in forums and offer this review too.   Hope you all like our review  Thank you from down under  zoedog43
0439023513|1.0|I loved Hunger Games, felt Catching Fire was just OK, and really did not like Mockingjay.  The ending was highly disappointing.  She spent maybe 20-30 pages winding things up, without a good explanation as to the motivations of the characters.
B0000027I6|5.0|If you loved the best years of Pink Floyd, and in particular \\"The Final Cut,\\" you will want this album! I have had it for several years now, and it never gets boring to listen two. Water's way of expressing his dismay towards the absurdities of our waring ways shines as brightly as it did in the Final Cut, though perhaps in a way that is full of the wisdom of an older man. In the absence of David Gilmore, Jeff Beck steps up to the plate, and compliments Waters in his own way that does not try to overshadow the heart of the music, something that Beck could have been tempted to do. Like all of Water's music, and just like the glory days of Pink Floyd when he was in the band, this album really should be listened to from start to finish. On a technical note, it is also mixed very well. Not perfect, but if you have a good sound system and quality headphones, you will be rewarded quite generously! This album keeps me wanting more of the same from one of the most brilliant musicians of out time.
B000002KCF|5.0|awesome, this is where it all began with his major label debut, great musicianship with clever lyrics.
B002O1TMI4|4.0|After listening to Absolution, Symmetry and Black Holes I can say I enjoy the sound of Muse. The rich voice of Bellamy is not comparable to Thom York and the bass is also generally exceptional in Muse. It reminds me of an electronic, angry version of Queen with classical influences and a dose of a rocking ballad.    It certainly carries emotion, call it \\"emo\\" if it want, but it seems to work in my opinion.    The Resistance is full of some gems like \\"United States of Eurasia\\" , \\"MK Ultra\\" and the \\"Exogenesis\\" bit    Interesting stuff, but I rated The \\"Resistance\\" a 4 because it doesn't quite rock with the energy of earlier Albums
1439102813|4.0|Totally enjoyed the book. It was the book our bookclub decided to read. Enlightening to realize how the person is affected by Alzheimer Disease and not just the family. How confusing in those beginning stages where we all tend to second guess what we have or why we have it or why something just happened. Is it Menopause, brain tumor, a senior moment, stress, or just daily confusion???
B003BWQEU4|5.0|I surely recommend this item.  I myself have bought two of them, one for me (I'm a grown-up however I love Disney Animation) and one for my niece.  There might be only an issue (the Spanish packing).  The discs (blu-ray and dvd) are made in the U.S.A. so  The treatment is the same one given to Pinocchio, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.  If you buy from Import CDs you will pay about US$ 30.00 (not bad at all for Beauty and the Beast is US$24.99, and remember it's an american release).  If you are still in doubt check this link below:  [...]
B002JVWR9U|4.0|For those of us who enjoyed the cheesy humor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the sex and brutality of shows like HBO's True Blood, we get a healthy dose of both in Vampire Diaries. Solid supporting characters in the family and in Bonny and Caroline lead the way to make this show more interesting than just the story of Damon, Stefan and Elaina.  With each new episode you watch, you begin to see different sides of Damon and Stefan that make you look forward to what they will do next. Bonny's story is interesting and I anticipate her relationship to the vampires will continue to grow as she grows into her powers. Damon is sheer delight and reminiscent of a smart-assed, broken hearted vamp name Spike that some of you may remember. Damon and Stefan both can't stay away from women that make them feel as though they could be redeemed.   I found Stefan slightly boring at times, and the Founder's Council seemed a little contrived, but it's good tweeny longing, lust and love in this show, and the Salvatore brothers are nothing to kick out of bed. Heck, for that matter, I wouldn't kick Elaina out either. So curl up, grab you blanket and get ready for a bloody and funny threesome as only the CW could do it.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|BATMAN  UNDER THE RED HOOD    Batman Under the Red Hood is a new DC Universe animated film based on a few different Batman comics that started with \\"A death In the Family\\". The story as I am sure you know by now centers around the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin. I will point out from the beginning this is no \\"Mask of the Phantasm\\" but is by no means a horrible film either. For those of us who read the comics already know basically what the deal is but it was still interesting in seeing how they would fit all that they wanted into an average length film. Did they accomplish what they needed to make this a classic, no, but it is not the worst the company has put out either.    We start off with the Joker and Robin [Jason Todd] spending a wonderful night together all cozy with a crowbar. Well it is actually Joker who is cozy as he is beating young Todd to death and having a great time doing it. Batman is on his way but he does not make it in time as the Joker is gone and Robin is killed by a bomb. Fast forward and time has gone by as Bruce Wayne is still trying to cope with what happened. But it seems he is no longer the big fish in town and neither is Black Mask who's empire is falling to a new crime lord, the Red Hood. The Red Hood has been used by many people including most famously by the Joker, but who is this new guy who can out run and play Batman.    So the race is one as Batman not only has to deal with Black Mask and this new guy named the Red Hood but it seems that the Joker is some how involved. Add in his former partner Night Wing is trying to help out where he can, by the way he was the first Robin but our boy wonder grew up. Now throw in a few more guys and events and you have one rushed and convoluted film, but it is still fun. But to be honest with all that is going on this film seems like it could have been a great miniseries for the DC Universe. But alas it was not meant to be as they crammed as much as they could into this film.     That is over all the main problem with this film, to much in such a short time. Everything else seems fine from the animation to the voice acting. Speaking of voice acting John DiMaggio did an excellent job as the Joker in this film. Everyone else here does a good job as well and all the performances are top notch. Written by Judd Winick and directed by Brandon Vietti this film while heavily mixed with different stories does miss out on a lot that the books had. I could go into all that it missed but that is covered in other reviews but I do recommend reading all the comics.    Also there is an excellent short animated film on Jonah Hex that I highly recommend, I really enjoyed it. It is about a lady, a working lady if you know what I mean, who lures drunk men upstairs only for them never to be seen again. It is just like I said a short film but it is very very good. Also we have a lot of in depth looks at other DC Universe films and two episodes from the excellent Batman animated series from the 90's, 2 about Robin and his origin. As well as an in depth look a Robin in a documentary called \\"Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson\\".    This two disc set is very much worth the price and I do think you should get it when you have the chance. Sure this is far from a classic, well maybe not far because it had potential to be the best. But it fell a little short but remains a very entertaining film and 2-disc set, the special features alone are great. So if you are a fan of DC, Batman, The Joker, or just comics in general I say buy it.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|My children are about Andy's age,(18 and 21), my wife and I took them to see 'Toy Story' (1995) around Thanksgiving which is also their birthdays (11/19 and 11/25)...LOVED IT!!  Bought them both Buzz and Woody for Christmas that year...the following summer we went to Disney World and experienced the great 'Toy Story' parade in MGM Studios...magical.  'To Infinity ...and Beyond' is part of our lexicon.      Toy Story 2, (1999) the quality of the digitalization improved exponentially and the story was great...all of us loved it.  We thought that was it.      Toy Story 3, (2010) again, Pixar has outdone themselves.  My kids are in college, so the wife and I watched it alone...how bittersweet.  I never thought a trilogy had the potential to be as consistently good as this.  Yes, I'll admit it, I cried at the end.  This is up there with 'Godfather I, II and III'... and 'Back to The Future I, II and III'.      Thomas Wolfe was right, you can't go home again...
B00000K3D4|4.0|It is well done and quite surreal. This is a fantastic film for children and adults. David Bowie stole the show as the Goblin King charismatic and musically slope. If you like fantasy or just something different or if you like Glam Rock this is for you. With six songs from rock legend David Bowie Labyrinth is one of the films most wonderful of it or at any time.

0596806027|5.0|As part of my education on HTML5, I ended up with a review copy of Mark Pilgrim's book HTML5: Up and Running.  Like many O'Reilly books I own, this will be one of the books I end up going back to repeatedly while I get \\"up and running.\\"  Pilgrim includes a balanced blend of context and code, which means I learn not only *what* to do, but *why* I'm doing it and how it ended up that way.<br /><br />Contents:<br />How Did We Get Here?; Detecting HTML5 Features; What Does It All Mean?; Let's Call It a Draw(ing Surface); Video on the Web; You Are Here (And So Is Everyone Else); The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications; Let's Take This Offline; A Form of Madness; \\"Distributed\\", \\"Extensibility,\\" and Other Fancy Words; Appendix - The All-in-One Almost-Alphabetical Guide to Detecting Everything; Index<br /><br />As mentioned above, I appreciated the look behind the curtain when it came to finding out why certain standards and features had gotten there.  The \\"How Did We Get Here?\\" chapter does an excellent job in dispelling any notions that HTML standards were methodically and rationally established and adhered to by all participants.  Once you know that, it's easier to understand why some features appear to be compromises and/or might be supported better by one browser over another.  As he goes through each main feature set, he provides plenty of code to show how it's used, as well as a handy chart that references each main browser and what version it started to support the feature (assuming it *is* supported).  Based on that, it's pretty easy to figure out if the feature you want to use will be supported by your intended target audience(s).  He also includes interesting sidebars under the catch phrase \\"Ask Professor Markup\\" that seem to pose the questions you'd ask if you had the author right there in front of you.  Wrap all this up in a writing style that doesn't take himself too seriously, and you end up with an entertaining read that conveys a lot of information in a short 200 pages.<br /><br />One really cool tool he points out is the Modernizr JavaScript library for detecting whether an HTML5 feature is supported in a user's browser.  Rather than try and write your own detection functions, you can just call the appropriate routine and see if it returns true.  So if you want to know if the browser supports the Canvas in HTML5, you can just say \\"if (Modernizr.canvas) \\" and that's it.  Clean and to the point.  Learning about that was almost worth the price of admission. :)<br /><br />At some point I'll likely end up with some 400 page book that covers every little parameter of HTML5 in detail.  Until then, HTML5: Up and Running is going to get dog-eared and post-it-noted while I get myself going.

006621131X|5.0|Gorgeous, lucid, and loving memoir of Smith's early days in New York with Robert Mapplethorpe. The intensity of their relationship is laid bare from the first sentence, and the tenderness with which Smith writes is stunning and profound.  Many fascinating people along the way -- Sam Sheppard, Andy Warhol, Ginsberg... but none more fascinating than Smith and Mapplethorpe themselves.  It's also an extraordinary glimpse into finding your way as an artist in this world -- not an easy thing to relate, but Smith does it gracefully, with no hype or self-consciousness.  My favorite book of the past year.
B002JIOQCO|5.0|If you liked Wolfmother's first cd, this one will satisfy your hunger for more. It definitely feels like part two of Wolfmother. The only complaint is that there is nothing terribly new here, just more of the same. However, when the same was as good as it was, more is better.

B001NFNFIK|5.0|I watched \\"In the Electric Mist\\" on a whim, based upon nothing more than the two actors displayed on the cover.  I had no idea what to expect, or what I was getting into.  In all honesty, I can't think of a better way to describe my reaction to the film other than to tell you that I logged onto Amazon tonight to purchase a copy.<br />I loved this film.<br />From the very beginning, \\"In the Electric Mist\\" draws you into an irresistible embrace and never lets go.  Every acting performance is spot-on, and the dubious culture of the Louisiana Bayou ebbs from every facet of the story.  I also need to mention the excellent soundtrack by Marco Beltrami; it is so powerful that it should be considered a character unto itself. There is a song played during the end credits that is truly one of the most beautiful songs you will ever hear.<br />Seriously, a great movie.<br />That being said, when I logged onto Amazon, I was surprised to see many reviewers voicing the opinion that this film's appeal is limited mainly to fans of the book.  It's true that \\"In the Electric Mist\\" leaves a lot to the imagination, but ambiguity and convolution are two very different things.<br />Take a chance.<br />Watch the movie.<br />Decide for yourself.
B0030U1TA2|3.0|I bought all the items    that day for my grandson's birthday.  They were to be given to him by me and several aunts and uncles.  He had sent me a link to each item that he wanted.  None of us listened or played any of the items, but he is happy with them.
B002Q9MZF6|3.0|Act III of Boheme is one of the most musically beautiful acts ever written in opera. It is book-ended by  two-notes followed by and proceeded by lovely music depicting light snow fall. The Director chose to eliminate these two notes at the end of the act so he could quickly cut to Act IV, thereby, for me, making Act III incomplete. It is metaphorically as if the Director had torn an enveloping arm off the composer's work. I'm surprised that of the 52 reviews on Amazon to date, no one else has even bothered to mention this.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Sixto Rodriguez is underrated and under-appreciated (except in South Africa and Australia where he's some type of a legend). This album, for me, even more than his first, cements Rodriguez's stature as a songwriter and musician that is among the best of his time. My vinyl album is all scratched out - this CD comes just in time.
0553805371|4.0|Some of us remember Dr. Hawking predicting an \\"end\\" to science in the late '80's.<br />He ends this book with the example of self-organizing cellular automata,<br />but fails to mention the ideas of Wolfram or Per Bak.<br />On page 129 he says:\\"that speed limit does not apply to the expansion of space itself.\\"<br />The idea that at some time space may have expanded at greater than the speed of light<br />may have isolated ordinary matter from the Lorentz limited<br />observation of our ordinary universe. That brings up dark matter<br />and dark energy which many authors say is as much as 3/4 of the universe<br />but which Hawking and his co-author leave out?<br />Feynman's QED and the new M-theory are the big winners in this book.<br />This book might be a useful introduction to science for liberal<br />arts majors, but it does science majors little good<br />as there are not equations,<br />just cartoons.

3836501910|4.0|when I read the reviews, Some said that they were disgusted and repulsed by the imaged in the book. I thought that it is a great book. I had some laughs while looking through it. It's not a book to leave on your coffee table when all your family is coming for Christmas dinner but we all have the one dad or brother that we can be like \\"DUDE, check this out!\\"90% of images include genitalia (That's a heads-up). I totally recommend this book if you're into creative, nude,erotic or shocking photography. Just get the book... You have nothing to lose (well, $[...] bucks....

0765326353|5.0|We just posted this review over at Elitist Book Reviews. Go check out our other reviews!    ***The Review***    From the very beginning you know THE WAY OF KINGS is a novel by Brandon Sanderson--you would know it even if his name wasn't imposed over a Michael Whelan cover. Sanderson has made a name for himself through his imaginative magic systems, and TWoK is no different.    He starts with the pacing set at a sprint. Following a series prelude (yeah, there is a prelude, then a prologue), we are put right into the action of things with a mysterious assassin, Szeth. Right from the onset of the novel we get hints of political intrigue, and of shadowy organizations pulling strings like puppeteers. What it seems to us is that Brandon is trying to start faster than his previous novels. His habit has been the slow burn in pacing followed by an explosion of craziness. Not so much here. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Really it will depend on your personal taste.    Ah but we get ahead of ourselves.    TWoK is a hard book to summarize. The worlds that Brandon creates are always well envisioned. Effort is made to make them stand-out. That said, there is usually a bit of familiar in them. The best way to describe the world in TWoK is to say it feels like a rich sea floor...but without the sea. Huge storms ravage the surface of the world of Roshar regularly, and that surface has adapted to them. Plants and animals retreat into hardened shells for protection. Cities themselves are built only where there is a measure of safety. There is a very alien feel to it all, and for the most part, Brandon makes it vivid and easy to visualize. It also helps that there are some seriously incredible sketches of the various creatures of the world come to life. We love interior art work.    As for the plot itself, we'll give you the basics without spoiling the details. War. Lots of wars and battles that are treated almost as competitions, and an excuse for personal gain. For greed. It becomes quickly apparent the level of stagnation that pervades the armies through these motivations. Brandon does seem torn throughout the course of the novel. At times the story is purely setting based, and yet at others it focuses exclusively on the characters. A smoother blend may have been nice, but really this is just a quibble.    Characters. We know Brandon, and we know how much effort he puts into making characters unique and likable. While not quite as good as his MISTBORN trilogy (yet), the characters in TWoK are pretty solid. Kaladin is a promising general on the rise who ends up a slave. Dalinar is a commander of one of the various armies fighting for honor and riches, but he has begin questioning the motivation behind it all while suffering vivid dream-visions of the past. Shallan is an artist whose goal is the theft of a priceless magical conduit. All-in-all, they are great characters. Except...    Look, we like shades of gray. There is none of that with the main characters. They are all good guys, regardless of some of their misleading attitudes and actions. We just wish there were less black-and-white characters in his novels. This isn't really a major criticism, just more of an observation. Brandon's characters in TWoK tend to go pretty emo as well (if we are honest, it caused some facepalm moments). Either that, or they are tough as nails. There isn't a lot of in-between. Most people won't have issue with this, but we felt we should bring it up. We ARE honest after all. It's our third best quality.    As we mentioned earlier, the pacing starts out at full-speed. It serves its purpose in hooking the reader--and it does that extremely well. Things are crazy early on. We get assassinations, epic battles, solitary heroic feats, dramatic failures, terrifying situations and awesome magic. We get all of this FAST. There is a full book's worth of awesomeness in the first third of the novel (which we guess is the actual size of a normal novel...TWoK is a 1000+ page behemoth). The issue with this? The middle third of the novel. When you start the novel with a peak, and end it with one as well, there is bound to be a valley in the middle. That middle 400 pages, while extremely interesting, can drag for less-than-patient readers...especially when that first part is so fast and breathtaking.    As we mentioned, this is the first book in a series. A BIG series. Ten books big. As a result, there is a lot of set-up here. It is done as well as can be, but it is very noticeable that we are embarking on a long, long trip. Our personal hope? That it is broken up a bit like Adrian Tchaikovsky's Shadows of the Apt series. What we mean is that the first few books become effectively a trilogy or quadrilogy. Then two more sets of three. Reading a straight ten book series feels daunting. Not knowing the end until at least 2020? Yikes! Again, just being honest.    We don't want to make it seem like we are bashing TWoK. We aren't. These issues are pretty small-time, and won't matter a bit to the very large majority. So we'll end with what we DO like. We love the learning curve. This has a much steeper one than any of Sanderson's prior novels. We like authors in the fantasy genre to challenge us, and to make us think for ourselves. Now this isn't quite at the Erikson Learning Curve level, but it is still fairly high. We can't stress how happy we are that Brandon is doing this. We've been begging him since ELANTRIS was released to go this route.    TWoK is also better than his previous novel, WARBREAKER. The writing is better, the story is better, and the characters are better. In our opinions, of course. Which are fact. Really, we liked this better than ELANTRIS too. TWoK is right there with his Mistborn Trilogy. We haven't read a Brandon Sanderson novel we didn't like (a trend unlikely to change over the next decade or two), and the Mistborn trilogy is high on our list of GREAT books. So when we say TWoK is almost (juuuuuuuust below really) as good as MISTBORN, it is a compliment. High praise indeed. And this was just the first book. This series has a HUGE amount of potential. This could very well turn into one of our favorite fantasy series ever by the time it finishes.    Brandon's chapter leads, though always great, are freaking awesome in TWoK. Once you get to the end of the novel, suddenly they take on a whole different meaning. This is how chapter leads should be done. We're not sure where they have been done better. Ever.    We love the clarity of the action sequences. The Bridge Crew scenes (especially the first few) are gripping, chaotic, and terrifying. The Shardblade duels and battles are artistic and flashy. Everything truly has its own unique flavor. While the very end seems like it is a little less than it could have been, the final section of the book (originally conceived as a series of epilogues, but now its own section in the novel) is fantastic. It really is a moment where, as the reader, you say, \\"Oh crap. Everyone is soooooooo screwed!\\" Love it.    THE WAY OF KINGS, Book One of the Stormlight Archive, is a fantastic opening entry in a truly epic (in every sense of the word) fantasy series. Every reader of the fantasy genre should buy this book immediately. Fans old and new will enjoy all 1000+ pages, and will be anxiously awaiting the sequel. We sure are. Of course, we've already been waiting for the sequel for a year now...`cause you know, we did read this last year.    Recommended Age: 15 and up.  Language: Not really. Made-up oaths and such.  Violence: YES!! Have we mentioned how much we love Brandon's action sequences?  Sex: Noppers.
0007183305|4.0|I like the format I did not realize that the book is small, actually pocket sized. You could actually have this book in a survival kit. I would pull off some pages that are pretty basic. i have to say I ahve not finished reading. Browsed, now going through throughly. Overall worthwhile
B00004R9A4|5.0|I searched forever and was glad I could find a DVD of Bedknobs and Brooksticks.  It is a very good Disney film and I am surprised they haven't \\"brought it out of the vault\\".  Angela Lansbury is wonderful in this. The story is really great.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|Product shipped and received on time.  Outstanding quality and for a great price too!
0143038419|2.0|With all the hype, I was disappointed with the book.  All women struggle with identity, and this just seemed a little whiny to me.  It was not the best book I read this summer.
0783225857|5.0|I had seen this movie many years ago and was happy to find it for an affordable price on Amazon.  This is an excellent movie, thought-provoking and addresses prejudice--whether against the color of our skin or believing the rumors about others.  I would recommend this to anyone.
0802473156|5.0|My wife recommended that we both read this book after struggling with some marital problems. It is well written and was a tremendous help in overcoming our differences. We especially liked the section where each spouse could profiole their own 5 love languages.    Great job Mr. Chapman!!!
B003J27WFW|5.0|Wow! Very good documentary and of Rush to boot.  Very riveting, we learned a lot about Rush and like/respect them even more than we did before watching this video.<br />Thanx Rush for the wonderful music in my childhood(late 70's, Farewell to Kings, etc) and for Witchhunt- my W. Bush song. There is no hope.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|One weekend AT&T gave free access to HBO, Cinemax, etc. to its customers. I recorded several movies I thought I'd like to watch and Temple Grandin was one of them. I had no idea how much this movie was going to affect me. Not only was it truly inspiring, I also realized I have so many of the characteristics of Temple. Not her speech style or gait, but her thought processes. Through this movie I discovered I have Aspergers Syndrome.     I spent years as a child at a horse stables, which I preferred over being with people. I'm very uncomfortable in social situations because I've never really understood people. I live alone by choice and never had children, preferring my cats to keep me company. I have 3 college degrees. I have spent my whole life not understanding what's wrong with me. Why am I different than other people? Why don't people like me? I have AS and that's okay. For the first time I feel I'm okay.    Thank you for this movie, which I've watched 4 times already and now ordered it. It's okay to be me. I'm different, but not less.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I give it 5 stars-- My only complaint is about the disc sleeves- I don't like that you have to slide the discs in and out instead of popping them off a plastic spindle- I'm afraid the discs will get scratched over time. Other than that, this super deluxe packaging is very, very cool. Fittingly magnificent and unique for one of the best network TV shows ever.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Easy as can be. Shopping for the things my 73yr. old mom would like to have or listen to. She's not into the computer and she lives 200 miles away. I find everything she needs or thinks she needs on Amazon:)
081297381X|2.0|I wanted to like this book because I can identify with many of the premises.  I abhor the faulty use of models - mathematical and otherwise - and I certainly believe in skepticism.  But reading this book was, like interviewing a brilliant psychotic, painful.  The author doth protest too much -- railing against academics, Frenchmen, bankers (easy targets...yes?)-- but in the end the most an intelligent reader will get is the banal observation that models used outside of their appropriate domain are inaccurate and that unpredictable events are...well..unpredictable.  The author has obviously been neglected by the academic establishment and he is hurt, and can't wait to share his wide breadth of knowledge and prove that he is smarter than all those ignorant fools and that he doesn't care anyway. It comes across as a temperamental spoiled brat on the playground. The flight of ideas, forced little tidbits from philosophy to theoretical physics mixed with quotes in other languages and all crammed on each single page comes across as just pathetic.  I get it...you are smaaaart!!  But the ideas belong to others...truly original thinkers like Kahneman and Tversky or writers like Gladwell,Ariely etc.  And one wonders about the true depth of the author's knowledge by little slips...like when he says his coffee cup contains \\"several trillions of atoms\\" (you might want to check how many orders of magnitude you are off here).  The book is supposed to give us some insight about improbable but highly significant events but the title and mantra \\"black swans\\" leave me mystified.  OK, I see that most swans are white and then one day a black swan appears -- uh -- so what??  Couldn't he have come up with something that more accurately reflects his premise?    There are some nuggets of interest here and I suspect the author could write a very interesting book s'il devient moins poseur (ooh la la, je peux ecrire des mot en francais aussi)-- stop with the aggressive megalomania.  Grow up, stop bashing everyone else, focus on your premise and examine the boundaries where it might be useful, trash 98% of the pseudo-erudite bulls*** (2% is OK...like a little garnish) -- and it might grow into something intelligent and worth reading. As it is, the book will appeal to the self-styled avant-garde pseudo-intellectual set and has already generated some copycat publications (even among some of the hated \\"academics\\" who are always looking for something to set them apart from the pack).  But ultimately it isn't going to lead to any paradigm shifts and it is headed for the $1.00 remainder bin.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I did not like Madonna when she started in the early 80s. After Ray of Light, I started thinking she was a serious artist, a music chameleon.  Confessions on the Dancefloor, is one of the best albums I have ever listened to. There is not one song that I did not like.  A lot of energetic, uplifting, modern dance music with a 70s touch. I listened to the CD till it melted. I bought it twice. With this CD she became one of my favorite pop artists ever. She is the Queen of pop, no doubt about that.
B0038LB3YK|1.0|Translation of Mexican terms could not be worse, I started in the prologue, and had to stop inmediately when I read \\"cuerno de chiva\\" instead of \\"cuerno de chivo\\" (correct term in mexico for AK-47), this was done repeatedly over thefirstfew pages.<br />Further more, at the end of this section, they write \\"El poder d'el cerro\\" when its quite obvious that they are trying to refer to the tittle in spanish \\"El Poder del Perro\\". Maybe I bought the wrong edition, but the poor use of Mexican terms makes the book seem stupid. One would think the author would investigate a little bit better when writing about country.<br /><br />Complete turn off.
B001TODCII|5.0|Taken is a moving story of a father's love.  It should challenge young girls out of their indifference to the difficulties which they could encounter.  The kidnapping seems realistic enough, but I'm not sure one man could take on all those professional criminals and succeed indefinitely.
0316067938|5.0|I loved this book.  Of course, I read all the others first and found this one to be just as good as the others. The new characters (and their entry into the story) are well developed--you really get a feel for most of the key players.  The ending was a surprise, but a hoped-for conclusion.  I can't wait for this movie to see how some of the elements of this story are translated to the screen.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the books and the movies.
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|Wonderful view into how much the knowledge of Autism has changed over the past 60 years. I recently saw Temple speak at an Autism conference and am amazed with her mother's perseverance and dedication to her daughter.
B000063KM1|1.0|Could not view the movie.  When I turned it on it said \\"Region Error\\".  Unable to play.  Had to send it back.  Movie Mars e-mailed me that they would reimburse my credit card.  I would have preferred to have the movie.  They shouldn't send out movies that people cannot view.  I am out the postage, both to have it shipped here and to send it back.  The movie \\"Harold & Maude\\" is one of my favorites.  There is nothing wrong with the movie itself, just the fact that I couldn't view it.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|This new remastered \\"Let It Be\\" album is almost like having it released for the first time. Any Beatles fan must have this.     Non-Beatles music people need to listen to this.
B0011KQSZ4|3.0|This is the sort of drawing room comedy that the English do properly. The director, Frank Oz was born in England and can do very good comedic work, so why is this film flaccid and slightly off mark?<br /><br />The premise is promising; an assortment of serious, well meaning, middle-class characters assemble at what appears to be a gracious \\"country home\\" for a funeral.<br /><br />What life event is more sacrosanct than a funeral? The one event where proper manners and appropriate expressions of sympathy must accompany deep displays of loss and despair. This is even more so at a middle-class funeral in England where emotional restraint is the national way. Unlike the US where anything goes and self expression of even the most base emotions is considered healthy......this is England where one is asked to \\"stay strong and carry on\\".<br /><br />And so, this movie is about an English funeral where absolutely everything that can go wrong, goes wrong. Really, really wrong. In so many, many ways. And yes, this is very funny indeed!<br /><br />However, something is amiss. The cast is excellent but not given the cinematic tools to be truly hilarious.<br /><br />Daniel (played by an oddly swollen and pasty be-still-my-heart, Matthew Macfadyen), the dutiful, caring and overshadowed second son who, along with his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes), lives in this stately home with his parents. It is his father who has died and it is Daniel's responsibility to organize and pay for the funeral and deliver the eulogy. Daniel and Jane are the dramatic foils who attempt to make sense out of the mayhem that quickly ensues.<br /><br />Daniel's mother, the grieving widow, is played by Jane Asher (early girlfriend of Paul McCartney and sister of Peter Asher). She is quite glamorous, perfectly coiffed and groomed and although she is wearing black (Chanel?) its a bit difficult to truly worry about her. She will get on with it, one suspects.<br /><br />Why oh why has this mommy dearest stuck Daniel with the bill for her husband's funeral? As if that's not enough, her obviously favored son, Robert (played by Rupert Graves), a fabulously successful author living in New York, also feels no responsibility to contribute \\"to the cause\\". Robert has spent all his money to purchase first class plane tickets in order to come to the funeral. If Daniel has to pay for the funeral all by himself he and Jane will not have enough money to buy a flat and move out of mommy's house. And Daniel has to deliver the eulogy even though he is constantly reminded that his brother, the famous writer, is so much better at words!<br /><br />If the plot so far sounds a bit thin....you are right. It's lighter than air.<br /><br />The comedic highlights of the movie come from the physical comedy provided by Simon (Alan Tudyk) the insecure boyfriend and secret fiance of cousin Martha. Simon accidently ingests a hallucinogenic pill, instead of Valium, on the way to the funeral and it is his behavior that starts the unfortunate chain of events. Alan Tudyk is hilarious even when stark naked. (I would like to add here that he is perhaps one of the whitest white men ever to appear naked on the screen.)<br /><br />The rest of the characters fall into generic types: hapless hypochondriacs, creepy snarks, and grumpy, elderly uncles in wheelchairs.<br /><br />Oh, yes. There is a mysterious American midget...... whatever is he doing at the funeral?<br /><br />Uh oh!not enough, her obviously favored son, Robert (played by Rupert Graves), a fabulously successful author living in New York, also feels no responsibility to contribute \\"to the cause\\".

0545123283|5.0|'Linger' is flawless and beautiful. I was literally on the edge with knives teasing my heart the entire time. I recommend this book as well at the first 'Shiver' to the series to everyone. I cannot wait for the last in the series 'Forever, a year from now, sigh.
B001UV4XFQ|2.0|I have seen all three movies in the theater (and yes I went to go with my wife). After seeing the last installment I now know why these movies absolutely do not work for me. (I have not read any of the books, and please don't use that as an excuse as to why I don't like the movies).     The Twilight series is filled with interesting characters and has a lot of interesting plot developments in it. Unfortunately the story follows the three worst characters and instead of concentrating telling the story of one of five to six interesting stories, it focuses on what is supposed to be a love story.     I'll start with the characters......     Bella Swan is a despicable person with no redeeming qualities. Would anyone actually want to even be associated with Bella Swan in real life? All I know is that she puts every single person in danger (including the vampire she is presumably in love with) all for purely selfish reasons. If her vampire plaything isn't around she decides to toy with the idiot werewolf boy who for some reason decides he likes this moping, selfish, unfriendly person. Has Bella Swan (which is a stupid name anyhow) ever uttered anything at all interesting or positive in the course of three movies?     Let's move on to Edward. You would think after centuries of existing he would have A) found something better to do with his time than to graduate high school repeatedly? B) Developed at least a smidgeon of a personality C) Had enough time to find someone in this world that could offer him something more than Bella Swan? I get he can't read her mind (which he sees as a positive), but maybe that's because she doesn't have much in that head of hers? Honestly?     And that leaves our pathetic werewolf pal who marches around shirtless (a joke about his shirtless ways was written in the Eclipse movie). He at least has a motorcycle hobby and outwardly seems friendly in the 1st movie (until he becomes a werewolf) and then because he becomes a central figure in this movie he must relinquish all semblance of a personality and become mad/sad. Why do I call this character pathetic? Because to constantly chase after someone who has been so outwardly disrespectful and just plain mean to you shows he has very little self respect for himself.     And now why I don't think the \\"love\\" triangle works. First, none of the characters are likable or compelling as explained above. Secondly, other than saying they love each what has happened to make me believe it? I know Edward has saved Bella a few times (because she needlessly puts herself in danger, because she's moody, reckless and selfish) so maybe I can buy Bella liking Edward. But other than not reading her mind there's no reason for this vampire to like this girl (I guess her blood smells good, but that's more reason to kill her right?). I could care less who ends up with this girl. As far as I'm concerned, whoever does is the loser in this triangle.     While watching the Eclipse, I felt the father echoed my thoughts. He seems bewildered at all the situations around him. Can't understand his daughter, doesn't like Edward. But he does really like Edward's sister Alice and so do I!     Imagine how much better of movie or series it could be if it followed the character of Alice? Or how about the doctor vampire father? Or what about Jasper from the 1800's? Or even the vengeful vampire girl that kills her rapist attackers from the 1900's? Or what about the group of Werewolves that are eager to kill and seem to at least have fun together? Or....well you get the idea. All of the characters are more proactive in what seems to be a larger picture. Our characters are far more concerned about laying in fields of flowers saying they love each other. In between that we the audience are treated to ridiculous jealous banter between two immature idiots (the vampire vs. werewolf boy).     So anyway, there is a lot to like in this series but instead we get left with the worst trio of characters possiblein the movie. It could be a simple fix too. Why not give Bella a bigger destiny than just becoming a vampire's wife? (if there is one we should have had a lot more foreshadow) Why not make her a key player in a bigger story (and no, having a vamoire baby is not a bigger story). Would it be too much to have them fall in love while trying doing something interesting on the behalf of something larger in scale than themselves? What if she could be a key part of a prophecy that helps mankind or vampirekind? Then it would make a little bit of sense that Edwards entire family and the entire werewolf clan puts their lives on the line to protect her while Edward, Bella, and Werewolf boy hide on a mountaintop out of harms way. And by the way if you are trying to make out a vampire army sound invincible at least have one member from the \\"heroes\\" side die, even a side character would be a start. I don't believe that band of young vampires was very formidable since all twenty or thirty were killed without them barely inflicting any damage to the good guy side. It's all just fluff in the end, nothing really happened.     So blah! Tell me why I'm wrong Twilight fans. While you do that please tell me what redeeming values Bella Swan has without telling lies or using references from the book series. Any positive character traits at all? Good luck.
0545123275|5.0|Such beautiful prose, heart throbbing love,, and believable romance. My first try at reading the book I didn't like it, I thought it was moving to slow, where was all the action. Also, a part of me was sick of werewolves after reading the Twilight series (not a diss b/c I love, love, love). So I took a break, months and months later I decided to give this book another try and I'm so glad I did because now I'm freaking obsessed with the series. Finished both 'Shiver' and 'Linger' in two weeks. I now have a jealousy complex with Maggie and her in-delph and perfected way of using words. I want more, more, more...Oh and by the way their not really werewolves, their wolves honey, read the book to find out more on her version of them, it's delightfully delicious.
0439023513|1.0|I read young adult for a reason.....as an escape from real life and as most agree, the first 2 books in the series were amazing.  Couldn't wait for Mockingjay, but now I wish I had never read it.  I am more disappointed than an adult should ever be over a Young Adult book.  I am still in denial that that's really how it's going to end.  A part of me is still hoping that it's all a big joke and the \\"real\\" Mockingjay is still out there waiting to be published.  I'm going to be mad for a long time on this one.....I know, lame on my part but true just the same.    Instead of re-reading I'm going to chuck all 3 in the garbage.  Reading the first 2 over again would be too painful a reminder of how horribly they end. :(
B002N8A14M|3.0|I only have one complaint about this product - the case does not allow me to use the standard Apple earbuds.  The headphone jack cannot fit snugly as the case has a lip on the end that prevents the headphones from sitting flush.  When I try to use them, the audio cuts in/out and the headphones frequently just fall out.  Other headphones work fine (I have another pair from Sony and one from Skull Candy), but it's a pretty huge problem that this can't work with the standard headphones that come with an iPod.<br /><br />Other than that, the case and armband work as advertised.  I actually love the kickstand on the case, but it's just such a hassle that I can't use the standard headphones.  Very disappointing.
0812550706|5.0|I was first told to read this book about fifteen years ago, but didn't get around to it until this past week. The author paints a picture of the earth that is still futuristic almost forty years after the book was published. The description of the Internet long before there was a mainstream Internet is fascinating. How did Card know what was coming? The battles fought by Ender, both real and in practice at Command School are insightful and make for good reading. I don't tend to read sci-fi, but as this book is one of the originals of the sci-fi genre and the author is LDS, I finally agreed it was time to read. I'm glad I did.
B0007TKNII|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. I also expected a much better result with the stageshow's composer/creator as producer. Sadly, this film fell very short of my expectations and is one of the few movies I've seen which I simply can't stand to watch. It came off pitiful at best, and is not one I'd recommend to my friends. As a listener of the original London Cast soundtrack for years, I was familiar with the music and had a rough grasp of the story. I was curious about the film, and thought &#34;Well, Andrew Lloyd Webber is working with the filmmakers, so it must be good&#34;. Boy, was I wrong.  This film adaptation is boring, incongruous, self-indulgent, lacking in any emotional depth or honesty, and grating on the ears. It makes any other musical adaptation's jump from stage to screen, even how terrible, seem like nothing. Anyone who was hoping this would be the great immortalization of one of the best, most timeless musicals will be severely disappointed. Even Andrew Lloyd Webber's brilliant music couldn't save this travestuous adaptation simply because it too was severely altered.  I know that my review will get passed over by all the others that laud this film's brilliance, so I'll begin by telling you my own first impression: The first time I saw this, I came away feeling unsettled and totally appalled by the ridiculous and insane spectacle I had just witnessed. Five years later, I still feel this way, only now I'm just angry that some better choices weren't made in production. The choice of Joel Shumacher as director was madness, and every decision after that just got worse. Don't get me wrong here; I LOVED the musical and plan to see it again when I get the chance, but the film just doesn't reach to such heights in my book.  I would say this movie was passable and I might be able to enjoy it and overlook the differences between film and show if the music itself hadn't been so severly butchered by the awful choices made in the orchestration department, as well as the beating each song took when belted out by the unfortunate cast. The songs aren't electrifying or exciting anymore, and might end up putting you to sleep. When a great musical like &#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34; turns out bad, you know you've picked the wrong people to handle it.  For one thing, the choice of actors is atrocious. They have absolutely no chemistry at all, and seem almost perpetually bored, sleepwalking, zombie-like, through their parts. None of them have acting abilities up to the caliber required for such roles, and their voices are nowhere near as strong as they should be for any musical. They sound below average of what you'd find in even the worst Off-Broadway show. They can't even sing on key! They also frequently over-act, under-sing, or whisper, a combination that doesn't work well at all on film and certainly something you can't do on in live theatre without getting booed off the stage. There are so many people who have played in &#34;Phantom&#34; on Broadway, in London, and on tour for years, and would have done marvelously, but sadly, none of those wonderful actors and actresses made it in.  Patrick Wilson as Raoul was bland and forgettable, even worse than in the original book, though I guess the one thing he has going for him is that he actually can sing, something that seems to have eluded the rest of the cast.  Emmy Rossum is much too young to play Christine. At age seventeen, she just doesn't have the chops to carry out any of the songs effectively. She's no Sarah Brightman, that's for sure, and isn't believable as an opera ingenue with such a thin voice as she has. Also, not seem too critical, but she's not much of an actress, and I couldn't believe that anyone would think of her as first choice to play the character who basically carries the whole weight of the story on her shoulders.  But if those two are bad, what comes next is even worse. Whoever picked Gerard Butler for the title character made the biggestmistake of all. Mr. Butler had no vocal training prior to being cast, and in this film it sounds like he still needs a lot more. He sort of growls his way through the film, and is also (I know, evil word here) WAY TOO YOUNG for the part. The Phantom isn't supposed to be really old, but he's supposed to have lived under the Opera for many years, and had many careers before turning recluse. It's impossible that he was only in his thirties by the time Christine crossed his path. Even in view of this fact, it would be all right if Butler could act the part of the mad but tender Phantom effectively, but he doesn't. He is gruff and unromantic, certainly not anyone you could picture falling in love with, and certainly not the first person you'd think of as the Angel of Music. As if that weren't bad enough, his supposed disfigurement is so seriously diminished that you don't want to pity his unfortunate situation, but rather ask him why a guy like that would go hide in the cellars of the Opera when all he needed was some minor plastic surgery?  I know that the filmmakers chose to have younger, more physically appealing cast in order to appeal to a wider range of audience, a choice which seems to have worked (Just look at the 1,000+ positive reviews on Amazon alone!), but I take it as a major insult to Michael Crawford that Andrew Lloyd Webber chose not to at least ask him to reprise the role he made famous on stage. This movie had been in talks since 1990, but was put on hold when Webber divorced Sarah Brightman. Crawford had expressed interest in playing the Phantom the whole time. It isn't his fault that it took fourteen years to finally materialize. Even so, I'd take Mr. Crawford over Mr. Butler any day. He looks much better in the cape, and could beat Butler in a singing contest at any age. Even Sarah Brightman at forty-five would have done a better Christine than Rossum's whispery, bosom-flaunting portrayal. What was up with those distressingly low-cut gowns? Ugh!  Upon rewatching, I think the most major problem with this film is the portrayal of Christine's feelings for the Phantom. In the original show, Christine's attraction to him stems from her longing for her dead father and belief that he is her &#34;good angel,&#34; as well as her burgeoning (though unspoken) sexual feelings as she transitions into womanhood, as evidenced by the lyric from the title song &#34;In all your fantasies you always knew, that man and mystery, were both in you,&#34; which is strangely absent from the film. Also revealing is the alteration of the lyric  &#34;far-reaching gaze&#34; to &#34;fathering&#34; during the &#34;Wandering Child&#34; scene. For all intents and purposes, Christine maintains her belief in him as the Angel of Music/her father's spirit throughout the entire film, even after she has learned that he is only a man. This makes the Phantom's obviously romantic intentions towards her seem out of place, and removes any tension as to whether she will choose him or Raoul in the end.  The look of the film is all right, I suppose, but it could have been better. In comparing the show to the film, the film is warmer in color and less foggy and mysterious, something I really loved and wish would have been included. It could have looked really spectacular on film. The Masquerade scene is reduced to a monochrome mess with misnomer lyrics (&#34;Flash of mauve, flash of puce, fool and king, ghoul and goose...&#34;) What? In black and white? All I can hope is that the costume designer was color-blind. Nearly of the magical elements are taken out (The magic Punjab Lasso, for example, or the Phantom's exit in the final scene), and the world is presented as less of a fantastic place and more a concrete-hard reality. Also, all of the grand, over-the-top theatricality which really made the show stand out has kind of evaporated, which makes this film just as boring and usual as every other one relased in the last ten years.  The movie was also too violent and visually disturbing, which made watching all two-and-a-half hours a painful experience. I'm still astonished how it can be frightening in all the wrong ways and still manages to be unexciting. I also didn't like the depressingly modern feel of the film, brought on by the lazy way in which the actors pronounced and performed their lines, despite the Victorian-esque design and setting. It seemed like a painfully lengthy soap-opera with fancy sets.  Since seeing this film, I have read Gaston Leroux's book many times and have seen the stage version once. I have to recommend only the latter two if you want to have a good time. Skip this film.
1596680296|5.0|If you'd like to learn how to knit socks the traditional 4-needle method, this is the book for you.  The instructions are clearly written with good photos to accompany them.  Socks in this book are knitted from the cuff down to the toe.  One of the best things about this book is that it gives instructions for knitting socks from many different weights of yarn, making it flexible for whatever yarn inspires you.  Once you have the basics down, there are also instructions for many variations in cuff designs if you are looking for something fancier.  But, a bit of a warining- sock knitting can be addictive!

0596009208|5.0|I took Java once in high school and I hated it. I had to take it again in college and I was getting very nervous about it, when I decided to buy this book. This totally reversed the effect of high school java. I LOVED IT. Its got a wonderfully easy going tone that teaches you the matter. Its almost like reading a comic book except you're learning and programming in Java at the same time. They give great examples that help you understand the concepts faster and you also learn how to apply them too. The beauty of this book is you don't need to know anything about java to start learning from this book. Its great for starters. It is not a reference book just like the book claims. You use it to start learning about how to use and get comfortable with java to get to the next level. I loved this book, it helped me prepare for the college course which go at a terribly fast pace. Get the book if you want to start programming in java.
0374158460|5.0|Jonathan Franzen must surely be one of literary giants of our day. His skillful use of language, his imagery and gripping storyline make his work highly enjoyable to read. What Kipling was to India in 1900, Franzen is to America in 2010. Definitely worth the money and you've finished it you'll wish it was thrice as long.    Other great books I've enjoyed are [[ASIN:1449591604 Nada the Lily]], [[ASIN:144959221X The Virgin of the Sun]] and [[ASIN:144956268X The Life of Apollonius of Tyana]].
B001CDWFPC|4.0|For a Kindle version of the Bible, I am VERY pleased so far. It took me about 30 minutes to download various Bibles to sample them, and this one turned out to be the best for me.<br /><br />Searching may not be as fast as searching through a hard copy, but it's not nearly as bad as people have reported. I can get to any verse in the Bible in ~10 seconds, which I think is pretty good.<br /><br />Here is how I search:<br />1. In the Kindle home page, or even in the Bible, I start typing to activate search, i.e., 'Ezekiel'<br />2. Then I click on the symbol button and type in the chapter number I want, i.e., 17<br />3. I click enter to search<br />4. In my search result page, I can easily find where Ezekiel 17 is, so I click on it (or I need to click on the book that contains the search criteria first - depending on whether or not I'm searching from the home page or the Bible)<br />5. Each chapter of the Bible for me takes about 2 pages for me to navigate (this might be because I use the smallest font because I like high resolution)<br /><br />Also, I love reading the introduction before I read a book. So for example, if I'm about to read Isaiah, then I love to read the introductory background first. In order to do this, I simply follow the steps above, but instead of putting in the chapter number for step #2, I type 'introduction'.<br /><br />*Update*<br />I just finished 2 Thessalonians, I wanted to click the next page button so that I could start on the introduction of 1 Timothy. Unfortunately, I had to page through all of the study notes of 2 Thessalonians before I could even get to 1 Timothy! I didn't know that they put the study notes after the book (in the hard copy, the study notes are underneath). This is very annoying. Sure, there are workarounds, but little things add up. I still leave give this 3 stars, but if I find anything else, then I'll be sure to update this review and downgrade the overall rating.<br /><br />*Update2*<br />Never mind, you can just click on the right arrow to skip through all of the study notes.

B0015DROBO|1.0|This could perhaps be the best marketed book since Mao's little red one, whose name escapes me...<br /><br />The only interesting thing here is that so many people have fallen for this ultimately dull book! While you may be in the minority, if you have a life and a brain you won't get past page 100. I confess to my eternal shame, that I did get a bit past this milestone before it struck me that the emperor has no cloths. However, I am convinced that nothing could happen to these shallow paper characters 'in the end' that justifies wasting precious reading time.<br /><br />If you are like the majority of readers who prefer not to think, but to be simply titillated with trash, then this book is perfect. If you want to experience what a book can really do, have a look at this cracker, which I gladly gave a positive review (just to show I can): [[ASIN:B003XYE93E He Who Conquers]].
B003NHRIVQ|2.0|Its hard to to be objective.  If I had just seen this movie on the shelf, without first enjoying Spark's books (including this one), I probably would have given it 3 or 4 stars (still wouldnt be a 5).  My first large complaint is that the movie tried to do alot of things really quickly.  In the book, you have the time to establish the relationships between Ronnie and will, Ronnie and her Dad, Ronnie and Blaze, etc (you get my point).  While those relationships are Cliche as mentioned in previous reviews, cliche is cliche because it works, and it sells.  However the entire movie just felt rushed.  Like they really just wanted it to be over, as soon as it started.  So I dont feel it flowed the way it could have, or should have.     My second big complaint, Miley.  She is NOT a good actor.  I will grant she can sing (somewhat, if your into that style).  But her lines felt canned, and it was almost painful whenever she opened her mouth.  Not many musicians really make decent actors, and I personally feel she is not one of them.      Between her terrible performance and the general rushed pace of the movie and somewhat sloppy slapped together feel, I couldnt rate the movie higher than 2 stars.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|I will avoid the plot review, because so many others seem compelled to summarize, and the repetition becomes tiresome. I enjoyed this novel, and I think you will too. I gave it four stars because it is not perfect, but it is better than most current fiction. Franzen may be a \\"serious\\" writer, but he is also highly readable, with an interesting story that can be enjoyed for itself alone, absent any considerations of literary aspirations.<br /><br />This is a big, rambling tale of modern Americans in their modern lives, people who reminded me of real people, a plot which kept me turning the pages of this compulsively readable, mostly entertaining novel. The tone is slightly condescending, as the quote above my review would suggest, mostly cynical, and ultimately hopeful by the end of the story, when his battered, bruised and bruising characters emerge from the wreckage of their lives, and bravely carry on.<br /><br />In many ways this novel is similar to his previous work, The Corrections. I remember enjoying that novel a few years back, although I could not understand why the critics raved about it. Franzen proves yet again that he is a very good writer, building a complicated but workable plot, creating characters who are real, complex and often disappointing, showing us his American self-portrait in 2010. He reaches for a big theme, as the title implies, but he doesn't quite achieve his goal of demontrating the illusory nature of our freedom (or alternatively that all this freedom is killing us). Like Sophocles, Franzen seems to take a dim view of freedom. I probably should not compare Franzen to Sophocles, or other great writers, past or present. He has a genuine voice, a straightforward style, but he does not possess lyrical abilities, nor great thematic breadth. His writing style is similar to Paul Murray's, serving up a cast of mostly unremarkable people who screw up their lives by means of their character defects, giving you a funny and sad slice of everyday life, saying something profound in the process.<br /><br />Amazon reviewers were much less enamored with The Corrections than the professional reviewers: they gave only three stars on average, with almost as many one star reviews as five star. Franzen's self portraits are closer to the world of the publishing industry than the world of amazon readers. His characters are based in the Midwest, at least in the beginning of the novel, but they are not the American everyman or woman. They are highly educated, well read, socially evolved and spiritually lost in the manner of the wealthy white specimen liberalis americanus. This writing feels too focused upon their world to allow for universal appeal.  Nevertheless, Freedom is a very well and carefully written novel. Only time itself will reveal if this is the work of the moment, or a work for all time.thing profound in the process.

0439023513|5.0|What a ride this series has been.  And what a conflicted ending the Mockingjay delivers.  Unlike JK Rowling's wonderful series, in which Good and Evil are clearly defined and Good secures a tidy triumph in the final book, here we're left with a much more nuanced vision of how power and trauma affect people.  Sure there's a part of me that longs for a different ending, one in which Prim's life is spared (the entire point of the first book) and so forth, but in truth I wouldn't change a thing, for precisely the reasons some other reviewers have been disappointed...    The heroes in this book started out as ordinary people--flawed, frail, and pushed into impossible situations by events entirely out of their control.  This book, even more than the other two, retains their \\"ordinariness\\" in the face of increasingly brutal challenges.  These challenges prove to be more than they can individually bear at times, which is real.  Nobody is immune, all-powerful, or even that extraordinary, except in the sense that they remain true to each other and continually choose to keep living.  The effects of torture, profound grief and loss, and other severe trauma all ring very true.  The sad fact is that many trauma victims never fully recover, regardless of how much time passes and how secure their lives become.  These are broken people, all of them, but they're survivors, and in that sense they become the most heroic.    This book reminded me somewhat of Schindler's List in its ability to be both profoundly sad and tearfully inspirational.  It's not a happy series, and certainly not a happy ending.  It left me somewhat unsatisfied, but more deeply moved, and upon reflection it's the way I prefer the series to end--being true to its core life messages rather than pitching a less-realistic but more cheerful resolution.

0439023513|2.0|Mockingjay, the final installment of the Hunger Games trilogy was just \\"okay.\\"  It wasn't too exciting, but it wasn't so bland that I stopped reading it.  It seems almost the entire book was dedicated to Katniss and her propos throughout the district.  Surely there must have been more relevant things to write about than describing Katniss' hair, makeup and costume for the millionth time.      The ending was unsatisfactory.  Most of the book moved at a slow pace.  The ending, however, just jumped out of no where and wrapped itself up in about ten pages.  Could have there been more elaboration on the fates of Gale, Katniss' mother, the other victors, etc?      Also, SC, in my book, has always been a good writer.  Suddenly, in Mockingjay, everything is disjointed, the characters are an alientation of what they once were, and complete sentences are practically nonexistent.  What happened to the thoughtful story telling we once knew?    In comparison to the previous two books, Mockingjay just didn't cut it.
1401216676|4.0|For first timers: if you need to know how the Joker began, this sort of answered the questions for me when I obtained a copy of this book in 1988 when it was first released. (but in a modern replication of the original  Joker's beginning as shown in classic Batman & Joker stories by Bob Kane and his writers/ artists.. )  I still have it with me to this day among my collection. I think Brian Bollard's art is awesome, he also did a brilliant job on his front cover artworks of Wonder Woman comics in 1990s.   This book has become a memorable read.. I still think of its story in my mind without reading it.. the artwork of the raining creating puddles is inspiring.    I recommend it.

0946535256|4.0|I know the author John from many years ago in the UK, and I recall with fondness when he took up playing the tenor saxophone. His passion for jazz and performance was always very keen and I've been thrilled to see his musical career progress, including authorship of this excellent series of jazz instrument methods. I have purchased the clarinet, saxophone and trumpet books in this series with interest, and take pleasure at the insight demonstrated in the selection of progressive jazz material to play, as well as the wise and informative text which is highly geared toward the adult learner. My only minor disappointment in purchasing the trumpet edition in this series was that the accompanying CD playing surface was marred by a strange foggy film, which I can only assume (as the book/CD was new) was due to a faulty pressing. I returned the book to Amazon with a polite complaint about the unplayable CD and the book/CD was promptly replaced with - alas - another faultly, unplayable CD. This was especially frustrating as the trumpet (rather than the sax or clarinet) is my main instrument. And the band is so good too! I have now just lost faith somewhat in obtaining an unblemished CD to accompany this otherwise creditable jazz instructional course.  As a later postscript to my review above, I recently took the blemished play-a-long disc to a music store to get it professionally cleaned. Initially the store assistant thought that the disc's playing surface appeared too marred and may not clean up. However, I'm pleased to say the intense cleaning did work and upon playing the disc I found, to my relief and pleasure, that it played normally.  The store assistant queried whether the disc had been subjected to 'water damage' in its manufacture/storage/shipping.

0439023513|4.0|WARNING!!  POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD!!....    I was looking forward to this book coming out (as were many) for months.  I loved the the first two books and (like many) was extremely curious to find out how the Katniss/Peeta/Gale love triangle would resolve.  However, many times during the story I was wondering if Katniss was going to pick anybody or even be alive at the end.  There were many deaths and I found the story at times to be downright depressing.  However, I do understand that this is a story about a war and that Collins wanted to show the destruction that a war can leave in its wake.  I wish Collins went into more detail after the war was resolved and how Katniss and Peeta got back together.  Although, I was very glad with her choice since I loved Peeta:)  Collins also does a nice job with throwing in some surprising twists.  However, I found some of the details to be too descriptive and at times confusing.  Overall, however, I did like the book and will greatly miss this series/trilogy.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is an amazing story with a heroine for all ages proving you don't have to be perfect to be an inspiration to the oppressed and downtrodden.  Compellingly written, Ms. Collins has created a true gem with this book.  It's a rare treat to have characters with depth working in such a well fleshed out universe that also exist as players in a great story.  I hope to find Catching Fire sometime in the near future.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|This is a great flash. I've had mine for a couple of months and have never seen the temperature readout move a millimeter, and I've pulled some pretty hot batteries out of this thing. Maybe the firmware updates have solved the problem. If it does ever cause a problem, I'll just disable the thermo protection. As another reviewer noted, do you really think this thing is so fragile compared to the SB800 it replaces? It's a software issue, not hardware - and it seems to be fixed.    I'm not going to reiterate what others have already said, but I will say this thing makes life so much easier, and Its so much nicer to use than the SB600s I use as fill. If I could justify the outlay, I'd buy two more tomorrow.
0439023513|5.0|The books been out a couple days and has 300+ reviews already.  A real hit, not a manufactured one.  The first 2 books were good enough that I watched for the release of this one.  So much for having the first review :)    Mockingjay is unique from the first two and has its own story area and focus.  It builds on the first two, but doesnt just rehash the old stories or coast on previous success.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Katy Perry evades the sophomore slump by pulling all the stops with her new record Teenage Dream, filled with hugely infectious hooks, massive choruses and unforgettable melodies. Perry addresses love, teenage years, break-up, overnight blurs, insecurities and of course, sex.    After the immediate success of `I Kissed a Girl' and the release of One of the Boys, Perry had to watch her every musical step to avoid being labeled as a one hit wonder. Her sophomore effort saves her from being mislabeled, and turns her into an absolute star.    Even though it seems calculated and manufactured to appeal to the masses, it has a lot of personality and attitude. There are no duds, no fillers; every track has single potential. It is solid; regardless of it being mostly sugary and candy-coated, it still has a particular acerbic taste. It is well balanced. Dr. Luke brought the best of his downright best. Stargate pole-vaulted outside of the box with his production, contributing with an effervescent sparkle. Tricky Stewart worked magic wonders; his production was enormously shocking and unexpected.    `Teenage Dream' is all pop rock should be, with a guitar riff and a subtle dance beat which comes to light in full as the chorus fiercely kicks in; standing still is not an option. `Last Friday Night' picks up where `Waking up in Vegas' left off, and is turned into a weekly mischief; it interpolates a wah-wah guitar driven hook which then explodes in a sax solo after a beguiling T.G.I.F. chant. `California Gurls' is massively upbeat and carefree, enclosing all things summer; it is one of the record's most euphoric moments.    `Firework' is orchestra meets dance; Perry's vocals are unmatched in this, as they soar and sky-rocket explode; it is uplifting. It is interesting to note it apparently alludes to the motif of a plastic bag swirling in the air off American Beauty. `Peacock' is a cheerleader intrusion in the boys' locker room. It is rascally energetic and rather racy with its witty yet clear-cut lyrics, as Perry almost `bird' wails in the milieu of the song. It is an absorbing no-brainer; the production is beyond incredible.    The ferociously mordant `Circle the Drain' is not just a slap in the face; it is definitely a knock out. It falls between being a blend of rock, synthesizers, auto-tune, drums and mild pitch gymnastics. `E.T.' is a brilliant astrophysical metaphor and quite a percussion laser storm; the overall composition is ingenious; it almost could do for hip-hop.    `The One That Got Away' is a throbbing idyllic love let-go; musically it goes along the same vein of the title track. `Who Am I Living For?' is electrifying and clout, however bitter and finds Perry's range being shoved into a struggle with keeping the pitch and ultimately manages to (though with notable effort). `Pearl' is sinuously on the ball and cleverly written; it is a call out to women empower.    `Hummingbird Heartbeat' is what Perry should have called the album's obvious innuendo instead of the straightforward `Peacock'; Perry sings about spreading her wings to fly, finding the magic seed and sounding like a symphony when in perfect harmony; it is nearly impossible not to take it in a double sense; it is an outstanding poppy rock layered number. The album closes with `Not like the Movies', a piano driven ballad with faint drums, and crystal glass harp interpolation.    Teenage Dream is wonderfully written; most of the tracks follow a two-part progression pattern with resourcefully crafted metaphors. Aside the tongue in cheek lyrics and adolescent references, Perry achieves some sort of maturity in her songwriting. The album showcases a more vocally powerful Perry; most of the material is sung in a high range, which works for her two-fold, as it showcases her vocals, but also reveals her limitations to some degree.    Past its bouncy bittersweet numbers, and venture into more pop turf, the album does not murder nor neglect the sound of the preceding record and still incorporates it in the vibe of the new; it does not sell out exactly, but only meshes in with more pop, allowing Perry's foible and flirtatious personality to come afloat.    The record might seem to lack cohesiveness as Perry tries to keep it all on fun mode, until she addresses more serious matter. What holds the album together is the fact even the slow songs are indeed bangers; despite them being slow paced in comparison to the rest, they manage to uphold the spirited rhythm of the album in whole.    Teenage Dream is grand in all way possible. It may be many things at once, but not enough to be turned into a nightmare. It is composed of anthems, it is stellar, fantastic, and assorted, though it still heaves an exceptional consistency when it comes to themes. Katy Perry outdid herself and exceeded expectations; she just could not do wrong. Teenage Dream is a dream come true, or at least a dream one would not want to wake up from.    C.Perez
0439023513|3.0|I took my time reading this to get a clear understanding of the novel instead of breezing through like most people. Plus it was the last one in the sequel.<br /><br />Like another person said I can't review without spoiling the book. So here it goes:<br /><br />I liked the book, it wasn't my faviorte but it was good. I know the last book was about war but I was atticapting a battle between and Katniss being the mockingjay. But as I read it some of the deaths could have been prevented. Like Finnicks. The whole misson when they were to head to the capital was pointless. Why did they go to the began with? Is the question. I know why Katniss wanted to go, to kill Snow but even when the oppurtunity for her to do it she killed Coin instead, and on the verge of killing herself afterwards. I was a little angry about that because Snow was as much murder as Coin. Even though Coin killed Prim, she could have killed both instead of just one.<br /><br />Now Prim. Why kill Prim towards the end. What was the point? Why not kill her towards the beggining at least Katniss would have showed alot more emotion throughout the book. She probably wouldn't have taken orders and became her version of mockingjay not something thirteen wanted her to be. I mean what it's like she staying the same never growing. Haymitch telling her what to do, Snow telling her who to kill, and listening to Coin and thirteen. As we see Katniss can easily be persuaded. Even when they all took advantage of her it made me sick. I wanted to jump throught the book and shake Katniss.<br /><br />But not as much as her mother. Her mother was barely in the book and when she was there she cared a half a fraction but not enought to convience me. I wish they would have killed her instead of Prim. Why leave your daughter when she has delt with the most trauma at her age? I found the mother selfish only thinking about herself. Sure I'll write you some letters, but I wont visit you Katniss it hurts too much. *Groan.<br /><br />Gale too. What kind of best friend is he? His bomb could have killed Prim but does he offer any condolcence or say he's sorry to Katniss. No. He doesn't he barely says anything and just leaves. Thats praticuly the last we see of him. Because he doesn't visit Katniss in twelve, she finds out about his wareabouts from greasy sae only be greasy sae sees him on tv. I mean there friendship was probably way pass repair, but I can't help hating this characters guts. I was never a team anybody but I did like Gale.<br /><br />I don't like how they used Katniss and then when it was over said they didn't know what to do with her. IF IT WEREN'T FOR HER YOU WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE AN EVIL RULER LIKE SNOW! That's how I felt, but she just didn't care, I guess when you lose almost everything nothing really matters.<br /><br />I was actually happy when Katniss ended up with Peeta. It was nice to see him angry we rarely see that from him. But the ending left us with alot of unaswerd questions:<br />=What happend to Haymitch?<br />=How is Annie doing?<br />=What has changed now that there is a new president?<br />=Did they rebuild district 13?<br />=What is Johanna doing?<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />Those are just some. But to the people that say this book is depressing. If it were so depressing why did she end up with anybody? Katniss could have either killed herself, or lived her life on liquor like Haymitch. I don't find it depressing I find it eye opening in some points and realistic because it happens everyday.he?

0425220931|4.0|The Music Lesson: A Spiritual Search for Growth Through Music was different than I expected, in a good way.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to work with Mr. Wooten in a creative capacity during the mid 90's, both with the \\"Flecktones\\" project, and as a solo artist. I had met Victor after his shows where I told him, as a musician, I was giving up: I've seen the ultimate musician, and there was no way I'll ever come close.<br /><br />He, instead, focused on my natural talents and Joys.. and let me become a part of his magical message. He never told me about what he was going through at the time.. never told me the secrets in this book, but I could tell.. just by the way he shook my hand, or looked me in the eye, or called me at 3AM with a computer question... there was something different at hand.<br /><br />Even if you don't \\"buy\\" the spiritual aspects of this book, a lesson as simple as \\"expect you already know a technique before you try it\\" is worth the price of admission. ( hope I didn't  #1: give too much away, #2: tell the lesson wrong... or #3: incite thousands of bass players to cause their thumb nail to bleed the way mine did after reading that part!)<br /><br />Face it: Victor Wooten is just about the best bass player on the planet.. probably ever. I know... Geddy, Jaco, Les Claypool, Entwhistle, Tony Levin... They are all great, but no one has met Music on Her own terms the was Victor seems to have.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book not only for musicians getting into the spiritual side of playing, but also any creative types looking to expand their horizons . Victor speaks eloquently on all areas of inviting your Muse into your life, but also how to handle what happens then.<br /><br />I've lost touch with Victor Wooten over the years. My daughter still remembers making \\"cat lunch\\" before we went off to the studio. I'd love to re-connect.<br /><br />Bob Anderson<br />Formerly from NewTek<br /><br />bob@lightwavebob.com
0307592839|3.0|A guy friend from facebook praised this book.The plot is a refreshing one. A very witty look at the The rise and fall of the music business. How the good performers are dying out, And the record company are pressured to find pretty people who will sell their souls or be out of a job.   The characters are compelling, I felt like I knew  most of them by the end of the book.Like the autistic children who are  obsessed with what pauses mean in rock and roll songs or Benny a man so rich he puts gold flakes in his coffee.    But the writing style was irritating in parts,  One character, a girl named Lulu  who texts and spells the words wrong. This would have been ok, if Ms Egan  would have clarified what was being said. That section  was impossible to read and went on for pages and pages.  It Almost seems like Ms. Egan's pages fell out of her folder on the way to the publisher and was published this way. I think she was trying to channel Elizabeth Strout's Olive kitteredge the way Ms. Strout weaves many short stories together to make a mosiac of a complex woman and her hometown. Instead it comes across as disjointed.
1416550550|5.0|This is THE best book I've read in a very long time. From the first page I was hooked. Such an incredible story (which I won't go into here) that at the same time I wanted to finish it but didn't want it to end. I saved the last chapter for when I was alone, because I knew I would shed some tears.
0439023513|4.0|This book finishes up the trilogy as the girl on fire becomes the girl whose fire went out.  At the end, there are two children born to a thirty something woman who symbolize the human race guttering out as it fails to increase its numbers to a sustainable biomass.    I started reading the series because my ten year old was entranced with it.  When it came in the mail from Amazon she grabbed it and read the final book through in one setting.  I asked her how it was and she was more \\"meh, ok, but not as good as the first books.\\"  The collapse in direction into fading coals from fire is clearly handled.  Perhaps Brokenjay would have been a better title.    Well written, tightly plotted, minimal sex (a few kisses on screen), the violence is not detailed or pornographic, the writing is adult (rather than the adolescent tripe that is listed as \\"adult\\") and mature.     Honestly, I wish Amazon had a filter to let me filter out books with excessive sex or overdetailed violence.  I'd find more like this series, which has gotten press as teen literature, but which is actually more mature.    Regrets?  I wanted to see the mayor revealed as a major resistance figure and his daughter, who insists that Katness take the Mockingjay pin as the one who would marry her \\"cousin.\\" I hoped for an action scene where Katness rescues Prim and in the process has her Mockinjay armored costume destroyed.  I wanted one last scene of fire blazing against the threat of dictatorship rather than guttering out.    So, the book and the series will end up at the used book store eventually, not quite a keeper, but very good.
0439023513|1.0|I hate to rip on a book so highly anticipated as this one, I really do, but I feel I have to. This story could have been told in about 200 pages. We spend way too much time inside Katniss' head (which started getting redundant with the obvious early on)and not enough in what could have been a good, exciting, scary and dangerous storyline. By the end I wasn't caring who died, beside Prim - which was anticlimatic IMO, just that they did so we could move on. I knew Coin would be the target about half way through the book, and had to read that \\"sentence\\" twice, surprised (and disappointed) that I was right. The writing was just poor this time around and the sentence structure, from a writer's POV, was so off it was a major distraction while reading. I can't help but wonder if SC was under too much pressure from the publisher to get this book finished that she didn't have the time she needed to make it what The Hunger Games was - a good book.

B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|Our main character Chris (Nicholas Cage) is always living in two times at once, permanently seeing the possibilities ahead (just two minutes, and we must remenber that the future is always changing). This movie is just like that: it has two tempos, infinite possibilities captured in a very finite and limited result.<br /><br />Good interpretations from Mr. Cage in the first part of the movie; Ms. Biel is beautiful but the role ain't demanding; Ms. Moore is a much better actress then this interpretation.<br /><br />Some of the scenes of this movie will be with in the memory of the viewer for a long time (SLIGHT SPOILER - like the Chris introduction to Liz, or his declaration, the escape from the casino or the first talk with FBI agent Ferris...that never happened - END OF SPOILER). Unfortunately it has many flaws and holes (SPOILER - I still don't understand why the terrorists chase Chris and want him killed so badly??? And who are those terrorists, what do they want? Sometimes two minutes sounded more like five or six? And many more... - END OF SPOILER).<br /><br />A nice Sci-Fi/action movie, you probably won't regret seeing.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|Congratulations to Eric Stonestreet and Modern Family on Their Emmy Wins!<br /><br />I'm very happy that Eric Stonestreet won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role on ABC's Modern Family, which also won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Comedy Series, which I am equally very happy about.<br /><br />Everyone from that show deserves an Emmy, because they are all fantastic. They are one of the funniest ensembles on television right now.<br /><br />Before the show premiered, I had set my mind on watching it solely because of the participation of Ed O'Neill, whom I'm a fan of from his iconic, outrageously over-the-top turn as Al Bundy on the 1987-1997 smash hit FOX sitcom Married with Children. I wasn't expecting much, though, because O'Neill hadn't made much of an impression since the monster success of Married with Children. Sure enough, when Modern Family started, I wasn't keen on O'Neill's new role. Not because he wasn't funny, but because, compared to the live-action cartoonish buffoonery of Al Bundy, O'Neill's quieter, subtle humor on Modern Family was more like Agnes of God.<br /><br />From the get-go, however, the situations and characters have been hilarious, and O'Neill has grown nicely into his role as the grandfather patriarch of his extended family.<br /><br />So kudos to Stonestreet, O'Neill, and the cast and crew of Modern Family for producing an Emmy-winning comedy that is actually worthy of our time, our involvement, and most importantly, our laughter.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There have been so many good reviews of this book.  Just wanted to add mine as I loved this book.  Can't really understand the young reader tag tho?? A great story but the writing style is the thing that grabs you.  Should be used in any writing class as an example of perfection.

B003BLPTB0|4.0|Having worn my Army Green 'Off-Road' Crocs around the house (and occasionally to the beach) for more than 4 years, I finally decided it was time for a new pair. I settled on the all black Yukon Sport. Having worn them almost everyday for the last six weeks, I can honestly say I am very happy with my purchase even if the price was a little steep. The leather upper surface blends and bonds well with crocs croslite material. Your feet do not make contact with leather as it is the croslite material that lines the inside, so there are no rubbing concerns. Your feet do tend to retain a little more heat than with regular crocs which is to be expected given the more enclosed nature of the upper space, but in general my feet feel far more relaxed than wearing regular shoes or sneakers. Nonetheless, you do need to clean them regularly during hot weather to prevent odor build-up. The big plus with these is that I feel far less self conscious about wearing them out in public, and with the leather upper surface, they can be worn with a pair of jeans/khakis and look perfectly acceptable to all but formal occasions. The adjustable strap ensures a snug fit if needed, although I often wear them with the strap forward. Very happy overall - loss of one star as the retail price is a little high.

0061706620|1.0|I really didn't enjoy this book. While the diary concept sounded so promising (and there are some interesting tangents included in the book) this doesn't tie in seamless with the series, contradicting several events. Neither does it provide a plot engaging and independent enough to carry you past this disconnect with what fans are undoubtedly familiar with. I can't help but feel that the plot would have been more engaging if it was not written in diary-form.
0439023513|1.0|I considered The Hunger Games one of the best books I've ever read. Mockingjay was almost at the other end of the spectrum.     It's almost as if Collins has changed genres. The first two books were full of humanity, artistically developed insights into our natures, and gripping adventure. Mockingjay felt like a week-long visit to the psych ward. It was depressing, unnatural, predictable, and the narrative moved very slowly. The book often felt preachy and contrived. Wonderful insight into the mind of a person with severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Not an enjoyable read by any standard.     I wish I had stopped after reading the first two books in the series.
0553381687|4.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect when I picked up \\"A Game of Thrones\\" at the bookstore. I had heard people praise it as one of the better fantasies and also that it was not as focused on magic like most other books of the genra are. As soon as I started reading, I was almost immediately drawn into the world of Westeros with all of its political intrigue.<br /><br />I have to give Martin a round of applause for being very imaginative with his story and tackling politics, instead of magic, as the story's focal point. Not to mention the depth he put into working on the history, geography, and the rest of the worldbuilding. The amount of detail gives one the true impression of being in a Medieval world, not of being in the half-hearted world of someone attempting a high fantasy.<br /><br />Martin created several characters and mentioned even more names, which at times became confusing, but I think in one sense it helped make the world feel more real. The characters generally all felt real and much more than cardboard stereotypes. But, what really struck me in reading, was how each of them wasn't the archetype of evil or good; even the good guys make mistakes and do dishonorable things, but you still love them. Even though Westeros does not allow for women to rule and most of the minor female characters are whores in some way, there are still strong female characters like Catelyn Stark, who looks for the one who ordered the assassination of her son, and Cersei Lannister, the conniving queen not to be trifled with.<br /><br />Martin also, unlike most writers, tells the story from various points of view. This gives the unique chance for the reader to see both sides of the issues, especially in regards to a war that took place over a decade before the story begins, when several of the characters were involved in the massacre of a mad king's family and stole the throne from him in the process.<br /><br />The story did have its weak points though. One thing I wished Martin would have cut down on was the amount of sex. I could have cared less if several of the characters hired prostitutes for the night or if a thirteen-year old girl has sex with her much-older husband on their wedding night. One sex scene would have been tolerable, but Martin goes into more detail than necessary in the several scenes that occur; he could have done it better by having the scene fade out or by skimming over what happens.<br /><br />Another weak point with the whole story was Daenerys, the exiled princess who marries a war chieftain so that her brother can regain the throne in Westeros. Her part of the tale seemed largely focused on having sex with her husband, who does not truly show any affection towards her beyond looking for the closest time to have sex with her, and did not seem to be related to what was going on in Westeros. Her character changed rather too rapidly from the shy, timid girl to the more mature person she is by the end of the book. Not to mention the ending which left me scratching my head and saying \\"what? Where in the world did that come from?\\"<br /><br />Besides those things, I truly enjoyed \\"A Game of Thrones\\".amount of sex.

0439023513|5.0|In Mockingjay, while Collins still explores her dominant theme of the effects of war and violence on children she doesn't miss taking digs at the political complacency of a full and well entertained population, at the blatant manipulation of the population by both political parties of the novel, and at the willingness of both parties to use any means necessary to achieve their ends (Anyone expecting District 13 to be paradise will be disappointed. The rebels are just as manipulative as the Capitol and at one point Collins contrasts the pragmatism of President Snow with the revolutionary zeal of the rebel leader, President Coin, and I admit I found Snow preferable.) She even touches on the redemptive quality of art and she pulls all the strands together in a novel that is still driven at an active pace.      As in the first two books of the series she uses her protaganist Katniss Everdeen and her love interests Gale Hawthorne and Peeta Mellark to great effect in showing the reader how children (and yes, for all that he has had to grow up too fast Gale is still only too years older than Katniss). I'm not a fan of love triangles as a rule and had originally considered her decision to go there one of the minor flaws of the book, however Mockingjay has proved me wrong. In having to decide between Peeta and Gale Katniss is really making a choice of what kind of person she will become after all the violence she has suffered. Peeta has always represented hope and kindness and being true to one's beliefs under horrific circumstances. His transformation at the hands of the Capitol from what had been the moral center of the first two books to the cold, angry and confused person he becomes in the third is one of the most heartbreaking aspects of this book, and believe me there are many. Gale's transformation into a ruthless man incapable of empathy, while unfortunate, is hardly unforseen. This 'new' Gale is a distillation of the one we see in the first book behaving coldly towards Madge because she was the mayors daughter, but Katniss, whose driving need has been to just survive, has never given any thought to what he was saying. In Mockingjay survival is no longer as precarious as it's been and she has the leisure to listen to and think about what he's saying and as she listens she becomes increasingly uneasy with his willingness to use the ends to justify the means, his incapacity to pity even the weakest and most helpless of his enemies and his refusal to see shades of gray. Gale may be two years older but Katniss is years more mature in her realization that \\"we're all slaves.\\" She still manages to overlook the increasing ruthlessness of her hunting partner until she is brutally forced to take a good hard look at him towards at the end of the book and decide whether or not she can reconcile herself to this aspect of Gale. There have been some complaints that Katniss is too passive a protagonist but really her core personality seems unchanged to me. Yes, she is manipulated by the rebels, but she chooses this because it's the way to get what she wants, much like surving the games of trying to keep Peeta alive, and even then she does it at her own convenience. She's dealt a lousy hand but she plays it very well.    This is a bleak novel but there are some truly moving sections. At one point a Capitol citizen who has been kidnapped and violently introduced to the austerity of District 13 sees the clothes that Cinna designed for Katniss cries because it's been so long since she's seen anything pretty. And of course the sections where Katniss sings are also beautiful, particularly the last one, where she sings a combination of swan song, District 12 memorial and requiem.      Collins turns her readers into tributes and drops them into the violence and mayhem that is Panem at war. We survive, of course, but not without feeling drained, desolate and yet at the end of all this she manages to give us with hope.
0439023513|4.0|First of all- please forgive any spelling errors as i am dyslexic- I admire this series because of the main character, Katniss- without giving too much away I felt like the character remained true to herself in her actions. Forget about what we think we would do in any given situation; it is what you ACTUALLY DO is what counts. Despite all of the horrific situations that Katniss was exposed to over the 3 volumes of the series, I sincerely admired Katniss's steady moral code and her behavior in tough situations. She has made countless sacrifices to serve the greater good...and come on- that last arrow was \\"priceless\\"! The ONLY thing that I did not like about this book was the hurried fairytale ending- but I have to admit there was unconfortable losses that occoured- although not pleasing for a book- may have some ground in reality. All and all I recomend this book for nothing else but Katniss's steady, present, and outstanding character.
B0015DROBO|2.0|The middle of the book, which mostly constituted the murder-mystery portion, was a very good story. However, I couldn't get over the financial portion of the book. I find finances very boring to begin with, so I'm not surprised I didn't like it. I can see how some people would like this book, it just wasn't for me.
0812550706|5.0|LOVE it.  fantastic.  creative.  Takes you somewhere else, and even after the last page, and after several months, you can still catch yourself lingering in the place this book crafted in your memory.
0439023513|2.0|It's never easy to finish a series, but I felt with the way the first two had been set up, an equally spectacular third book was achievable.  Maybe I read it too fast, but everything that happened just felt way too rushed. By the end I just wanted to finish the book and get it over with.  Katniss's romance with Gale and Peeta was hardly an aspect of the plot. It was almost like she didn't even care about them anymore. Or anyone, really.  I got really lost during the trek to the capitol. I could never work out the scene in my head, and I had to go back a few pages every so often to see what had happened. Also, I didn't really get the whole point in killing Snow. I couldn't think of why that would solve any problems, and I kept forgetting why it was so important.    Katniss seemed so strong at the beginning of the series, she did what she wanted, but in this book she hardly made any choices. I suppose that was the part of the plot, but I didn't appreciate her sense of spirit anymore.    I didn't like the epilogue much either. She seemed so depressed, and it didn't even seem like she loved Peeta all that much, rather that she was just settling for him.    In the first two books, there were a lot of unexpected twists, and things happened that I didn't expect. In this book, I don't know what I expected, but it was more than what I got. Two stars - readable, but in light of the previous two, unsatisfying.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I do not usually like long books, or books that include insanely long descriptions of settings, towns, and people.  However, this book was different.  It is so long for a reason.  You get to know GENERATIONS of a family.  You meet the parents when they're young and their children when born.  You leave the book feeling like you know the history of this family... like you KNOW them... not just know how they acted in one or 2 different situations.  Like you know them inside and out.  I loved this book and put it right up there with The Catcher in the Rye as books that have made a difference in how I live & view my life.
0439023513|4.0|I was so excited for this book to hit shevels August 24th 2010. When I read about how Stepheine Meyer could not put down this new book called \\"The Hunger Games\\" I made sure the next time I visited Barnes and Noble to pick up a copy. At some point an author reaches that point when there so amazing whatever book they sujest I have confidence that I too will enjoy it. Well \\"The Hunger Games\\" far surpased what I had had \\"confidence\\" in. I became involved in the characters, I loved Suzanne Collins writing so much I read all of her childrens series \\"Gregor the overlander\\", which I thoughly enjoyed but gave me an insight on what kind of endings Collins books can take. Which is to say well spoiler! unpleseant. Her endings are no happily ever after. Far from it. Is she realistic? Yes. Does the ending make me put the book down and feel satisfied that my characters have been taken care of so that I may rest in peace? Well lets just say I, for both endings, have felt uneasy at the ending. Not that they are bad endings, it is just that sick depressed pressure I get in the pit of my stomach after finshing a fantasic series, that I know will not be surpased by another series for a while, deepens at the thought that one of my favorite characters (who i thought was safe so was not preparing myself for the loss at all) dies. However, the bitter part of me who screams that my characters deserved a much more padded ending is always told by the commen sense side that, though the ending was bitter, it also had light. It also held so much more purpose to the novel than a padded ending would have. Collins message: that war does not leave wounds that heal quickly and everyone is affected no matter how noble the cause, could not have concluded with a padded ending. Our characters are affected forever and are no longer the characters we met in the first few chapters of \\"The Hunger Games\\". This growth is the key to the success of the novels. While some have complained that Katniss is weak andnot the strong willed girl we met in \\"The Hunger Games\\" I see that as exactly Collins' point. I may not like it but Katniss has been changed and will never be the same by the end of \\"Mockingjay\\". Even Peeta who seemed to be the only Character to keep himself unchanged throughout \\"The Hunger Games\\", yes he phyically was stronger but still the same mind set, he is even changed by the end of \\"Mockingjay\\". Peeta's change is most likley the hardest character for me to face by the end of the book. But bringing it back to the fact that everyone, even amazingly sweet, awesome, thoughtful, Peeta, is affected by war. The question that these changes of my beloved characters brings up is, was it worth it? At the begining of \\"The Hunger Games\\" I would have instantly said that of course they should take John Locke's idea that if a government is wronging the citizens than the citizens should exersise their right to rebel. However, I question now whether there would have been another way, could the citizens have gained rights and respect through peaceful organisations, or is this to much of an ignorant outlook of humanity? Does Suzanne Collins agree with me and thats why there was a war or was her point exactly that we should question the role fighting takes in our lifes and the idea that if we wanted to we could change?

B0036EH3WU|4.0|On nearly all accounts, the Lost Box Set does not disappoint. I'll leave it to other reviewers to praise the series itself. My qualm resides with the extreme smell of the box the game board and DVD case: they all radiate a nauseating smell. After a few days outside, the smell is still overwhelming.

0399215980|4.0|The story and pictures are in the classic style of the author. The book it's self is a lot smaller than I had invisioned.
B00004W4UB|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  Julia Roberts plays an excellent character as Mary Reilly, a very sensitive and tormented young lady whom Doctor Jekyll finds he is attracted to yet stands back and does nothing.  As usual, John Malkovich, who plays Jekyll and Hyde is superb and quite attractive as Mr. Hyde. This is the best version that I have seen of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The music is haunting and goes very well with the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last book in a series is always a little stressful to read and this one was no exception. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time. Suzanne Collins definitely knows what she's doing! It was slow to start but when it did it was action packed and full of surprises. Anyone who hasn't read this series doesn't know what their missing. RUN to the store and buy this series NOW!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I got introduced to Jared Leto through his band 30 Seconds to Mars and ever since I've wanted to see this movie. Sure enough, I saw it for the first (and only) time several months ago. You can tell it's a completely different movie the second the DVD screen comes up. As for the movie itself...holy, holy cow. I think most of us would not want to see it again. Is it good? Yes, it is. Is it too good? Yes. And that's exactly why most of us would say no to a second viewing...    It's brutal, nightmarish and very, very real. Darren Aronofsky has pushed us to the limits of what is acceptable in movies and what crosses the line. Because it's unrated, it serves as a well-deserved warning to the general public. Some people probably won't be able to see it through to the end because it's so extreme. My mother couldn't. But even though it's extreme, it still remains a very realistic demonstration of the mechanics of addiction, volatile hope and complete destruction. I have to agree with Jeff Shannon on this movie when he says here on the product page, \\"Requiem for a Dream is a noteworthy film, but watching it twice would qualify as masochistic behavior.\\"
B002A9IZ9C|3.0|I bought the Di866 after using the Di622 and feeling it was missing some key features (High speed sync and wireless capability).<br /><br />At first, I was giddy and excited to get a flash with just about the same features as the more expensive Canon 580EX II but at a much lower price. I really enjoyed how maneuverable the flash head was, and being able to wirelessly sync with other Nissin flashes. I used it at a number of birthday parties with no problem.<br /><br />Then I used it at a fashion shoot, and it overheated on me. I was using it normally, taking one photo at a time, and there was definitely enough time for it to cool, as we had to change the clothing outfits. After an hour, the LCD screen said OVERHEAT, and I have not been able to turn it on since then. I am getting a replacement from Amazon, and we'll see how this one goes.<br /><br />If I can't use it normally, then I may have to get the Canon one.<br /><br />Update: I replaced these with the Canon 480 EX II and won't be looking back. With the Canon flash, I can depend on it working every time instead of going through (and replacing) 3 Nissin flashes.
B000FBFN0Q|2.0|After reading all the rave reviews, I thought this book was a bargain at only $0.89 for the Kindle.  I swiped it up and started reading it immediately.  I expected a funny, light read.  Light yes, funny, not so much.  I guess it could be considered funny by some, but I just found it irritating, namely: her inability to tell the truth about even the most minute, seemingly unimportant things, her flimsy, silly excuses to the bank and the way she tried to fall in love with a date simply because she knew he was wealthy.  There were too many bad sterotypes portrayed - that women are unable to take care of themselves, be responsible, are \\"gold diggers\\" and only think of clothes.  So why 2 stars?  First, it was only $0.89, so for a few hours entertainment, it cost less than a bad movie or meal.  And secondly, I found the ending to be the only redeeming factor of this book.  She discovers she is already smarter and more capable than she thought she was and she actually \\"grows up.\\"  While I wasn't impressed with the overall book, I do appreciate that the author had the main character grow, change and adapt.
B002ZG9846|3.0|Ok, I liked this film, I don't know why people said it was really funny. It had some slapstick humor but the characters of the super hero were all very good except red-mist who really wasn't a super hero but just a phony wanna be. Towards the end, the film makes you want it to end. Great first half, Nicholas Cage kind of redeemed himself but he really is a bigger actor than all these films he's done recently. What happened to the man who made Leaving Las Vegas? I understand there's an age for everything but I'm happy he's bouncing back and this is definitely a step in the positive direction for him. My favourite thing about the film was the little girl with the cool purple hair, her attitude was amazing. She reminded me of the little sister to the main character in 500 days of summer. The stand-out feature is that the film is not one percent cheesy surprisingly. It is not very very funny unless you found Superbad the funniest film of all time. Slightly geeky and indie but overall a little over-rated. Definitely worth watching, exceeded my expectations but still, I'm not watching the correct films this year.
B003EYVXYQ|1.0|This movie gets the one star because they at least spelled everything right on the blue ray box.  Ultimately a poor shlock film that is dated before it even hit the store.  The films z-list actors were reminescent of \\"House of the Dead\\" autrocity. The film lacks modern scare, has CGI blood effect (to which Romero conceeds..\\"its too expenive to do real effects these days, so we computer generate the gun shots, the blood etc\\"...too bad. garbage.
0439023513|2.0|The book is pretty good by itself. But in term of the last book in its trilogy, it is an disappointment! The author had created wonderful characters in the first and the second book. However, all of such excellent characters became dull and bored in the Mockingjay. It seems the author had big struggles in finding the way to develop the story. Was she in rush of fishing the book on time? I'd rather waiting another year to read a better book!
0060512806|5.0|The First Book I read of Neal Stephenson Hooked me for Life!<br /><br />If you want to try Neal's work I would highly recommend starting here. This novel encapsulates everything great about his writing style and blew me away. I'm traditionally a science fiction fantasy reader with some modern day thrillers and historical fiction thrown in and Neal combines a little of all of those in his books which is pretty unique.<br /><br />Highly recommended as an avid daily reader who has 2-3 books going at all times and has to read to fall asleep every night which means I've been reading every day practically for 35 years now and I can say he is one of my top 25 favorite all-time authors.<br /><br />Anyway, buy and read this and I guarantee you, it will set you up perfectly to want to then read his trilogy, the Baroque Cycle!<br /><br />Regards,<br />--Jarrett

B000AXSN5G|4.0|Neil Young's 2005 release \\"Prairie Wind\\" is a strong album, and had it not been because the album loses some of its clarity towards the end I might have to have ranked it up among great works such as \\"After the Gold Rush\\" and \\"Harvest.\\" There is as soft melodic country touch to many of the songs, and many actually have a similar sound to his classic 1970's albums. Lyrically, though, there has been a change and the themes of his songs are generally darker.<br /><br />The opening song \\"The Painter\\" is a very beautiful composition that makes you look out for your guitar to figure out how it goes. This is surely a classic. \\"No Wonder\\" is great too, maybe more traditional in its structure, but with lyrics that give rise for reflection.<br /><br />\\"Falling Off The Face Of The Earth\\" has a great verse line - reminds me a lot about Lou Reed. The falsetto part does not quite live up to the verse, but generally it's a great song too, with nice tasteful organ in the background.<br /><br />\\"Far From Home\\" and \\"It's Dream\\" is both sad songs - the first a bluesy tune with both horns, harmonica and slide guitar, whereas the second is a slow waltzy song. There is also some nostalgia in the lyrics of the title-track \\"Prarie Wind\\" - one of the few blues-rockers on the album, the longest track, too. \\"Here For You\\" is a melodic ballad which in spite of steel guitar and strings has a naked honesty to it.<br /><br />\\"This Old Guitar\\" is quite nice, but best remembered for the guest-appearance of Emmylou Harris. \\"He was the King\\" has a live unplugged feel to it, and the closing track \\"When God Made Me\\" is a gospel kind of tune. Without being weak are the last numbers of the album make to lose a little strength, and my favorites are among those first seven.
0439023513|5.0|I love this book so much, the writing style is so enjoyable, and I could barely wait for it!

I love George Romero's zombie flicks (yes, even \\"Land of the Dead\\" & \\"Diary of the Dead\\"), but this movie is a dud!<br />I understand that this film was made on a very small budget, but it's a complete mess; the movie tries to be funny and isn't, it tries to be scary and is not,tries to be thought provoking but fails and worst of all it isn't even entertaining.<br />This is a terrible film!
0064440346|5.0|This book is just wonderful and we read it together quite often.  We have a copy in our son's library and enjoy it very much.
0765326353|5.0|I am having a really hard time explaining this book and how much i loved it, so forgive me if i sound like a rambling idiot.     I have been a fan of all of Sandersons books. I loved all his previous works, and i don't want to take anything away from them, but The Way of Kings makes all his other books (Mistborn, Elantris, Warbreaker) look like nothing more than practice runs for this book.    The world of Roshar is incredibly well thought out. I can't imagine having the ability to actual create a world, but Sanderson makes it look easy. The Magic, races, storms, animal, and plant life are so detailed that it seemed like Sanderson was actually describing a world he has been to in real life.    The magic is really cool, yet it is a little daunting. There are so many different forms of magic that it will take me numerous reads to even get a grasp on it. The good thing is Sanderson managed to bring the magic to life little by little, leaving most of the magic to be fully examined in later books in the series. Thankfully, the characters are the main focus of the book, and there storylines were great.    Kaladin has just become not only my favorite of Sanderson characters,(beating out Kelsier from Mistborn, Raoden from Elantris, and Lightsong from Warbreaker) but by the end of the book, one of my all time favorite fantasy heroes. His backstory, time as a soldier, a slave, and his amazing climax were all incredible. I can't wait to see whats in store for him in the future. Other characters are great too. Dalinar and his sons are great and i was invested in them from the first time they were on the page. Shallan was a character i didn't care much for at the start, but by the end of the book, i was impressed with her story too.    One problem with this book is that after reading it the first time i knew i missed a bunch of things, and would have to read it again and probably again. Not only did i want to read The Way of Kings again, but also all of Sandersons other books too. If you have read Mistborn, Elantris, and Warbreaker you will see just how related all of Sandersons worlds are. I know i need to read all his books again to try to get clues on Hoid, and the Shards from them. I have a feeling that every world Sanderson has written about is going to end up playing a big role in this series.    Wow, this book is really hard to explain, so the only other thing i can say is that this is a must own for all fantasy fans. You won't be disappointed.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|I love Ta-Dah.  I am beyond puzzled that so many people trash this CD.  It's wonderful, and of The Scissor Sister's three studio releases, it's my clear favorite (with their very uneven but still wonderful debut 2nd, and Night Work 3rd).  That said, it's not perfect, and I think we could have done without \\"Intermission\\" and \\"Kiss You Off\\" [aside - does anyone else feel like me about the obligatory Ana Matronic song on each Scissor Sisters CD - it's like Yoko Ono's songs on John Lennon's records, you cringe when you hear them but somehow manage to get through it].  But any CD that has so many A-caliber songs such as \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\", \\"I Can't Decide\\", \\"Lights\\", \\"Oooh\\", \\"Paul McCartney\\", \\"The Other Side\\" (which they must have written as a Roxy Music \\"tribute\\"), and finishes off with \\"Everybody Wants The Same Thing\\" can't be all that bad.  And kudos to the Sisters for putting gay international porn star Lukas Ridgeston (albeit clothed and bespectacled) on the cover, how can that not make you smile or laugh?
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Though I've read most of the other novels by Jane Austin--my favorites being [[ASIN:1453693319 Pride And Prejudice]] and [[ASIN:1593080492 Sense and Sensibility (Barnes & Noble Classics Series) (B&N Classics)]]--I've never read [[ASIN:1451539347 Persuasion]].  I think that the descriptive statements that accompany the book have put me off for some reason in the past.  I was on an Austin kick, however, and decided to view a DVD of the novel.  I have to say that I'm much encouraged to read the book itself from what I've seen of the story.<br /><br />That said, however, I didn't feel that the film itself was exceptional.  Perhaps I've seen too many stellar cast versions of other Austin books.  The Emma Thompson version of [[ASIN:0800141660 Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)]] with Huge Grant, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman and a totally amazing cast of British character actors and the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version of [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]] would spoil any viewer for anything less.<br /><br />Rupert Penry-Jones was not as riveting as Fredrick Wentworth as one might have hoped.  He lacks the dark brooding and sometimes almost sinister character of an Austin romantic hero.  I suspect that his open face and blondness gave him too much of a pleasant \\"guy next door\\" air.  He gave a very masterful performance as the rejected lover while on horseback accompanying the heroine in her coach, but the stormy weather background and his costume had much to do with it.  One can't help feel that Victorian riding boots, panel fronted trousers, white linen cravats and a flowing cape would give most men the look of a romantic hero.  It's almost too bad they've given them up these days!<br /><br />Most of the female characters were very unremarkable, almost forgettable.  Sally Hawkins makes a very unprepossessing Anne Elliot.  Her Anne seems to revel in the martyrdom of spinsterhood like a sullen 19 year old.  Instead of being a beautiful woman of great dignity and poise who has chosen to remain unmarried rather than marry someone other than the love of her life, she seems dumpy. Emma Thompson's Ms Dashwood as the practical mainstay of her own natal family is far less frumpy and moody.  When Anne descends the stair in what looks like a gown made from the living room drapes we are doubtlessly intended to contrast this with her sister's fine ball gown and see that Anne is the epitomy of the sensible woman.  Instead we feel like she's attempting a \\"poor little me\\" routine to gain sympathy. Part of this is the attempted shorthand of the film.  We're meant to understand her through her costume.  It didn't work.<br /><br />Jennifer Higham as Louisa Musgrove is almost annoying.  Though she doesn't look it, she acts like a girl of 13 or 14 who has a crush on a handsome \\"older\\" neighbor and who has yet to decide if she wants to be a little girl and play or an adult and court.  She just comes across as totally inappropriate.  It is hardly surprising that Captain Wentworth is shocked to discover he has inadvertently \\"committed himself\\" to this playful child.  It would be like Edward Ferrars finding himself engaged by accident to the youngest Dashwood sister Margaret because they played tag and swords on the manor grounds!  What the character did do well was to feed information to the audience about Anne.  By contrasting the quiet, unassuming and practical Anne with the light weight antics of Ms Muscove, we see why the hero might have returned after eight years for a second chance.<br /><br />Probably the greatest missed chance was Julia Davis' Elizabeth Elliot.  So much more could have been made of her character than was.  I could almost see a performance akin to that of Harriet Walter's Fanny Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility or Juliet Stevenson's Mrs. Elton in Emma. These characters did so much to illuminate the lives and personalities of their respective heroines, they almost carried the story.  That's what they're supposed to do.  Almost all Austin characters are there to further the story and provide the reader with information.  Had the director made better use of Elizabeth's behavior as favorite daughter and debutant, more of Anne's personality and place in her family would have been apparent.  Certainly Amanda Hale's neurotic presentation of Mary Elliot Musgrove did a great deal to further the audience's understanding of Anne and her situtation.<br /><br />A good story, but only a fair film because not everything that could have been done with the characters was.all Austin characters are there to further the story and provide the reader with information.

0439023513|4.0|I've been highly anticipating this book since I finished \\"Catching Fire\\" a year ago. I got \\"Mockingjay\\" the night it came out, finished it the next day, and then, for a long while, I didn't know what to think.    -SPOILERS-    Because here's the thing--I hated this book. And because of that, I think it's the perfect ending. I have so much respect, after finishing the trilogy, for Suzanne Collins, and for her unwillingness to shy away from certain truths. \\"Mockingjay\\" was a hard book, and a painful book, but I think another ending to the trilogy wouldn't have been as satisfying. Something with a lighter or happier ending, something with less death and where less things fell apart wouldn't have been true to the original story. It may have been more enjoyable, or made me more superficially happy, but the books would have lost some of their integrity.     I have read some reviews where people complain about Katniss's lack of spine in this book, and I can understand that. But I was okay with it. Katniss is a fighter--we've seen that in \\"The Hunger Games\\" and in \\"Catching Fire.\\" And in \\"Mockingjay,\\" we see her at the end of her rope. War and intrigue and trauma--not to mention two forays into the arena--have broken her. And while she doesn't give up, she's no longer entirely whole.     Finnick, in \\"Catching Fire,\\" says to Katniss that, except for maybe Peeta, none of the Hunger Games victors were victors by accident. And there is truth to that--Katniss is hard, she is calculating. Her softest, most human moments involve Prim. And by the end of \\"Mockingjay,\\" Katniss has lost almost everything, including her sister. Of course she is broken. If she had behaved differently in \\"Mockingjay,\\" I don't think I would have believed it. But I can completely believe this quieter, more fearful, damaged Katniss. I think that one of the ultimate messages in this book was that war changes people, that there are some things you can never come back from. And Collins follows that through tothe end, creating a story that is dark and difficult and disturbing in its blatant truthfulness.      That being said, there are a few things that did bother me, and first and foremost of these is the treatment of Cinna in \\"Mockingjay.\\" I honestly thought that more was going to be done with him. He really grew as a character in the first two books, and I had so many unanswered questions about him. Why did he request District 12 in his first Hunger Games? Where did he come from initially? How did he get involved in the rebellion? There was so much mystery surrounding Cinna, and I thought that \\"Mockingjay\\" would give us some answers. And when his death was relegated to a single sentence at the beginning of \\"Mockingjay\\"...I didn't believe it. I kept waiting for him to pop up again somewhere, surprisingly alive and with some answers, but he never did.    I was also a little disappointed--albeit to a lesser degree--with Finnick's death (partly I think just because I absolutely loved Finnick.) It was just so quick and brutal. That was okay--I understand that not every death scene can be a long, poetic one, but I would have liked to see a little more grieving. Katniss never seemed to react much to it--and we barely saw Annie again after it--and I just would have liked to have seen Finnick, as well as the others in Katniss's group, mourned. I can forgive this more than I can forgive the lack of ceremony for Cinna, however, because I think that part of it shows just how cold and separate Katniss has gotten, and we begin to see, perhaps, just how irreparably she is damaged.     Prim's death was well done--confusing and heartbreaking, and the first place in the book where I really cried. And I didn't mind how much smaller of a role the love triangle played in this book. Because it was never about the Peeta-vs-Gale triangle, not really. That was there because it is human nature to fall in love, and a lot of this book was about human nature, but it was never the main conflict. Iwould have been fine with Katniss choosing Gale or choosing no one at all, and I'm fine with the way things played out.     For a long time, I couldn't put my finger on why I was so disturbed by the ending--of Peeta and Katniss alone with their children in District 12. Because it isn't as if it is a hopeless ending; for their children, for the world, there is hope, and plenty of it. But for Peeta and Katniss, I realized eventually, there isn't. There are some things that you can't get past, and so they live through them. Neither of them will ever recover from the war or the arena; they are forever changed by that, and will have to live with the memories and the nightmares forever. But this ending, as hard and bittersweet as it is, is a necessary one. If it had been a happier ending, if they had managed to forget, even if they had left District 12--it wouldn't have been as honest, and it wouldn't have been as powerful. And that, in the end, is what makes \\"Mockingjay\\" such a powerhouse ending--I can hate it all I want, but I can't not respect it's unflinching view of our potential future.
1416549447|5.0|I am an asthmatic who has always wanted to run, but I never thought I would be able to run for over a few minutes. I read this book in it's first edition as a library book and it became such an integral part of my excercise program that I renewed it and then came back to the library the day after I finally had to return it so I could check it out again. I decided to buy it without delay. I love the new edition with the different organization and information. I am a beginning runner and started running with this program when I was 40 lbs overweight. Now, about two months later, I have lost 20 pounds and had no injuries. When I started I could barely run for 2 minutes. Now I can run for 20 minutes without to much fatigue. I have also gone off one of my asthma medications, and am hopeful that I will no longer need any medication as my distances and times increase. I am less stressed and more energized than I have ever ben in my life. The form taught in this book is mostly responsible for my success. I also have a history of back pain, and I had none because of the \\"leveled pelvis\\" and low impact taught in this book. Very easy to read, common-sense techniques that apply to the rest of your life as well. I am a Senior Vocal Performance Major in college, and the principals have also helped me greatly with my singing. This is a must-buy for anyone who wants to run in a way that is fun, energizing, and efficient.
030745455X|3.0|There's a difference between a good storyteller and good writer and Stieg Larsson is not a good writer.<br /><br />He's a master of the irrelevant detail with a weird fixation on coffee.<br /><br />His characters \\"start coffee,\\" \\"pour coffee,\\" are \\"impressed\\" with others' coffee-making skills. I swear F. Scott Fitzgerald did not mention booze as much in all his stories as Larsson mentions coffee in this one book. If Larsson had written \\"Moby Dick,\\" the opening line would be \\"Call me Ishmael and join me for a coffee...\\"<br /><br />Larson seems to very often miss the point that good thriller writers know about what information to give and what to withhold, and what characters know and what the reader should know and when.<br /><br />Then there's the needless and draining repetition.<br /><br />In one tiresome chapter, he gives us a police press conference where all the information (and I mean ALL) is stuff we already know, but is presented again in detail.<br /><br />There's a 100 page section that's truly risible in its irrelevance. Characters investigate and hit dead ends and \\"uncover\\" information we already know. We, the reader, are ahead of the characters, and that's always tedious (unless the characters are being drawn suspenseful into a trap, which is not the case).<br /><br />As Eric Asimov wrote, you can't wait for Larsson's books to end (as opposed to not wanting them to end) but I have to admit, that despite all their many flaws, I sort of enjoy reading these books. I also spend a lot of time wondering why.<br /><br />I think it's because, Larsson is a good storyteller, and he creates compelling characters. His Lisbeth Salander is singular pleasure to follow, and whenever she's on the page, the story crackles. Just being inside her head is a perverse pleasure.<br /><br />I'll probably read the next installment (which is supposed to be much better than \\"...Played with Fire\\") and then be glad they're over (but not glad for the reason, of course).
0439023513|5.0|I preordered this book after reading the first two books in the series.  I couldn't wait for it to come and it arrived at my house in less then 3 days after publishing.  Also due to preordering through Amazon i got a great price when ordering and then it dropped the price again so I saved even more money.  I would preorder again since it worked so well.  And the book was great.
B000W4D94I|3.0|I'm a huge Michael Crichton fan.  But, I've noticed that the best of Micheal Crichton is still unavailable on Blu-ray.  Even though I'm not particularly fond of Jurassic Park, it is considered his most famous story and film, and yet not available on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />\\"Twister\\" is Okay.  It's not Michael Crichton's best story writing film effort.  Far from it.  And the other known Micheal Crichton film currently available on Blu-Ray is \\"Sphere\\".  It's had mediocre reviews, but yet it too, has been made available on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I'm not particularly fond of \\"The Andromeda Strain\\", but I'd appreciate it over \\"Twister\\" and \\"Sphere\\", as I'm sure many people do.  But, these are the Micheal Crichton films that I am sure MANY people are anxious to see remastered in High Definition on to Blu-ray.  Prepare to get a hard-on when you see all these great movies suggested all in one sentence:<br /><br />\\"Westworld\\", \\"Coma\\", \\"The Great Train Robbery\\", \\"Runaway\\", \\"Looker\\", \\"The 13th Warrior\\", \\"Rising Sun\\", \\"Congo\\", and \\"Disclosure.\\"<br /><br />These are the one's that we are waiting for on Blu-Ray.  Perhaps we could get a box set put together like they did for Stanley Kubrick since he's dead now, too.  One less person they'll have to pay royalties to.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|****SPOILER ALERT****This review is of the movie, not the dvd. This movie was a complete disappointment and waste of time: two hours of basically following a depressed George Clooney around....a bit of sex with prostitutes, a bit of suspense while trying to figure out what the story could possibly be about, a bit of action at the end.... and then he dies. There wasn't a storyline to catch onto. One wouldn't even know he was a \\"hitman\\" except the small blurb on the online movie schedule. This was based on a book, but I don't remember the title. Perhaps the way the book was written was too difficult to translate to a movie....
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|Sony must think we just want any movie on Blu-Ray, so we can say that we have the best quality available of any particular movie.  I really wish these companies that release Blu-Ray would stick to the REASONS WHY we would upgrade our movie collections from DVD to Blu-Ray.<br /><br />This release of \\"The Terminator\\" onto Blu-Ray is a waste of everybody's money if your intention is the same as mine as to get a High-Definition improvement of our favorite movies.  If it can not be made to look any better than the DVD, please don't release the Blu-Ray version of the same mediocre quality.  However, I know with today's quality enhancement skills being applied to many films, this movie could have been greatly improved for a pleasing High-Definition improved picture and sound.  We know it takes a pain-staking frame-by-frame articulate effort to improve video quality but it CAN be done.  It has been done by many movie companies already.  And only then, should our movies be converted to Blu-Ray so that it JUSTIFIES why we would want to buy the movie again.  Jeez, is that too unrealistic of an expectation?<br /><br />Here are some words of deception used as well as some vague statements to explain what you're getting with this Blu-Ray release of \\"The Terminator\\":<br /><br />On the front (bottom), it says: EXPERIENCE HIGH DEFINITION<br /><br />The deception here is that this statement DOES NOT apply to this Blu-Ray disc.<br /><br />And on the top of the back it says: BLU-RAY DISC TAKES YOU BEYOND HIGH DEFINITION<br /><br />Again, that statement is not supported by this movie's un-enhanced transfer to Blu-Ray.  Shame on you, Sony!<br /><br />Then, there is this rather vague disclaimer that I guess we should start to look for before we waste our money buying the Blu-Ray to replace our DVD:<br /><br />Near the top on the back it says:<br /><br />PURE (meaning unchanged and unaltered) PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY. TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE MASTER<br /><br />Well, there you have what best explains that NO EFFORT has been made to improve this movie for transfer to Blu-Ray.  You're going to get the same un-improved video transfer as that of your DVD, and this Blu-Ray disc gives you less extras than the DVD.  And why is that?  So that, some day soon, they may actually apply that pain-staking, frame-by-frame, articulate effort to improve the video quality, and then put in all those currently existing extras that your DVD already has, so that they can sell the Blu-Ray version of this movie AGAIN.  Why else, would they leave out all those already existing extras?  It's a pre-calculated rip-off! It's a recognized release pattern that we've seen for years, and they still do it.  I believe George Lucas is the master of this corrupted \\"bilk-the-consumer\\" re-release then re-sell, style of profiting.  Sell it at a bare minimum for quality and content.  Then, improve on it, and then sell it again.<br /><br />So, I hope this will be a lesson to us all.  And I've learned this with several Blu-Ray releases as well.  Just because it's been transferred to Blu-Ray, DOES NOT mean that it's going to look any better than your currently owned DVD.<br /><br />So, buyer beware!  If possible, RENT IT FIRST!  So, you can compare it to your DVD.  That would save you money in the long run, don't you think?transfer to Blu-Ray.

0553801473|2.0|disappointing. There may be a bunch of good reviews from people whom only got into this series AFTER the HBO show, but i was into it before and i haven't even seen the show so this comes the the perspective of a fan/reader of the series. You only get more upset because it takes Martin s damn long between books to get the next one out, lol. And the last i heard the next book is nothing more than a collection of backstories. Don't even know if i'm going to even bother with that. hell, he takes so long between book releases i might not even bother. You'd think being a successful writer he'd know not to take so long between book, but i guess he's enjoying making all that money from bandwagon fanboys of his HBO series. Thanks for screwing your readers for your tv show, Martin, lol. Anyways, buy it only if you're a fan of the series. Even then, don't say i didn't warn you.

B000BUYP4Q|4.0|In my opinion, Batman Begins (2005) should have been called The Dark Knight because Batman takes centerstage in this movie, unlike in The Dark Knight (2008) where Batman seems to take a back seat to The Joker and Two-Face. That's the irony - in the movie that's called The Dark Knight, Batman actually takes a back seat to the villains, who steal the show. I personally think The Dark Knight should have been called The Joker Emerges, or something like that.<br /><br />Now I want to make some observations about this movie.<br /><br />First of all, it's inevitable that the new Christopher Nolan movies will always be compared to the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher movies, so that's one thing I myself will do. In contrast to Burton and Schumacher, Christopher Nolan went for darkness, realism, and seriousness in his Batman movies in an effort to make them far different than the semi-campy (though dark) Burton films and all-out campy and bright Schumacher films. I feel that Batman Begins is TOO real. It's TOO serious. To me, Batman movies should have an element of fun to them. An example is Batman (1989) - The Joker was evil, but he had dark humor to go along with his evilness. He used gadgets, like a hand buzzer and squirting lapel flower. Sometimes he went a little too far, like dancing, etc., but he showed he was funny as well as dark and evil. It was a good balance. It seems that in the Nolan movies, all the fun has been sucked out of them and they're way too serious and realistic. Their overall atmosphere and look seem a lot like cop dramas that you see on primetime weeknight TV. I found Batman Begins a little boring for the first hour or so, and this is a big reason why.  However, the second half of the movie kind of makes up for it with lots of action and suspense.<br /><br />I thought the acting was pretty good. The best acting came from Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox was also pretty good. Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow was OK. I thought Scarecrow was somewhat of a boring villain who didn't do much, and borderline cheesy. Gary Oldman was pretty good as Commissioner Gordon. I thought Katie Holmes was pretty good as Rachel Dawes. I like her portrayal of Rachel Dawes a little better than Maggie Gyllenhaal's in The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Christian Bale? I thought he was a mediocre Bruce Wayne and a mediocre Batman. Not bad, but not good. His voice while he's Batman sounds as if he's been smoking for 40 years. Bruce Wayne comes off as too much of a playboy in this movie as well as in The Dark Knight. He seems to have an attitude and is arrogant. I think Michael Keaton owns the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman in the 1989 and 1992 movies.<br /><br />I dislike the Batmobile in this movie. Now, the Batmobile has been through many incarnations in previous movies. First, there was the Batmobile from the '60s TV series and 1966 movie called Batman: The Movie. Then, the Batmobile from the '89 and '92 movies. Then a different one in the '95 and '97 movies. They all were CARS. Like they should be. Right? Well, Christopher Nolan decided that the Batmobile appeared as a car too often, so he changed it to what is called a \\"Tumbler\\" that looks like a cross between a tank and a Hummer, so now the Batmobile isn't even a car. Bad. This goes too far, in my opinion.  The Batcave? It was cool. It's slightly better than the Batcave from the Tim Burton films.  Batman's costume? It was on par with the costumes used in the '89 and '92 Tim Burton films, maybe slightly better.  Some of the conditions in this movie were unique and different, such as the pouring rain in a few scenes.<br /><br />I found the musical score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard to be flat and unmoving in not only this movie, but The Dark Knight as well. They in no way compare to Danny Elfman's masterpiece scores from the 1989 and 1992 movies.<br /><br />I found the movie hard to follow at times, so I needed to watch it again to understand it.<br /><br />This is a two-DVD set that comes with many extras.<br /><br />I think this movie is better than The Dark Knight.  This movie isn't as much of a mess and complicated like The Dark Knight is.  The Dark Knight is all over the place, with some scenes in Hong Kong, too many characters, a confusing story, plot holes, and it's way more serious than Batman Begins, and I thought Batman Begins was serious.  The Dark Knight tops it.<br /><br />When I think of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies, the first thing I think of is cops, cops in riot gear, SWAT teams, and tons of police cars.  It's way overdone, but especially in the second and third movies.  The second thing I think of is Law & Order, NYPD Blue, and CSI: NY.  The movies feel like these cop dramas, especially the second and third movies.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good movie, but I still prefer the movies from 1989, 1992, 1995, and 1997, especially the 1989 and 1992 movies.<br /><br />If you've never seen a Batman movie before, I think you should watch this as well as The Dark Knight and then watch the 1989 and 1992 movies for starters so you can do the inevitable comparison just like I have. You might like the older movies better, or you might like the new Nolan movies better. Everyone has their own opinions.<br /><br />UPDATE: April 23, 2013 - I rank Batman Begins (2005) the best of the trilogy followed by The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and then The Dark Knight (2008).<br /><br />This is a two-DVD set that comes with many extras.<br /><br />I think this movie is better than The Dark Knight.

Too unrealistic that it was frustrating.

It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I finally found it for $8.00. I was happy but not nearly as exited as I would have been if I had found it sooner. In any case with CD insert in hand and lower expectations I put this on my CD player, lay on my sofa, turn on my lamp and press play while I start reading the lyrics.<br /><br />First of all he is a magnificent musician and the arrangements are gorgeous. But pretty soon I start noticing I'm going nowhere. I can read what he is saying but I can't hear it through the speakers. I close my eyes and then I hear all the pretty sounds but still I'm unable to create any emotion. Like a bad McCartney song that sounds good but lacks soul, the album continues a slow pace  towards its climax \\"Chicago\\" a song that is truly magnificent. But as soon as is over I'm dragged down again to more chorus and whispered style singing. I really have no problem with that style of singing, Nick Drake did it beautifully but there was humanity in his singing, he didn't do it by choice he did it because that was his God given singing voice. Here Stevens whispers even the high notes which borders on absurdity.<br /><br />In any case I found some highlights the already mentioned \\"Chicago\\", \\"The Man of Metropolis\\" and \\"The Tallest Man\\"

B000M341QE|3.0|As for anything `deeper,' in a film like this one cannot really dig into issues like cultural identity, or masculinity and violence, because, while they are there, they are there at such a superficial level (as opposed to, say, the same theme of violence in Taxi Driver or Raging Bull, explored at a far deeper level). On a technical level, the film does employ music well, and the film succeeds with its many quick cuts, even if more longer paced scenes should have been interspersed to let the actors truly act and cogitate on their lives, beyond the overacting DiCaprio does on Fermiga's couch. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus does his usual competent job, especially in the retro look of some scenes, which open and close with irises.<br /><br />  The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is naturally bloated. There are not enough extras to need a second disk, and furthermore, for a two disk set, they commit the ultimate crime: no film commentary by Scorsese nor any of the leads. There are nine deleted scenes prefaced by Scorsese's reasons for omission, a profile called Scorsese On Scorsese, a documentary on the criminal this film was based upon: Boston crime kingpin, James `Whitey' Bulger, a documentary on what influenced Scorsese's crime films, and the theatrical trailer. Solid stuff, but for two disks, more- especially an audio commentary, should be standard issue. But, were the movie better, the gripes re: the DVD package would be minimal.<br /><br />  As it is, The Departed is good Hollywood fluff, yet, given that it's Scorsese, more is expected, although I have the sinking feeling that, like Woody Allen, he will never produce another masterpiece. This film follows a standard cops and crooks formula, which, in and of itself, is not a bad thing- consider the 1997 crime masterpiece, L.A. Confidential. The difference is that where that film took a genre formula and twisted it from pulp melodrama into real drama, via the writing and performances, as well as ending the film with a satisfying twist that was unexpected in the small, even if expected in the large (the good guys won), The Departed does the inverse, never rising above melodrama (even if good), and ending the film with a bad twist, of the worst deus ex machina sort. If you watch the film, don't expect much of an aesthetic not intellectual rush, only some mildly entertaining moments, crafted really well. If you want the former, go watch some earlier films from the Scorsese canon. Unfortunately, given his recent output, that last line was also likely seen coming from a mile away.g twist that was unexpected in the small, even if expected in the large (the good guys won), The Departed does the inverse, never rising above melodrama (even if good), and ending the film with a bad twist, of the worst deus ex machina sort.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|Little by little people kept mentioning \\"Funeral\\" and by 2006 most of my friends have already talked about the greatness of Arcade Fire. I even remember my SPIN magazine featuring a picture of Win Butler with Bruce Springsteen and me thinking  is he that big of an icon that he is paired next to Springsteen. So as many things when they are build up to the stratosphere its better to wait on it otherwise it wouldn't fulfill the promise made.<br /><br />Anyhow I waited 5 years and I was stupid for doing so because \\"Funeral\\" delivers and does it in ways you do not expect. There are epics moments, there are sweet moments, there are rocking moments. Its a roller coaster of sounds and landscapes. In a world where every indie band uses the same chord progression, tempo, and singing style than the previous act. Arcade Fire does the almost impossible give each song its own identity and distinct feeling.<br /><br />So in my humble opinion \\"Funeral\\" is one of the best recent albums to grace our ears. Just with 10 songs they made us fall in love. As a matter of fact I haven't been this excited about a band since \\"The Flaming Lips\\" and \\"The Eels\\". I can already see this crawling its way into my small but loyal selection of favorite records.
B000OVLBGC|3.0|The few critics of the film, naturally, frame their criticisms not artistically, but based upon the director's supposed failure to truly depict how hard life really was in East Germany, or that a Wiesler could not have existed in reality, for the Stasi was so paranoid about loyalty that they always worked in pairs, etc. Of course, these criticism miss the point as much as the positive ones do. That Wiesler may not have been able to exist in reality has nothing to do with the diegetic reality of the film, wherein he functions quite well, save for the rather thin reason for his `treason.' As stated, it would have been more plausible if he protected Dreyman so that Grubitz and Hempf lost face, for abusing the `good will' of the Communist state. Few critics, though, have commented on the drab visuals (including those not intended), the trite dialogue between the artists, and the presence of numerous melodramatic plot twists used merely to move the sometimes slow moving 137 minute film along (it could have lost 30 minutes to great positive effect). Despite this, it is a solid film, but one likely not deserving of an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Picture, which it won.<br /><br />  I mentioned its affinity to The Conversation, but this film is far more prosaic, and, as terrific an acting performance as M&uuml;he provides, his character is simply not nearly as complex as Gene Hackman's Harry Caul, nor is his self-doubt as realistically (and, more importantly, effectively) depicted. He should have been protecting Dreyman to screw Grubitz, rather than for Dreyman's sake (or even because he, too, lusted for Sieland), because that would have been believable, and added layers of depth to Wiesler's conversion (so, too, could shading have been thus added to Wiesler's taking of the typewriter- is he protecting Dreyman, or trying to hide his own prior protection of Dreyman? But, that also would have required a depth of life experience and writerly ability that the callow Donnersmarck, and his rather straightforward plot, lacked. However, all in all, a good effort from a first time filmmaker, and one that deserved applause, if not all the plaudits it received.  For all its flaws, the screenplay and film, at least, attempt something of depth, even if, overall, they come up short. Wiesler ultimately loses faith not in the `system,' but in the people who run the system; this is why he is so disconsolate, even after the fall of the Berlin Wall, for his system is now dead.<br /><br />  The Lives Of Others does fall prey to the Day After Effect, for its flaws stick more than its good qualities, but it's worth a viewing for those good qualities, faithful or -less.

B001TOD92C|4.0|The Wrestler is the vehicle for Rourke to shine on. It's a film that claws and earns its way to greatness. Perhaps the worst thing is the film is the nearly unreadable font of the opening credits, but after that, it's all excelsior. It's small moments remind me of The Jimmy Show, a terrific, and similarly unsentimental, 2001 film that got as much indifference as this film got hype. Both films are unafraid to show life's unpretty side, but neither film buys into the false heroics of Hollywood endings, nor the false travails of more melodramatic `indy' films. It also piques one to envision what a truly adult film by the hit and miss director Kevin Smith would be like, since his films are all set in New Jersey, with blue collar folk, as well.<br /><br />  Randy `The Ram' Ramzinsky is what his daughter claims, a screw-up. But, he realizes it. So many of the characters in films, and people in real life, delude themselves into thinking they are things they are not. And it is this sort of strength that makes the film an `adult' film, not Tomei's nudity (watch the scene where Randy heads down from the supermarket bathroom to enter the deli box, pauses, with the blare of a pro wrestling entrance theme playing, breathes, then enters to the silence of mundane work). More of this is needed. Perhaps Darren Aronofsky, if he's learnt the lessons of this film, can pick up the gauntlet that John Cassavetes tossed down a few decades ago, but which remains on American cinema's floor. If not, at least here's hoping he does not return to his earlier ways. If, instead of navel gazing masturbatory philosophy, a dose of blue collar realism (and no sport is more blue collar than pro wrestling) can work wonders for an artist like Aronofsky, imagine what it can do for the blue collars that watch it. Go ahead, try it, for a change!
B000AOEMXM|4.0|It was good to get the complete series in one package so I could see the whole story line in sequence.  I've been a fan of all of the Star Trek series and although they did take some liberties for the most part they stayed true to the theme of Star Trek in general I could have watched several more seasons had they been available.
B000R8YC18|5.0|Is there an American film more wrongly and regularly misinterpreted than Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece, Taxi Driver? Not even 2001: A Space Odyssey, by Stanley Kubrick, nor Apocalypse Now, by Francis Ford Coppola, have been intellectually, politically, and critically twisted and turned away from what they really are- and this all aside and apart from the silly debates over art influencing real world violence after John W. Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, in 1981, due to his own obsession with actress Jodie Foster. The film has been deconstructed and reconstructed (see references to Death Wish and The Searchers) according to prevailing political and artistic whims more than several times, and matters have been further complicated by the many claims of the film's protagonists, from screenwriter Paul Schrader (is there a better example of a filmic one hit wonder?), to director Scorsese, to star Robert De Niro, the claims and counterclaims about the film have devolved into legendry.<br /><br />Taxi Driver was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, but lost out to the formulaic boxer flick, Rocky, penned by Sylvester Stallone It did, however, win the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It is not only a great motion picture, but it is one of the best portraits of a character ever filmed, and Travis Bickle is one of the scariest characters in film history. Probably only Martin Landau's character, Judah Rosenthal, in Woody Allen's Crimes And Misdemeanors, is more truly horrifying (and certainly far more evil). But Bickle is every bit as scary, for he is far more unpredictable to those about him. Yes, he is not a cold blooded murderer, like Rosenthal, but he is certainly violent, and a racist- not of the KKK White Supremacist sort, but of the passive, scared little white boy sort; and much mileage has been gotten from the fact that the film's final shootout victims were all white, when in the original screenplay they had been all black (Scorsese and Schrader bowed to studio pressure to change that fact, because by not making a change, the beancounters claimed, the film might incite race riots, and lead to financial culpability). These elements are what make Bickle scary, and why he is so realistically portrayed. Yet, there is also the niggling truth even the film seems loath to admit, that Travis Bickle really and truly IS a hero, and not merely a crazed lunatic. Note that I wrote `not merely,' for this is an important point: because most critics resort to binary thought in such matters, that does not change the fact that Bickle is a dangerous and paranoid man and a hero; and these are not mutually opposing claims. And by `hero,' I mean it in the absolutely most sober sense of the word. Heroes are not perfect men, but they are real men (and women, of course). And heroes are not necessarily even ethically `good' men (imagine that!). But they are brave, they are determined, and they are relentless, in the pursuit of the goals, things, and people, they deem as good. But, most of all they are `real,' not like the fictive heroes that populate books and films, comic books and video games. And rarely has there ever been a more chillingly realistic portrayal of a hero in film than Travis Bickle. Now, do me the favor of not misinterpreting that, ok?corsese and Schrader bowed to studio pressure to change that fact, because by not making a change, the beancounters claimed, the film might incite race riots, and lead to financial culpability).

0525423842|1.0|I don't get it. Really, I don't. There's no action, nothing particularly interesting happens, there are strange diversions into Animal Court and for some reason, Grisham thinks 13 year old boys wouldn't admit to having girlfriends.<br /><br />Also, this kid watches Perry Mason nightly and can explain the complexities of bankruptcy law, but randomly doesn't know what being held in contempt of court might mean.<br /><br />The story is riddled with inconsistencies that you wouldn't notice if the story wasn't plodding on at a snail's pace with telling where you should be showing and showing what could've been told--including several repeated conversations where the same thing is explained over and over again.<br /><br />It was such an interesting premise. A kid lawyer and Grisham set up some other boys in the class (oh, btw, this school isn't coed--girls and boys go to the same school but do not attend the same classes. What? Why? There's no valid plot reason for this. Grisham should've considered another century to set this story in) as being inventive and having their own talents that would've made a great kid gang, but alas. We are left with Theodore, legal sue.<br /><br />This book is depressingly bad. If you want kids to stop reading, this is the book to help them along that path.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|All in all, I Am Legend is even a disappointment if one went in expecting disappointment. There is no deeper examination of loneliness, just shots of aloneness. The threat to Neville has been dumbed down- in earlier versions he is the threat. In this film, he is the threatened. The female he meets is a religious bubblehead, rather than a plant from the semi-zomboids that are looking to start a New Breed. And on and on goes the watering down. The film fails as both an adaptation, and if seen without knowledge of its forebears. But, aside from its Hollywoodization stripping the tale of its relevance and depth, this film version even fails its low Hollywoodized standards of success- it's dull, poorly made, and has not a second of suspense. It is a retard's retard. But, as I always seek to give credit where it's due, let me state to that grandfather of Hollywood dumbing down, `Thanks for nothing, Mr. Spielberg!'
1449528279|3.0|This is a very difficult book to review, because I'm not actually sure what I thought about it or how I felt about it. It's widely accepted as a masterpiece of British literature, and there's good reason why it's a classic and why it's still widely read today.<br /><br />This book was hard to read, hard to understand, and hard to enjoy--but it's meant to be that way. I see it as part of Thackeray's statement about the society he's describing. This makes it difficult to decide if I should give the book four stars, because it succeeds in it's endeavor and is rather brilliant, or two, because it succeeded in being wordy, confusing, and being populated by unpleasant people. I gave it three, which is for sure wrong, but will hopefully warn those who need a warning what it is they are getting themselves into by starting this trek through the good and bad times in the life of Miss Becky Sharp and through the highest and lowest offerings of British Regency society.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|Overall, There Will Be Blood is a film with a good opening, a few good potential moments and scenes (as with the faux brother), but it ends in near disaster. Its ending would rank as one of the worst in history (think Akira Kurosawa's Rashomom) if only the rest of the film had been stronger. Also, in no way, shape, nor form is the film an `epic.' Other than the word `surreal' the term epic may be the most overused and misused word in the arts. An epic is a tale that covers a great deal of history, time, and place. It also delves deeply into the characters and plot. There Will Be Blood is a series of cursory sketches that are meager and often poorly connected. I spoke of the hit and miss cinematography, but the musical scoring to this film is even worse. And, even if one were to put aside the technical lack, and the script problems, there's the acting. It's simply not good. The two main characters, Lewis and Dano have no chemistry, in the sense that their hatred of each other never seems genuine. And, while Dano is a cipher emotionally, Lewis chews scenery even more than he did as Bill The Butcher In Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York. Granted, while not a great film, that film was better written than this one, but there is a certain cartoonishness in Lewis's portrayal that neuters all attempt at real drama. One cares not a damn for any of the mannekin-like characters- save perhaps for the faux brother, whose very fakeness was designed merely to show of Lewis's character's rage and psychopathy, but did nothing of the sort. It only made the faux brother's character seem slighter by his casual dismissal from Daniel's life. Also, the tale is both too linear and too sparse in development to have any real poesy. It relies not on characterization but grotesques- they aren't even caricatures. And, after the first fifteen minutes, I kept wondering what a real visionary director like Theo Angelopoulos or Michelangelo Antonioni would have done with this film's premise- even its footage, for quality editing could have severely tightened the film up, and made it less dependent upon overwrought theatrics. In essence, one can tell this was a Hollywood film, even from the first minutes of silence.<br /><br />  There Will Be Blood attempts to be epic, great, and tie in with the current political zeitgeist by showing viewers the beginnings of what caused global warming. Instead, it is a meandering tale that relies on soap operatic tricks (such as Bandy's blackmailing Daniel into Eli's church- why?) that don't even have a payoff, however cheap; as well as being dull and poor in almost every filmic aspect (not unlike its twinned, wildly overpraised critical cousin, the Coen Brothers' No Country For Old Men). That this film got so raved over as a great piece of cinema shows how little critics and filmgoers today understand real art and/or care about it. Which scenario is worse is open for debate.

0060557818|5.0|This is a really interesting fantasy adventure that takes normal guy Richard Mayhew on a dangerous quest through the hidden and forgotten bits of London with a number of mysterious, fascinating, creepy, and wonderful characters. There are twists and turns, celebrations, frustrations, tube maps, betrayals, and reunions, there is confusion, hilarity, oddness, violence, terror, and leather clothing. It's fun, interesting, exciting, scary, and satisfying.<br /><br />Neverwhere is London in book form. While reading it, I almost felt I was back in London, walking the streets and seeing all the buildings and storefronts and landmarks that Neil Gaiman described so accurately and put so perfectly in their real places. (So perfectly, in fact, that I felt like he must have repeatedly walked the same blocks--particularly Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road--that I and many others walk(ed) all the time.) The familiarity and recognition his description of the city streets caused was powerful. And then to be introduced to the personified neighborhoods of the city! And to learn about the extent of the tube lines! These and a thousand other things in this book touched me deeply. Plus, I found out that you can sing the lyrics of one song to the tune of another, and sometimes it works really well.
B000WMFZMY|3.0|The film's visuals are occasionally stunning, and, while the screenplay by Philip Yordan, Ben Barzman and Fredric M. Frank, from a story by Frank, is solid, one does wonder how differently a true film master like Michelangelo Antonioni would have handles such a film. We never get inside any of the characters because they act upon such a large stage that what they say and do almost does not matter, as it is dwarfed by the seeming weight of history. In a sense, the film is like a Frederic Edwin Church painting, wherein natural forces marginalize the efforts of man. The music score by Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa, was much lauded, but in retrospect, it does not hold up against the visuals of cinematographer Robert Krasker. Interestingly, perhaps the most important technical aspect that succeeds in this film is the editing by Robert Lawrence. Repeatedly, the scenes end before typical Hollywood reveals that hammer a point home, especially in epic films like this. There are dozens of examples, but note the scene where Cid kills Chimene's father. First, we never see the final deed, as both men are behind the staircase when Cid strikes his deathblow. Second, after getting Chimene to agree to avenge his death, we see her turn, to see Cid in darkness under the stairs, but then we get the fade. We never see the typical confrontation between the lovers That is delayed for a few minutes. What this shows is that Mann was handed an elephant, and did his best to leave some sort of imprint of himself on it.<br /><br />  The film won some awards at the Golden Globes, and Oscars- mostly technical stuff, but it was a smash hit. The film is shown in a 2.20:1 aspect ratio and clocks in at almost three and a quarter hours in length, and comes in 1 three disk DVD package, as part of The Miriam Collection of films. Unfortunately, the film is split at its intermission, and spread across two DVDs. In this day and age, this is a major boner. Even worse is that the audio commentary is also split. The commentary, by Bill Bronston (son of producer Sauel Bronston) and Neal M. Rosendorf, a film historian, is ok, mentioning some of the unfortunate stereotyping that was portrayed, but it's nothing special. Perhaps the most insightful thing mentioned is how the film used Islamic expansion as a metaphor for the Cold War, whereas now it can be read literally, and how Sam Bronston was clueless as to the deeper themes in the film. Disk 1 features radio interviews with Heston and Loren, while Disk 2 has the featurettes. There's a making of featurette, a film on the career of Bronston as a producer, one on Anthony Mann'sd career as a director, one on the music of Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa, a film on film preservation, and a gallery of theatrical trailers. The worst extra feature, though, comes on Disk 3. There is nothing but a lengthy interview with a none too bright evangelist named John Bevere, who spends his whole interview as an apologist for Christianity, as well as spewing bizarre 1950s era ultra-nationalistic tripe, and generally misinterpreting the film. It's an embarrassing feature, and one wonders what connection to the people involved in the DVD this man has, and why he would be featured so prominently in the packaging.<br /><br />  Overall, El Cid is a terrific popcorn movie to watch, but a film of depth and great art it's not. Akira Kurosawa would have really lifted a project like this into the heavens. These days, all of the thousands of extras would simply be added in via CG, so it is quite impressive to see a film that truly was epic in scope. I also prefer the old method of putting all the credits at the start of the film, and, of course, there's Charlton Heston. Simply put, Heston is the quintessential American Alpha Male Movie Star. John Wayne, Sylvester Stallone, Marlon Brando, Errol Flynn, Cary Grant, Rock Hudson. No one really compares, except for, perhaps, Gary Cooper. While this film does not test his acting chops the way Major Dundee did, nor is it as iconic as his roles in Planet Of The Apes nor The Ten Commandments, it may be the role Heston was most suited to play, for it seems that he is never straining, and always in his comfort zone. Regardless, watch El Cid if you want an idea of what the filmgoing experience was, at its best, during the middle of last century.The Apes nor The Ten Commandments, it may be the role Heston was most suited to play, for it seems that he is never straining, and always in his comfort zone.

0199535523|5.0|I think most people are already familiar with the story of Emma, and many are probably also familiar with the back-story, which is that Jane Austen  decided to write about a character which she thought \\"nobody but myself will much like.\\" I dare say there are plenty of people who indeed do not like Emma Woodhouse, but I have loved plenty of books, TV shows, and movies centered on a character I disliked (or even hated) far more than Emma, whose faults do not, at least, include witlessness, stupidity, or true ugliness of character.<br /><br />Added to Emma's attractiveness as a protagonist and other well-rounded characters that we may love or  hate, is Jane Austen's excellent prose and story plotting, and, most importantly, her cutting humor and social commentary. Oh wait, perhaps most important is the love story--or love stories--that touch the readers' hearts. Or at least touched mine. All of those elements are there, and so I enjoyed the book. While not my favorite book of Austen's, Emma is far from my least favorite (ahem, Mansfield Park).
B00000JNNY|5.0|Etta was great but the background music styling was magnificent! Listeners don't realize how much that helped to create the magic of that recording. My hat's off to whoever was responsible for that (Leonard Chess???). When I first heard it in 1961 (yes I'm that old!!!), I was blown away. I continue to pause (maybe even a tear) every time I hear it. Leonard or whoever was responsible for the styling, deserved some award or recognition!
B0017I0KVI|3.0|I didn't expect the quality of the prose or the depth of the writing to be equal to those of Jane Austen, but I did expect them to be as good as one would expect from any standard work of writing for adults. In this I was disappointed.<br /><br />Still, it was a somewhat entertaining read. It seemed kind of pointless that so much of it was the exact same events told in Emma but less eloquently from the perspective of someone else in the same room (although at least, since Jane Austen thought of them, they make an interesting story), but the events and characters that were unique to this book were more interesting. I did enjoy seeing how Mr. Knightly might have come to realize his feelings for Emma, and I enjoyed the sweet (if improbable) relationship for one of the few characters from Emma who doesn't end up married in that book.<br /><br />It's not a great book, or even a really good one, but it was an easy and somewhat enjoyable read. I plan to read at least one other book in the series (if you can call it a series), with the hope that it will diverge a bit more from what Austen already showed us, but even if it doesn't it will still probably be pleasant.
0061703257|5.0|I was fascinated by this book from the moment I picked it up.  It was unlike anything I had read recently and kept me rivoted until the end.  Ah, the end....totally unexpected, and I am usually really good at getting the subtleties and twists that make up the plots of mysteries.  This one left me stunned.
044022425X|5.0|We rejoin Jamie and Claire, now in the British colonies in North America but still leading a life as dangerous and adventurous, and as loving, as always. We also see a lot of the next generation, Brianna and Roger, and their struggles to live up to the example of a loving relationship that Jamie and Claire have left them. I smiled almost all the way through this book, just because I love the characters and was so happy to be reading more about them, and was thrilled to see them happy with one another. I also laughed out loud many, many times, and then at other (and less frequent) times, felt genuine horror and sadness. That's how real these characters are, and how well this book is written, that it can evoke such genuine emotion.<br /><br />Even though this book, just like the other books in the series, is around 1000 pages, it was actually very quick for me to read, because I just did not ever want to put it down.<br /><br />I'm much more interested in Scottish history than in American, but then again, I'm much more interested in Jamie and Claire than I am in reading a history book, so it works out just fine. I was less interested in the parts about Bree and Roger, at least until Diana Gabaldon leaves a huge cliffhanger regarding the latter, and I was forced--FORCED, I say--to read ahead just to make sure everything would be OK. Unfortunately, having gotten glimpses of what was to come, my insatiable need to keep reading flagged for an evening, so I don't recommend reading ahead.<br /><br />I wish I had re-read the first three books before reading this one after a break of a couple of years, because I could not remember all the details about their meeting with Geillis Duncan in the third book, which was undoubtedly important. Maybe I'll read [[ASIN:0385335997 Voyager (Outlander)]] again soon, unless I go ahead and finish the series (is another one coming out soon?), in which case I'll read it after. Or maybe I'll read them all again. Or maybe I'll read the Lord John books first...
0439023513|4.0|Suzanne Collins pulls no punches in this final chapter of the 'The Hunger Games' trilogy. Indeed, no one is spared and all bets are off as the final showdown between Kitmiss and Snow takes place. The biggest shift in the series was tone to me. At the center of the first two books was a palpable love story, at the very least for Peeta towards Kitmiss. Nearly all of that is pushed aside to make way for what amounts to huge chunks of plot that revolve around the rebels destroying the Capitol. As a result, any sweetness, or hopeful romance that existed in the previous books has been snuffed out, and what's left is an ultra violent, bleak study of the senselessness of war. The books transcended their intended target audience from the beginning with their original and heart stopping plots, but I wonder how young people reading this finale will respond to an ending that's not neat and tidy, and leaves many of the characters dead in it's wake. Ultimately if Collins intention was to create a discussion, she's certainly succeeded, and one can draw direct parallels to the now concluding situation in Iraq to see the harms of sending our young people to fight adult conflicts. Still I was a little surprised at what a downer the book was, despite it being I guess, a fitting conclusion.
0446693804|3.0|I know that people always say that the movie is different from the book.  And most will also say that the book is better than the movie.  I usually agree, but this book was an exception.  In fact, I think it's the only book/movie combo where I've actually liked the movie more.    Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author.  His books are easy to read, yet the stories pull you in.  The thing that I just could not get over with this book was how different it is from the movie.    I watched \\"A Walk to Remember\\" when it first came out, and since then it's been, hands down, my favorite movie.  I love everything about it.  So I just knew that I would love the book...but when I started reading the book, it was completely different.  It's set in a different era; Landon isn't a \\"bad boy\\", Jamie's father wrote the play and Landon volunteered to be in it; they didn't have all of the sweet dates that helped her accomplish things on \\"her list\\"; Landon's parents were still together; and on and on and on.  It was a COMPLETELY different book.  The over-all moral of the story was the same, but practically all of the details were different.    That being said, I probably would have loved the book and hated the movie if I read it first.  The actual book wasn't bad--it was just too different in my opinion.  Since I've loved the movie for so long, the book wasn't what I thought it would be.  However, I have a really good friend who loved the book before she saw that movie and she feels completely opposite.    To sum all of this up:  If you love the movie, know that the book is completely different before you start it or you'll be disappointed.  If you haven't seen the movie, read the book because it really is well-written.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This cup holder fits our Maclaren Techno XLR stroller quite well.  The two drink holders are stretchy enough to hold cans, water bottles, and the types of paper cups provided by quick service restaurants.  The loops used to connect it to the stroller fit very well on the extended posts of the adjustable handles. The bump created where the handle branches provides an excellent stop for the bag and so it stays very steady and even.  Drinks do not tip and we have had no problems with stability when we take three mile hikes over slanted and rocky sidewalks.    The center section has been a wonderful repository for my pepper spray, cell phone, and MP3 player.  The zippered portion is very slim, and best suited to very thin items. The Buggy Buddy slightly impedes use of the top storage bag on the back of the Techno XLR's hood, but does not fully block access to the small covered pouch.  I feel the small frustration is a small price to pay for two cup holders and additional easy access storage.    When we collapse the stroller I undo one of the connecting straps but leave the other connected to the stroller, this allows the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy to stay with the stroller but without stressing the wire structure.  While I can close the stroller with the Buggy Buddy fully connnected, I have read that others have bent or broken the super-structure of the Buggy Buddy and so this seems a nice compromise.  I keep everything in one place, it takes only a moment to put on and off, and I am am decreasing the risk of damaging the Buggy Buddy.    Update April 2011: Wire superstructure broke. Forgot to lift loop off of the handle before folding stroller. Still somewhat functional, but sharp ends necessitate removal from stroller. I wish they would re-design product with a less fragile structural element.    The quality of the product is higher than I expected and it seems sturdier than other higher priced stroller accessories I have purchased.  We are about to take it on two crosscountry flights and a fourteen night stay at Disney World.  So,in the next month it will tackle toddlers, teenagers, heat, rain, flight crews, trains, buses, and boats.  If anything breaks or has problems I will update this account.  If you are reading this after October 1, 2010 and there is no update then rest assured that no news is good news and the Buggy Buddy exceeded expectations and survived the wild adventure to Walt Disney World unscathed.

B002ZG98C8|4.0|\\"This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson\\"     This quote from Robert Rodriguez pretty much sums up exactly what you can expect from Machete. A cheesy action flick filled with brutal fights, senseless (but fun) violence, copious amounts of nudity, and some classic one-liners. Needless to say, I was pretty excited for it, even more so being a fan of Robert Rodriguez. I was able to see a sneak preview of Machete last night (8/31/2010) courtesy of my friend and I had a damn good time.    First, a little bit of background. Machete was an idea Rodriguez had all the way back in 1993, but he never got around to making it. Once he and Tarantino made [[ASIN:B003VMFWYI Grindhouse]] (one of my all-time favorites), he included it as one of the fake trailers. Now it's 2010 and he finally got to make the movie after 17 years, but not before creating some of the coolest characters to ever grace the screen (El Mariachi, [[ASIN:B00004RJ74 Seth Gecko]], [[ASIN:B000BCKFWK Marv]], El Wray, etc). I'm a big fan of Rodriguez's work and he's only let me down once, with [[ASIN:B0000WN140 Once Upon A Time In Mexico]], but that's a story for another day.    The story is something any self-respecting action fan will recognize instantly: a man is given a dangerous job to do, he gets double crossed, and he seeks bloody revenge. We've seen this dozens of times, but it doesn't feel stale here. The main reason for this is the break-neck pace of the film. The runtime is about 1 hour, 45 minutes but it flies by in what feels like an hour. An interesting pseudo-commentary is present in the film, concerning illegal immigration. I'm sure some people out there will take the movie way too seriously and try to over-analyze it, but the fact is it's all done tongue-in-cheek and should not effect your enjoyment of the film.    Onto the cast, which like a lot of Rodriguez's films, is outstanding. Danny Trejo plays the same role he's been playing for 20 years, but this is exactly what he does best. He handles what little dialogue he has just fine, also delivering a few hilarious one-liners that I won't spoil here. Jeff Fahey is deviously cool as the guy who hires and then double-crosses Machete. Jessica Alba feels a bit out of place, but does a decent job and looks good doing it. Robert De Niro is delightfully cheesy as the big shot senator who is anti-immigration. It's quite fun to see one of the greatest actors of all-time just goofing around with a ridiculous role. Steven Seagal serves as more of a secondary antagonist, but he has a few good parts, especially in the finale. Rounding out the rest of the cast is Michelle Rodriguez, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan and Tom Savini. Cheech plays a good supporting role as Machete's priest brother, while Johnson chews the scenery as a vicious border patrol officer. Sadly, Savini isn't in the film enough. Amusingly, Lohan plays what feels like a caricature of herself, which some will find hilarious and others will find pointless. All in all, the cast does a good job.    The action and special effects are surprisingly good. While I love Robert Rodriguez's films, I do feel he isn't the best action director, save for [[ASIN:B0000A2ZU1 Desperado]]. He doesn't really give you time to savor the destruction and mayhem that occurs. With the help of co-director Ethan Maniquis, Machete's action scenes are exciting and very violent, with limbs and heads getting chopped off, people being impaled, and plenty of other gruesomely awesome acts. There's a scene in a hospital that I know people will be talking about for years to come.     The film does have a few weak points, mainly concerning the ending. Like Desperado, the best action scenes occur midway through the film, making the finale a bit of a letdown because it just can't live up to the excitement of the earlier scenes . Much of this is forgivable due to the short but memorable scenes that pop up in every Rodriguez film and have a style alltheir own.     So bottom line, Machete is an satisfyingly bloody good time with a few memorable scenes and a great sense of humor. If you like a good action flick and just want to enjoy yourself, I'd give Machete a watch.
034544678X|5.0|I have been a cat person all my life. But I recently retired and discovered I had the time for a companion dog. You can't take your cat on a walk or for a ride in a car. Decades of living with cats have given me a pretty good understanding of cat-human relations. But I know nothing about dogs except some of them (the well behaved ones) I really liked, even loved. What I needed was a crash course in human-dog relations. There are a lot of books out there, but I judged this book by it's clever cover. Just who is on the other end of the leash? What flows between both ends of the leash? What is understood correctly by both dog and human? What is misunderstood and what are the consequences? How has canine training chanced in the last few decades? After reading this book I know I want the companionship of a dog. I understand what that means, that it is a two way street. My concerns about failure to train a puppy to be a good companion have been relieved. It's really about training the human to be sensitive to dog culture and dealing with the conflicting messages the dog receives from the human culture in which the dog resides.<br /><br />If you are all ready a companion to a canine read this book anyway. It's a very good read. You will learn a lot about humans and dogs and how and why these two species have been together for so long. And it celebrates the new training methods of kindness and understanding.
B002A4Q652|5.0|As one grows older, they often grow more cynical about contemporary music.  I know I've been there several times in my life, growing up during the musically diverse early 1970s, surviving the disco era, falling asleep amidst a wash of synthpop bands in the '80s, being reinvigorated when alternative rock and grunge appeared, and finding the first decade of the century dominated by soul-less corporate pop.    Symphonic metal is something of a breath of fresh, if incense tinged, air.  I'd heard some stuff by Nightwish, Coheed and Cambria, and a few others.  Interesting, I thought, a lot of it reminiscent of early Rainbow or the Scorpions (and all owing a certain debt of gratitude for Led Zeppelin for writing \\"Kashmir\\" .  But no recent band has excited me as much as Delain.  From the moment I clicked on the amazon.com sample of the song \\"April Rain\\" I knew I was listening to something special.    Lead vocalist Charlotte Wessels has a fine, sultry voice, brimming with emotion and self-confidence.  Keyboard player (and founder) Martijn Westerhold, I feel is up there in ability with the classic ProgRock keyboardists.  Guitarist Ronald Landa does a good job at both the genre's signature heavy licks and is a very good soloist.  And drummer Sander Zoer truly sets the band apart with a deft hand on the drumsticks.    The songwriting is consistently good, with the title track, \\"Stay Forever\\", and \\"I'll Reach You\\" standing out.  Even the \\"death growl\\" vocals on \\"Virtue and Vice\\" don't diminish the song's quality (and I'll take the growls over the unnaturally implanted rap in found in (too) many current pop songs anyday).    This is a band (and a genre) to keep an eye on.

0765326353|5.0|I had the opportunity to read an ARC (Advance Reading Copy) of a book a lot of people out there probably want to get their hands on, and I thought, \\"Hey! Here's a chance to review something in a timely fashion.\\" So I read through all 1000 pages of said book, and I'm here today to review it for you. Aren't you lucky?    What is it?    It's the first book in a planned ten (count 'em, ten) book epic fantasy by Brandon Sanderson, fantasy author extraordinaire. He's well known for his Mistborn series, and much better known for being that guy who's finishing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. (The next book's out in November, folks! Excited much?) This isn't just any ol' epic fantasy series, either. The back of the ARC says \\"What Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time has been to the fantasy genre for the last two decades, The Stormlight Archives (the name of the series) will be to the next.\\" And while Sanderson persuaded Tor to keep that wording off the final, published book, any which way you look at it, the gauntlet was thrown. Sure, some of it could be an attempt at hype, but the thing about hype is that sooner or later, you can evaluate for yourself whether it's earned or not.    I'm here to tell you that in this case, the hype is earned.    I still vividly remember seeing Jordan's Eye of the World on the shelf at the library for the first time. I was at an age where I was choosing what to read based on book thickness alone. If it was really long and heavy, and it had something remotely related to fantasy on the cover, I checked it out and read it, usually three of those a week. Jordan's book stood head and shoulders above the other stuff I was reading. It was long, but fast paced. It had fantastic characters, and even though it was the first book in a series, it had a distinct beginning, middle and end. It was a series started with an entirety in mind, and it's gone on to be the most successful fantasy series in the past two decades. It's been mimicked many times in manydifferent ways. It redefined the genre.    For The Way of Kings to do that, it was going to have to break new ground--not just traipse along in the wake of other books. That's just what it did.    The book tells three separate stories. There's Dalinar and his son Adolin, two nobles embroiled in a six-year old war. There's Shallan, a young woman who's doing her best to save her family from ruin. There's Kaladin, the one-time war hero and current slave, battling inner demons. These are roles we've seen before in fantasy, yes, but Sanderson breathes new life into them. They're full-fleshed characters, each very well done. My personal favorite was Kaladin, and it's his storyline that takes the bulk of the book. I'd delve into more of the plot, but I read it spoiler-free, and I'd like to give you the chance to get to know it that way, too.    For me, what really made this book stand out from the crowd was the world-building. Most fantasies these days share fairly similar settings. Yes, they each of some funky animals and strange demons or mythical beasts, but the technology level's usually about the same (fairly primitive), the cities all feel like they're out of medieval Europe, and the various climates are all very Earth-based.    Sanderson's world feels more like something from a science-fiction book. It's a world ravaged by regular super-storms. Storms so strong they can pick up boulders and hurl them through the air. Storms that have had a huge effect on the ecosystem of the planet. For example, they have something they refer to as grass, but it's far different from the green stuff we know. This grass is more of a living creature, able to suck itself into the ground when danger appears, then emerge again once it's gone. And that's just one example. The animals are also almost wholly different and alien: more like land-crustaceans than mammals. It's hard to describe this just right, but it feels very natural in the book. Sanderson came up with a unique, new world, and it plays a very big role in the story.    Technology plays a role in the setting, as well. The world has scientists devoting themselves to the study of magic, putting it to new uses that have a very steam-punk feel. These people don't view themselves as primitives: they look at their lives in much the same way we do, feeling like they're living at the best of times, where technology has developed far enough to make their lives easier and give them hope for continual new developments in the future.    Another way the book stands out is in its art work. Full color maps appear in the front and end flap, each chapter gets its own illustration (similar to the beginning illustrations that start each chapter in The Wheel of Time). More fully drawn maps dot the text itself, accompanied by pages of illustrations of the various creatures and items that appear in the book. No expense was spared on the development of this novel, and it shows. You get more than your money's worth from this one. Three separate interior artists in addition to the cover artist. When's the last time you saw that in an epic fantasy? Have you ever? I haven't.    Was there anything I didn't like? Well, as the first book of a ten book series, it doesn't exactly hurl you into the full climax right off, but that's to be expected. The book has plenty of action and plot turns, but at the end of the day, it's still the first step in a long journey. It has a lot of promise for things to come, but it pays you in full upfront, too. Does that make sense? Better yet, the book's written by a man who's proven he can keep up the pace of a huge epic. Sanderson is a prolific writer. He churns out words like a machine, and he's devoted to his craft. He has a very transparent writing process, willing to communicate with his fans extensively through his Facebook and Twitter accounts and his blog. I'm not worried that we'll go through three or four (or five!) year droughts between books with him. He's not just a fantasyauthor, he's a fan, and he knows how frustrating that can get. So while I approach many fantasy books with caution (10 books? Really?) I don't feel that way about this one.    My only other frustration came from something typical to epic fantasy: with three separate stories to tell, I'd have to leave one plot and go to another after each chapter. Of course, I think it's a great sign when I'm upset the chapter ends--each time. There wasn't a plot line that I didn't look forward to reading. I'd get into one, then be disappointed when it ended and a new one started, but I was disappointed again when that new one ended and I got back to the old one.    Perhaps the highest compliment I can give the book is that I spent most of my Saturday reading it. I think I blazed through the last 750 pages in a day, and it's been years since I read that much that fast. In fact, the last time I remember doing it was with Robert Jordan.    'Nuff said.
1605092762|1.0|Paul Polak would have you believe that increasing income solves all problems.  While it is hard to argue that an increase from $1 per day to $2 per day is a bad thing, it is not the solution to everything. He gives his approach great credit while offering sophomoric sarcastic opinions about traditional approaches. Does $2 per day provide health care to a child with cancer? No. Does $2 per day provide a school nearby for literacy? No. Does $2 per day provide a road to sell goods in the city? No. Traditional solutions like governments and NGO's are needed for these solutions and are not provided by this solution.  He would do better to admit that his approach helps but is not the only solution needed. A little humility and less simplistic criticism of current working solutions would make this a more serious proposal, although it not surprising that successful capitalists have been quick to embrace and support this as an ultimate solution.

0439023513|4.0|First off I would like to say that I loved the series.  I really like this authors writing style.  It is very much like Stephanie Meyers' style.  The first two book I thought were very good and obviously created for a younger audience.  However, the third book had some pretty heavy adult themes.  I don't want to spoil the story for anyone so I will be vague when I say that there are a LOT of unexpected deaths.  I thought that the end could have been wrapped up a little neater, but that may have ruined the under tone of the book which cleary is \\"War is Hell\\".
0439023513|5.0|Just finished reading and still a little overwhelmed... I actually shed a few tears while on the last few pages, while reading them on a treadmill at the public gym *a little embarrassed* The story in Hunger Games Trilogy is extremely intense, intelligent and unpredictable. The atrocities that are happening to the young characters are downright awful and would be gruesome, if Suzanne Collins would handle them even slightly differently. There's quite a bit of violence going on throughout all 3 books, and at times, it feels like we're getting conditioned to overlook it, to preserve our sanity, just like the main protagonist Katniss does.    With brutal honesty and never-ending twists and turns in the narration, Suzanne tells us a story of struggle for freedom, power and survival. All three are connected, intertwined and dependent on each other. The kids, forced to grow up at the age of 13, are tough and resourceful, and besides the skills and talents they need to possess, they also need to figure out the finer politics of alliances, trust and lack of whereof.    The Mockingjay is as fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat up until the very last page, just like it's predecessors. The love triangle of Katniss, her childhood friend Gale and her Games ally Peeta comes to a logical solution... maybe even too logical, for my taste. The story of uprising against the powerful President Snow and his Capitol also comes to a conclusion which is again, quite brutal in it's honesty. As one of the characters tells Katniss \\"We're fickle stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction\\". But at the end, there's always hope. Hope, glimpse of the future, and a bitter sweet taste of a story so intriguing and powerful that it makes you rush to finish it asap, yet you don't want it to end. Add to that a guilty feeling of watching the story unfold almost as if it were... the Hunger Games, on our own tv...
0307271862|2.0|I had seen a TV series of one of his books and I wasn't overly impressed with the story. Since a TV show is not the book, when I read a good review of this book, I decided to read it and get a better impression of Mankell.    This story starts out great and I really liked it, but about 1/3 of the way into the story, it starts to falter, and goes downhill, and never recovers-- I was surprised at how filled with impossibilites/improbabilities, etc. Some of the connections worked out by the \\"bad guys\\" from occurrences of 150 years ago between events in Nevada and a small, remote group of houses in Sweden in present day ... hmmm...    I took the book out of the library and was glad I hadn't bought it. I was most disappointed because I love mysteries and I was hoping that I had found a writer I would like.    Just my opinions

006145205X|4.0|This is an impressive,if lengthy, brief for optimism. Over hundreds of pages, Ridley makes a strong case that the world's future is brighter than the media, politicians, scientists, etc.. are saying. Growing up in the 1970s, Ridley says he was exposed to constant pessimism, and he doesn't want children today to think the world is doomed. He points out, accurately, that doomsayers like Paul Erlich (The Population Bomb) have been predicting disaster for many years and have been constantly wrong. Ridley is a strong believer in a free market in goods and services, which he sees as the force that will continue to make the world better for humanity.<br /><br />In the most controversial part of The Rational Optimist, Ridley discusses climate change at great deal. He is not a climate denier, but rejects the alarmism of the IPCC and much of the media. He sees a modest warming that people will adapt to without great suffering.  I'm not completely sold on his optimism here, but it's worth reading.
B002VECLVO|4.0|A Single Man is a very simple tale about a gay man in the 1960's who is despairing after losing his lover of many years. He has not taken his death lightly and we get a small glimpse of how bleak his existance is now. He goes through his daily routine as usual but there is quite a bit of foreshadowing as to what will happen. Is it predictable? Yes. But it doesn't detract from the wonderful performance by Colin Firth, who is perfection and elegance and melancholy all at the same time. He never overdoes it-in fact, I would call it understated, and yet, you can't help but feel morose and utterly depressed at his situation. This is not a pro-gay or anti-gay film. It never pretends to be more than it is. And that is why the simple nature may not be for people who like extensive drama or action. Or even plot. It is a very short film but it leaves an impression.    Julianne Moore is a sort of mystery in this film as her part could have been played by anyone and she would not be missed. I do applaud her attempt at a British accent, for I will never forgive her for An Ideal Husband.... She appears to be a long-time friend of Firth's character, still maybe pining after him even after all the years he's been with his lover. Her character is almost unnecessary but there is a great scene between them towards the end where she says something that is inexcusable to Firth and the scene is both dramatic and heart-breaking without going overboard. There are very few other characters in the film because it really is all about Colin Firth. He is just magical. I wish more low-budget superb films would be made because they can make more of an impact than a $200 million summer blockbuster.
B000068OCS|2.0|Although Joe Beirne tries to lay to rest the aspect ratio troubling this dvd release he isn't right about the original release format for this movie.  He may be right on the decision making for the aspect ratio of the current release and the fact that pan and scan would be an awful method to transfer the original image to 1:1.85 aspect ratio but that doesn't mean that there isn't any problem with the chosen aspect ratio for this release.   The original theatrical release was in the 1:1.33 aspect ratio mentioned and that was the ratio used when screened at the cinema.  He implies that the current release has the original aspect ratio at which the film was shot and that now finally it has been released in it's full aspect ratio.  If that is true then there would be more to see in the images presented on this new dvd version, mainly left and right of the image frame would show more and additional picture information. and therein lies the problem of this release, there is no more information there to be seen but the picture looks like a cropped version of the original 1:1.33 release. Cropped in this instance means that the picture has been zoomed into to fit a different screen format than the original format for this movie. It shows up like there is a portion missing at the lower and upper sides of the original freme of the picture as is the problem with this release when compared with the older versions of this release on dvd and vhs videotapee and the way it was screened in the cinema. On the other hand there are no black bars on either side of the picture when viewed on a widescreen display that were unavailable when the movie was originally released for the home market.  But that doesn't mean that the print used for this release was shot in 1:1.85 aspect ratio! When I compared the new release with the original IRE release of this dvd and the older vhs tape it became very clear that the frame has been cropped to fit the 1:1.85 screen.  This is clearly to be seen at the approx. 10 minutes into the movie when there is a rock face to be seen that fills the original frame with just the top of the facia at top of the screen and the base of the rock with it's sediment lines at the bottom. The new version doesn't show either the top of the facia nor the sediment lines at the bottom but it does fill the tv screen from left to right without black bars. So there is a substantial portion of the picture frame missing when compared to the older version and there isn't more or new sights to be seen in the newer version on the left or the right hand of the new picture frame versus the old picture frame.  I hope when the Blu Ray version will be released, that they make it available in the old aspect ratio because there is nothing more being added to the picture by cropping the originl frame format just to loose the black bars in the screen, I can live with those perfectly.  If you can't, well, change the aspect ratio of your tv to make the image fit your tv screen and loose those black bars when you want to.  Something that should have been left to the costumer to decide instead of cropping the original picture in the first place.
0439023491|4.0|Yes, the middle book of a trilogy is usually the weakest and this one is no different.  In fact, I deliberately set the book aside until I also had the final book in hand.  However, as \\"the middle,\\" this was stronger than is usually the case and though not as good as the first book, it was a real pager-turner.<br /><br />Some reviewers have made legitimate points about how this has a lot of summary as Katniss recounts the fallout after the games, and the Victory Tour.  However, the tour gives readers (and Katniss) a chance to connect with the other districts making the revolution more than just District 12 vs the Capitol.  And, the book does feel a bit like a retread of the first after Katniss learns that she must return to the arena.  President Snow uses the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games as an excuse to kill her by decreeing that all the tributes this year will be culled from previous victors.  Though this could easily have been \\"Hunger Games the Remake\\", I found it was actually a clever way to segue into the upcoming rebellion.  I thought the best parts of the first book took place in the arena, and that is the case here.  This time her opponents are skilled killers who each won before.  Plus, Haymitch begins pushing her to forge an alliance with some of them, who actively protect her and Peeta ,  so how will she be able to kill them? Throughout the book, Collins lays down breadcrumbs for the development of the revolution - each mention of the Mockingjay carries significance - and the ending is explosive with some surprises.<br /><br />Catching Fire also develops the love triangle between Gale, Katniss and Peeta better than other series, such as Twilight.  I never found Jacob to be a real contender because it was so obvious Bella would end up with Edward.  Not so here.  Even though readers don't spend much time with Gale, he has a history with Katniss and her memories evoke this.  On the other hand is Peeta, who is so obviously in love with her, has fought by her side, and protects her as only he can.  Halfway through the final book, and it's still not obvious who she will choose, which keeps the suspense high.<br /><br />Though a cliffhanger is practically expected here, I never-the-less found the conclusion to be very satisfying.  The book ends at a staging point; there is resolution in that all the pieces are in place and readers can move to the next stage - war.  Overall, I could not put this book down and have already begun the finale.  Highly recommended series!by her side, and protects her as only he can.

0439023513|5.0|It has been three years since I bought the first book in this series. For the first time since Harry Potter, I had found a series that I really connected with. This series was one I longed for and am thrilled that it has a conclusion.     Much like the Potter books, this deals with a war and very heavy subject matter. It is bloody, shocking, heartbreaking. I refuse to write spoilers into this book review, because it is better to discover these stories on your own. Therefore, I cannot address much dealing with people's complaints. Having read many of the negative reviews, I find that a lot of people misunderstood some of what was being said and done within this book. Others were upset with the changes in Katniss, but she displays symptoms of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). After the hell she has been through, I don't see why this is such a huge shock.     The thing that really drew me into these books is, the protagonist, Katniss. She is a strong female character who is flawed, yet relatable. The colorful, at times literal, cast of characters making up her world are all very loveable or extremely loathsome. Then there is the plot. I'm sure all of us can relate to how much government corruption exists in our world. It is almost frightening that I can see our world coming to reflect the one in this book, where government controls everything we do. It is almost a warning. Despite it being a YA piece of fiction, it has a deeper message than most.     Weaved throughout these books are themes and names from classic tragedies. For added tidbit, Plutarch was a real Greek biographer who wrote about Coriolanus. These names should make sense if you've read \\"Catching Fire\\". Lavinia, from Shakespeare's \\"Titus Andronicus\\", has a namesake with the same horrible affliction.     I've laughed, cried, and gasped while reading all three books. Maybe they aren't everyone's cup of tea, but I love them unconditionally. If you know me, you know how deep my love of the Potter books run and these books come in as a very close second.
B001IF252M|4.0|I purchased this for use with my LG lcdTv. Hooked it up to my Mac Book Pro and it worked great. It feels solid and matches the white MBP.    Quick note, in some cases you need to tinker with the display settings on the mac. System Settings -> Display -> Resolution.     Because this display adapter communicates as well as displays...it will actually save your desired resolution when the adapter is plugged in. For example my native res is 1280x800...as soon as I plug in the adapter it switches to 720p.     Downside...I think it's WAY to expensive. That's nothing new with an apple product.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I read this book due to a recommendation of a friend and the continued hype around the book. I must say, I was rather disappointed with the book. The books pacing is slow to me and kind of dragged out. I suppose that if you really, really like post-apocalyptic stories you might want to read this but if you like faster paced books you'll get board with it.<br /><br />I also found that the style of the story writing negatively broke up the story which really interfered with the continuity.

The one part of the story I found it hard to believe that an indentured Irish orphan would be considered a family member even over time, but it did make the story interesting.  There are several stories being told but the main characters, are 2 girls, one is a slave born on the planation and one a indentured orphan Irish girl. I did recommend this book to friends.

B001QBC4AG|4.0|This is my personal favorite Who album.  I started with the mono disk 2 & liked the sound over all. There are 1 or 2 songs that I feel the stereo sound is better & that is largely due to some \\"phasey\\" sounds on Moon's cymbals. The sound over all is like a Mack truck hitting you. This is akin to the 1st LP just very powerful rock&roll the way its supposed to be.  I especially like the jingles in mono as it reminds me of the way we used to hear them on the AM radio (dead center mono).  The material speaks for itself. Sell Out is arguably the WHO at the peak of thier powers. The LP is fun to listen to & not too full of itself like what was to follow. The \\"jingle\\" concept came later in the recording process & was never fully realized or fleshed out as a \\"Sellout\\" or commercial LP but opted to feature songs that had not much to do with the concept like Rael or Sunrise. I still like the \\"non-concept\\" songs. But, the listener now can make thier own \\"version\\" of what could've been with bonus trax like \\"Jaguar\\", \\"Coke\\" etc. I can't wait to check out the original Kit Lambert Stereo side 1. This LP doesnt include Glow Girl or Melancholia like the 1995 reissue had therefore 4&1/2 stars...Just get it!

Not sure why Amazon allows this as the Blu-Ray isn't out yet.      Now based on \\"Band of Brothers\\" which I loved, I also didn't think that the Pacific would live up to it's name in regards to the Band of Brothers but it did! Once again excellent acting, great story, great cinematography!, my review is based on what   I saw on HBO, all the episodes are still DVRed as I was waiting for the Blu-Rays to hit the streets soon.

This is warfare and by definition throughout history innocents have been killed, that is til we tried to pacify things with ROE that are most of the time insane and created by suits with their candy asses safe and sound in their ivory towers. One day it will be gloves off globally and what a shock the liberals  will be in for.
B003ODL43M|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I cannot choose a favorite Blind Guardian album.  Ever since Somewhere Far Beyond came out, everything this band has released has held a special place in my heart.  In fact, at my wedding 4 years ago, our bride & groom first dance was to \\"The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight\\"  and it couldn't have been more beautiful.<br /><br />Blind Guardian is more than a thrash/power metal band.  Yes there are those elements to their music, but the main focus of their music is composition and in creating music that is cohesive, innovative, and extravagant.  Over their past 3 albums, the compositions have gotten progressively more intricate and bombastic.  Some critique them as \\"overdone\\" and that's a fair statement if you prefer raw metal.  This is not raw metal however.  You are listening to the wrong band if you want Blind Guardian to sound like they did in the 80's and 90's.  In fact, if you're missing that style so much, skip this album and go purchase the latest Persuader or Savage Circus albums.  They sound almost exactly like early Blind Guardian.<br /><br />Before the song by song analysis, At The Edge of Time as a whole complete album is perhaps their best work.  This album definitely has the most diversity out of all their previous works.  Not one song sounds like it doesn't belong and while there are stronger songs than others, they complement each other perfectly.  Case in point, a mid tempo, piano driven song ,\\"Road to No Release\\" is sandwiched between two of the fastest, guitar driven songs on the album.  Then immediately following a blisteringly brilliant thrash song, you have one of Guardian's finest ballads.<br /><br />Sacred Worlds (10/10) This may be one of my favorite BG songs of all time, second only to \\"And Then There was Silence\\".  The orchestral arrangements start the album building intensity and excitement until the band starts.  It all flows so seamlessly that you will hardly notice the change.  When the band does start infull, the orchestra weaves in and out providing brilliant counter melodies and gorgeous depth to the music.  The chorus of this song is in my opinion one of the most powerful chorus ever.  The lyrics were originally created for a fantasy game, but have real world applications, particularly the emotion of setting evil things right that have been accepted as  the norm.<br /><br />Tanelorn (9/10) I love this song a lot.  The guitars are the driving force and sound incredible.  Marcus and Andre are playing at harmonic thirds of each other for much of the song and the guitars are amazingly tight.  Hansi sings very aggressively on this one, very similar to his style on Imaginations From the Other Side.  The chorus is very good and catchy, however I'm not emotionally taken away as I am with some of their other songs.<br /><br />Road of No Release (8/10) This is a hard one for me to rate.  The intro is beautiful with the piano, guitars and snare drum roll.  This song stylistically sounds similar to the A Twist in the Myth album. There are many changes in rhythm and keep this song interesting but not all of it is as moving as the intro.  This is one of those songs that will probably need to marinate in my head for many months before I can fully appreciate it.<br /><br />Ride into Obsession (10/10) My favorite of the fast songs on the album.  This song has everything.  The lyrics are powerful and really get to the heart of the emotional struggle the dragon is facing.  I won't spoil who he is in case you haven't read the first book in Wheel of Time.  The chorus is one of the best on the album, but what really gives this song the edge over Tanelorn is the middle section where the music takes an unexpected twist.<br /><br />Curse my Name (10/10) One of Blind Guardian's best ballads.  This song has many celtic sounding instruments and percussions, strings, flutes, and some other things I can't quite identify.  Brilliant lyrics and a wonderful chorus that actually inspires me to dance like an idiot hopping around from one foot to the other.  The deluxe edition of this album comes with a demo version of this song which sounds just as good, but is the scaled back version featuring acoustic guitars and Hansi's voice.  It is very reminiscent of The Bard's Song and time may prove it to be just as classic.<br /><br />Valkyries (8/10) I have similar opinions about this song as I do \\"Road of No Release\\" being a more modern version of their previous album style.  It has a very good chorus and is a good mix of heavy and soft features.  After about 10 listens of the album as a whole, this song seems to be one of the weaker on the album.  It is still an awesome song, but there is some fierce competition on this CD.  It may prove to be one of those songs that I'll only fully grasp after I've heard it 100's of time.<br /><br />Control the Devine (10/10) This is one of my favorite songs as well.  Stylistically, it sounds like it could have been released on Nightfall in Middle Earth.  This song features great texture from acoustic guitars and one of the best and catchiest choruses on the album.  It manages to avoid sounding familiar without actually pushing Blind Guardian's music to the next level.<br /><br />War of the Thrones (10/10) This song is another great ballad that I absolutely love.  It starts off with piano and vocals only and is most appropriate given the subject matter.  The chorus is classic and very sing-along-esque.  As the song progresses more instruments are introduced, giving rise to the intensity matched my Hansi's delivery.<br /><br />A Voice in the Dark (8.5/10) This is an awesome song that I was somewhat unimpressed when I first heard it on the single.  The vocal phrasing and chorus is very reminiscent of Traveler in Time, or Time What is Time.  It is very fast and aggressive but also very clever in the arrangement.  The variations are just enough that you don't tire of the standard pop song formula that this song employs.  My only criticism is that the guitar solo is not up to par.  It sounds \\"good enough\\" not to hurt the song but is desperately lacking Andre's usual touch and finesse.<br /><br />Wheel of Time (1/10) Oh man, the album sure took a dive down the crapper here, this song is just terrible!  Just kidding... here we have yet again one of Blind Guardian's greatest musical accomplishments.  One thing I recommend doing is listening to the instrumental version on the second disc.  The music has been composed with such craft and eloquence that it needs to be heard by itself before you can fully appreciate all that is going on here.  It is pure magic.  The album version with vocals is amazing too.  I was just flabbergasted at how great the song sounded as an instrumental.  The vocal arrangement is very complex and will take you many listens before your brain wraps around all the intricacies and wonderful phrasings by Hansi.  The chorus is good and matches the music well, but my favorite part of this song is the latter half after the symphonic interlude.  It provides the perfect down time before the bombastic finale that is very dangerously overwhelming.  (by the way, the real score is 10/10)<br /><br />This is without a doubt the best use of an orchestra that has been done in metal.  I strongly suggest you listen to it and let the music take you on a journey away to a land where monotony does not exist.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I was initially disappointed with these after replacing my aging Bose QC2's because they didn't perform as well with portable devices like my Mac or iPod.  From all the positive reviews, i surmised I could get the same thing for 1/3 the price.  But comparing these phones to amplified noise-cancelling ones is apples --> oranges.<br /><br />Performance rivals the Bose in IDEAL CONDITIONS.  That is...a studio environment.  NO AMBIENT NOISE and a DECENT AMPLIFIED AUDIO SOURCE.  As I am not a professional sound editor, I won't comment on this product in that respect (there are plenty of others with those credentials who have).  I'm just a guy who wants studio sound out of his iPod.  For that, I'll be writing another $350 check to Bose.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I never liked the classic PS1 controller and then I went with the Xbox instead of PS2. I just recently bought a PS3 and I cant stand the dual shock. Next to the Colecovision controller it is the most uncomfortable controller I have ever used. Now I have never bought a third party controller before now. I always assumed they were junk, but on hearing they were going to make a PS3 controller that looked just like a Xbox360 controller I knew I had to give it a shot. The controller is well made, the plastic textured handles are nice. The buttons are firm and light up which helps those who aren't as familiar with the PS button labels. The joysticks are not as firm as a 360 controller but maybe a little tighter than a dual shocks joysticks but not by much. The triggers are awesome, they are actually functional now which is helping my Wipeout HD scores. The dongle and power cable work as they are supposed to. I am extremely happy with this purchase.    P.S. I haven't messed around with sixaxis on this controller. In general sixaxis seems like a gimmick to me and I haven't felt the need to use it yet.
0439023513|1.0|First, I want to establish that I adored the first two books--I've read them multiple times and recommended them constantly at the bookstore where I work; I read them aloud to my husband, gave them to friends and relatives, and I've looked forward to Mockingjay's release for MONTHS!  Once I got the book I didn't read it for several days--a little silly, but I realized I didn't want the story to end.    I should have kept to that instinct, because I have finished the book and now I just feel sick. I don't want to own it and I don't think I'll ever re-read it.    It wasn't even well-written! I don't say this off the cuff--it wouldn't be fair to criticize the book this way simply because I didn't like the ending--but it's true, and here's why:        **********SPOILER ALERT*********SPOILER ALERT***********SPOILER ALERT***********        It was predictable and contrived. Collins created lots of expendable characters (Hi there, Team 451!) and then spent most of the book killing them off. It reminded me of the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie, where characters whose names you don't know are being killed left and right so you know this is SERIOUS without having to lose a major character--it's a cheap trick, and I expected better of Collins. And cheating like this doesn't actually work; it was so unlikely that she was going to kill off Katniss, Gale or Peeta in the middle of the book that it didn't really create the suspense she was going for. Prim's death (and Finnick's) could have been used much more thoughtfully; instead we had a blitzkrieg of constant attrition to remind us that THIS IS WAR. It wasn't evocative--it just made me feel numb.     This endless dying is interspersed with even-more-endless strategy and technical details. I repeatedly found myself skimming, which never happened with the previous two books. But these passages were so boring(!), and I kept hoping to find that Katniss had figured out a purpose or an orientation or had reached out to Peeta or even just accurately assessed something--but no luck.     Which brings me to character development, relationships, and philosophical reflections on values and motivations. They were vital in the previous two books, but they are nearly nonexistent here, and the book is fatally flawed because of it. Peeta is barely present, and if you discount the time that Katniss spends crying in corners, injured and in the hospital, taking morphling, or being manipulated or controlled by others and wandering around confused, she isn't really present either. And Gale is unfairly characterized in order to resolve the love triangle--it's baffling, because Katniss of all people isn't in a moral position to judge Gale, and I thought that was part of the point.      Ultimately, the story is hijacked--hey, that's a good metaphor!--by anti-war propaganda and a damn-near nihilistic outlook. I understand that Collins wanted to communicate that war and violence aren't glamorous.  I think she's right. But (ironically) she's done real violence to her characters and the merit in the world she created in order to bludgeon us with that value.    In a way, you could call this book \\"more realistic\\". And yet--I think a book that accurately reflects the gritty horrors of war would show how people use dark humor as a coping mechanism. This book had none of the wry humor of the previous two.    And for pity's sake, what was Collins trying to achieve with the ending?  I agree with those who say that Katniss agreed to a renewed Hunger Games featuring the children of Capitol citizens in order to get the opportunity to stop Coin--it's the only thing that makes sense, given what Collins is clearly trying to convey, and it fits best with the character of Katniss. But it's not made explicit in the text. Leaving this up to conjecture was a major error on Collins' part, or very bad editing. It's not wise to be subtle in the philosophical part of the book that is meant to put the heavy-handed part into some kind of context.     And the last four pages, where we finally learn: Peeta or Gale? An afterthought. I think what is worst is that by making this choice, Collins makes the war the only important part, the only real part of Katniss's life--all the rest calls for is a brief summary. Almost all injury, very little road to recovery (those \\"real or not real\\" conversations were one of the few highlights of the book).  It's baffling to me that this tacked-on ending is still fairy-tale-esque (that is, Katniss did settle down with her True Love and have children). But why bother giving her this semblance of a fairy-tale ending when it's so clear that she's DEAD INSIDE? It could have been insightfully ironic--though that's a little sick--but it's not. It's just empty. Apparently, once you've been in a war, nothing--not even consummation of true love or the birth of your children--can bring you joy ever again.    I think the vital counterpart to accurately portraying the horror and corruption of war is the possibility of redemption, of pursuing redemption. And Collins set this up but didn't follow through. Both personally and politically, through all of 'Mockingjay' Katniss is reduced to this calculating, empty creature. Her reflections on putting those she loves before herself (as she does with Prim in the first book, and Peeta in the second)--her major arc as a dynamic character? Utterly gone here. She makes, what, TWO efforts to reach out to Peeta? Three? She realizes she should be doing better but makes barely any effort to do so. I suppose it could be argued that the war left her no time--though her repeated willingness to kill Peeta to save her own skin blights that rather--but afterwards? There's no mention of her interest in making it up to him. Even when she later has leisure as a wife and parent, post-war, to reflect on these things, she doesn't. Politically, too, she never finds a motivation--such as \\"a world where Peeta's child can be safe\\"--to sustain her. Her own survival (as Gale bitterly notes) seems to be her top priority--though hell, she's not even sure she wants that; she seems a lot more concerned that her death be a quick one.  Great. Katniss is Everyman--a broken, broken Everyman. For pity's sake, I'm tired of the GROWNUP literature that shows us the depth to which the human spirit can sink--I don't need it here!  The main perk of young adult literature is that you can have both good writing AND a hero who can inspire you by example to rise above and triumph. To my mind, the purpose of good YA lit is to explore dark topics in a meaningful, well-written way that doesn't leave you in a bog of existential misery.  If this is the brave new world into which young adult literature is heading, let me say now that I want no part of it.  I can re-read '1984' and 'The Road'--or pick up 'They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'--anytime I want. In fact, the former are fine examples of how a book can be serious, gritty, and disturbing, and still satisfying. But if you're going to make someone sit through this near-nihilism, essentially conveying that neither individuals or humanity as a whole can never really change, they deserve capital-L Literature for their trouble.      I just wish I could go back and warn myself not to read this. I've never been interested in fanfiction but I think I'm almost willing to look some up, if only to get the taste of this out of my mouth.
B0001XAPZ6|2.0|I had always heard wonderful things about this movie, but I decided to read the manga first. The manga is brilliant, violent, and complex- I highly recommend it. The movie, on the other hand... is not so great. They tried to cram four long graphic novels into one two-hour movie, and it really shows. The story is awkwardly compressed, and frankly a bit of a wreck. Despite the nice animation, I didn't enjoy it very much at all.    Mind you, I have no problem with book-to-film translations in general- I thought Lord of the Rings was wonderfully done. This movie just isn't very well written or translated to the screen, though. Frankly, Nausicaa would have worked much better as a one-season tv series.    So in short...    Film: 4/10  Manga: 9/10
B0026RHR6K|5.0|Simply the finest science fiction I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I grew up in the early 80s eagerly watching reruns of the original Battlestar Galactica. I feasted on Buck Rogers, ST TOS, ST TNG, I remember the miniseries 'Something is Out There' and even Moonbase Alpha. So, I am an unapologetic, huge sci-fi nerd who fiercely believed that no show could ever do equal to or better than 'Babylon 5'.<br /><br />Battlestar Galactica consists of the four-hour pilot miniseries and then four seasons followed by 'The Plan' (not included in the DVD collection). I highly recommend watching it at least in HD if you can. We watched if the first time through on an old-fashioned tube TV and are now watching the entire series again--in HD. It really is a whole new show--visually--if you watch it in HD. While Bear MacCreary's enchanting soundtrack is worth listening to all by itself.<br /><br />Let's get right to the ***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />As a fan of the original BSG, I had certain standards that needed to be met. Two of my favorite things was the actual structure of the Galactica and it's commander, Lorne Greene's Adama. So, the new BSG right away had a hard act to follow, and I knew I would be uncomfortable seeing a different ship or Adama.<br /><br />They could not have done better than Edward James Olmos as Bill Adama, who, hands down, remains my favorite character of the series. You got to love those sad droop-dog eyes of his that he gives everybody. His face is just legend.<br /><br />Then you get some of the old characters revisited, Starbuck, Apollo, Tigh, Baltar, Boomer, and a whole new set too including, Billy, Helo, Dualla, Gaeta, Leoben, Cavil, Sam, Doc Cottle, etc. Maybe I am just easily impressed but--I thought everybody's acting was amazing throughout most of the series. It's hard to think of a character I could have done without. Everyone who gets screen time is game-on and convincing.<br /><br />My spouse and I watched this straight through over the course of about two weeks--and almost needed some therapy for mild PTSD. Reality never lets up for the crew of the Galactica, starting with the first post-miniseries episode, '33', with the Cylons jumping after the ragtag fleet every thirty-three minutes. Knuckle-biting. The stress hits everyone--even the viewer.<br /><br />One of the things that I love so much about Babylon 5 is that the cast is flawed. There are no Mary-Sues in Babylon 5. Subjects like rebelling against the State, addiction, family loss and prostitution were broached and played with a little. It was a very refreshing change of pace from the good, clean-cut characters of Star Trek.<br /><br />BSG takes that to an entirely different level. Like in real life, everyone in BSG has a problem. They may be gifted, talented, attractive or successful, but they are -all- flawed. From the Admiral and the President on down to the lowliest knuckle-dragger.<br /><br />Issues tackled in this show include but are not limited to:<br /><br />Alternative medicine. Kamala extract fills in for medical marijuana and is useful for treating pain.<br />Addictions to or recreational use of an assortment of substances including stims, booze and tobacco.<br />Homicide for varying reasons.<br />War crimes tribunals.<br />Labor unions and workers rights.<br />Maintaining government and freedom in times of extreme crisis.<br />Birth control and access.<br />Love, lust and recreational sex.<br />Marriage and divorce.<br />Right to refuse medical treatment.<br />Guerrilla insurgency, sabotage and patriotism.<br />Blatant military recruitment and government propaganda.<br />Peace movements and civil disobedience.<br />Depression, suicide, psychosis and other mental illness.<br />Religion--at least two different religions are presented in this show, along with agnosticism and atheism.<br /><br />--All handled amazingly well in my opinion. I wanted to serve on the Galactica before the miniseries was over.<br /><br />Other thoughts. Doc Cottle is the coolest doctor in science fiction--ever. Show includes some amazing father-son tension between not-so-goody two shoes Apollo and his old man. The chemistry between Roslin and Adama is one of the most precious interactions in the show. There  is a moment when Starbuck is being kept by the creepy psychopathic Leoben in a doll house and she is eating her steak while glancing over at the recently deceased copy and she wipes her mouth with her bloody hand-- if you've seen it, you know about the scene. It's really just amazing.<br /><br />It should be noted that the CGI is topnotch and although heavily used--never abused. The backdrops and ships are lovingly detailed. There is something totally steampunk in how the venerable and aging Galactica relies on it's old model Vipers and corded phones and lack of computer networks yet we still have some classic sci-fi devices like FTL jumps, anti-gravity that is never discussed and some pretty good futuristic technology--but no energy shields, turbo-lasers or transporter-beams.<br /><br />They really downplay the tech parts making it seem like the culture and reality of the people of the Twelve Colonies could very believably be us in the not-so-distant future. Throughout most of the show, there is this pressure of Cylon extinction overshadowing everything--but it quickly becomes obvious that the remaining humans may not be able to survive themselves.<br /><br />BSG makes people act like they do in real life and one of the overarching themes is--do we humans really have the right to inherit the earth and the galaxy for that matter? What makes us so good? There are more than a few times when you want to root for the Cylons when you see the survivors make one blundering, self-defeating mistake after another.<br /><br />After we watched the ending for the first time, my spouse said \\"I'll never be able to watch Star Trek quite the same again.\\" --I agree. This show will spoil you for other sci-fi which will seem quaint and innocent if not naive after watching BSG.<br /><br />Oh yea, the packaging is bad, blah blah, We didn't buy it for the packaging.  We made our purchase the week after the Universal's new packaging deal expired. Frak! So we put our DVDs in a plastic DVD binder in order of the seasons. It prevents the DVDs from getting scratched up as happens when you take them in and out of the stupid cardboard DVD holders that came with the box.<br /><br />I've lectured enough--gods damn it.

B000YAA68C|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Before he dies, Gerry Kennedy (Gerard Butler) - the pluckiest victim of a brain tumor since the stiff-upper-lipped Bette Davis faced-down a similar fate in \\"Dark Victory\\" - comes up with an ingenious way to continue giving Holly (Hilary Swank), his soon-to-be widow, advice from beyond the grave.  He composes a series of upbeat letters to be delivered to her at regular intervals after he`s gone - missives that contain specific instructions on how to pick up the pieces of her shattered world and move on with her life.  You see, Holly was kind of an uptight stick-in-the-mud when they were married, and now the too-good-to-be-true, happy-go-lucky Irishman wants to loosen her up by getting her to perform karaoke, sending her on an all-expenses-paid trip to the place of his birth, and encouraging her to become a cobbler (I kid you not).  But will Gerry's continued presence in his widow's life actually retard her ability to let go of the past and start anew?  And does this \\"Ghost\\" knockoff stand a ghost of a chance of becoming as universally beloved as that earlier husband-hanging-around-after-death romantic classic?<br /><br />Beyond the cringe-inducing creepiness of its premise, \\"P.S. I Love You,\\" based on the novel by Cecilia Ahern, is one of those annoying romantic comedies in which the women get all goofy, frisky and/or tongue-tied the moment some good-looking guy so much as steps into their line of vision.  Moreover, Gerry is portrayed as such a saintly figure, both before his demise and most definitely thereafter, that we never get to know him as a real, flesh-and-blood person in his own right; instead, in order to make all the ladies in the audience swoon over his magnificent romantic spirit - one, I might add, that no man in the real world has the slightest hope of ever living up to - writer/director Richard LaGravenese has seen fit to deprive Gerry of all those flaws each of us is entitled to just for being a member of the human race - and which are truly the only things that make a character interesting in the end.  And with that crucial dimension missing from the couple's relationship, we soon lose interest in Holly as well.  And, of course, the movie cheats by having Gerry's illness take place entirely off-camera, so as not to disturb the light romantic tone of the piece, but it does little to make us care about the couple.  The movie finally hits on some honest sentiment round about the 115-minute mark, and the story does avoid going down one painfully obvious narrative pathway towards the end, but, by that time, it's much too late to undo the damage.<br /><br />A large cast of well-known and talented actors - Kathy Bates, Lisa Kudrow, Harry Connick Jr., among them - do yeomen work with poorly written parts, but it's an uphill slog against bathos, pratfalls and contrivance all the way.

B003ELKNOK|5.0|This edition is wonderful. Tracks are written in little bit heavier mode. I mean that you can hear bass-guitar perfectly not like on Crossroad version. I took it as a present for my brother but I like it.
B002C6K7NU|5.0|If you like Lynyrd Skynyrd at all, what else can I say except here's another one! Sadly, two more long-time members (Billy Powell & Ean Evans) have passed away but the music is pure Skynyrd as always. Amazing that only one original remains (Gary Rossington) and they can still sound so much like the early band.
0439023513|5.0|Every so often, a book comes along that changes you. The Hunger Games, with this book as its conclusion, did just that. I know I'll spend weeks thinking about it and sorting through all of the questions and emotions \\"Mockingjay\\" stirred up. Yes, there are twists and yes, it is paced differently than the first two but after finishing it, I'm so glad that I did. \\"Mockingjay\\" ends in the only way that makes sense given the stark reality of the world Collins paints and it's completely true to the spirit of the first two books. Reading it will send you through an emotional gauntlet but there (sadly) few books that can do it so well.
B000NVT0RU|5.0|Some movies move us with their exquisite craftsmanship, superb acting, and luxurious cinematography while others affect us by the power of their story alone.  One such film is Rachid Bouchareb`s long-overdue tale about France`s forgotten African war heroes.`Days of Glory` charts the fates of those African soldiers who gave their blood and lives to free a nation that refused them sovereignty and equality. Director Bouchareb does an admirable job of whittling down this enormous history lesson into a tale of forlorn sacrifice.<br /><br />The film centers around the lives of four poverty-stricken North Africans who for various reasons volunteer to help rid France of tyranny. Abdelkader (magnificently played by Sami Bouajila) is an Algerian who on account of his literacy is immediately sent to NCO training.  A passionate idealist, Abdelkader firmly believes the war is being fought for the ideals of `liberty, equality and fraternity.`  He hopes that these will be granted to France`s African citizens as well.  Said (Jamel Debbouze) is a good-hearted shepherd from the dirt poor hinterlands of Algeria.  Despite his doting mother`s attempts to delay his enlistment, Said joins up with the tall, handsome Messaoud (Roshdy Zem) who soon becomes his unit`s crack marksman.<br /><br />Their baptism of fire arrives during the Allies` grinding advance through Italy.  The French colonials are given the task of cracking a path through the hardscrabble Italian mountains.  The Algerians charge up a hill raked by German mortar and machine gun fire.  Alongside them are the mountain Berbers of Morocco, the `goumiers.`  One of them, Yassir (Samy Naceri), soon becomes one of the main characters of the story.<br /><br />While all four survive their first taste of combat, they soon face equally sinister challenges from their own side.  Like Asian, Latino and African Americans during WWII, France`s colonial soldiers fought two wars: one against the Nazis and one against discrimination in the ranks.  When African soldiers are denied the same food rations as others, Abdelkader raises his voice in protest.  During their off-duty time, the North Africans are forced to watch a ballet presentation.  They chaff at having to endure something so foreign to their culture.  Again, Abdelkader turns the ensuing melee into a street protest with the soldiers demanding respect and recognition.  Bouchareb throws in these scenes of chronic injustice when you least expect them.  The African NCO`s are routinely overlooked for promotion, R&R leave is denied the African soldiers, and most insidiously, their mail is constantly censored.<br /><br />While the Africans help liberate France, the film too marches from anecdote to anecdote.  None of these are developed to any great extent, but yet they help us better understand the protagonists` predicaments.  Yet, some of these moments do wear thin in terms of plausibility.  When the troops liberate a French town, Said begins to chat up a pretty tricolor-waving girl.  He drones on about his profound attachment to `la patrie,` to the befuddled teen`s confusion.  Hard to believe that this would be any soldier`s first words to a girl he was trying to woo.<br /><br />For the most part, `Days of Glory` ambles along as a good film, but one with a great story to tell.  By the end though, the film itself rises to the level of its story.  In a final breathtaking scene, all four characters are thrown together one last time.  Their task is to hold a village until reinforcements arrive.  Abdelkader, Said, Messaud and Yassir fight for their lives and more importantly, for each other.  Bound tenuously by a common continent, religion, and language, all four fight with a selflessness and sense of sacrifice that binds them into a true brotherhood.  After the chaos and carnage settles, Abdelkader once again has his idealism shattered.  The French reinforcements claim the victory their Algerian and Moroccan brothers fought and died for.<br /><br />By telling this story, Bouchareb has done what all filmmakers should aspire to: provoke a change with their film.  After supposedly viewing the film in 2006, President Chirac freed up colonial soldiers` pension money frozen since 1959.  `Days of Glory` is a very entertaining and moving story that should be seen by history buffs and serious film fans alike.  Those looking for a vacuous action-packed war film best look elsewhere.  `Days` isn`t so much about war as about the cruel sacrifices it extracts.  Yet, it also shows how grievous injustices can be righted some 60 years after the fact.  American filmmakers should take note from Bouchareb`s success.  The Tuskegee airmen or the Africans` blood brothers in Alsace, the Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team are still waiting for someone to tell their equally compelling and worthy stories.
1433515164|5.0|As a full time minister, I have used MANY good Study Bibles over the years. I must say that this one has impressed me unlike any other. A total of 2,750 pages (not counting the maps in the back) - it is massive. It is filled with great notes, pictures, charts, and introductions. I am presently preparing to teach thru the book of Isaiah, and have made much use of the introductory material in this Bible. It is very well done. This is without a doubt the BEST study Bible I have ever seen. Get it, you'll love it!

0439023491|4.0|When last we left our heroine Katniss Everdeen, she was faced with a life of misery because she had to pretend to be in love with someone she kind of likes. She had angered the Capitol by not only surviving the Hunger Games, but bringing fake-boyfriend Peeta out alive as well. Such blatant disregard for the rules has not gone unnoticed, and now the twelve Districts are beginning to get ideas of rebellion.<br /><br />And so President Snow orders Katniss and Peeta to tour the districts and pretend to be in love to defuse the situation. The Capitol seems to be a bit undecided as to what to do with the pair, because Katniss and Peeta are also thrown back into the Hunger Games for round two.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a better, more rounded view of life in Panem, but the same problems from The Hunger Games return to haunt this book. This time around Katniss and Peeta tour the different districts, so we get to see just how put down and dystopian this society really is. We see more interaction between the Capitol and the Districts, making the Good Guys seem more good and the Bad Guys seem more Bad.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for someone who narrates the entire story, Katniss seems to be completely oblivious to anything that goes on around her. She notices, quite clearly and on multiple occasions, the symbol of the mockingjay in relation to rebel activity. The mockingjay was her symbol in the Hunger Games. She was the one who sparked the rebellion. And yet Katniss fails to put two and two together to figure out that she is the one all the rebels look to as a symbol of hope.<br /><br />No, instead she spends her time trying to deal with Peeta and Gale. Gale is of course her childhood friend, who hunts in the woods with Katniss. He got maybe a page and a half total in The Hunger Games, and yet is apparently Katniss' true love. We see more of him this time in Catching Fire, but his screentime is once again far overshadowed by Peeta. It 's a poor romance when the heroine spends most of her time mooning over someone we hardly know while snubbing the character the readers have come to know and identify with.<br /><br />The ending is rather abrupt and has little closure for the story. Much the same as the ending to The Empire Strikes Back, Catching Fire is a blatant setup for the next book. It's mostly exposition to lay the groundwork for part three, with more Hunger Games thrown into the middle to keep us pacified. And through it all, I still have no idea if Katniss likes Peeta or not.most of her time mooning over someone we hardly know while snubbing the character the readers have come to know and identify with.<br /><br />The ending is rather abrupt and has little closure for the story.

B002ZG997M|5.0|I found it a very satisying story . Plenty to keep the attention riveted, be curious about. Had a satisfying ending, general humanistic and related to that/in that way, some christian themes, etc. But this is woven into a good action plot. I'd call it a thoughtful action movie - nonthinkers and thinkers alike would enjoy it if they like action movies at all.     Good acting, particularly the key characters. Didn't glorify evil strength as the only way to ultimately survive (to the contrary), nor did it overly sensationalize or exaggerate the violence of the fight scenes, which were filmed with a more b&w palette than other scenes, perhaps to portray that life is at these times a very ugly and harsh reality.    Film starts out with Denzel walking westwards in post-apocolyptic future (in barren desert, as usual). Fight scene style is sort of a mashup of \\"private ryan\\" flavor blended with street/martial fighting choreography - so though it's rough, hurray, it's not the dumb comic-book quentin tarentino style. Though we aren't sure right away, little things before and after show us he's a decent guy under the badass. What is not answered is how how did he became so resilient, and how did he learn to be so competent a figher? (like clint eastwood's \\"pale rider\\"). There's the usual bad guys abusing people and resources along the way, and he gets to save a few lives. Due to attention to detail, the story is credibly done (for this genre); and not overly romanticized or glam. For some reason all the bibles were hunted down and burned (shades of fahrenheit 451). Note the map on the wall behind villain's desk. It's always interesting how denzel's character reacts, what he says. Also interesting that we see seeds of the human need of little beauty and spiritual in a few others when exposed to what denzel's character says as a decent person or quotes from the bible. The villain misses the book of eli but wants it for power, and denzel needs to bring it to where will be used forgood. Unintended funny - in a gunfight he shoots 22-28 bullets out of a semi handgunt, never reloading - it just  kept going, and going like the ever-ready bunny, Gee, even in the Matrix they had to reload much sooner.

0439023513|2.0|It is impossible to write about what I didn't like about this third installment of the Hunger Games without \\"spoiling\\" it for those who haven't read it.... Sorry...    It's dark. It's depressing. It's one tragic turn of events after another. It's apparent that those who gave this book rave  reviews accepted and enjoyed this type of ending for the series. Some people enjoy a heart-wrenching tragedy. I didn't. I expected better.    Peeta: The light and joy of the story - his love for Katniss is destroyed and his influential abilities are totally wasted. MIA for most of the story and when he is reintroduced his character is totally changed. He had such potential to be the \\"voice\\" of the rebellion. He represented everything good and noble in the society and when he was removed and changed we were left with darkness and hopelessness that could not be overcome. I sorely missed him.    Katniss: I understand that at the end of the book when she votes \\"yes\\" for Coin's new Hunger Games her intention is to assassinate Coin to prevent the same-old-same-old - a different regime but the same Evil. I understand that Haymitch knows this at the time of the vote without it ever being spoken. I understand that her mental state during the novel sets up the ending defense at her trial - not guilty due to mental instability. However, it is highly unlikely that in ANY society she would have gotten away with assassinating the new President and have been set free with supervised psychiatric care even with such a defense.   From what we know about Katniss in the previous two novels, there is NO WAY she would have condoned continuing the Hunger Games in any form. She did what she had to in order to prevent their continuation. That being said, it was a long-suffering ordeal to read hundreds of pages of her mental and physical torments. I also can't get past the whole scene with her failed attempt to assassinate Snow - a continuing theme through the book of how many lives have been lost that Katniss was directly or indirectly responsible for. Her assassination of Coin was the one thing that went right for Katniss, but I must admit I saw it coming.    What I didn't see coming was the death of Prim. I actually had to read the passage twice to figure out what had actually happened. It wasn't initially clear to me why Prim would even be there. Irony, yes, that the entire series starts with Katniss acting to save Prim's life and Prim ends up dying anyway. But sadness heaped upon sadness adds up to numbness and by that time I just didn't care anymore. I had figured out where this story was going long ago and already resigned myself to it.  The death of Finnick was also totally unnecessary. (Yes, I understand \\"war is hell\\", nobody really \\"wins\\", etc. etc.) Collins didn't have to kill off beloved characters to prove that. She'd already drilled it into us in a multitude of ways. At least she didn't kill the cat.    The ending was so unsatisfying. The relationships that we had in the first two books between Katniss and Peeta and Katniss and Gale are resolved by default. We get ONE PAGE summing up this whole relationship situation that was CENTRAL to the stories in the first two books. I almost feel like Collins set us up with this wonderful love story and then loosed her real agenda in the third book.    I read and re-read the first two books and longingly looked forward to the third but I doubt that I will ever read it again.

B001F2W4Y2|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of AC/DC and loved every album up to Razor's Edge and AC/DC Live.  That being said, I was HUGELY disappointed with Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip (if you take the few decent tracks off those two albums and combine them, you have half of one decent CD).  Black Ice, on the other hand, is a return to what makes these guys so much fun.  They've always had one or two hit songs off each album that make it to radio play for a little while, but what's always been great is that you can listen to most of their CDs from start to finish and it's just one great song after another.  Black Ice has that feel once again.  My only complaint is that it's 15 tracks long and only about 11 are truly worthy of being on the CD.  But that's still pretty decent.  My favorite tracks are Rock 'N Roll Train, Skys on Fire, Anything Goes, and War Machine.
B002A9IZ9C|1.0|I *so* wanted to love this unit that I bought two.  And at $100 less than the 580exii it sounds like a bargain, even with double the recycling time, slightly flaky buttons, and a slow-to-update display.  But what a disappointment: as a slave it would not sync in groups A or B, only C. As a master it didn't work properly either, though I couldn't figure out quite what it *was* doing.  And to top it off I discovered that Nissin, who confirmed the unit was faulty, didn't offer an international warranty, only a return-to-China warranty.    If they fix this, this unit would be a killer, but for now, I'm (regrettably, and painfully) passing.  Back to Amazon it has gone. :(
0385528752|5.0|This book was not just good but great.  It is about introducing change in an organization.  Of course one of the most difficult organizations to change is a church, so this book is incredibly helpful for leaders in congregations.  The book is easy to read, and understandable.  Instead of a difficult and complex model for change, the authors broke down the steps in a clear model.  You will hear about elephants, riders, and self-control.  This book was read on a kindle and I marked it all up.  It was so good that I even twitted from the kindle.  Of all the books on change, this was the one I would read again.  Even though it was not written to churches, it is applicable to churches.  Even if you are not going through a process of change, the book also provides a ton of practical advice on moving people forward in Christian faith.  Life is about changing, from churches going from internal to external, to Christians going from immature to mature.  This is the nature process of life and this book helps one navigate this transition.  I highly recommend this title.  It is great.
0596806027|3.0|In the 1970s, ABC's \\"Schoolhouse Rock\\" took the tedious process of making a law and distilled it down into a 3-minute song that many of us can at least sing the first few bars from (\\"I'm just a bill, yes I'm only a bill, and I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill...\\"). Marc Pilgrim takes a different approach with the first chapter of this book, distilling the early history of HTML into fourteen eye-glazing pages. But if you can muddle through the initial proposal and discussion of the IMG tag, you get to Pilgrim's primary take-away of the chapter: HTML is not so much a thing, but a collection of things.    This is good, because the history of HTML has not been a smooth, step-by-step process. Different releases of different browsers have adopted different features of different specs at different times. I can personally recall rejoicing, back in the 90s, when both IE and Netscape finally implemented support for HTML tables. So it's no wonder that the second chapter dives into methods for detecting whether or not a user's browser supports certain HTML5 features.    If the first chapter was boring, the second is discouraging. First he shows how to check if Canvas is even supported. But once that's determined, you have to check if all the features of Canvas are supported. Moving on to the Video tag, even when that is supported, video format support varies across browsers. Basically, in these early days of HTML 5 support, it's like touring the United States early in the 20th century. Flush toilets and electric lights took longer to come to some areas than others.    After the third chapter started breaking down some of the new tags and how they affect the DOM, my eyes were good and glazed. This book is more discussion than documentation. If it was a car repair manual, instead of merely showing you the steps for changing the oil on your Honda, it would give you the history of the internal combustion engine, then detail different kinds of lubrication systems.    In short, there'sa lot of valuable information in this book. Mark Pilgrim is no slouch on technical know-how or understanding of his topic. I just find the manner of presentation to be organized in such a way that I don't feel I have quick access to the information I want or that the available path to acquiring that knowledge is optimal. It's short on lab, long on lecture, and isn't something I'd make part of my permanent library.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|When things go wrong Bayside Media gets it fixed fast. We were sent the wrong movie, but were given the movie we did receive while we waited for the correct one to arrive. The mix up was recognized immediately, and resolved quickly by a friendly staff member who kept me informed. When we did receive the movie we ordered, the DVD was in excellent condition and packaged carefully. I would definitely order from Bayside Media again despite the mild inconvenience.
0618918248|2.0|In this book Richard Dawkins is an advocate of evolutionary biology as opposed to creationism. The problem is that Dawkins' subject matter is hopelessly pass&eacute;. I mean it's 150 years ago that Darwin published \\"On the Origin of Species\\" in 1859 and Christianity as a religion in the western world is, save for a few mentally disturbed people, pretty dead! Actually Dawkins appear to me to be a little stupid. Personally I suspect that religions are made in the image of man. And man can actually be something a bit more wonderous than Dawkins can probe with his scientific instruments. Dawkins is a hot house plant playing his own little intellectual game, quite ignorant and blind to the traits of the world developing right now.

0060557818|5.0|\\"Neverwhere\\" by Neil Gaiman truly is a great fantasy adventure. Mr. Gaiman's style of writing had me wondering what time period he was writing about and frankly I was surprised when I came to the realization. My confusion was due, in part, to the London locale but also a result of the incredibly realistic story blending of the author. The story begins with Richard Mayhew, the protagonist, being given a send off by friends. He's to leave Scotland for London to begin a new job. Mayhew is a strange sort of fellow, not daring or adventurous at all. Not truly enjoying the party, and perhaps having had too much drink he leaves for a bit and has an encounter with a woman who thinks he's a derelict. She provides him with a prophesy that confuses him but it's what sets the stage and gets ones imaginative juices flowing. It isn't long afterward that the reader is introduced to the next protagonist and then the story goes places, very different places both in time and locale. I'm especially interested in this sort of fantastic, whimsical, adventure storytelling and Mr. Gaiman is a master. The novel characters and story develop nicely and mostly what happens isn't at all what one might anticipate. It's all somewhat, and sort of, like an adult \\"through the looking glass\\" type adventure, but then, very much not like that at all. Mystery and danger, with a little magic thrown in, is rife throughout. Have some fun with this exciting book, I did.
B001QXE0OC|4.0|I had briefly heard naturally and saw this for £3. For £3 if I didn't like it, it wasn't the end of the world.<br /><br />Actually I liked it. As embarrassing as it is to admit I am 21, this album is a serious guilty pleasure. Whereas some albums can be a struggle to listen too all the way through, this wasn't. It grew on me quickly and I like every song to near enough the same extent.<br /><br />The only one I might skip occasionally is 'As a Blonde.'<br /><br />The running time is just long enough and it doesn't bore me half way through. The songs are catchy and the album doesn't take itself too seriously. Ok, so not the best or most artistically progressive album in the world by any means but I've brought many a worse album for alot more money.<br /><br />This album doesn't claim to be anything it's not. It isn't going to change the face of music. If you are expecting a serious album, then look elsewhere. You won't be getting an album of the Beatles standard, but you will get an album of half-decent pop songs.<br /><br />Give it a go. I'm not a Wizards of Waverley place fan but I didn't let her Disney stardom turn me off. I'm glad it didn't. Whilst some people would be embarrassed to have this in their CD collection, I'm not. Already pre-ordered album number 2 and I'm looking forward to it.
0300108834|5.0|I heard of this book on NPR radio and had to buy it! The radio story was actually about a similar style book titled \\"A Little Book of Language\\" I didn't care much about that title, but this one piqued my interest, so I bought it! I read a chapter or two (only a few pages)each night and as a person who didn't care much for or pay attention to history during my school years, I now understand what I missed!! This book gets the main ideas/topics across without overwhelming you with minute details. I love it! Definitely a good book/gift for an older child!
0307454541|3.0|This is an above-average thriller. I've read better in the genre but plenty more that are worse. It does bulk out because of the overly descriptive style, including a full ingredient list of every sandwich the characters eat.

B003HARV3Y|1.0|Chris Columbus is terrible. Why does he keep getting hired? It's now to the point that if my family sees his name on a film, we'll avoid it. This movie was a horrible disservice to Rick Riordan and the Percy Jackson books. I wish HBO or any other cable channel with the means would hire intelligent visionaries who are fans of the material to develop a series based on the books. The difficulties would include aging the characters believably from 12 to 16 or so, but perhaps certain books and series (such as the Harry Potter books and this one) can truly be brought beautifully to the screen only as part of TV. As to this and the Potter films, there are those fans of the books who dislike the film adaptations and those who just don't care; they'll see anything based on their beloved books. Count me in the first group.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I'm completely stable at 4.175GHz. Is it my final result? Probably not with my existing equipment, but I am extremely impressed with the result. My goal is still to get to 4.2GHz, but this is how I got here and the contributing factors.<br /><br />AMD X6 Black Edition (3.2GHz)<br />Asus CrossHair IV Motherboard<br />16Gb of DDR3 1066 Ram<br />Corsair H50 CPU Cooler<br />Coolermaster HAF Full Tower<br />Asus 5870 1GB v2 Video Card<br /><br />Step 1: Use TurboEvo software (included with Asus Crosshair)to auto overclock the CPU & Ram automatically in Windows 7. This is a good observational tool to find out which factors should be changed (Ratio/Multiplier, Bus, Voltage) and there respective limits. I used this tool with settings Extreme Overclock and Flexible Voltage Settings and got a 3.9GHz Result.<br /><br />Step 2: Restart and Mod in Bios. The trick to overclocking is deciding whether to focus on increasing the bus or multiplier when reaching for that higher clock. This is answered in Step 1. The ram speed is the determining factor in this answer. My ram speed was 1333, and with my 4 sticks of 4gb (16 total) sucking up far more voltage than a single stick, increasing the cpu's bus speed would mean a higher memory speed requirement that my ram couldn't handle without a voltage increase.<br />So I left the cpu's bus at the default 200 setting and increased the multiplier, hoping to get a final clock speed of 4.3 or 4.4.  After reading others overclocking experiences I decided not to set the voltage beyond 1.49. I also set my CPU/NB voltage at a 1.25. After numerous crashes and restarts, I ended up with a super stable clock of 4.1GHz that survived all of the highest settings of Heaven Benchmarks, 3DMark06 and 3DMark Vantage, Crysis (Directx 10), Alien vs Predator Benchmark (Directx 11), and the dreaded Furmark test (with my 5870 that I overclocked to a stable 961 core/1290 memory).<br /><br />Step 3: Run Turbo Evo again. This program will push your overclock even higher, more stably than you ever could using your new settings as a starting point. Starting at my 4.1, Turbo Evo overclocked three more times in Windows, finally crashing above 4.2. It saved my final stable settings upon restart, and my cpu was automatically set to 4.175GHz. Point is the motherboard and memory speed do make a difference, not just cooling. Though my Cosair H50 handles this overclock at 40 degrees idle/50 load with ease. If your memory is faster, than you may get a slightly better result. In a few days, I may decide to try to set the voltage at 1.5 or 1.51 and see if temps are still good and see if I can reach that 4.2 or 4.3 using Turbo Evo only. My manual overclock is done.<br /><br />If you have any questions, hit my up at coolbreeze70056@yahoo.com and I will try to help.<br /><br />Update: Here are the necessary voltages for this processor. For each voltage, set it -.02 below the voltage that's given, as the voltage given is what it will be under a load.<br />3792MHz=1.35v (set voltage to 1.33) ; 4000MHz=1.42v (set to 1.39) ; 4100Mhz=1.44 (set to 1.41) ; 4200MHz=1.46 (set to 1.44).<br /><br />*Cooling update* I upgraded from a H50 to H70, set it up with 2 included 2200 rpm fans @ 100% speed in push/pull exhaust configuration. Under a full load, my temps were 38 degrees idle/41 degrees during an hour long playtime of Metro 2033 at max settings/ 46 degrees max during an hour and 30 minute long movie encoding using Cyberlink's Power Director. Power Director is optimized to push all six cores in order to encode faster, and would easily crash the system if there's not enough voltage or crash if the program generates to much heat. None of the test went above 46 degrees at the 4GHz/1.39v settings. Remember that the highest temps that you would want the processor to reach on a 24 basis under a load is 55 degrees. It can go over by 1 or 2 degrees every now and then, but if you are reaching the breaking point of 62 degrees everytime the computer is under a load, then you have to lower the voltage and use a lower overclock.<br /><br />Why haven't I run the normal stress test to push the system?

0374158460|3.0|I think \\"The Corrections\\" was a more successful outing than this one. For me, \\"Freedom\\" suffers from a tedious first half, including Patty's autobiography, a huge section of over 150 pages.<br /><br />I'm not belittling what Franzen has accomplished; he does know how to write. I guess I sound like one of those Woody Allen critics, the kind who wants all his stuff to be funny.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />BEST LINE: \\"The fungus that dare not speak its name.\\" (p. 60)<br /><br />BEST INVENTIONS: Republic of Health; Walnut Surprise.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Tedious first half. Payoff comes awfully late in the game.
B003QCCS36|4.0|I've listened to it for a couple of weeks before reviewing. I like this album, but it's not as interesting to me as \\"Gossip In The Grain\\", which I think is his best so far.    There's not as much variety as on \\"Gossip\\". Another reviewer said that, unlike this album, \\"Trouble\\" didn't have much diversity. But my thought before reading the reviews was that this album was pretty similar to \\"Trouble\\", though with a lot more fire.    For a few days, the 2nd track -- \\"New York City's Killing Me\\" -- acted as somewhat of a roadblock. I'd start listening to the CD, which begins with the excellent, aggressive \\"Repo Man\\", and get to the 2nd track and just turn it off.    Even though I don't much like the 2nd track, the contrast between \\"New York City's Killing Me\\", where he sings \\"There's just something about this hotel -- Got me wishing I was dead -- Gotta get outta New York City, son\\" and then the line in the track that follows: \\"Caroline in the mountains; sun sets up in ribbons high -- I don't never wanna get old; never wanna die...\\" is a pretty interesting contrast. You know where he belongs.    After the first track, the first half is pretty same-sounding. The title track stands out. It starts to get a bit more interesting by the 5th or 6th track and then holds it for the remainder. But I wouldn't say that it's an album where every track is perfect.    The recording quality is very good and airy. It's not one of those CDs that was mastered explicitly for the iPod audience.    If you preferred his first two albums, I think you will like this one. If you thought \\"Gossip In The Grain\\" was his best to date, this one might feel like a step backward to his prior sound.
1400095204|4.0|This is quite a book and the last 100 pages or so, are a rough ride.  The book is based, largely I believe, on real life characters and follows each of them through the war/massacre/mass starvation that became known as either the Nigerian Civil War, or the lost war for Biafran Independence in the years 1967-1970.  What I liked about this book is that the characters are well developed and flawed; therefore, they are believable and you feel empathy for them, even when they act  destructively.      The writer's prose is simple and straightforward.  It is not overly descriptive or flowery.  So, in many ways, she is purposely a better story teller than she is a story writer.  But that's okay.  This is a page turner and a humane telling of a conflict lost to the blind ambitions of the Big Powers and the ego-maniacs that rule the world.  The author does not spare her scorn for the Brits and the Americans and their cynical backing of a corrupt Nigerian government.      In the end, I felt her main message was a simple yet profound message.  No one wins in war. Even, the so called \\"winners\\" sacrifice their humanity and their ideals.  So, in a strange way it made me reflect on America's present wars.      In the end, does anyone really win?      I don't give five star ratings unless a book is one of the best I've read in the past several years; but this book comes close.  It's easily a 4. Okay, let's give it a 4.5.  It's a perfect selection for a book club as much discussion could be made of the various characters and what they represent.  But if you buy this book, stick with it for the first, fairly slow, 100 pages as it does build up a story foundation as it progresses to its relatively sad ending.      I highly recommend this book.
1594488843|4.0|This book explores some of the complexities of what motivates humans. It attacks a stereotype that says only financial rewards matter, and exaggerates the extent to which people adopt that fallacy. His style is similar to Malcolm Gladwell's, but with more substance than Gladwell.<br /><br />The book's advice is likely to cause some improvement in how businesses are run and in how people choose careers. But I wonder how many bosses will ignore it because their desire to exert control over people outweighs their desire to create successful companies.<br /><br />I'm not satisfied with the way he and others classify motivations as intrinsic and extrinsic. While feelings of flow may be almost entirely internally generated, other motivations that he classifies as intrinsic seem to involve an important component of feeling that others are rewarding you with higher status/reputation.<br /><br />Shirking may have been a been an important problem a century ago for which financial rewards were appropriate solutions, but the nature of work has changed so that it's much less common for workers to want to put less effort into a job. The author implies that this means standard financial rewards have become fairly unimportant factors in determining productivity. I think he underestimates the importance they play in determining how goals are prioritized.<br /><br />He believes the changes in work that reduced the importance of financial incentives was the replacement of rule-following routine work with work that requires creativity. I suggest that another factor was that in 1900, work often required muscle-power that consumed almost as much energy as a worker could afford to feed himself.<br /><br />He states his claims vaguely enough that they could be interpreted as implying that broad categories of financial incentives (including stock options and equity) work poorly. I checked one of the references that sounded like it might address that (\\"When performance-related pay backfires\\"), and found it only dealt with payments for completing specific tasks.<br /><br />His complaints about excessive focus on quarterly earnings probably have some value, but it's important to remember that it's easy to err in the other direction as well (the dot-com bubble seemed to coincide with an unusual amount of effort at focusing on earnings 5 to 10 years away).<br /><br />I'm disappointed that he advises not to encourage workers to compete against each other, but offers no evidence about its effects.<br /><br />One interesting story is the bonus system at Kimley-Horn and Associates, where any employee can award another employee $50 for doing something exceptional. I'd be interested in more tests of this - is there something special about Kimley-Horn that prevents abuse, or would it work in most companies?for completing specific tasks.

B002VECMAE|4.0|Watched this on cable last night and really enjoyed it. The whole premise was actually a serious military project at one time back in the day, but I assume it never panned out in real life?<br /><br />This is definitely not a movie for everyone as some of the gags and humor are a bit deadpan, yet I found myself chuckling throughout it all. George Clooney plays a likeable goofball and Jeff Bridges is especially great as the head Jedi. Kevin Spacey plays a real weasel this time.<br /><br />The only thing that could have bothered me is when George Clooney reveals his health condition to the reporter (as a result of a \\"death touch\\"). Whether it was real or just imagined is hard to say because you could not tell in the end.<br /><br />Speaking of endings, I loved the little twist at the end.<br /><br />Not for everyone's taste, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Recommended.
B002VECMAE|5.0|I loved this movie. Would see it again. But most people dont get it. My family didn't get it. I went and saw it alone and then rented it for my grown daughter and wife and they were like 'what on earth are we watching'. Well, what can I say? Being a Marine and Vietnam Vet and product of the sixties I believe this is primarily a true story as the Author says it is. I recently read the book, after seeing the movie, and didnt care for it - but the movie - go see it if you're into the bizarre real military thinking and tests.

B003IY48PS|5.0|A couple of months ago it was announced that Evil Dead was coming out on Blu-Ray. I confess that I was not very excited due to the fact that I had a copy of the HDTV broadcast of Evil Dead and didn't expect much of an improvement. Yet I decided to pick up a copy at my local DVD shop. With little excitement, I nonchalantly put the disc in my Blu-Ray player and sat back. Unlike some other Blu-Rays, this one had didn't have to take time loading and immediately went to previews of horror movies. I skipped through these and went to the menu. When the menu started playing, my spirits immediately were uplifted. The menu had the same music as the one in the Ultimate Edition over a nice collection of suspenseful moments in the film with a sepia filter over them. I decided to watch the full screen version.  The moment the movie started I was shocked. The once blurry and pink Renaissance logo and Evil Dead title were now sharp red. I was intrigued. As the movie proceeded, I was thoroughly amazed, this is and probably will always be THE BEST PICTURE QUALITY THAT EVIL DEAD WILL BE PRESENTED IN. I highly doubt that a film shot on 16mm can be up-converted beyond this; however, don't get me wrong, this isn't reference quality Blu-Ray, it's very far from it. There is plenty of grain that is inherent to 16mm film. Apparently Sam Raimi really did supervise this transfer well. It no longer suffers from the problems evidenced in the widescreen Anchor Bay releases and surpasses even the Elite DVD in sharpness. The color timing is spot on and is probably what was intended. For example, at the end, the sky is white rather than pinkish like in the Elite DVD. Additionally, reds do not bloom as in the Ultimate Edition transfer and HDTV broadcast. In case you are wondering, I did compare this with the aforementioned HDTV broadcast, and the difference is like night and day. It reminds me of the difference between the original Anchor Bay DVD release with the vastly superior Elite DVD. Finally, Iam pleased to say that this transfer does not use HEAVY DNR (grain reducer) unlike the Evil Dead 2 transfer (which makes me hope that Anchor Bay will re-release Evil Dead 2 on Blu-Ray with a new transfer by Sam Raimi. The Dolby True HD sound mix was immersive and very impressive; although, I am disappointed that the mono mix was not included for purists' sakes.  After finishing the movie, I watched it again in widescreen with the commentary. The widescreen video is exactly the same as the full screen video quality, so I suspect Sam Raimi supervised both of them. The commentary was informative and had it's moments. Although I enjoyed it thoroughly, it is nowhere near as good as the Evil Dead 2 commentary, which is in my opinion the best commentary ever.  The Evil Dead is a horror masterpiece. Though lacking in acting, it makes Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street look like the comedies they really are. It showed that horror should have no boundaries through the very raw talent of Sam Raimi. This rawness resembles the similar rawness Stephen King (who incidentally endorsed this movie) used in his (in my opinion) best novel Carrie. It gets to our horror tolerance limits then breaks them. Bruce Campbell brings a certain charm and innocence to the role of Ash that makes his character the best male horror protagonist.  With that, I am glad to say that Evil Dead has finally gotten the release it deserves. Now, JOIN US!!!
B0035G9ABQ|4.0|This album is simply amazing. Most Gorillaz fans think this album is very weak compared to their previous albums \\"Gorillaz\\" & \\"Demon Days\\". Don't get me wrong this album is nothing like the first two, but that's what you expect from Gorillaz, something unique and of course epic. I'm a huge Gorillaz fan and I listen to this album like every single day. I'm going to rate every song and put a comment on how I feel about them.    1. Orchestral Intro (feat. sinfonia ViVA) 5/5: This intro is so smooth and relaxing to listen to. There's not much to say about it but when you hear it, you'll know what I'm talking about.    2. Welcome to World of the Plastic Beach (feat. Snoop Dogg & Hypnotic Brass Ensemble) 4.5/5: I'm not even going to lie, when I first heard this song, I hated it. I couldn't feel the beat nor Snoop Dogg. Now it's grown on me. 2D only has background vocals saying \\"Just like that!\\" It's simple, short and straight to the point.     3. White Flag (feat. Bashy, Kano & The Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music) 5/5: In the beginning of this song you immediately hear the Arabic music. As I was listening to this I didn't know what to expect. I didn't feel like I was listening to a Gorillaz song at all. Also, I never even heard of Bashy and Kano. Once the beat drop, I was like \\"Wow, this is pretty hot\\". I had no clue it was going to become a hip-hop song, then at the end it goes back to the Arabic music. No vocals from 2D or Noodle but it still works for me. Personally this is one of my favorite songs on the album.    4. Rhinestone Eyes 5/5: This is pretty much the first song that 2D is actually on. What can I say about this song. Its Gorillaz! Catchy lyrics and the beat is SO Crazy!    5. Stylo (feat. Bobby Womack and Mos Def) 5/5: This is the first single off their album. This song gives you that good alternative hip-hop/electronic mix to it. 2D owns this song all the way. Bobby Womack sounds on point, a little loud but it goes with the song. Mos Def is just background vocals but every time I hear Mos Def, It always seem right. The video is amazing as well. Give it a watch.    6. Superfast Jellyfish (feat. De La Soul & Gruff Rhys of the Super Furry Animals) 5/5: I can not get this song out of my head if my life depended on it. If you heard this song already, try not to compare it to Feel Good Inc., since it features De La Soul. Superfast Jellyfish gives incredible rap delivery from emcees Posdnuos and Trugoy. Gruff Rhys sounds amazing on the hook giving you that good indie feel. This song does really sound like an advertisement for a food commercial and it makes me want to eat Jellyfish...Superfast. :)    7. Empire Ants (feat. Little Dragon) 5/5: I could sing this song all day. In the beginning you hear 2D singing along to a real soft synthpop instrumental. His voice is perfect for the beat and it works really well. The beat eventually changes into a more electronic/dance tune. Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon sounds amazing. I can't help to feel that its Noodle or Cyborg Noodle singing with 2D. Who knows.       8. Glitter Freeze (feat. Mark E. Smith) 2/5: Personally, I feel this is the worst track off the album. The whole song is mostly instrumental, but I doesn't do anything for me. The beat is not too bad but its pretty boring. Nothing special.    9. Some Kind of Nature (feat. Lou Reed) 5/5: Lou Reed is pretty much talking on the whole song, but it works in some weird way. The beat is amazingly catchy and 2D as always is on point with the lyrics. The duet is great to listen to and it always puts me in a good mood.    10. On Melancholy Hill 5/5: This is the second single off the album. What can I say about this synthpop tune? Its damn near perfect. How could you not like this song? Even better the video is so awesome to look at! Welcome back Noodle. We missed you so much.    11. Broken 3/5: I have to admit, the song is good but I can easily skip it. 2D does sound very good but the hook I'm not too crazy about. Its not horrible, no...but not amazing. Just my opinion.     12. Sweepstakes (feat. Mos Def & Hypnotic Brass Ensemble) 3/5: Again, another song I can also skip. The beat always seems a little bit out of place and its just okay. Lyrics by Mos Def aren't too hot. Maybe I should give it time to grow on me.    13. Plastic Beach (feat. Mick Jones And Paul Simonon) 5/5: At first I did not like this song at all. It just didn't do it for me. Now I play this song like every single day. I love the instrumental in the beginning of the song. 2D once again sounds awesome. The squeaky voices on the hook did bother me at first. I feel like it really goes with the song very well now.     14. To Binge (feat. Little Dragon) 5/5: Probably my favorite song off this album. Its either a tie between this and \\"On Melancholy Hill\\" 2D & Yukimi or should I say Noodle, do such an amazing job signing together. It's relaxing, peaceful and calm. I'm hoping they will make this to a single, but I have a feeling that's not going to happen. Overall its a great song..its hard not to like this song.    15. Cloud of Unknowing (feat. Bobby Womack & sinfonia ViVA) 4/5: Bobby Womack is in his own world with this song. It works very well. Short and sweet.    16. Pirate Jet 4.5/5: I never really listen to this song, but when I do, I really like it. I don't know why I don't listen to it but who knows. Give it a listen and most likely you'll dig it.    Overall, Plastic Beach is a great album. A lot of fans may disagree but I don't really care what other people think. It's just my personal opinion. If you haven't heard this album, I say give a chance..but you really have to have a open mind and not think Demon Days. I liked Demon Days but I have to admit, I think I might like Plastic Beach a little better. Sorry to Disappoint. :) I give the album 9/10

John Lithgow is this season's Big Bad, and he is ominous and scary. Lots of uncomfortable, anxiety-provoking moments, as Dexter's rigid discipline begins to unravel.

030726999X|3.0|Honestly, if you want the long and the short of it, without spoilers, this book comes nowhere close to being as good as the first novel in Larrson's series, much like the second novel. It just doesn't. Way too much summary, lots of rehashing events three or four times through the perspectives of multiple characters, for what effect I have no idea, but it becomes so redundant that it fails to move the plot forward and it's painful in a novel that is billed as a \\"thriller\\". It's a much slower read with much fewer heart racing moments. It seems like the product of an author who was trying to milk a good idea for way too long. It's a very Salander centric novel, which normally would be a good thing, accept she spends almost the entire time in a hospital bed awaiting trial. She's not allowed to go out and cause havoc like in the first two, which would be a blast. The Salander moments are what make the series.<br /><br />The ultimate killer of this novel is that there is no mystery. Unlike Dragon Tattoo and even a little bit of \\"Played with Fire\\", there is utterly no mystery either as a central plot point, or even in the conflicts themselves. What this amounts to is absolutely no suspense. The reader knows where the book is going even before the book knows its going there, and that's a death knell. It really is. This is one of the most predictable books I have ever read, and maybe that is partially intentional, but it shouldn't have been. People will rate this novel high because it is the sequel of maybe one of the greatest pure mysteries ever written, but the reality is, it doesn't deserve to stand along side Dragon Tattoo. Its not in the same league, not even the same sport, and I suspect on some level if Larsson had not died it would have been reworked and rewritten. It does have the feel of being in manuscript form, or possibly even being unfinished, a draft if you will of something that could have been much better. We will never know, and that's the ultimate tragedy of Larsson's passing, that we will never really get a \\"true\\" sequel that does the first novel justice. Ultimately I think the final two novels illustrate the pitfalls of serializing a character in that you can never really maintain the punch and suspense of when they were originally introduced. It's just too hard. If the first novel was a superb hollywood film then books two and three are like a TV series spin off...they may capture some of the zeitgeist of the original idea, but they verge into self parody far too often to do the characters justice.<br /><br />This will fuel debate in literary circles that Larsson was just an amateur writer who got lucky with his first novel, captured lightning in a bottle, and was never able to do so again. I don't believe this. I think he could have been a major heavyweight and could have gone on to duplicate the success of Dragon Tattoo. Sadly he didn't get that chance, and we are all poorer for it. But to pretend that he did it in this novel or the one before it, would be an equal dishonor, as it is not his best work.on's passing, that we will never really get a \\"true\\" sequel that does the first novel justice.

B000002UJQ|2.0|This disc enjoys a special place on my private list of \\"those things that must be smote,\\" as not only is it an over-hyped harbinger of boredom, but it is also largely responsible for reintroducing the worst characteristics of early seventies music back to mainstream radio. And after we thought the Ramones had finally purged the world of whiny, overblown prog-rock too. So many people hail \\"OK Computer\\" as some kind of musical flash of genius that launched an entire sound. Well, they're half right. The album did launch an entire sound, but, unfortunately, that sound sucks. If I had known the future of rock music would be boring musical arrangements that are only really good for generating alpha waves - much like the entire droning, half-speed, yawn-inducing plodding of the nineties' grunge phenomenon - I would have tried to change the future somehow. As for Thom Yorke's vocals, they're pretty much akin to a drug snitch who is being interrogated via electrodes on his privates - he sounds like a strangled cat. Who besides out of touch rock magazines like Rolling Stone and a few hype-happy listeners with turtlenecks and thumb rings are seriously going to suggest this guy can sing at all? Curiously, the guy looks like a strangled cat as well, so maybe his singing voice is actually his inner spirit animal trying to escape its whiny human prison. I give the cd 2 stars just for the fact that the band at least shows some sort of musicianship, but only 2 as the sum total of their efforts is just awful.
0316067938|3.0|I too, have read all the books (twice) and have jumped on the \\"Twilight\\" bandwagon late - I read the final book and was totally dissappointed as well....total let down! Let us all pray that the last 2 movies are better then the book... WOW ~ When has anybody hoped for that??
B00000G3AZ|1.0|I ordered three DVDs of different movies and this one was very poor quality compared to the others I received.  There is no excuse for this.

Hope I don't get anymore that look like this.

B0009R1T7M|2.0|Another whiny album from yet another overrated neo-folk musician. Yes Sufjan Stevens might have some writing ability, yes he does original musical stuff on his album...but so what. I could smack a fish against a xylophone, throw some well chosen words together into a recording mic and call it an album too...that doesn't mean the sum total would be good...or a pleasant listening experience...or have a single decent melody. Illinoise it aptly named. It is ultimately one of those albums made by the goofy high school band guy who liked to whip out his guitar around campfires and sing cheesy alternative neo-folk songs - the same guy who got a name for himself after graduation because tin-eared music critics looking to break the next big thing in music rushed to proclaim it genius. It's not genius - it's the product of a guy with a fish and a xylophone, not to mention an ultimately boring and uninspiring musical mess. I'm giving it 2 stars simply because, although it still blows, it IS at least more original than most of the other neo folk albums out there.

0307120007|5.0|I bought this for a baby shower \\"wishing well\\" knowing that the expected baby will simply LOVE this book. Both my children loved this book and read it until it was torn and tattered. I've since bought it as a gift for expectant mothers, and they've told me how their babies adored patting the bunny and doing the many other engaging things in the book. Every page is highly interactive. With few words on a page, babies can soon read this themselves. It's a great first book for baby.
B00406UK5A|3.0|Centurion is a blood-soaked action thriller about a small group of 9th Legion soldiers trying to make their way out of enemy territory. The 9th had been send to supress the intractable Picts, inhabitants of the modern day Scottish Highlands who had held Rome in a stalemate for twenty years, using ferocious guerrilla tactics and knowledge of the terrain to defend their homeland. The Legion is wiped out in an ambush and their general, Titus Virilus (Dominic West), is captured, leaving only a handful of survivors. During their attempt to rescue the general from the enemy camp, events go terribly wrong and the men earn a bounty on their heads. The rest of the film follows these 7 or 8 soldiers, led by Centurion Quintas Dias (Fassbender), as they are hunted down one by one. Alternatively, this movie can be called \\"Band [of Romans] on the Run\\".<br /><br />This film is not for the squeamish. Limbs fly and heads roll in glorious profusion. People get sliced, bludgeoned, decapitated (sometimes very sloppily), skewered, and messily hacked up. It's very gory and very graphic. As for the acting, Fassbender does a bang-up job in his role as the group's leader, as does Dominic West as the General. In his relatively short screen time, West manages to convey volumes about his character. I wish I could say the same for the rest of the soldiers. There is little depth to their characters, so we are not asked to make much of an emotional investment. We have little to no back-story for them.<br /><br />Another issue that I found to be a major distraction is the use of modern vernacular and idioms, especially profanities like f--k, s--t (which are plentiful in the film). Right at the beginning narration, Quintas Dias says \\"this place is the arseh*le of the world\\". I expect soldiers to use coarse language and engage in abusive banter, but not when it's curses and expressions we might hear today at the local bar. The actors are dressed as ancient Roman soldiers, but they talk like they're right out of 2010. No attempt is made to disguise or stylize the dialogue and make it sound more like a period film. This took me right out of the fiction and made it more difficult to immerse in the film's setting. There are multiple instances where the dialogue pulled me right out of the scene because that is now how Romans in AD 117 are supposed to sound. They don't say things like: \\"When will people learn not to f--- with the Ninth?\\" and \\"I think that's Pict for 'f-- off'.\\"<br /><br />Secondly are several logic gaps. Etain (Olga Kurylenko in a non-speaking role) is a master tracker, but on two separate occasions, the soldiers are able to hide right under her nose. One of these times, they are actually quite literally right under her nose. They don't try to make any clever traps to pick off their pursuers like Pierce Brosnan's character does in [[ASIN:B000NOIVT0 Seraphim Falls]]. They mostly just run.<br /><br />Overall, it's an admirable film for being done on a paltry $10 million budget (by today's $200+ million Hollywood standards). It doesn't bring anything new to the table, but still enjoyable for fans of \\"sword-and-sandal\\" period films. If you enjoyed other survival/pursuit movies like [[ASIN:B000GRU0A2 Tears of the Sun]], and [[ASIN:B000WMA6QO Rescue Dawn]], you might like Centurion. Just don't think too hard. Enjoy!10.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|Excellent. One of the best movies I've ever seen. No need for special effects, just tell the story of a special person. There are a lot of neuro typicals out there who'll never contribute one iota to society even though they are normal. Good thing not every one is \\"normal\\".
0765350386|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was quite long, but didn't feel boring or overextended at all, instead using its length to explore a variety of different questions and issues raised by the plot.  Overall, it was a very satisfying read, though the ending felt a bit abrupt.  Overall, just a lot of book for your money.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Emma\\" and I think this book is Jane Austen's masterpiece.    I own two film versions of Emma.  The 1972 BBC version, which I thought was very close to the book.  Although the actor portraying John Knightly, John Carson, was 45 years of age and too old for the role.  Knightly was 37 in the book.  The actor portraying Mr. Woodhouse looked like he was on his death bed.  Too old and too fidgety.      And then there is the version with Gweneth Paltrow.  Beautiful scenery, beautiful homes.  They squeezed too much of the book into the film.  And then the cast, good grief.  Harriet Smith is 17 years old in the book, slender, short statured.  What were they thinking when they cast porky older Toni Collette in the role?  Paltrow is an American and her accent just drove me over the edge.  And what was she saying when she realized she loved Mr. Knightly \\"oh John oh John, how I love you.\\"  His name is George, George Knightly.  John is Emma's brother in law, not her love interest.  Good grief.    So, here we have the 2009 version and it is magnificent.  Simply superb.  Brilliant casting.  The actress who portrayed Miss Bates just nailed it.  Mr. Woodhouse is brilliantly portrayed and not like an idiot.  Mrs. Weston is shown in this movie pregnant, as she is in the book, unlike the other two movies.  The actress who portrayed Harriet Smith is appropriate for the role.    Romola Garai is Emma, that lovely flibbertygibit gad about.  Johnny Lee Miller is perfect as Mr. George Knightly whose love for Emma is on his face from the first frame.      Jane Austen said that no one would love Emma but herself.  Well, she was wrong.  And what would Jane Austen think about all these wonderful movies based on her masterpieces?  Thank goodness for Austen's genius.  Jane died too soon at the age of 42.  I wonder what other glorious creations would have come from her pen.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this cooler because my CPU was reaching dangerous temperatures while converting videos, as well as idling high in general. After installing this cooler, I am seeing a 5 to 10 degree drop in temperatures across the board. I am very impressed by this product and I would recommend it to anyone. One of the best features is the size, nearly every other high-end cooler on the market for socket 1366 is way too big to fit on my motherboard because of northbridge heatsinks being very close to the CPU mounting. I recommend buying a slightly quieter fan for the unit, but it is already pretty silent. I went with [[ASIN:B003WZT9IY Wing 12 PL 120mm PWM Fan Blue LED]] because I also wanted the blue LEDs to match my case.
0307474275|5.0|This book has everything you need.  Excitement, mystery, plot twists, and narrow escapes.  I definitely had to spend some time with Google while reading this book to keep track of what is real and what isn't.  Brown is a talented writer.
0061537969|2.0|Is this what guys are reading this summer?  A sentimental journey through car racing, talking dogs and most things bad that can happen to a guy.  He perseveres through it all - death of a spouse, temporary loss of a child, challenges of a career as a race car driver, unfounded charges of rape - with the help of wonder-dog Enzo.  Pleeeeze.  Yes, it was touching.  Yes, I read it all.  But good writing, NO.  Good plot, hardly.  Silly conceit, mediocre at best.  Buy it used, take it to the beach and leave it there.

After watching both, there was no discernible difference between them. Save your money and purchase The Collection. You get three movies for the price of one.
B003OJBWGK|4.0|Listening to the lyrics of this release the first thing that I thought of is this chick needs to get into therapy with Christopher Ownes from Girls.  At first listen both seem to suffer from serious relationship issues/ codependency.  But then I can't tell if Bethany Cosentino is seriously hung up on some guy she feels she needs to fill a void in her life, or like Owens is really distraught over a love that will never be.  Or maybe she's just playing the part of a love lorn chick who can't get the guy she thinks she really wants.  All that being said, the songs themselves are catchy, and the lyrics are extremely clever.  After a couple of weeks I still find it enjoyable listening to \\"Crazy for You\\" and then listening to Girls (Owens) \\"Album\\" and realizing my lot in life isn't as bad as I sometimes imagine it to be.  All things considered it's far and away a lot better than most of the stuff that's come out this summer.
B001DSNELK|4.0|The two GB movies look very good, good bonus features like extra GB cartoons,cards,slime,statue looks like it could break very easy so keep it away from the little ones and u have to keep the slime in a cool place or it will evaporate quickly.but overall good giftset.
142313494X|3.0|3.5 stars. I wanted to give it 4, but just couldn't do it.<br /><br />The opening chapters were very good. Gets right to the action and let's us know there's a lot more to come. I was all in until his mom and stepfather were introduced. Just too cliche. The fat, greasy no-good stepfather that plays poker and calls the protagonist a punk. The mother is a clone of Polly Purebred, the goody damsel in distress.<br /><br />Riordan's writing is tight and fast-paced and he kept me invested in the plot, so I looked past my disappointment in the parents. But then I really wished he hadn't used \\"half-blood\\" to described the half human/half god children since JK Rowlings universalized the term. I realize it's an appropriate description, but after reading it I couldn't stop seeing the parallels between this book and Harry Potter. It got distracting.<br /><br />But Riordan kept me in story. The ending was lukewarm. The parents resolution not all that satisfactory. Luke's attempt to kill Jackson with a scorpion reminded me of Austin Powers. Why not just rid of him?<br /><br />It felt like a middle grade book, and his target audience clearly loves it, so he succeeded without question. And that explains why his characters don't use any language beyond 'jerk' or 'punk'. At times, I thought the plot was getting interesting but then got very jokie-joke (like getting past Cerebus with a red ball). Rowlings managed to avoid this (sorry for the comparison, but 'half-blood' made me do it). She injected humor when appropriate and got serious when the plot needed it.<br /><br />Riordan is a good writer and he'll continue to succeed with his demographic.
B00012BSHG|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old and 10 month old to use as a ball pit for their playroom.  It is perfect!!!  I filled with about 600 balls, although we could have used less.  300-400 would be fine..  They love it, it's deep enough to keep all of the balls in and big enough so that I can go in with them!  We get lots of compliments on it.  So happy with the purchase!
B002HWRYJE|2.0|I was never a \\"trekkie\\" although I grew up watching the original Star Trek series and enjoyed the first 3 or 4 feature films such as The Wrath of Khan and The Voyage Home.  What they lacked in visual effects and technological savvy they more than made up for in story, pitch and character development.      Star Trek 2009 is not a \\"bad\\" movie.  There is a plot and the movie does involve the genesis of the original characters and how and why they found themselves together aboard the acclaimed USS Enterprise.  Unfortunately, the film focuses too little on these events and primarily concerns itself with action scenes and special effects.      Almost from the word GO the movie is about loud and noisy, although visually spectacular, battle scenes combined with exhausting, seemingly never ending brawls between the various characters.  In between, the plot is very difficult to follow.  There are several flash forwards accompanied by several flashbacks because the plot involves....you guessed it, a black hole involving time travel.  I was so busy trying to unravel the plot shifts that it wasn't until well after the movie ended that I came to the conclusion that the storyline was actually pretty clever.      Star Trek 2009 is all about fast, furious and visually entertaining and leaves little to the imagination.
0439023513|1.0|I thought this book would be great in the fact that it would hopefully do these three things:    -Resolve Gale/Peeta love triangle  -Resolve winner (e.g. Capitol, Rebels)  -Give Katniss a happy ending, PLEASE.    Although Suzanne Collins very effectively described how terrible being in a war would be, she did not make the book fun to read.  I guess what I mean is that when I read the first two books, they held a few key interests that kept me pulled in, and I still say the first two books are fantastic.  Katniss's love life in this book is almost nonexistent.  Katniss is not helpless at all in the first two books, I will even say she was absolutely kickass, but in this book she is, as Collins puts it, \\"mentally disoriented\\" in the entire book, not to mention the many times she gets herself hurt in her craziness, thus putting her in a hospital for a great portion of the book until the end.  Ah.  The end.  Why on God's earth would Prim have to die?  Isn't this book depressing enough without THAT little tidbit happening?  Along with Finnick dying, is there even a point other than to describe how terrible the situation Katniss is in?  Forgive me if I say that there isn't.  Don't get me wrong, sometimes tragedies are good.  In this case, I definitely think the opposite.  Back to the Peeta/Gale thing.  Gale is a war-obsessed temperamental die-hard soldier in this book which I find exciting but Katniss is far too \\"wounded\\" to care about Gale.  Then Peeta comes back just to torture Katniss because he has been \\"hijacked\\" meaning his brain is pretty much programmed to kill Katniss by Capitol peeps.  Bring on more \\"wounded\\"-ness.  And so Peeta doesn't even remember all the good stuff we've read about in the two previous books, bringing on a hearth of depression and a dearth of even the tiniest enjoyment.  The first two books had at least some happiness.  The ending again, was just a little bit bizarre.  Katniss votes for another Hunger Games, and then realizing she's stupid she shoots Coin before anyone finds out when she is supposed to shoot President Snow.  He then dies from laughing so hard at Katniss's silly notions.  Flashforward a bit, after Katniss is let out of her prison room she sings in like a lunatic for weeks and is sent to twelve for a life of woundedness with Haymitch and Peeta.  We don't even get to hear about Peeta and Katniss, let alone for one lousy paragraph, where she says she basically is with him because he understands and loves her, and she supposes she loves him too. Flashforward a bunch of years when she has 2 children and she talks about how they are playing in the meadow where all the people that died in the twelve bombing are buried.  What a fantastic ending.  I give this book a one, because for me it just didn't deliver the goods.  I realize this is pretty much a huge rant, but it's what I think.  Hope it helped you.    (By the way, I still give Suzanne Collins props for the first two, those were actually quite good.)
B001ILFUD2|4.0|For some reason, I have a feeling this was a copied product.  Other than that, it was perfect.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|It's hard to keep one's feet on the ground in the presence of great dance, unless one is like myself, suffering from a stubbed toe, athletes foot, and fat ankles.  So I sit, hoping one day it will be turn to kick-off the tevas, hop on the bar and show these two dancing maniacs who is in charge. They are, of course.  Hines and Baryshnikov have tapped their toes to the right beat in this bone shaker.  Let me tell you.  Intrique, Relationships, and a Dance Escape (!) are but some of the ways to pass the time inbetween the mad dash of choreography which can only be described as the next best thing to an evening with someone besides myself.  Kudos.  This comrade seeks asylum and is defecting to the nation of Dance!
B000GCFO0I|5.0|When this movie was released back in April 2006, I was more than thrilled to go see it. Although I'm a huge fan of the series at that time I didn't care if the movie would be bad or not, and when I say bad I mean on par with the Street Fighter movie bad. But thank goodness it turned out to be great. I even dragged my cousin, who is somewhat familiar with the game from watching me play during sleepovers, to the theater to see this with me.  She was grossed out, horrified, and stunned by the film, as was I.  It was pretty scary for me even for a movie adaption of the game.    Video-game fans are somewhat a hard crowd to please for the most part. The word 'adaption' means just that, it's not going to be the Silent Hill game rehashed bit by bit.  Why pay money for a movie when you already know what's going to happen?  I'm a fan of the series, but some just take their 'fandom' waaay too seriously.  It's a video-game movie, just be happy that sad sack director Uwe Boll(House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, Doom) didn't get his disgsting mitts on this project, then you'd really have something to bitch about.      Instead of the male protagonist we had in SH1, we're introduced to Rose(Radha Mitchell) who takes her adoptive daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, against the wishes of her husband, believing that somehow it will help flesh out the mystery of why Sharon is plagued by nightmares of the town.  It follows the main storyline of the first game and includes many canon characters from the game with the inclusion of many non-canon charcters.  I was not upset or perturbed by this by no means.  I thought it was an excellent idea on the director's part to mix and blend his ideas with what the series has already established.    Similar to the game, Rose and Sharon are involved in a car crash after racing to the town by taking a closed road, which alerts the concern of patrolling officer Cybil Bennet(canon) who attempts to stop her.  After an undetermined amount of time after the crash, Rose awakes in the fog laden town with ash falling from the sky...Sharon is no where in sight.  Thus, the movie really begins.    The film includes many key elements and characters from the series, but it isn't all copied from the game. The movie takes a life of its own, but it keeps the plot grounded to what the fans were familiar with from the game with the main goal of finding the missing daughter of the protagonist and hopefully escaping from the town.  There is some interesting back story about the origin of Sharon nostalgic to the Alessa/Cheryl/Heather element also.    I love how the director portrayed the town as like an alternate dimension/world disconnected yet still apart of the real world. We see this in the scenes involving Rose's husband and a detective who are in the real deserted town(due to the hazard of the coal fire burning underground) compared to Rose and Cybil who are trapped in 'alternate' Silent Hill.    I also love how this film, unlike the Resident Evil films(which I also like), has a lot of familiarity of the game such as locations like Midwich Elementary, Grand Hotel, and Alchemelia Hospital.  There are familiar characters and villians, along with the music from Akira Yamaoka. I don't care if the movie wasn't an exact replica of the game or not, because that's not what I wanted, I just wanted a movie with solid acting, good scares, and an engaging plot.  This movie delivered that to me and I have no complaints, save for a few...    Christopers Gans took some risks by including the fan favorite Pyramid Head in the film.  The movie follows the plotline of SH1, PH is from SH2 and many fans debate that this villian is somehow manifested in the main character's mind from SH2, and I agree, but I believe PH was added to the film for fanservice.    There are many memorable and great scenes from the movie and I was surprised at how great the monsters looked without looking overly cheesy or unrealistic.  There is a fair amount of blood and gore scenes in the movie that are just as disturbing as the content from the game.  It's a great 'adaption' for the series and I belive many people who are not familiar with the video games will enjoy this film if they are fans of horror.    The ending is a bit of a mystery and it may leave many viewers confused or open up more doors of theorizing about what really happened...

B002ZG974M|5.0|This is not only a very interesting movie, it is entertaining, cute, funny and very enjoyable! As a Mother it is very interesting to see the different ways children are cared for by Mother's of other cultures and the similarities we all have across cultures:) My daughter will be 3 at the end of September and we rented it from On Demand through FIOS and she absolutely ADORES it! We ran up the bill a bit re-renting it for her and I finally had to tell her (after 3 times) that that was enough for now. She asks for this movie EVERY DAY! I am preordering it! It just so happens her birthday is September 29th, the day after it's released so I'll include it in her presents (she already has a lovely bunch I've ordered...Yes, I tend to do things early:) My daughter will watch this movie over and over as many children do when they have a new movie they love and of all the movies that she has done that with, this movie I don't mind watching twice in a row. There's not a lot of dialog except for what is said by the parents to their children in their language (one of the babies is from the USA). It's filmed as if they have no knowledge of the camereas being there and they are just going about their daily routine naturally which is part of the appeal of this movie. I give it an A+! It was very well done! Plus, those babies are pretty funny at times:) My daughter said that she would like you to know that she \\"LOVES Babies!!!!\\" :) She insisted I add that into the review:) Enjoy!
0691142165|1.0|This Time is Different features sloppy research which is most visible in Table 2.3 where the the refundings of Consols the British nation  at par are listed (incorrectly) as defaults. The right of the British government to refund Consols at par was always reflected in their prices. Five percent Consols were priced in the 1700s to have higher yields then Thre Percent Consols which reflected the greater vulnerability of Five Percent Consols to refunding.       Another howler - he largest domestic default in US History-the voiding of the Gold Clause in US government bonds by the Roosevelt Administration in 1933  is represented in this account only by  default in 1933 by the US on its treaty obligations to Panama-which is listed as a \\"domestic default\\" Panama was then (at least de jure) an independant country.
0345479092|2.0|It has some good points, tips and guidelines, but some significant concerns as well.     Throughout the book she reminds the reader to view your baby as a person. Talk to your baby as a person, by his name, with respect. Treat your child as you would any older person - warn him before doing something that would startle him, talk him through stuff, listen to his concerns (cries), etc. It is really beautiful to see her respect for the dignity of the child, and both humor-full and enlightening to have her give words to a child's cry.     She also gives a guide regarding typical signals and what they often mean. Some of these I find overly obvious, and others terribly inaccurate : eye-redness for Regina has always been a potty sign, never tiredness. She also describes different types of cries to help you try to distinguish what different cries indicate. For someone like myself who practices infant pottying (which she doesn't touch at all) and has actively tried to discern different cries from the day she was born, this is not new, but for someone unfamiliar with doing this it could be helpful.     Personality type is also discussed - she gives five classifications of babies - textbook, angel, grumpy, spirited, and touchy. According to her Regina would be considered touchy or spirited - I really wonder what this woman would have done with her in her earlier, more difficult days.   Identifying that your baby is a certain type may help one to be more understanding of a fussy baby - she compares a \\"grumpy\\" baby to an old grandpa who complains about every little thing. He is annoying sometimes, but you just have to laugh and how particular he is. She mentions the standard guidelines of when crying may be too much and there may be something wrong, but doesn't go any deeper into the possibility of allergy, chiropractic, or other physical causes of discomfort.     The author describes plans for how to help baby follow a loose schedule for both baby's contentment and mom's peaceand rest, and a guide for helping baby to sleep on her own without doing any cry-it-out routine. She is firm that strict routines will cause as much problems as having no routine at all, but prescribes having a routine for solving all sorts of ailments. She frowns heavily on co-sleeping, and miss-explains the theories of Dr. Sears and beliefs of people who encourage co-sleeping, and then disregards them in one swoop. Her suggestions of a routine to help ease baby into sleeping time are not worthless in my opinion and not dissimilar from what I have done with Regina (who does not like bedtime!) and thinking about the stages of sleep and the encouragement to be patient are certainly worthwhile.     Regarding breastfeeding, she seems to be supportive of it, but despite a year 2000 authorship, she somehow maintains that formula is just as good, and repeatedly mentions the difficulties of breastfeeding even as she encourages it. She does urge single-side feeding, which is wonderful to hear when the poor guidance of \\"10 minutes each side\\" is still rampant. I do like that she encourages the reader to not just stick a pacifier or a breast in the babies mouth with every cry, but rather to listen to the cry and the physical signals first to discern what baby's real need is. This is more respectful of the baby and sets one up for better communication over the long run as both parent and child are not used to just shutting needs up with a prop, but actively seeking to fill needs.     My biggest frustration is that she indicates over and over that what is learned as a pattern is very difficult to change. For example, she seems to think that if you sleep with your baby from the beginning, then your baby will still be sleeping with you when he is two or three. Then at the same time she advertises her ability to help you change \\"bad\\" habits in three days! If you can change habits in three days, then why couldn't you nurse baby to sleep in the early months, and transition her to falling asleep on her own later? Regina hated to be horizontal for any length of time when she was an infant, probably because of colic brought on by food sensitivities, and I honestly think that if the author had come to my home to help me \\"correct bad habits\\" she would have given up or let Regina scream a lot. She doesn't condemn attachment parenting, but seems to indicate that it is an automatic recipe for chaos, frustration, and an unhappy family. However, she does steer the reader away from treating the child as a product and using a lot of gadgets and distractions so that the mother and father can \\"get on with their life.\\"    Overall, I appreciate her fairly balanced view and suggestions. She helps one see how you can guide your baby into habits that will help make the family more contented, without a lot of crying and difficulties. She promotes unity and balance between the parents, and helps one differentiate between being attentive and jumping at every sound.
0375851569|5.0|This set of Seuss Beginner Books has become my favorite gift to give at baby showers. I distinctly remember opening my first reader (Hop on Pop!) when I was about 4 years old, and I began reading these gems to my own son from the time he was an infant.

If you want to revisit your own childhood, get this set! You will smile!
0439023513|4.0|Read the book, read the reviews, make a decision for yourself. Am I tired of the ravages and horror of war? Yes.  Have I seen firsthand what it can do to those I love? Yes. Do I love the Hunger Game series? Yes.     Katniss is seventeen years old.  Her whole life has been a struggle to survive and keep her family safe.  She started this struggle to save one person her sister. In the end, she helped to save thousands at a price no person should have to pay.     Teenagers welcome to the world of war. This isn't a video game where you shoot, steal, ravage and destroy without really caring about the characters who come and go, where it's all about winning. This book places you in the midst of battle and you won't come out unscathed or even whole.    Teens hate being preached too and it's my impression that's not what's happening here. Readers were being asked to wake up their imaginations and see the price being paid for having control and misusing it. Katniss and Peeta have helped to bring a halt to the Hunger Games but at a price.  They are separated, Katniss trying to recover in a hospital in District 13, hiding under ground, be used much like a mascot for a war she wanted no part of. Peeta left in the hands of a torturous dictator, brainwashed to believe the worst of a girl he for which he would have once given his life.  Their world destroyed by adults, controlled by adults, but where children and teens must pay to ultimate price, to preserve what little the majority of the population has left.      Teenagers want control and Suzanne Collins gives it to them through her main characters, but she also points out that when you are in control the decisions don't come easy and the price is high. Katniss, Gale, Peeta and the others, didn't start it, but now they have to find a way to stop it. It may be a work of fiction, but it felt all too real in cost of human lives and emotions as I read it.  Reading isn't always about being entertained, there are times when reading should also make us think, question and search for answers.
B0000024IE|1.0|Funny that there's an advisory label on the cover but they beep out the cuss words on Fight the Power.  Wish I knew this before I bought the CD.
0307454541|3.0|My mother, who is Swedish, read this in the original language and highly recommended it. There's an awful lot of Swedish culture and language that doesn't translate easily or exactly ... which certainly hinders the book for an American audience.<br /><br />That said, it reads like a first novel (and for a very good reason: it is).  \\"Clunky\\" comes to mind.  Plot threads are introduced and then just ... dangle (Lisabeth's tatooed Advokat comes to mind). The story bounces awkwardly between murder mystery and political screed, with the murder mystery being wrapped up several chapters before the other stuff gets hastily wrapped up.  The protagonist is just too suave with the ladies, and it doesn't help that he's very clearly a stand-in for the author, making the book read more like a middle-aged guy's fantasy.  Worst, though, is the unrelenting brutality, almost all of it directed at the female characters.  The  Swedish title \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" was quite apt.<br /><br />Had the author lived to be able to work with a good editor, this book would have been so much better.<br /><br />As disappointed as I am with the novel (I won't be reading the rest of the trilogy unless under duress)  I still have this odd hankering for an open-faced herring and pickle sandwich on rye bread.....
B003OFHMKO|5.0|I love the concept of this album. It presents a maturity and yet has the vibrancy you'd expect from a young artist. Jazz artists like her and Christian Scott ([[ASIN:B002ZCWA9A Yesterday You Said Tomorrow]]), who are both associated with the Berklee College of Music in Boston, makes things bright for contemporary jazz music further into the 21st century. If you are considering this album without first having and listening to her previous albums, check out [[ASIN:B0014HC56K Esperanza]] and her debut [[ASIN:B000F0H4R2 Junjo]]. Hopefully she'll get award attention and further success with this album.    Added Sept. 3: I just saw a performance by Esperanza on PBS Austin City Limits and she was AMAZING! A recording does not do this girl justice. I really hope to catch a live performance if she comes to Ohio.
B003IY48PS|5.0|There have been tons of horror movies released over the years. Many critics have noted that the horror films run in cycles with the original films eventually downplayed to comic status (note the original FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA found there way to pairings with Abbott and Costello). That all changed during the 80s when horror films became more of a mainstream favorite and home video took off. Now horror films are playing nearly all the time in theaters.<br /><br />But even those movies don't always elicit fan devotion or repeated viewings. Sure many people have favorites but a true classic stands the test of time and continues to offer goose bumps and nightmare ideas repeatedly. Such is the case with the Sam Raimi directed EVIL DEAD.<br /><br />Released in 1985 (though credits often cite the release date as 1981), the film was a terrifying experience in a theater. I know, that's where I first saw it. The film was released through Thorn/EMI back in the 80s on home video and then bounced around until it ended up at Anchor Bay a few years back. Then Anchor Bay made it one of their staples releasing numerous incantations of the title, everything from special edition boxed sets to bound in the Book of the Dead cover (a main icon of the movie). Finally they've released the film on blu-ray. So is it worth going out and buying the new edition if you own one of the umpteen other ones? The answer is yes.<br /><br />Let's get one thing out of the way first. The synopsis for those who haven't seen one of the many versions. The story revolves around two couples and a sister of one of the guys heading out to the country to enjoy a nice peaceful weekend. Scott (Richard Demanincor) is dating Shelly (Theresa Tilly), Ash (Bruce Campbell who also co-produced) is dating Linda (Betsy Baker) and Ash's sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) is along for the trip.<br /><br />The five head to the secluded cabin that can only be reached by crossing a dangerously outdated bridge. Once they arrive at the cabin they work on cleaning it up and trying to settle in, unaware of the evil that resides there. It's not until the cellar door tosses itself open and the look in the cellar that things begin to change. They come across an old tape player and a strange looking book that they discover is the Book of the Dead. The house had belonged to an archeologist who had discovered the book and only realized too late that it contained a pathway for demons.<br /><br />So what do they do? Why of course they play the tape that recites an incantation that releases the demons, the first of which eventually possesses Ash's sister Cheryl. But not until after she investigates some noises outside only to be grabbed by wild vines and raped by a tree branch. To this day this scene is still disturbing though not as graphic as many films released today.<br /><br />The night proceeds and each of the cabin dwellers finds themselves attacked or possessed with only Ash tormented from beginning to end and never taken over. The film offers tons of gooey gore, slashed limbs, stabbings, gunshots and oozing gruesome goodies for fans but by today's standards...well yeah it's still pretty extreme at times. So much so that when originally released, the film was attacked in Britain and placed on the notorious \\"Video Nasties\\" list for films that were banned.<br /><br />While watching this film I was listening to the new voice over track that features commentary by director Sam Raimi (who later directed the SPIDER MAN movies), Rob Tapert (who went on to produce TV series like XENA and HERCULES as well as most of Raimi's movies) and Bruce Campbell (who went on to star in TV series like BRISCO COUNTY JR and can currently be seen in BURN NOTICE), but in the background I watched the film. Having seen it numerous times I knew what was going on and wanted to hear the new commentary (which was great focusing on how they got the movie made). The thing I noticed while watching was that the movie still held up. It was still a frightening film. I could see that this movie would induce nightmares in younger viewers and perhaps even in some of the older one. It is still one scary flick.<br /><br />And that's why it stands the test of time. That's why even after 25 years the movie is still an experience that will frighten most movie goers. Even sitting in your living room with the TV going it will be a scary movie with certain scenes that will elicit screams. There are few movies that leave images in your brain that you remember later and this is one.<br /><br />One thing that helps I think is that the acting seems pretty good for a group of first timers or actors who had done so little. These people are believable in their roles and that makes the movie that more believable, even when you have severed limbs crawling or demons running rampant. All do a great job and its sad that of those involved on Campbell has gone on to more recognizable roles.<br /><br />So as for the film itself, yes, it is one scary horror film and deserves to be watched over and over again. It won't make a difference how many times you watch; it will remain scary and give you the creeps time and time again. And that's the sure fire test of whether a movie is worth buying or not, if you can watch it again and again.<br /><br />So what does this new blu-ray disc offer? Well first off Raimi supervised the reconstruction of the film from original prints giving you a great 1080p HD transfer. Kind of amazing seeing as how the film was shot on 16mm back in the early 80s. It also offers a choice of aspect ratios to watch it in, either a 1.85 ratio or a 1.33 ratio, both featuring Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio as well as the commentary track I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />A second disc in the set offers some interesting things as well. The usual cover art/set photos are there for one. It also features some featurettes that have been available in past editions but are now brought together here. These include ONE BY ONE WE WILL TAKE YOU:THE UNTOLD SAGA OF THE EVIL DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD:TREASURES FROM THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR, THE LADIES OF THE EVIL DEAD MEET BRUCE CAMPBELL, BOOK OF THE DEAD:THE OTHER PAGES, DISCOVERING THE EVIL DEAD, UNCONVENTIONAL and AT THE DRIVE IN. Of these extras, THE LADIES..., UNCONVENTIONAL and DRIVE IN were all made in part a few years back at the Flashback convention held in Chicago where the cast reunited for the first time since making the movie. The three female leads continue to tour the convention circuit now and then under the Ladies of title thrilling fans.<br /><br />So there you have it. A run down on a truly classic fright flick that is bound to give you scares. But make sure you watch it in the dark for full effect. And if you think that watching a scary film like this is made better by seeing it with a crowd in a darkened theater AND if you are lucky enough, it is making the rounds to theaters across the country again for midnight screenings. For die hard fans (sorry if you read this after the date listed) make a point of going to Dixon, IL,  where Flashback is having another celebration of the film and star Bruce Campbell at the Midway Drive In on September 10th and 11th. Campbell will be there as they screen THEY CALL ME BRUCE, THE EVIL DEAD and its two sequels.

0385512058|2.0|I've never met Keith Ferrazzi. However, after reading this book my guess is that you have and that the two of you speak on a regular basis.  Ferrazzi leaves an impression that it's possible to connect with nearly every human being on earth - well, at least the important ones.<br /><br />Maybe it's my Midwestern sensibilities, but I don't know that I'd like Mr. Ferrazzi if I were to actually meet him (and again - this will apparently happen at some point during my life at the rate he's going).  He comes across as a glad handing, baby kissing, socialite who flits from one high powered community gathering to another and claims to have a great time every step along the way.<br /><br />I don't doubt that he is having a great time.  What I fear is that for 99% of the population, emulating every move that he makes will set you up for a lifetime of misery.  He says he's up at 4am in California so he can start calling people on the east coast and keeps it up with 100s of calls throughout the day. Emailing from his car, taxi, train, or airplane.  Hosting dinner parties constantly.  Constructing a strategy for meeting people at conferences.  I don't doubt that these things work.  I just doubt that any person whose goals don't include being a CEO, governor, or president can do what he does and not hate their life after a few weeks.<br /><br />All that being said, I think that a lot of the information in the book is great and applicable to everybody.  Being bold, mastering small talk, and getting involved in groups that you're passionate about are bound to bring you into contact with people who genuinely care about you and the goals that you have.<br /><br />Overall, if you want to land yourself in a high-powered job and are willing to do whatever it takes to get you there, you'll love this book.  If you just want to expand your network a bit and have an enjoyable time doing it, this book might push you over the edge.
1401302378|5.0|I'm not a newcomer to technology. I spend hours a day on the web so I canceled my newspaper subscription after 30 years, my girlfriend and I get our music online, shop online, we stream Netflix and other clips from the computer through the HDMI cable to the... You get the picture. But reading this book was like discovering an anatomy book back in Paracelsus's time. Even though I've been predicting some of these phenomena for years -- like the demise of newspapers, traditional movie theaters, the big three networks -- it took Chris Anderson to put it all in perspective for me. Why didn't I read this book when it came out? Could've made a killing in the stock market (before I probably would've lost it in the last downturn).    For example, his account of how libraries inefficiently catalog books vs. Amazon's methods had me smiling and nagging my girlfriend so I could read her sections. It's almost worth the price of the book alone. Yes, some ideas are brought up more than once, but there are so many \\"ah-hah!\\" moments in this book, it has become like a page-turning thriller. Makes me want to get the updated version for sure. And I've already started \\"Free.\\"    Highly recommended for anyone who'd like to see what forest we're currently navigating.

B004132HZS|4.0|Sherlock Holmes....makes brainy sexy.  Sure he's a self described \\"high functioning sociopath\\", with no people skills; but he's brilliant, driven and dresses wonderfully.  Dr. John Watson is not a patsy (not a sidekick - he's a partner); sharp, wry, worldly man of action who tolerates Sherlock's idiosyncrasies because he misses the adrenaline edge of combat and seeks meaning in a life after war.  They are evenly matched although Sherlock draws the attention and enmity of their foes - Watson is a good second.<br /><br />The writing is engaging, cheeky, smart and fast paced. It rolls current technology into the stream of consciousness.  The looks of awe when Sherlock figures it out - and his amusement when he learns he's alone are priceless.  The cinematography, costumes, lighting and use of text overlays to move the story along are well placed and impressive on their own.<br /><br />But the intelligence of the show is its presumption in the interest of the watcher; therefore moving with alacrity, flexibility and certain undefinable element of charm missing from many US shows (the brilliant but cancelled Life with Damian Lewis excluded).  I'm a US viewer lucky enough to have a friend in the UK - but this show should gain followers worldwide with the power to draw from the past literary works and latch onto the current to slingshot us into the future of TV - for thinking people.

B002VR9QY6|5.0|This DVD preserves a performance by the Dutch National Ballet that took place in February 2009. Their Giselle was then a new production by Rachel Beaujean und Riccardo Bustamante (and considering that such productions usually stay in the repertory for a long time, it is still very new). The beautiful designs by Toer van Schayk look like 19th century paintings with their careful choice of colour and use of light. The painted backdrop for the first act shows the Rhine (in particular, the region between Bonn and Koblenz where there are hills and castles on both sides), a river that was a source of inspiration for romantic poets and travelers.<br />Although the stage designs are quite detailed (Giselle's hut has a gate), the Amsterdam stage itself is so spacious it never looks cluttered.  The two sides of the Romantic era are conveyed exemplarily as the first act looks warm, sunny and folksy whereas the second act is closer to the dark, gothic atmosphere of some of Heinrich Heine's poetry. I especially liked the first entrance of the wilis and the way they form a circle around Myrtha like a sinister sisterhood, supported by very effective positioning of the camera somewhere high up. The wilis here also keep on their veils longer, which adds to the ghostly, spectral atmosphere.<br />If you have seen other performances of this ballet you will probably notice that in the first act there is a peasant pas de quatre and not a pas de deux like they have in Paris and Milan, or a pas de six (Royal Ballet). It gives more than two dancers the chance to shine  and supports the idea of the village being a community, thus plausibly dealing with the problem that I always thought comes up when there is a Peasant Pas de Deux: who are these people and why do they dance this divertissement. (The Peasant Pas de Deux with music by Friedrich Burgm&uuml;ller was interpolated into the first act before the ballet's original premiere for a ballerina who was the mistress of an influential patron of the Paris Op&eacute;ra.) I love the \\"flute\\" variation danced by the second female dancer in the pas de quatre and would have liked to know if that piece is also by Burgm&uuml;ller.<br />Another important piece of additional choreography is the new solo for Albrecht towards the end of the first act, which he dances immediately before Giselle's own variation. The music for Albrecht's solo is taken from another ballet by Adolphe Adam, Le Diable &agrave; Quatre.<br />Hilarion in this production is a young man close in age to Giselle who is passionately in love with her - when Albrecht attacks him after Giselle has died, he doesn't try to defend himself. He reminds me of the protagonist in Schubert's \\"Die Sch&ouml;ne M&uuml;llerin\\" or the Romantic rural figures in the works of Joseph Eichendorff, whereas Albrecht with his split identity maybe is a more modern character.<br />The DVD has an Extra consisting of interviews with the lead dancers Anna Tsygankova (Giselle), Jozef Varga (Albrecht), Igone de Jongh (Myrtha) and Jan Zerer (Hilarion) as well as with Rachel Beaujean and Riccardo Bustamante. They tell us their opinions about their respective characters in the ballet. Is Albrecht a cad? Jozef Varga thinks he isn't. He plays him as being genuinely in love with Giselle, but also as someone who as an aristocrat \\"never had to do anything like work, never had to lift a bench\\" and therefore is a stranger in the village community who watches people and their customs from a certain distance. I wish ballet conventions would leave more room to develop such things.is Opéra.)

0545123283|4.0|Well I was anxiously anticipating Linger and I will say that for the most part, it was worth the wait. The thing I loved most about Shiver was Sam and Grace's undeniable connection but from Linger we find ourselves in the throes of a love triangle. Really, I'm quite tired of those! I would like to see a book where people fall in love and that's just it...they're happy and in love, they face conflict of course, come through it and are better than ever. Why does there always have to be a love triangle, grrr. Aside from that, it's nice to see Sam human again even though somewhere in the back of your mind you can only think that it's surely going to be short lived. But all in all this was an enjoyable read and I definitely look forward to the last and final installment, Forever.

B002ZHKZEM|5.0|It was inevitable that David Tennant had to leave Doctor Who.  After all, part of the character's history has been the regenerations which allow the character to become another person (As well as allow for the actor playing The Doctor to be replaced).  So the time came for Tennant--wildly popular in the role, and greatly responsible for reenergizing the character--to go, but BBC and Russell T. Davies couldn't evolve Tennant into Matt Smith without a fond and warm farewell.  Which seems the purpose of the five specials.  I don't see the post-series specials--I know some complained that \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" from Series 2, \\"The Runaway Bride\\" from Series 3, and \\"The Voyage Of The Damned\\" from Series 4 weren't in this collection, but those were all more separate one-offs--as standing on their own as much as I saw them as being comparable to the \\"Torchwood: Children Of Earth\\" mini-series.  To me, the five episodes of this set had the obvious undertone of preparing for the regeneration--\\"The ending of The Doctor's Song\\" as the Ood put it in \\"The End Of Time, Part I\\"--but also (Obviously) wanting to send Tennant out on a heroic and sad note.  This is why--for the most part--David doesn't have a constant Companion throughout these episodes.  These episodes also show that our favorite TimeLord isn't as infallible as we usually believe him to be--otherwise, he would have realized immediately in \\"The Two Doctors\\" that David Morrisey's \\"Doctor\\" isn't who/what he assumed him to be (Specifically, a future version of himself).  Or the final sadness of \\"The Waters Of Mars\\", in which The Doctor chooses to interfere with the time stream...and things do not quite work out the way he believed that they would.<br />  But overall, this is a fun and good set of episodes in which Tennant gets to say goodbye to a character which made him internationally known (Or at least very well known stateside).  \\"The Two Doctors\\"--which brings back the Cybermen--is a raucous romp, what with Morrissey's \\"Doctor\\" being there...and not quite being there.<br />\\"The Planet Of The Dead\\" introduces Michelle Ryan's Lady Christina de Souza--note to Steven Moffatt, here.  Steve, here's a recurring character.  You didn't bring her back in Series 5--fine.  Find a place for her in Series 6, please.  \\"The Waters Of Mars\\" is notable because of Lindsay Duncan's tortured performance as Adelaide Brooke is heartwrenching...and sets the table for \\"The End Of Time\\".<br />  The two-parter that concludes the David Tennant era is as it should be--an epic tale that brings back The Master; and this time, John Simm is brilliantly unhinged...but ends up getting trumped by Timothy Dalton's raging, expectorating Lord President when the TimeLords return to bring Gallifrey--the homeworld of The Doctor and The Master--back into existence.  Bernard Cribbins is wonderful as Wilfred Mott--Donna Noble's grandfather, and the keeper of Donna's experiences with The Doctor.  He is loyal and sees The Doctor as a true hero--even when he becomes responsible for what The Doctor MUST do in the aftermath of (Once again) saving the planet...it is a shame that Catherine Tate feels somewhat wasted in this story, however.  Privately, there have to be a lot of Whophiles out there who somehow and someway want the Donna we had throughout Series 4 back...but it is a nice touch that the way that he met Donna is the way that he leaves Donna--in a wedding dress.<br />  The last 10 to 15 minutes of \\"The End Of Time, Part 2\\" are heart-wrenching; what with The Doctor saying good-bye to those he spent the last four-plus years with--Mickey and Martha (Anyone want to bet that we'll see Mr. and Mrs. Smith on \\"Torchwood\\"?).  Luke and Sarah Jane.  Captain Jack and Alonzo Frame (Before anyone mentions Alonzo joining Torchwood, remember that Russell Tovey has \\"Being Human\\" issues).  Donna, Wilf and Sylvia Noble.<br />  And finally, Rose.<br />  In the end, we can't ask Matt Smith to replace or replicate what David Tennant didwith his Tenth Doctor.  What we end up asking for is for Matt to add to the legacy of the character...because David CERTAINLY did.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|I am based in London, UK. Our Shield box set comes in a cardboard box with file type folders which house the DVDs. this didnt look like a good way to store the discs but the main problem over here is that one of the episodes is missing 20 or so minutes due to international cuts so any fan of the show should stick with the US set...     So I bought this US box set when it was on the Amazon Deal of the Day and even though I was nervous about the amount of reviews there where about packaging problems it was UNCUT so I thought id take my chances.     I recieved the item quickly and paid no cutom charge so this was an absolute steal at £38($59)    Apart from the actual box set being a bit oversized - it is one of the best box sets I own. All the dvds are housed within the thick pages of this coffee book style packaging with each page displaying photos and images which relate to the characters of the show, and they are all wrapped in white glossy paper to avoid scratching.     I would recomened this set to anyone as it is a great set for one of the best shows ever made.

I enjoyed having the Collector's Edition with alternate endings, and scenes that were not in the original movie, which are only available with this special edition.

I finally was told that this movie was \\"retired\\", imagine my surprise! I got this movie pack for a very reasonable price from a seller who shipped this item very fast and in great condition. My son would recommend the movie and I would recommend the seller of this item. Both were great in their own way!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Remember when you got to book 3 or 4 of the Harry Potter series and he got really whiny and cranky and Dumbledorf wouldn't talk to him and he thought everyone was out to get him?  Well, in Hunger Games Book 3, she gets very whiny and cranky -- not that she doesn't have her reasons.  She's suffering from post-traumatic stress and has a whopper of a head injury and one of her true loves, the one who kept her alive during the first 2 books, is in the hands of evil doers, but she spends an enormous amount of time in this book cowering in closets, weeping.  And I just found it a little unbelievable that grown up adults who had been so mistreated and enslaved by the evil doers and watched their children die year after year would need a 17 year old in a really fabulously designed uniform to rally them to rise up against said evil doers.    Cowering in the closet is just not as compelling as fighting for your survival.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Might be the most intelligent and \\"real-world\\" vampire movie ever made. The other reviews are right--watch it with the \\"English-theatrical\\" subtitles.     It feels Swedish. The style and pacing are different than most American movies, so take it on its own terms and enjoy the difference. Hollywood is of course busy re-doing it, and may give us either an abomination or something decent, but I doubt it will come anywhere close to the original. I think this movie is just about perfect.    Unlike some of the other translated versions, the English title has the same meaning as the original Swedish one, and you can think about that title from the perspective of either Eli or Oskar.      It's a horror movie, a character study, a friendship and coming-of-age movie. It's about innocence, freedom, wisdom, cynicism, redemption, and prices to be paid. Oh, and it's a hell of a love story, too.      Loved it.

Yes it was hard to install...but the worst part is that the protection is not designed for the iphone 4.  the front protector is too big...so if you position it on the home button..it will cover the front camera as well as the speaker...and go over the phone...  so definitively not the good item to buy if you want to protect your phone...and still be able to listen to the people calling you.
B000005IU1|5.0|I don't have alot to say about this album, I'm out of words, but I will try to write some.  In my opinion, every Stooges album affected another genre.  The Stooges-The early birth of Punk Rock. You still can't excatly hear it's a Punk Rock album, but Punk Rock started here. In this album, the Stooges sounds a bit like the Rolling Stones, in my opinion. It's also a 60' sound album, but it's not a Beatles sound (Pop), it's more like a Rolling Stones sound (as I said before).  Funhouse-In Funhouse, you can hear the Punk Rock. This album is more aggresive and crazier than the first one. I think that this is the album that affected the Ramones the most.  Raw Power-This album is Punk Rock, but you can hear that it's a Grunge album. Something in the sound of the guitars and everything together makes it sounds a bit like Grunge. It's amazing that a music like this existed in the early 70'.    But debut was the one that started it all.  The guitar sound, the riffs and solos are awesome! Ron Asheton is a great guitar player.  You must buy it, but buy the version without the Remastering!
B00003CXCD|5.0|ROMAN HOLIDAY is a spectacularly romantic, wonderfully well-acted movie.  It is styled a \\"comedy\\", but could also be a styled a tragedy.  It is the story of Princess Ann, (AUDREY HEPBURN), from an un-named European country, (always called \\"her country\\" in the movie), who finds her duties boring and irksome in the extreme.  (The beginning scenes, wherein the Princess loses her shoe, and is forced to dance with perhaps the most boring selection of fictional diplomats ever assembled for any movie -- are priceless!) Finally, in the early evening hours, she finds a way to sneak out of her country's embassy, (where she is sting during a good will visit to Rome), and see the \\"real\\" world.....    A naive, (but intelligent) Princess, finding her way into the \\"real\\" world for the first time, could have wound up in a lot of trouble.  She had no money with her, (royalty never carries money -- leaving that to underlings to do), and to top things off, she had been given a sleeping potion, the delayed action of which starts to work just as she hops off the truck that took her out of the embassy, and finds a seat near a Roman fountain.  Kidnapping, white slavery, ransom holding....any number of terrible things might have come to the runaway princes -- but, (luckily!), she is found by American newsman-in-Rome, Joe Bradley, (GREGORY PECK), who, after some deliberation, takes her to his small apartment to shelter for the night.  Joe is preplexed by this beautiful girl's seeming contradictions, (she is well-dressed, well-educated -- yet he found her on the streets alone).  Later, going to his boss, he discovers, (from a newspaper story of the Princess's sudden \\"illness\\" -- and the photo that accompanies it), that the girl he has found is actualy the \\"ill\\" princess, (the \\"illness\\" obviously being a cover story, to explain her disappearance from a group interview she was supposed to give the press earlier in the day.)  Smelling an exclusive -- and a way to get out of Rome, and back to where he wants to be, (New York City), Joe calls up his photographer-friend, Irving Radovitch, (EDDIE ALBERT), and the two of them make plans for \\"the story of the year\\" -- if not the decade, about the REAL Princess Ann, disclosing her innermost secrets and desires.....    The princess meets Joe's rather insensed landlady, a kindly barber, some street vendors, dances at a local festival -- and has a fateful meeting with some \\"men in black\\" from her country.  As these events go on, she and Joe find they are beginning to care very much for each other.........    Cary Grant was orignally supposed to play the part of Joe Bradley, and many people seem to think he would have been perfect for it.  I must strongly disagree.  Mr. Grant -- whatever type of person he was in real life -- had a screen persona of the very slightest rakish kind.  Gregory Peck, however, had a screen persona of, (usually), total and complete integrity -- and I feel that this is what was needed in the role of Joe Bradley, a newspaperman longing to go back home, desperately needing the funds to do so, but who finds that he simply cannot do so, for to earn this money, he would have to betray the woman he has come to love, and love very much....  For me, Gregory Peck -- later the sterling \\"Atticus Finch\\" of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', and the stalwart hero of so many other films -- fit the role of 'Joe Bradley', to a tee.  A role-model for all men to look up to, (and all women to swoon over! -- sigh!)    It is said that this movie was inspired by the tragic Princess Margaret-Peter Townsend affair.   Also, it is said that this movie  was John F. Kennedy's favourite film, and it is easy to see why.  His first true love was the beautiful actress, GENE TIERNEY.  As both were rich, beautiful, and Catholic, one would think it would be a match of which both families would approve.  Unhappily, Ms. Tierney's family, (very conservative French Catholics), did not think that Mr. Kennedy, (Irish-Catholic), was good enough for her (!), and so they had to part.  In a much later interview, (near the end of her life), on the Phil Donahue show, Ms. Hepburn was asked which of her movies was her favourite.  \\"Roman Holiday\\", she said without hesitation, and the audience seemed to agree with her.  This exchange was edited out of the later showings of this program -- and I cannot think why. \\"Roman Holiday\\" WAS Audrey Hepburn at her luminous, and most beautiful best.  One could say she was BORN to play this role, as she was, in actuality, the daughter of a Belgian baroness.  Many, many  people agree that this is Audrey Hepburn's best movie.  I am one of them!
B003097A9W|5.0|This edition is an \\"official\\" issue, with the \\"Rhino/Atco/Warner Music\\" logo, though it is manufactured in Europe. Based on that, it is likely an exact clone of Rhino's most recent remasters from original sources. It is a very compact slipcase (thin cardboard) containing five separate \\"LP Cover\\" thin cardboard sleeves with the original LP front and back covers. There is no additional booklet, but you can always buy a separate book on Otis if you need that. At the $18 I paid on Amazon marketplace for a new copy, it is a great bargain.

0307454541|2.0|This entire review may be full of spoilers, so if you're not interested in learning certain components of the plot that would spoil the story for you, read no further. Needless to say, I found this book (and the whole series of \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" books) overrated, verbose, and so detail-oriented and in needing of an editor who could cut them down in half their size, as to be hard to justify investing your time in them.<br /><br />Let's start with the plot, since any good story relies on a good plot. Especially a story that's centered on a mystery -- what happened to the girl?<br /><br />Now, I'm not sure what the statistics are in Sweden, but in America, a normal investigator might turn his or her eye to the idea that an unhappy teenager might be more likely to run away because of deep, dark family secrets, than to be murdered. And if you're running away from your family, isn't it likely you'd want nothing to do with any of them ever again?<br /><br />It's a plot hole you can drive a truck through. And one I recognized immediately after the so-called mystery began. Of course she's not dead -- she just ran away. Why? Well, gee, bad family. Mystery solved (I wanted you about those spoilers).<br /><br />One would think a supposed good journalist, such as the hero of the story, would immediately recognize this as a realistic possibility, and work hard to pursue this as a missing persons case, rather than a murder. I suspect he would've gotten a lot further, more quickly, had he done so.<br /><br />Instead, we're subjected to dozens of pages of theories about the supposed murder, so many ridiculous details that add nothing to painting a picture of a specific character or setting a scene. Indeed, the details -- the numerous mention of specific brand names, of specifically how something is done, of politics that have little to do with the actual plot, etc. ad nauseum -- seem to want to hide the fact that the author just isn't a very good storyteller. (He would make an excellent travel writer, however, were he still alive today.)<br /><br />I wanted to love this book -- all three books, in fact. But I found the fact that it just took so darn long to get to the point and the plot that it was hardly worth it. And then to find the \\"mystery\\" was as simple as a kid running away from home to get away from some evil family members... well, heck, how many stories have we already read that traversed that familiar ground?<br /><br />I suppose the only thing that makes this book redeemable is that the \\"Girl\\" in the title is a lithe elite hacker woman who likely has Asperger's. This resonates with perhaps the targeted audience -- teen and young adult males. Who, sadly, probably wouldn't recognize good literature if it attacked them through their SSH connection.alive today.)    I wanted to love this book -- all three books, in fact.

0393327345|5.0|I am going to break the first rule of Fight Club, with apologies to Tyler Durden and Chuck Palahniuk. I am going to talk about Fight Club, the book, and also the club itself, since it is too hard to dance around the central theme and still review the book. Fight Club is the main organizing principle, the central idea in a book crammed with ideas. Call them recurring motifs, trains of thought, running gags--Fight Club is chock full o' them. Or is it Chuck full? Anywho, there are support groups for terminal illnesses, and the insomniacs who fake it so they can attend the meetings and cry themselves to sleep. An unreliable narrator who works for as an analyst for insurance companies, calculating the cost of paying off settlements versus recalling a shoddy and unsafe product. Shopaholics who obsess over purchasing the perfect end table on Ikea online. Reader's Digest articles written by internal organs in the First Person: I Am Joe's Spleen. Haiku poems:<br /><br />-----------<br />Watching white moon face<br />The stars never feel anger<br />Blah, blah, blah, the end<br />==================<br /><br />There is soap, made with lye and liposuctioned fat from the bottoms of rich women, then sold back to them as fancy scented soap in overpriced boutiques:<br /><br />-------<br />At the Paper Street Soap Company, other teams pick the petals from roses or anemones and lavender and pack the flowers into boxes with a cake of pure tallow that will absorb their scent for making soap with a flower smell.<br />  Marla tells me about the plants.<br />  Some of the plants have obituary names: Iris, Basil, Rue, Rosemary, and Verbena. Some, like meadowsweet and cowslips, sweet flag and spikenard, are like the names of Shakespeare fairies. Deer tongue with its sweet vanilla smell. Witch hazel, another natural astringent.<br />  Orrisroot, the wild Spanish iris.<br />  Every night, Marla and I walk in the garden until I'm sure that Tyler's not coming home that night. Right behind us is always a space monkey trailing us to pick up the twist of balm or rue or mint Marla crushes under my nose.<br />==========<br /><br />Who is Marla? She sounds like a sweet girl. My first love was named Marla. But this Marla--Marla Singer--is a faker who goes to terminal illness support groups to soak up sympathy like a vampire. She goes to groups that make no sense, like testicular cancer, or COPD groups where she chain smokes. She fakes suicide to get attention:<br /><br />------------<br />\\"I embrace my own festering diseased corruption,\\" Marla tells the cherry on the end of her cigarette. Marla twists the cigarette into the soft white belly of her arm. \\"Burn, witch, burn.\\"<br />========<br /><br />Chuck Palahniuk juggles all of these ideas, short quips, haiku poems, Reader's Digest excerpts, Ikea catalogue ads, and spins them all into a most compelling tale:<br /><br />--------------<br />\\"The second rule of fight club, Tyler yells, \\"is you don't talk about fight club.\\"<br /><br />Me, I knew my dad for about six years, but I don't remember anything.

Is this Chuck Palahniuk's first novel? If so, he comes out swinging, with a one-two punch--great left jab and right hook. He really captures the angst and rage of a generation of men raised without fathers, with no great cause, no great war, no great depression, to fight for or against. The anti-consumerism thrust of wanting to chuck it all away and start fresh with only the things that really matter. The bare minimum. Palahniuk would churn out many more novels after this--most with short punchy titles likeRant, Snuff, or Choke, but it is hard to imagine that any of those books (which I haven't read yet, so I am just supposing) could pack as mean a punch as Fight Club.<br /><br />-------------<br />The lye clinging in the exact shape of tyler's kiss is a bonfire or a branding iron or an atomic pile meltdown on my hand at the end of a long, long road I picture miles away from me.

0439023513|3.0|I enjoyed the first two novels (borrowed from the library) enough that I chose to purchase the third book. However, while it was still moderately entertaining, MockingJay had very little plot. It is one of those books that seem to just expand a 2-dimensional single sentence storyline into a book, with seemingly no reason.    I feel that one should NEVER pause in the middle of a book and wonder how nothing has really happened for the past 150 pages. Even worse, I stopped in the middle of this book and realized I didn't feel any inclination to finish the book. I could have dropped it right then and there without losing a wink of sleep.    That said, I did finish the book if only to find some sort of closure. However, even that eludes the reader in this book. There really was no climax, book 2 was the climax. This entire book just seemed to make its dying cry without adding much, if anything to the trilogy.    *MINOR SPOILERS*  No characters or character relationships were developed--the love triangle with gale, peeta, and kat goes nowhere. The previous books actually made me *feel* something while reading them, this one was just... dead, dead like the \\"horrors of war\\" it seemed to be trying to convey. Fiction novels, especially the ending book to a trilogy, should not be war documentaries. I just witnessed a lot of gore and random characters dying. There were some surprises, but those felt like loose threads, and didn't really fit into the tapestry of the story.    I commend Collins for her first two books, but feel she should have perhaps taken an extra year to work on this one rather then rush out a painfully mediocre read.
B000FC12L4|5.0|I dont like giving my 5 stars away, in fact, i hate it. But this book,  this series, continues to hunger for them. ITS NOT FAIR! GIVE ME BACK MY STARS! This book is a fantastic masterpiece of danger, mystery, and frightingly excitable tense action.
B000059TEP|5.0|Probably one of the most romantic ghost movie (with a comic twist) ever made.  The clay wheel scene is steamy without the need to show extreme detail.

B003D89P66|5.0|I can't wait for the DVD. I downloaded and watched on my computer. I stayed on the edge of my seat. The best season yet of this great show. A must have for you collection.
B0036EH3WU|4.0|If you've been holding off getting the DVDs until the show ended then you might as well get this set cause at roughly $25 a season  at Amzaon's current price ($148.99) it's a pretty decent deal.  But if you already have the DVDs and aren't a huge fan of the show then you might want to reconsider. Much like the \\"Season 5 Dharma Orientation Kit\\" there isn't much here that isn't going to excite anyone but the ultimate fan. Luckily for me, I happen to be one.   I was a little disappointed in the \\"secret message from Jacob\\" that was in the Ankh at first, but it turned out to be a fun puzzle to solve that revealed some interesting information (not answers). I also loved finding the bonus disc (it is same disc that came with the season 6 pre-order from BEST BUY) because of the way it was hidden. The Black Rock journal entry answered a question that was well worth the trouble deciphering the handwriting and the black light torch shows some cool hidden secrets. I'll never play the Senet game but it's still a cool prop to have (you'll have to do some hunting for the instructions on how to play).  Still, all I've listed as features I enjoy will just frustrate most casual viewers who were hoping for MORE(or all of the)answers to unanswered questions. I like it, it's a cool set, and if your a fan who loved the series from \\"Pilot\\" to \\"The End\\" then you probably will too. Anyone else, should probably just pass on it.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This new CD by Katy Perry is definitely fun, and a welcome relief and break from the stuff that's been out on the airwaves and stores for months.  No, Katy is not out to change the world with this CD.  She's not out to make some music-defining or life-changing work.  What she has done is produce a CD whose songs are catchy and make for fun driving music on those long drives or traffic jams to and from work.  Naturally, the CD would be even better on a road trip with no worries or cares in the world.

1575666286|5.0|I started reading The Gerson Therapy a few months after receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. In the intervening three years I have pieced together evidence of damage I had not realized I suffered after chemo. I was given the book again as a gift in the last few months, and subsequently bought several more copies to pass along to others. It has been an integral source of information to help me know what to do, and what help I needed in order to overcome not only post-chemo damage, but also to correct several conditions that contributed to my vulnerability to develop cancer.    The Gerson regime is narrow, well-defined, and intense--if you have Stage 4 cancer. I did not have such a crisis, and decided as I read that whatever of the program I did, it was more than I've been doing. (It's easy to get \\"sloppy,\\" tired, and disgusted with trying to do everything it might take to recover from something there is little medical substantiation I have, and I certainly had slipped out of a lot of good eating habits in three years.) But I've built on that basic belief that any change now would be an improvement, and still often go back to the book to refresh myself on why I'm doing something the Gerson way, why I can't eat something and what else is there, and to remember why I do eat what is recommended.    I feel better immediately when I do, and long-standing conditions are beginning to fall away. Finally I'm sleeping better, and have the stamina and energy for exercise, gardening, carpentry and other activities. The book is helping me immensely, also with the support of a certified nutritionist and the blessing of the oncologist, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to piece together \\"what's wrong,\\" and what to do get back on the road to recovery.
B000002MU3|3.0|I appreciate that REM went 180 degrees from AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE (still their best album) by lashing out with a sonic assault and some of the stuff on here is good songwriting.  FREQUENCY, STAR 69 and STRANGE CURRENCIES are standouts, but the same reverb on every song?  Come on, guys.  I know you're pals with Thurston Moore, but jeez.....<br /><br />There's been a lot of talk about STRANGE CURRENCIES being another version of EVERYBODY HURTS but not as many people mention that BANG AND BLAME is a reverb-attacked LOSING MY RELIGION with different lyrics.  Unlistenable.<br /><br />Ultimately, the follow-up album NEW ADVENTURES IN HI-FI is the bridge between MONSTER and AUTOMATIC.  HI-FI also marks what I consider to be the end of REM, sadly.<br /><br />MONSTER is great for completists or if you want some raucus over-loud 70's throwback music for party background, but it's far from REM's best.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I love Katniss, I think she's a fantastic character and I adored the first two books. This one, unfortunately, just felt rushed and underdeveloped to me. It's a huge epic storyline, the rebels versus the Capitol, and yet everything is ultimately resolved within a matter of a few pages. For some reason the drama just never built up properly for me, the \\"pods\\" or traps seemed very forced and unrealistic - I think the author felt a need to put some \\"Hunger Games\\" into a story that didn't have any Hunger Games to it, and that really pushed her in a tough direction. Streets tilting open, bizarre purple lights that melt people, half man-half lizard mutts, none of it made much sense, none of it was well developed, everything was forced and rushed. Characters were introduced in one paragraph, just so they could die in the next. Even the final moment of rebellion/conflict was poorly executed. I saw it coming and then even when it got there the writing wasn't strong enough to make it a BIG moment. Just a quick sentence and it was done. I wanted so much more out of this book. The first two felt so real to me, I can still picture the cornucopia, and the stream and so many other components and characters inside the dome - they were vivid and detailed...this book just lacked a lot of that passion. Maybe there was just too much story to put into one last book. Especially a book aimed at the YA audience mandating a smaller page count. Oh well, can't wait for the movie(s). (There's got to be movies, right??)

B002ZG974M|5.0|I was able to see this movie last night, and it was real cute. the antics the kids did on their siblings. I felt a bit sorry for the Mongolian baby because his sibling was a bully but he gave it back too. I was a bit concerned with him on that truck and no one seemingly around him. The African baby was adorable. basically he had to help himself early on. The Japanese girl, I could tell from the way she went off when she couldn't do the toy she wanted to do that she will be someone who gets the job done. You could tell that from the start. The American baby Hattie, she has a good head on her shoulders. If she didn't like something, she left, like the time when they were sitting around doing the chanting and stuff, she walked off. Each of the babies have their own special abilities and they grew up pretty quick. I kind of fell sorry for the little African baby because he was so sleepy and was sitting up. I was like, let him sleep. oh this is real nice for parents as well as little ones. I can see them gravitating to this movie indeed.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Like all four previous A7X studio albums, this one took a while for me to understand and fully appreciate.  After five or six listens I finally \\"got\\" what they were trying to accomplish.  Yes, it is a fitting tribute to the Rev.  But mostly it is A7X taking elements that defined each of their four previous albums and combining them into a coherent album that surpasses each of their previous records.  First, a way of background since reviews don't mean anything unless the reader knows where the reviewer is coming from.  Additionally, to fully understand \\"Nightmare\\", one should know something about their previous albums.  I assume that most people who have heard \\"Nightmare\\" have heard at least one of their previous albums, but here is my take on them (if readers want to skip right to my review of \\"Nightmare\\", skip the next four paragraphs):    I first heard A7X in 2002 when a friend recommended \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" to me.  This was after Synyster Gates had joined the band and the album was re-issued on Hopeless Records.  To be honest, I didn't appreciate the album as much then as I do now.  I wasn't a huge metalcore fan then - actually, I'm still not - but I still had to acknowledge that certain songs had an undeniable intensity that made me keep listening.  The first seven tracks on the album are all great.  This album, with a few exceptions, is heavy on M. Shadows' screaming (a trademark of metalcore).  He does it exceptionally well.  This album has a simpler approach (but loud, heavy and extremely effective) on guitar since Zacky Vengeance had sole duties for all but one song.      While \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" wasn't my favorite album of all time, I enjoyed it enough that I purchased \\"Waking the Fallen\\" upon its release in 2003.  This album continued somewhat in the same vein as its predecessor, but the addition of Synyster Gates on lead guitar was noticeable.  The band's music had increased in complexity.  Also different was that, in addition tohis howling and screaming, Shadows used his singing voice on a good portion of the album.  Many A7X fans consider this to be their favorite record: enough metalcore intensity to keep the original fans happy and enough melody to bring in the new fans.  This album has many standout tracks and was a clear step forward for the band.    \\"City of Evil\\", released in 2005, was a shock to fans like myself who enjoyed the metalcore-based attack of their previous two albums.  \\"City of Evil\\" was more in the vein of classic heavy metal.  Gone were the guttural metalcore howls and screams by Shadows as he used his singing voice 100% of the time.  The slower, heavy guitars that could be found on their first two albums were replaced almost entirely with lightning-fast lead guitar work that conjured up thoughts of Iron Maiden.  This album, thanks to songs like \\"Bat Country\\", crossed over somewhat into the mainstream.  For the first time, A7X was being played on many rock radio stations and garnered some MTV attention.  Although the band insisted that their original plan all along had been for their third album's vocals to consist entirely of singing, it was still surprising to hear.  While the songs were technically difficult, this album didn't quite do it for me: with all the guitar wizardry and undeniably talented drumming by the Rev, it didn't have the same intensity or emotional impact as their first two albums.  Additionally, Shadows was not yet a very good singer.  Of course, he was not a good singer in the technical sense on their prior albums, but that shortcoming was covered up by the fact that he did not use his singing voice often and when he did, it was often for a contrasting effect.    Their self-titled release came next in 2007.  It is arguable which album was more surprising - \\"City of Evil\\" or \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\".  Their self-titled album lacked the coherent theme of the previous three albums.  It had more songs that were radio-friendly length but shifted genres throughout the album.  The first two albums could be classified as metalcore or a derivative of it.  The third album was pure old-school heavy metal.  The fourth album was all over the place.  It was hard rock, heavy metal and alternative all rolled into one.  Shadows didn't return to screaming/growling, but his singing vocal ability had noticeably improved.  There were hard rock songs, a song with children's choir (!), a song where Shadows used a vocoder (!) and a long, extravagant song that incorporated classic showtunes sounds.  It even ended with a slower countrified rock ballad.  Some songs were great; others were a bit bizarre.  It was clear that A7X was stretching themselves, sometimes even successfully.  Certainly they received more mainstream radio play with this album than with their prior releases.    Finally, this brings us to 2010 and \\"Nightmare\\".  I won't re-chronicle in detail the circumstances surrounding since they can be found elsewhere(briefly, the Rev, A7X's drummer, tragically died at the end of 2009 after the songs for the album had been written; the Rev was replaced by Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy for the recording of this album), but \\"Nightmare\\" puts together all of the elements of their previous albums in a coherent and exciting way.  It contains elements of metalcore as Shadows graces the listener with guttural howling on several songs.  It has elements of classic heavy metal as Synyster Gates' lead guitar takes over on numerous places in the album.  It has gut-pounding guitars and drums.  It even has great singing vocals.  All of the elements that are found on their first four albums are found here making this their most complete album and this reviewer's favorite.  Here is my song-by-song review:    1) Nightmare - The lead single from the album.  This is a no-nonsense track that immediately amps up the volume.  At about the 4:00 mark, Shadows launches into some Hetfield-esque growling that exponentially increases the Wow! factor of this song.  Other than the somewhat ridiculous \\"It's your f*#@ing nightmare\\" refrain, this is a great song.    2) Welcome to the Family - Shadows' style of singing here sounds like that on various places of their self-titled album.  Screaming guitars from Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance are the standouts here.  A great all-around hard rock song.    3) Danger Line - In my opinion, one of two weak songs on the album.  The subject, a soldier's thoughts as he is dying on the field of battle, demonstrates A7X's empathy for our troops abroad, but the overall song is fairly nondescript.    4) Buried Alive - The album really starts to heat up here.  This song is one of my favorites in the A7X catalog.  After a great intro by Synyster Gates, the song starts in earnest with a couple of verses and choruses before picking up speed at the end of the second chorus.  Then, after furious guitar work and drums, it settles down into a heavy Metallica-like groove.  Shadows' vocal intensity picks up and ends with him growling \\"This...is now...your life! Die...buried...alive!\\"  I had never thought of A7X as being particularly Metallica-inspired before this song, but \\"Buried Alive\\" is A7X's \\"One\\".  A true A7X classic.    5) Natural Born Killer - Not letting up on the intensity, this song, if anything, ramps up the pace.  Portnoy's booming double-bass kicks are evident throughout the song.  The sheer speed and intensity of the guitars, bass and drums on this song is astounding.  Another of A7X's best.    6) So Far Away - After the intensity of the previous two songs, A7X slows it down with their first ballad-type song on the album providing a much-needed respite from the relentless attack.  This one didn't appeal to me immediately, but has grown on me with repeated listening.  Excellent vocals by Shadows and some solid guitar work by Gates, including some acoustic guitar, make this a good song.    7) God Hates Us - This is it: the song all those fans of \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" and \\"Waking the Fallen\\" have been waiting for.  After teasing us with some metalcore screaming in a few prior songs, Shadows goes all-out here.  The sheer force of the guitars, bass and drums pave the road for Shadows to lay down some of his most vicious vocals ever.  Truly another standout track on the album; again, one of A7X's best.    8) Victim - A longer, slow song that again demonstrates excellent vocals by Shadows.  This one really speaks to the pain and confusion the band is feeling from the untimely loss of the Rev.  Probably my favorite slow song on the album.    9) Tonight the World Dies - This song, along with \\"Danger Line\\" is probably my least favorite on the album.  It has a blues-based guitar attack that is interesting, but not overwhelming or particularly memorable.  The same goes for the vocals and the lyrics.      10) Fiction - A highlight because of the last recorded vocals by the Rev.  This song is slow - mostly piano and vocals - but the Rev's vocals complement those of Shadows impeccably.  For fans of A7X, this is quite a poignant song.    11) Save Me - The album ends with a bang.  This song harnesses some of the best drumming and guitar on the album as well as some excellent vocals and lyrics.  Mike Portnoy's influence can be heard on this nearly eleven-minutes-long song.  The double-bass kicks are pounding throughout the song.  The complicated song structure is reminiscent of Dream Theater but the execution and delivery is 100% A7X.  I hope to hear more like this from A7X in the future.  Given the over-arching theme of the album - dealing with trials and tribulations, in particular the Rev's untimely demise - this song ends with a fitting refrain from Shadows: \\"Tonight...we all...die young!\\"    Overall, \\"Nightmare\\" has something for everyone.  Fans of each of their previous albums will find something to like.  Shadows' singing voice has never been better.  The guitar work has never been more complex nor have Gates and Vengeance been as coordinated.  Johnny Christ holds things together on bass.  And Mike Portnoy fills in admirably for the Rev, upholding the Rev's memory while adding some new touches to A7X.  This album isn't like any of their previous releases but it does have elements of the best of each.  For those new to A7X, this is a great introduction to the breadth of the band's sound.  For those who have heard them before, I encourage you to give this album a chance: you have never heard the band playing like this.
B003REGM3A|5.0|This is the first review I have done. That said I bought this album after she played a concert in Napa, the Uptpwn Theatre. The crowd loved her and the local paper review raved. I thought , what the heck, I'll buy it.  a great move, love it.
0553266306|5.0|Just so you know, my review will not ruin it for you. The Day of the Jackal is a very fun book to read. The craftiest operations I couldn't ever imagine went into the Jackal's assassination mission. It's possible to even admire the Jackal so much tempting one to wish him success in his mission. The detective work was just as clever. Some things that were not adding up get resolved in the conclusion, saving the story from not making sense and keeping it realistic.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a good game.  I assume everyone knows a little about the game, so I'll just say this version is well-constructed with nice visuals.    I would not recommend Seafarers, but Cities and Knights is a good expansion.  The 5-6 Player extensions are worthwhile.
0374158460|4.0|I'll preface this review by saying I was not, and am still not, a fan of Franzen's \\"Corrections,\\" for a number of reasons inconsequential to this review. \\"Freedom,\\" however, finds the author having divested himself of the indulgences that plagued that work; we are given a mystery and a social commentary in the guise of a turbulent marriage, and by doing so Franzen makes us feel such conventional genres from the viewpoint, and through the progression, of a simple (enough) midwestern family. Russian Critic Viktor Shklovsky theorized of literature that its effectiveness lay in its ability to defamiliarize--that is, to reintroduce common ideas in uncommon ways, so as to make us stop and consider how they have diverged (whether linguistically or thematically) from their common usage--and what Franzen does in this work is ask we consider his rather conventional novel using a series of unconventional methods: i.e. a good portion of the novel is written as an assignment for the protagonist's psychologist, and so on. He begins the novel telling us the family constituting the majority of the novel fall into ignobility, and it is with this in mind that he asks we proceed--we do so from the perspectives of the novel's main players, looking at the story's tragedies from the views of ostensibly dissociated observers. The moment benched upon UVA's grounds, young Joey talking with his mother--who we've already found to have descended into a deep depression, which she veils in an attempt to maintain their singularly focused relationship--was so much more laden with pathos for us having already seen her life pass that moment, knowing it to have directly preceded her emotional nadir. Franzen accentuates the story's emotions by looking at them from different perspectives; this is an often used strategy, multiple perspectives, but Franzen's manipulation of time and characters between chapters is done masterfully.     I congratulate Franzen for making this work far more contained and self-reflexive than his past writings: the ideas of trust, circumlocutory thinking, and (surely enough) freedom are reiterated and elucidated throughout, and Franzen's novel, though compelling enough a page turner, subtly intersperses these themes throughout, rewarding the assiduous reader so much as it does the cursory reader. Franzen struggled with this in the past--his is undeniably a lucid prose style, but he struggled to match his form with his content previously, and he's finally matched the two. In my opinion, the work is all that much greater for it.     I ask any reader also to put this work in perspective (an incredibly difficult thing to do, considering literature's current desuetude): this will certainly be remembered as a great work of the decade, and one of the best of our (post-2000) generation. I give this only four stars because Franzen continues to struggle with universalizing his themes--these are very much a select set of problems pertinent to only a select, albeit large, group (college-educated midwesterners). I feel you can hold this alongside Delillo's \\"White Noise,\\" (which I consider an inarguably canonized work) for I believe the juxtaposition between them reveals this problem. Whereas Delillo took on vapid consumerism and its permeation in popular American culture, Franzen takes on the problems of this decidedly smaller group. Perhaps this is the postmodern condition; perhaps Literature is to be written less for the masses and more for the consideration of the select constituency who still cling to the fading medium. But, as it is, this novel does not stand alongside such works as White Noise or Mason & Dixon atop our contemporary canon because of its specificity--rather, it stands near the top of the more recent works, and I feel will be a defining work of this time.     I also rather dislike Franzen's overtly Freudian take on filial relationships (in fact, the idea of freedom to each character can be defined as how they either accept or contend with Freudian parameters, though they all invariably end up heeding them); it doesn't come off organically, in my view, and seems, like a previous reviewer has said, to be what is a very academically-bred writer's attempt to layer his novel. My final criticism is also what ultimately leads me to contend with the novel's all-time greatness: Franzen is still unable to leave anything tacit. An example: Having taken up an offer to house-sit for his aunt Abigail, young Joey invites his girlfriend out to New York, from Minnesota, and she arrives by bus soon after. Now, after she arrived, i set down my book and considered the implications of this--she had a job, the importance of which was earlier stressed by her mother; Joey was indulging himself in her obsession, much like his mother had done with Eliza earlier in the novel; and he was treating her much like an object, to be picked up or put down at his whim, much like Richard. You see, he was a melange of the mistakes made by other characters, which, as I considered this, was due to his self-caused inchoate intellectual development. But, as I read on, Franzen exhaustively lays down the implications and effects of her dropping everything to go to New York--he, unlike the great authors, is unable to leave such things unsaid, which may again be due to his academic cultivation, and I feel this does a disservice to the reader by underestimating their comprehension of the moment's impact.     It is, though, a superbly written, intricately detailed analysis of one of the last American traditions we consider sacred--marriage--and it captures the disillusionment of our time, distilling the particular problems of a people and revealing that any number of circumstances can lead to its decidedly generic (which I cannot stress enough, as I consider my diction, is not pejoratively used) conclusion. I consider this one of the rare times in our current age when a widely released book is truly great, if not perched atop the contemporary canon: I implore any curious reader to pick up this work, and enjoy it as they may.
0439023513|1.0|I don't have much to say except that it was very disappointing. She had a great story going and totally messed it up with book three. It's as if she ran out of creativity and just wanted to fill the pages to get a paycheck. I am sorry I paid for the book and even more sorry I wasted time reading it. It was better when I had imagined my own ending.
0439023513|2.0|I was really anticipating the conclusion the trilogy, but as I understand Collins need to present the horrors of war as part as of the story. I felt the plot and the characters were sacrificed in order to do so in Mockingjay. End the end I will not read this one again.
0143118420|1.0|I will preface this review with the fact that I didn't actually finish the book. I couldn't.  I stopped somewhere in Italy.  I think I am supposed to like the main character - and apparently many people did - but by page 2 I knew I didn't.  She comes across extremely smug and self-righeous.  The problems are two-fold:  1)  she doesn't explain at all why she's so unhappy.  And she actually says she's too enlightened now to hurt anyone so won't provide any details. Well, if I don't understand who she is and why she started her crazy journey, how can I possibly empathize and so like her?  The bottom line is that I absolutely cannot relate to this woman.  And because we are only provided surface glimpses she comes across extremely smug, self-absorbed and generally unlikeable.  2)  This book I believe was written so others could appreciate and perhaps take lessons from her spiritual and self-discovery journey.  The fact that she does this by getting a huge book advance and runs away for a year traveling the world is absurd.  I almost want to say, \\"how dare you?\\"  If you write a book about spiritual self-discovery and do not provide any real insight into who you are and do so in a manner in which no one else could do this - you are going to come across narcissistic and self-righteous - most certainly not enlightened.  Skip this self-absorbed tale.

0070511136|5.0|There is a huge difference between Sales and Marketing.  I can say this because I have been in marketing most of my career.  I have been the VP of Marketing at two publicly traded companies and even been the VP of Sales and Marketing over a 300 person direct-store-delivery sales force.  But as a marketing executive, I knew nothing about selling.  That's why I needed SPIN Selling.<br /><br />I now run a consulting firm where everyone in the firm has been a VP of Marketing at an operating company.  But when it was time to sell our services, we realized that our marketers didn't know how to sell.  We provide fractional or part-time Chief Marketing Officers to Growth and Mid-Size companies.  We are therefore selling to CEOs and because we are selling experience and insights, feature and benefit selling is useless.<br /><br />After reading SPIN Selling I purchased a copy for everyone in my company.  The focus on structuring a sales call around leaning about your potential client and getting them to explain why they need us was golden.  Just like the book says, the more we ask about the client's company, the more they believe that we care about their company and understand their problems.  And the less time we spend telling them how smart we are, the smarter they think we are.<br /><br />Art Saxby<br />Chief Outsiders<br />[...]

B002ZG97RE|5.0|I went into this film with reservations, mostly on account of the average box office pull it made during its run, coupled with the many harsh reviews it received afterward (many of them coming to rest right here on Amazon). But I was set on watching this because it's Paul Greengrass. I've only seen a handful of his films, but if he's nothing else, he's honest about what he's doing. And honesty is all I saw while I was watching this film.<br /><br />In many ways, GREEN ZONE could be seen as a quasi-bookend to Greengrass' highly-underrated [[ASIN:B000GH3CR0 United 93 (Widescreen Edition)]], though we're obviously dealing with a more fictionalized account in this instance. Our invasion of Iraq was, essentially, the epilogue to what happened on 9/11, during a time when we weren't simply focused on the ones who pulled the trigger, but anyone else who might have the distinct possibility. And that's where GREEN ZONE begins, during the opening moments of the invasion. It's shot in such a way that you could almost watch the two films together and not notice the transition. Cause and effect.<br /><br />For me, UNITED 93 is a very important film. I've watched it several times, and for this movie to begin like it did was emotionally jarring.<br /><br />But! Then we're off to the races with Matt Damon's character, Roy Miller: to see who can find the most WMDs. And it turns out there aren't any, but it's not like we couldn't see that plot twist coming. The action ramps up very quickly afterward, and pauses only so that you can wrap your mind around what's going on, then you're right back in the middle of it.<br /><br />The thing is: you can enjoy this movie as a pure thriller. I guarantee that if you go into GREEN ZONE thinking that all you'll be getting is a couple hours of good, intense action, then you've already found it. But the movie's secondary objective is to ask a question that I'm sure many Americans have asked in the years following the invasion.<br /><br />If the entire reason we went in there became a MacGuffin, then why were we there in the first place? The plot is fictional. The characters are fictional. But by the end of the movie, it ends up trying to hit you closer to home than you might have expected. Because regardless of what you believe, left or right, we paid for something in this war that we never ended up getting. And to that point, I was left just as disoriented as the main character.<br /><br />But that's beside the point. Did I mention there's some great action? =Duffin, then why were we there in the first place? The plot is fictional. The characters are fictional. But by the end of the movie, it ends up trying to hit you closer to home than you might have expected.

0743455967|5.0|I'm an aspiring author, much like many of the other people who bought this book. I won't go into specifics of the content regarding his \\"tips\\" because I see others have. Instead, I will say that reading this book helped lift the creative slump I've been dealing with. His tips obviously aren't for everyone, but there is valuable information to be found within. Having read some of the negative reviews, I feel I should also say that this book describes Stephen King's writing process: how he writes, how he began writing, where his ideas come from, etc. If you're expecting him to tell you how to write and hold your hand through each step, I'm sorry to inform you that he doesn't do that. If you're expecting him to tell you how the Bronte sisters wrote, he doesn't do that either. There is a brief section on grammar, but if you need help with that, you're better off looking for a different kind of book or researching on the internet.    The last few pages of this book do indeed talk about the car accident in 1999. Others have felt that this was unnecessary and had nothing to do with the rest of the book, but I disagree. There are other portions that are memoir-esque, as is to be expected, and this life experience did play a part in the delay of this book's completion and led to King considering retirement. It also lends to the conversational tone, which makes it feel like you're just sitting down, having a chat with a friend who happens to be a famous author.    I enjoyed this book, and I think if you understand what it is before reading it, you will as well.

0596806027|4.0|I found this book to be an interesting balance of an attempt at advocacy and an attempt at education. While I think that the official selling purpose of the book for readers is to show them how to use HTML5, it seems like what Mark Pilgrim really wants to achieve is to convince people that it's worth the trouble of using it.    It starts out with a history of HTML and how it developed and then goes on to explaining the actual new features that are supported with HTML5 and how to go about using them properly. In the process, he includes some interesting exercises like starting with an older HTML file and showing the ways that it can be improved and made simpler by using the conventions of the new spec. There's also an associated website to make it easy to look at the code samples for how they'll display in different real browsers, if you wish.    This is definitely not a book for someone who knows nothing about HTML and wants to start building web pages. While there's some interesting discussion of the way that HTML is actually handled by a rendering engine, the basic fundamentals of the language really aren't the focus here. For people who do want to start using HTML5 features, this is a good guide to how to go about it for now. Considering that the spec is still in development, it's going to be a little longer before any book can be published that isn't already out-of-date by the time you can get it from the store.    I received an electronic copy of this book from O'Reilly for the purpose of writing a review. As a person who is interested in computer languages and the way that these things are designed, I found the author's focus on why things are done these ways to be a very interesting read. I probably wouldn't have actually bought this for myself, but only because I'm not actively using any of the features of HTML5 in any of my projects at the moment. For something that's still as subject to change as this, I tend to wait until things settle down before I buy reference material unless my need is really urgent. For someone who is using these features right now or about to start, though, there is definitely a lot of information in here that should make it worthwhile to get.

B002T9H2L0|1.0|If it hadn't been for some great acting performances (not Brad Pitt) I would have never sat through this entire movie.  Christopher Waltz was incredible in this film and the rest of the performances, with one exception, were a close second to Mr. Waltz. And those performances is what makes this movie worth watching.  With all due respect to nerds everywhere, a fifth grade nerd with no acting experience could have done a better job acting in this movie than Brad Pitt.  He was nothing short of horrible in this film which surprised me because he is otherwise a fine actor.  Watching Mr. Pitt in this film I found myself repeatedly asking \\"is this some kind of joke\\".  Unfortunately it was not.  What was Mr. Tarantino thinking?

B0013FXWU6|5.0|Remember when There Will Be Blood came out in 2007?  I remember seeing it in the video store and hearing rumors that it was a long boring epic that would only get recognition from critics and not the public. Well, when I finally viewed this movie i was absolutely blown away and I now look at it as the best film of the 00's. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the most outstanding performance I can remember as Daniel Plainview, a self-described \\"Oil Man\\" with a competetive nature who slowly goes insane with his lust for power and wealth. Paul Thomas Anderson once again proves himself as one of the great filmakers of his time with this fantastic epic that should be seen at least once by anyone with a love for great film. I can't remember when an actor disserved the Best Actor honor as much as Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood.
0307454541|3.0|I almost gave up on the book because of the excess of characters that I could not remember.  But about half way through, the story finally grabbed me.  I liked the main characters.  I am somewhat disturbed by the author writing so many gruesome happenings in the book and I have to wonder what type of person could even think of these things.  The book could have been written, I think, just as exciting with a bit less gruesome activity.  I already purchased the next book as I was told it was good.  I hope I am not disappointed.  If it is a copy of the first one, i.e., gruesome, I will be disappointed.
B000P0J09M|5.0|I watched Goodfellas the other day for probably the 50th time and I have got to say it is one of those rare films that you can love and appreciate even more over time,  ...even if you already loved it!  Being a long time Scorsese fan this is the film that got me started.  This is the first one of his films that came out during my lifetime and I have enjoyed it a couple times a year since I was about 8 (not that it's a good idea to let an 8 year old watch this film, it is very graphic!).  The direction is flawless as usual, the screenplay is wonderful, based on the bestselling book \\"Wiseguy\\" by Nicholas Pileggi (who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese), and the acting is fantastic.  Joe Pesci earned a long overdue Oscar as Tommy, DeNiro is as incredible as Jimmy \\"The Gent\\" and Ray Liotta scored big with the lead role as Henry Hill which will always be his best performance in my opinion. If you enjoy gangster movies, genre movies, or simply movies that are incredible, you have to see this movie.  ...a whole bunch of times.

B000R8YC18|5.0|Taxi Driver is what I believe to be Scorsese's masterpiece and his most artistic and emotional film.  This movie is just a culmination of Scorsese, Schrader and DeNiro beautifully portraying material that they all identify with on a personal level.  The direction is flawless, the script is fantastic and Robert DeNiro's performance as Travis Bickle may be his finest ever, and definetely deserved the Best Actor oscar for that year.  This is filmmaking at it's absolute best, and even though it came out of an era with countless classics, Scorsese's Taxi Driver still stands out as one of the most breathtaking peices of cinema ever created.

0393312836|5.0|This book is pretty cool! I enjoyed reading it! The Product is great no complaints. I think they should add an index to the book so you can look up the interesting vocab words used instead of guessing. Although u can figure most of it out it would be nice to just be able to check instead of thinking so hard.
0061922315|4.0|This book is done in a somewhat journalistic style, similar to the main character. I felt it provided a great vehicle to explore traditions, feelings, problems and more in both India and the USA. A very well done and interesting read.
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first two books.  I knew this would be a hard book.  I knew I'd read about more violence and more loss.  I didn't know how it would end.    This book doesn't focus on the characters as much as the violence and heartache war brings on BOTH SIDES. The horror of the war on both sides leaves the characters I loved so altered that you don't recognize them anymore (war does that, got it).     Katniss allows herself to become a pawn in the war (something she would NOT do in the first two books) but as I said before...she's not Katniss, but a shell.   *SPOILER*  Peeta's gone and Gale bails too.  I understand that neither he(Gale)or Katniss could handle their relationship after Prim.  Everything just ends with their friendship and you don't get much more out of the Peeta thing.  I didn't really care if she ended up with anyone in the end, but that she was able to be strong and go on.  You get hundreds of pages of war and violence and a few very, very vague pages of...happiness? Complacency? Blah?    You wouldn't think I liked this book, but I did for the fast paced brilliant writing that Collins can work.  I like the message about war, but I HATED everything that happened to the characters and what they become.  Pointless deaths at times...it's fiction! It's for the youth!!    When I finished the book I was empty and raw.
0316067938|4.0|I have seen the many negative reviews of this book, but I really enjoyed Breaking Dawn. Yes, I saw the imprinting coming from a mile away but that didn't stop me from enjoying the book.  The fact is, like most of the other Twilight Saga books, I could not put it down.    Perhaps it does have a \\"fairy tale\\" ending (wait - isn't that the Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries?) but so what? I got the ending I wanted, and enjoyed the ride.  Some people want a great literary saga - some pain and suffering and sacrifice.  But this is written for teens -- not for your literary desires.  Yes, it could have been better.  Yes, it could have had more depth.  But it is what it is - escapism at its finest.  And this saga has driven many teens (and older) who have never been readers to pick up multiple books and share in a story - a fantasy - with millions of others.  That in itself is a great accomplishment.    That being said, this is one of my favorite books in the series.  It ties up the loose ends and answers some of my questions. It made for a great summer for me and my family, and we eagerly await the movies!
006621131X|5.0|Excellent, excellent book.  It is such a wonderful portrait of two hungry, emerging artists and their intimate and true journey.  Patti Smith is a natural storyteller.  She has created such an engaging memoir detailing both her and Robert Mapplethorpe's emergence as creators and as wide eyed children discovering and stepping out into the world around them.  You can feel the grittiness of New York under her pen as well as the distinct moment in time, before cell phones and the Internet, when you met people as people and could bump into Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix or a beat poet of the time and hold a conversation with the person absent the ever present \\"star\\" label that is so freely branded on everyone now.  Patti Smith holds a time capsule treasure in her mind and heart that she has shared with us.  Bravo. LOVED it.

B001E45XT4|5.0|Before deciding on this model of headphones, I had debated between the Creative Fatality's, Sennheiser 350's, and Audio Technica ATH-AD700's.  I almost went with the AD700's but wanted a headset with an integrated mic, I wouldn't feel bad about loosing or throwing into a bag for travel, sounded decent, and didn't cost an arm and a leg (ruling out the Sennheiser's, as well).  It was a difficult debate, to be sure.  As you can guess, in the end, I went with the Gamecom's.  Having now owned them for about a week, I now wish to offer my review.    OVERALL QUALITY    Overall quality of this headset is very good.  As others have noted, the majority of the headset consists of a sturdy, durable plastic that feels as though it will last for years.  The ear pads are covered in a black velour that, while very soft and comfortable, will attract dust and hair very easily.  Also, I don't know if any of the pads are replaceable.  If not, they should be.    The mic folding up into the headset is a very nice touch.  However, it does rub up against the headphone itself so that it never stays tucked in all the way.  Further, when rotating the mic down to mouth level, it tends to scrape along the raised edge of the headphone.  This will eventually begin to show signs of wear.    The cable is a very nice, thick gauge.  The volume dial feels very solid and is constructed of the same plastic as the headset itself.  It is a few inches further from the headset than I prefer, but that is easily solved with the on-cable clip.  The y-split at the end of the cable is set with a rubber cover and the cables after the split are pretty short, thus limiting its functionality.  This could be a problem for some.    Finally, the extension pieces (the part that the headphones slides on, at the top)  are much thinner and flimsier than the plastic used elsewhere on the headset.  I could see this easily breaking in the not too distant future, unfortunately.    COMFORT    As headsets go, these are among themost comfortable I've used.  As I said, the plush velour pads on the ears and band are very soft.  They will keep your ears quite warm, unfortunately.  I had read reviews stating that the headset gave people headaches from the pressure.  On the contrary, I found them to be about average in the amount of pressure they exert, and I have a larger than average head size.  Also, I absolutely love how the ear cups themselves pivot allowing the headset to better adjust to the contours of your noggin.    SOUND QUALITY    On its own, this headset is OK when it comes to sound quality, not great but not terrible.  Highs are decent (a tad trimmed, actually), mids are decent, and lows are generally heard but not felt.  I would describe the sound as airy and subdued as if there's unrealized potential.  (I feel it fair to mention that this headset should be burned/broken in for at least three hours but preferably longer.  The sound signature changes dramatically within that time.)  The soundstage (how well you can tell where individual sounds are coming from), on the other hand, is absolutely phenomenal.  For the twenty-five dollars you pay, I can't think of another headset with this good of a soundstage.  This makes them an excellent recommendation for gaming, obviously.  For general listening (movies and music), this headset is generally good.  I would say it's above average for it's class/price range.    When amped and equalized, however, this headset comes to life.  Hooking the Gamecom's up through my cmoybb headphone amp (with bass boost on, of course) and tweaking the equalizer in iTunes dramatically changes how these headphones act.  Highs are amazing, mids are great, and lows are heard AND felt (seriously, this headset goes surprisingly low).  For the price-point, the sound quality, when amped, is amazing.    The only other point I would like to mention here before concluding is that the headphones, despite being labeled as \\"closed-ear,\\" will NOT block out external noise.Keep this in mind when considering these headphones.    CONCLUSION    I would HIGHLY recommend this headset to any budget conscious gamer looking for a very reasonably priced headset that offers good sound quality, comfort, and durability.  On the same token, I would very strongly suggest that you purchase a good headphone amp to accompany this headset, in order to realize their full potential.  It will make a night and day difference.    Pros:  Sturdy Construction  Great sound quality, when amped  Overall very comfortable  Does not block out all external noise (good for use at the office)    Cons:  Need an amp to realize full potential  Design issues with mic  Can be quite warm after long periods  Does not block out all external noise (bad for noisy environments)
8478884955|4.0|I ordered this used copy for a friend, and was disappointed when it arrived with damaged corners. I know it was marked used, but I wish the seller had been a little more descriptive with the appearance of the book. It is completely usable and readable though, so I am overall satisfied.
B003G7164S|5.0|Very good idea to release again old classic albums on vinyl... It's magic!  The only thing that I will improve it's about inside sleeve info... It should show more pictures and info about the album.  Best Regards!!!
0439023513|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from MockingJay, the final book of the Hunger Games.  Well let me tell you, it was super! It certainly exceeded my expectations.  It was a harrowing, haunting read. I wouldn't say that it was enjoyable, just because it's so heartbreaking and sad. On the other hand, I read it in one day, and just couldn't put it down. Even now it's running through my head. It's defintely going to stay with me for awhile.      If you loved the Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I don't think you will be disappointed with how the series ends.  Collins does a great job of putting you right there in the war with Katniss, and you feel all the turmoil she feels as she watches the people she love die around her.  I would and will definitely recommend this to friends!!
032147404X|5.0|To be honest, I've had this book in my collection for quite some time and hadn't read it yet.  After reading the reviews about Mr Kelby's 'poor attempt' at humor, I thought I should read it. I will be honest....I LOVED IT!  Not only is there so much great info on photography, but the humor was a relief from alot of the 'stuffy' photography books out there.  This was the first photography book that had me laughing and gave me straight forward tips and tricks on making better photos.  I have already ordered the rest of the series and am looking forward to any future books.  Mr. Kelby, if you read this, keep your sense of humor in the books!!!
0439023513|5.0|This book was masterfully done. What I don't get is how the people who loved the first two books disliked this one so much. What I have to assume is that it was the ending of the book that caused readers so much grief. Suzanne Collins gave the readers what they wanted but perhaps not how they wanted it. It caused you to feel sort of empty and incomplete. I believe that is how it was supposed to be. This is not a story that follows in the footsteps of other authors regarding character growth or storybook endings. It's gritty and realistic, which makes it so believable. The end may not be what you wanted, but it is what was needed to complete the series.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|In general, I agree with the low-star crowd, although positive reviews are comfortably in the majority. Avatar has some spectacular visuals but they are not enough to carry the movie to greatness. I actually got bored during one of the more slack parts of the film in the Na'vi camp with the lame dialog. It was like watching a bad movie about American Indians who had to decide what to do with the cowboy in their custody. Here's another small peeve of mine: There's nothing in the water. At one point, the main character jumps off a cliff into the water below to escape a fearsome jungle predator. But there's nothing in the water, no fish, no snakes, no leeches, no Pandorian alligators or amphibians, no beasties of any kind. The tail hookups are also a bit ridiculous with their universal plug-n-play capabilities. And finally, the tree of life left me underwhelmed. Apparently it's a kind and gentle version of the planet's Borg nerve center.<br /><br />Avatar is a movie that you certainly should watch at least once and then decide where your sensibilities fall. It's mostly entertaining but says nothing new or significant about the human condition, love, the environment, our place in the universe, culture, or technology. The film certainly has a message. It's just not new or unique in any way. I don't think it's a classic or even an important film. (But don't take my word for it. Read the selected comments from Rotten Tomatoes that I added to this review.) In summary: Lush visuals and some nicely done special effects, but recycled plot lines, mediocre acting, and hokey dialog. It's like a dinner party with good appetizers and tasty desserts, but a dry meat dish and overcooked vegetables. The only thing that I'd really like to see more of is Michelle Rodriquez. She's the warrior babe with a heart. That's my kind of clich&eacute;.
0689853637|5.0|This book makes a wonderful gift - it's simply beautiful.  I have given this book as a gift to countless, children, adults and co-workers.  What makes it such a good gift is that fact that most people have never seen it before.  You'd be crazy to not want this as a gift for any occasion!
B0015HOFZI|2.0|Convenient style and function but poorer sound than my old, cheap Fisher turntable.  Worse, it promises to record to computer but I followed the (minimal) instructions and nothing happened -- so I used the phone and internet offered in the booklet, and both said they don't support the product (in whose booklet they appear).  Wow.  With this product Sony lies about everything!  (Excuse me: it does play records.)  I've had some dissatisfaction with Sony products before but this finishes my Sony purchasing.  (I couldn't even complain to the company without mentioning a product -- at which point they said, again, there was no email \\"support\\" for this product.)

B0000VD04M|5.0|Ever since i saw \\"Ed Wood\\" in October 1994, I was in love with this film!      The opening credits which are very creative help set the mood   as the film unfolds.     Bottom of the B films ladder, struggling director Ed Wood  trys to get his artistic vision made even if hes the only one who can invision the final masterpiece!     One thing comes up threw out & that is the main character Ed Wood's loyalty to his friends & coworkers.     As Ed begs borrows & steals to get his films made! The acting is superb by a great cast ,starring Johnny Depp as Ed, Sara Jessica  Parker as Ed's girl friend Delores.     The funny Jeffery Jones as the great Chriswell, the hilarious Bill Murray as Bunny! & the wonderful  Patricia Arquette as Kathy Ed's future wife to be.    And its a all true! Enjoy, Martin Goodman
B000007O9L|4.0|I heard the cover of Dylan's  \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" on the radio and had to buy this CD. After several listens, I've decided \\"Stripped,\\" a semi-acoustic, mostly-live effort, does not knock my teeth out and has weak spots but is nonetheless very enjoyable.     I should probably say I'm a huge fan of the Stones' music. For my money, their mature musical skills make up for their failure to release an album of new material that compels my interest since \\"Tattoo You.\\" Those who think the Stones have been washed up for 30 or 40 years, or who are Beatles fans who think you can't like both, should probably stop reading now.     High points are some of the older, less known songs like \\"The Spider and the Fly,\\" (which my husband thought was a cover but is actually one of their early compositions) and material from their peak Banquet-Exile period that does not get much airplay, like \\"Sweet Virginia\\" and \\"Love in Vain.\\"  FM radio staples like \\"Angie,\\" \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" which could easily have been subject to going-through-the motions efforts, are performed with energy, commitment and precision.     On the down side, I usually look forward to Keith's lead vocal, but I find \\"Slipping Away\\" to be a dull, airport-Holiday-Inn-lounge kind of ballad. \\"Dead Flowers,\\" an all-time favorite, is played too fast, a real disappointment.     Fortunately, CD players let us skip the songs we don't care for, and 12/14 strong songs is good enough for me. This has been a worthy addition to my collection of the Stones' music.
B004132I20|5.0|As a big fan of the original stories and of the 80's Granada show with Jeremy Brett I was expecting to be disappointed by this show.  I wasn't!  Though it has been transplanted to modern day London it has kept the spirit of the books, and the casting is superb, especially the lead actor who plays the cold, calculated Holmes to perfection.<br /><br />It's not an easy task to move this concept into a modern day setting given the advances in forensic science since the stories were first published, but focusing on Holmes' acute intelligence, observation and deduction it still gives that sense of awe that makes you feel like you're waking around with your eyes shut.<br /><br />Don't hesitate... buy or rent this today if you love Holmes!
0439023513|1.0|**Spoiler Warning**    I loved the first two books of this trilogy, and like many others I was anxiously awaiting the release of the final installment. Unlike many others who I share the disappointment of the last book, I did not find it terribly boring or laborious to read...the first time. I have now read the book twice (once on my own and a second time to my husband who also loved the first two), and have been reflecting on why I was so displeased with the book before I sat down to write a review.     Like I said, the first time I read mockingjay, I read it as fast as I did Hunger Games and Catching Fire. I noted the slower pace, the constant hospital and morphling relapses, the hiding in closets, and overall breakdown of Katniss, but kept waiting (until the very end) for the plot to pull together. For it to make sense that Collins would so intentionally stray from the original framework of the characters I had grown to love and their world. I thought Collins was an extremely talented author and thought right up until the last page that she was going to pull it together. But she didn't.     And I get it, war is bad, it will change who you are, it will make you behave differently and essentially alter you forever. Yes, I know. But I find it hard to believe that so many characters (ie Katniss, Finnick) would fall so completely apart once they had persevered to the point of accomplishing the hardest part of the war in the first place. They had already gained legitimate support for their cause. A time to me that would bring out the best in them, illuminate their power, make them realize the importance of the parts they had to play. In their submission at that time, it makes every person's death before it seem in vain, and I believe Katniss would have realized that. That she couldn't just lay down and accept morphling to incapacitate her at such a vital point in the war.     Like many others, I feel Collins cheated the characters, and her readers, in her portrayal ofhow they would have acted. This was the first thing that really bothered me about the book. But instead of reiterating what many other good reviews have already touched on I wanted to add a few thoughts outside of what I didn't like, that others can argue that they did. I feel there are many technical points that, no matter how you slice it, are just wrong. First off, I know that Panem is a stretch in itself (hey that's fiction, right?), but in that world, everything Collins had included in the first two books was real. It made sense that it would happed there. But in Mockingjay, she had a startling amount of inconsistencies for that world.     The main problem is that Collins wanted the war to resemble that of war how we know it. But in Panem, this doesn't fly. She wanted the soldiers to be in bloody combat to illustrate they effects it has on people. But are we suppose to believe that in a world that can create mutts, programmed to kill, that the citizen would be engaging in the most dangerous aspects of the battle? Why sacrifice human life when you can crank out as many \\"terminators\\" as you want?     Also, Beetee spent a considerable amount of time hacking into the capital's computer systems to allow for \\"airtime assaults\\". If he could do that, wouldn't his time be better spent trying to break into the system that controlled the pods, and deactivating them after they had won the districts support?     To me, the war in itself was too far fetched for their world. The book would have faired better, in my opinion if it was more of a psychological war. Katniss trying to convince the people of Panam that the Capital needs them, not what they had been brainwashed to believe, that they need the Capital. This is more plausible. People are led to believe that they can not survive without the big wigs and follow like sheep to their orders. Katniss, Gale, Peeta, and countless others realized this was not true, thus striking up a revolution. But in fighting the more powerfulyou have to have numbers on your side, not unlike the Industrial Revolution. Once the majority turns rebel, the wars over. The capital knew this, why didn't Collins? If the districts just sit back and stop sending their products to the Capital, the Capital would collapse on its own. Would there still be war then? Yes. There would be deaths, the capital killing to strike fear into the citizens, so they would still need fighters willing to potentially die for the greater good, but there would be no need to send soldiers on a death mission behind enemy lines. And as President Snow said, they can't kill everybody because that would kill off the Capital just as fast. Without explaining every minute detail of this theory, think about, and you will be able to fill in the cracks I didn't include.    Lastly, another inconsistency that really bothers me was the meeting of all of the surviving tributes that voted on the reestablishment of the hunger games using Capital children. Regardless of who voted what, ALL of the surviving tributes weren't there. Pylor, the leader from district 8 turn president, one Collin's first introduced as a victor, wasn't at the meeting. How do you think she would have voted? My guess would be a no, thus splitting the votes. I guess this isn't as big of an inconsistency, just an oversight that Collins should have caught.      With all that being said (sorry for the ridiculously long review) I tried to stick to the more technical reasons this book did not meet my expectations, even though I have a lot of personal/emotional reasons I was disappointed (just read other one star reviews and those are more than likely my feelings as well). No, the book did not end how I wanted it to, but in producing a well written, well thought out book, I would have liked it regardless. Collins didn't do that, so not only did she fail to give me a satisfying story, she also destroyed the illusion of the world I came to believed in. In fiction you can create a world but can can't change the realities of it just to propel the plot.
B003JTHESA|5.0|This album/CD brings me back to the old days when I first started listening to Maiden at 13!!!! Couldn't stand the non-Bruce period and they've now hit their stride again.  The album just keeps getting better and better after every listen. This album is awesome!!!
B003P2WO5E|1.0|I want to make this perfectly clear: the narrative itself is worthy of 5 stars, but the Kindle version rates, at best, only 1 star.    The artwork, which presumably adds a great deal to the enjoyment of the narrative, is rendered tolerably well on both iDevices as well as the Kindle2. However, due to compression artifacts, the stylized text included in the artwork is altogether illegible on both types of devices. A novel containing as much artwork as this one does should _never_ have been offered in Kindle format until image size constraints are either removed or increased dramatically.    If you own a Kindle, save yourself some grief and purchase the hardcover instead!

B002ZG98C8|5.0|I can't think of a harder working or more deserving character actor/producer that deserves his time in the lead spotlight - think of the cool, amazing and memorable roles that Trejo has had from Heat to Con Air to From Dusk Til Dawn. Gotta love his humble sense of humour on the movie set too:     De Niro - \\"Hey Danny, haven't seen you since we did Heat, glad to see that you finally got your first starring role\\".     Trejo - \\"Mr. De Niro, go and get me a cup a coffee\\"..... F***ING PRICELESS!     Hats off to Rodriguez for staying loyal to one of the good guys/Trejo and not letting Hollywood or the critics mess with the magic. Hope to see RR filming in Detroit one day...while Michigan still has its 40% film rebate. I can't wait to see Machete this Friday! Viva Danny Trejo!!!!      Scotty G in Detroit!
0307454541|2.0|I am so glad that I finally found some bad reviews for this book. I was beginning to feel like a pariah--sort of like how I felt when I appeared to be the only person in the world who hated the movie, PRETTY WOMAN.<br /><br />With all due respect to those who have practically a cult-like love for this book--I just don't see the appeal.<br /><br />-----------These examples may contain some spoilers------------------------------<br /><br />Our hero is a man-bimbo who is simply irresistable to women of all age groups. I know it's Sweden; but his \\"relationships\\" are simply vapid, empty, and defy believability. He is such a passive, agreeable little ho. We never even know if he is attracted to the women who can't help but seduce him. Even an angry, anti-social, asperger suffering, vigilante, bi-sexual, who never even talks to anyone, starts seeing white picket fences when she is in Blomkvist's presence. Even though she has just suffered a violent, brutal beating and rape by a sadist that would have killed any other 90 pound, 4'11\\" woman, she is able to nonchalantly seduce the passive Blomkvist just days later.<br /><br />The author spends about one paragraph on Blomkvist searching his soul over ignoring his daughter for years on and wraps it up with the very profound sentence on about page 600: \\"Blomkvist was a bad father.\\" Oh well. The next sentence he is back to the cabin being a compliant little man toy.<br /><br />And the plot!!! Oh my. Defies silliness. From the get-go it is just assumed that only a dead body could have been sneaked off the island. And why consult with Harriet's former best friend/cousin, who happens to work for an airline and travels internationally (hence the pressed flowers)?--when you could solve a mystery by tracking down various angles of obscure photos from 36 years ago?

0439023513|1.0|There was an addiction to this series that few books can spark.  After tearing through the first 2 books time and time again, I was ready for the final book to keep me hooked with that same intensity, character, and readability.  While the first two books could mix the weight of despair with the thrill of finding out what happens next, I found myself slogging through Mockingjay and not enjoying it even a tiny bit.  There was a rush in the previous books' bleakness, but the final book made me apathetic about characters that had meant a lot to me before I started this book.  After spending this long journey with them, I went from liking the characters to just waiting for them to hurry up and die.          With this final book, the characters act so strangely that I can't even stay interested.  Why is this happening to Peeta?  Why is that character showing up?  Why are the wrong characters dying? I understand war is horrible and unpredictable, but the final showdown doesn't feel believable and after 2 books of feeling bad for the characters, I was ready for them to have some joy.  Instead, I'm given awkward pacing, character detachment, and a predictable ending.  The Mockingjay finally made me stop and wonder why I'm so absorbed in a series that is all about having children fight to the death.        There are a small handful of decent ideas in it, but not enough to save the book.  I don't know if there is a perfect way to end this trilogy, but I do know that this tragic story can't compete with its predecessors and in many ways has jumped the shark.  I'd like to see \\"mulligan\\" called and see the last book written again.  The author has so much talent but I just didn't feel it here.
B001N26GFM|4.0|I think that this movie rather focuses on childhood and that the historic context is less important, yet very dramatic.  It is about the dangerous games children play, and it might have been set anywhere anytime where the grown-ups are in war.  Wonderful, shocking movie. I couldn't breathe at the end.
0439023483|5.0|I LOOVED this book. I could not put it down. I definitely recommend it to anyone. It's a great quick read and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Well done!
B003QNXPUK|2.0|This product is tricky. I gave it two stars because I like the idea of it and it does do a good job but the installation process is beyond tedious and did not look clean and properly adhered after it was applied. Most likely because I applied it myself, my partner also had the same issues himself on his samsung captivate. I have the full body on my ipad but that I had done by an employee at one of the retail carts in a mall. It does a good job, I have noticed a bit of sensitivity issues on my ipad but honestly I can not say if that also applies to the iphone. After I applied it myself and was extremely upset at the result I removed it and reapplied over and over till I finally came to the conclusion I didn't want it on my phone at all (due to stubbornness). I'm not trying to say you shouldn't get it but that you should look more in to which way is going to be cheaper. I bought this set thinking I could do it myself and the set was a great price. You can buy the sets and take them to the retail locations to have an employee apply the film but I was told several prices by different employees. We were told $15 for the captivate and then they told us only $5 when we paid which was excellent, on the ipad it went from $15 or so to $20 which defeated the purpose of buying the set else where and taking it in to have it done. Overall decent product, but definitely not an easy process.

068484267X|1.0|i have heard about this book for years and decided to pick it up at my paperback exchange store. i can't finish it. am a third of the way through, and it's all the same- poverty, starving children, abusive catholic teachers, alcoholic father, dead tired mother. it's just events. no character, nothing to grab onto. it's heartbreaking that this is life in so many places for so many people. but i already know that and see it. and contribute to help. i don't think it's worthy of a prize, it just seems a rambling narrative and nothing more. conditions like this need action, not reporting.
B002ZG999U|5.0|\\"The Expendables\\" comes at you with barrels a-loaded and guns a-blazin' right from scene one!  Many reviews on here are saying this is a throwback or a tribute to 80's action flicks.  While I cannot disagree completely, I can say that it isn't relegated to that distinction only. It is just as much a part of today's action movie scene as it is to the 80's scene.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I have a wife who isn't overly fond of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and the like. On the night we went to the movies, we decided to see two of them, one of my choice and one of hers. My choice, of course, was \\"The Expendables.\\" She made sure she told me on the way to the theater, \\"I really don't want to watch \\"The Expendables.\\"\\"<br /><br />\\"It's only fair,\\" I replied with a gleam in my eye and anticipation coursing through my veins.<br /><br />So after it was over and we exited the theater, I was a bit reluctant to ask her what she thought. I assumed that I already knew her answer, and frankly, I didn't want to hear what my discerning mind already was certain it was going to hear. But being a glutton for the occasional wife-induced punishment, I asked anyway. I about fell over when she replied with, \\"It was real good...waaaayyyy better than I thought it was going to be.\\"<br /><br />\\"Huh?\\" I replied, dumbfounded. I'm sure I looked like a deer in the headlights.<br /><br />\\"It was good,\\" she assured me with a smile. After that we marched into another theater to watch Round 2 of movie night, her choice, \\"Nanny McPhee Returns,\\" which was actually quite good, as well, I might add, especially since we had the ENTIRE theater to ourselves...not a soul was in there besides us two. Later on that night, she made the comment, \\"We got to see two excellent movies.\\"<br /><br />WOW! I was floored. \\"Good\\" had now been escalated to \\"Excellent!\\"<br /><br />It really doesn't matter that the younger generation is having problems with older guys performing in action flicks. Granted, Stallone has a few wrinkles, and he's a little rough around the edges, but he's still built like a Mack truck and as tough as an overcooked prime rib steak. His talents are endless, and he deserves to be admired for his accomplishments. Now you can add \\"The Expendables\\" to that long list. It was an exceptionally fun movie, and I recommend it to everyone who likes a good action film with good actors having fun while doing it.<br /><br />A+!<br /><br />One more thing worth noting. It's quite refreshing to know, and maybe younger generation Hollywood should take the hint, that you don't need to drop F-Bombs every four seconds to make an outstanding movie. There were a couple of strategically placed profane words, but NOTHING over the top. I don't think there was a single F-Word in the whole movie; they aren't always necessary. Hats off to that as well!s, but he's still built like a Mack truck and as tough as an overcooked prime rib steak. His talents are endless, and he deserves to be admired for his accomplishments.

0810995212|5.0|Joseph Christian Leyendecker (March 23, 1874 - July 25, 1951)  holds the position as the most important American illustrator of his time, a position he firmly held until his successor Norman Rockwell ((February 3, 1894 - November 8, 1978) replaced him in the late 30s early 40s. His posters, book and advertising illustrations won him a vast following for his ability to capture the mood, the style and the joie de vivre of the American public. His illustrations of magazine and catalogs of the Arrow Shirt Collection (the trade name was 'The Arrow Collar Man') made his illustrations immediately recognizable not only in this country but around the world.  He was responsible for over 300 cover illustrations of the popular Saturday Evening Post earning him the distinction of being the country's most well read magazine's art Tsar.<br /><br />This very well designed book is rich with reproductions of Leydendecker's work.  Spending time with the images he created for the Arrow Collar title makes us aware of the degree of sexual attention he gave the American male.  This aspect of Leydendecker's work is not significantly touched on in this particular book, nor is much attention paid to his private life.  Historically the volume is correct and the devotion of the page space to art is commendable.  Though the written aspects of the book by Laurence and Judy Cutler add significance to the importance of this artist, there is too much left unsaid. Perhaps another biography of this reclusive artist icon of the 1020s will surface.  Until that time, this book is well worth adding to the library of art books.
1439165645|5.0|This book was a joy to read, interesting dialogue and the author is well versed in his chosed subject. His phrasing made me pause throughout the novel to savor his words. Altogether a very, very enjoyable read.  His family is fascinating but I think perhaps typical of the people of that area. Recommend this one highly!  I await his next book!
B003TTIXOO|4.0|My daughter's and myself have watched Grey's from the beginning.  While each of us have come to our own opinions about each character, we all admired George.  He was the kind of guy who could be calm in an emergency, while at the same time....tug our hearts with his kindness.  This episode was just incredibly sad....hard to imagine G.A. without him.   Everyone I know will miss our favorite tv surgeon......bye Georgie!!!!
B003EYVXYG|1.0|George Romero's zombie films tend to age extremely well.  Night of the Living Dead went from a shoestring budget horror flick to something culturally and historically relevant to cinema.  Dawn of the Dead holds up to this very day as a valid and powerful commentary on consumerism and one of the finest films the genre has to offer.  Day of the Dead, though poorly received upon initial release, garnered a considerable reputation for itself and is considered by some the best of the series.  I even believe that with some time, the lukewarm feelings toward Land of the Dead will become more favorable and it will be seen as a decent enough entry in Romero's Dead universe, though not nearly on the same level as the three films preceding it.  Then came Diary of the Dead, which seemed more focused on capitalizing on the POV filmmaking boom than on having any relevant social commentary.  All things considered, for as poor as that movie comes across, it seems miles ahead of Romero's latest offering.  Many want to make the argument that Romero's two or three latest films have been battered by poorer reviews but will eventually be considered gems in some years, much akin to Day of the Dead.  I would suggest that these recent films have seen increasingly less favorable returns since 1985 because Romero has been making exponentially less appealing films in the time since, Survival of the Dead being easily the worst of the bunch.  No amount of hindsight could make this a good movie, Romero or no.<br /><br />Had Survival of the Dead been written and directed by anyone else, it would have been here and gone with little or no fanfare.  It is, without question, an almost entirely forgettable film.  However, with the name George Romero attached, Survival immediately gains a measure of credibility among the horror community.  As someone who has seen every Romero film and considers him an artistic influence, I can safely say that the Romero brand cannot lend this film any credit, and may even signal that Romero's days of making films with a purpose are over.  Which would be fine if Survival of the Dead were even a fun outing, or if there was a modicum of entertainment value to be had from viewing this film.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Survival of the Dead, quite frankly, is an exercise in patience.  It is a frustrating film to watch, and it is almost entirely without merit.  And I think the name Romero is partially to blame, because it is well documented that George Romero can make a fine film that is enjoyable and says something about mankind all at once, and this film fails brilliantly to do either.  Had the man who created our morbid fascination with the living dead forty odd years ago not been the one at the helm of this train wreck, it would have been scrapped and junked and few would have bothered to look for survivors.  Because of that name value, the film is subject to far more scrutiny, but this particular wreck is nonetheless lacking for salvageable pieces.<br /><br />Here, Romero has planted his theme: conflict between warring factions.  The two families on the island have opposing views on the matter of how to deal with their dead.  Which seems like a decent enough starting point, although there is a glaring flaw: both faction leaders are intolerable human beings, which falls right into Romero's oft used gray scale of character morality, but certainly isn't helped by the fact the viewer can't be bothered to care on account of the characters being so bereft of motivation or logic and the actors portraying them being so overwhelmingly unequipped.  They are not intolerable because they are written that way insomuch as the actors portraying them do so poorly at selling their characters that they are nearly unwatchable.  The problem here is that there is no one even remotely interesting or sympathetic of the entire cast of characters.  There is no complexity to any character: they are either a bad guy, a slightly more thinly veiledbad guy, utterly moronic, or completely useless.  The characters in this film consistently make ridiculous choices and act in utterly irrational fashion for the simple purpose of moving the plot along.  Sure, in Romero's previous efforts, characters are morally ambiguous and make bad decisions, but their decisions have weight and the repercussions fit the actions.  No decision in Survival of the Dead feels like it means anything.  Things happen simply to get the film from point A to point B, which makes for lazy storytelling and a lackluster film.  There is a wide berth of difference between Romero's original trilogy and this particular film: there is no sense of dread to be found, no sense of loss of humanity, nothing remotely close to vitriol and transgression, nothing new we learn about ourselves as a culture, and--nearly as important--nothing to draw the viewer into the narrative.<br /><br />But let's throw that all out the window.  Let's assume that Romero has conceded that he can no longer write characters as strong as Ben, Fran, or Rhodes.  That he cannot create characters that are more than trope or stock, characters that may represent something a little more.  Let's assume he doesn't try so hard to sell his characters in this film as representatives to some greater meaning.  That this film is simply a fun exhibition of post-apocalyptic gore tableaux.  It even fails there.  Romero, so well known for taking practical effects and putting them to great use, relies almost entirely on CGI.  In a commentary track on the Dawn of the Dead U.S. Theatrical Cut, Romero says he feels CGI is better suited for effects that cannot be done practically (and furthermore, if something sounds impossible to do convincingly with practical effects, it probably is) or to enhance practical effects.  He says that the viewer should never feel like they are watching effects, that there is no need to abuse CGI in his films because he is not making a movie about dinosaurs, and that CGI should never be the star of the film.  To be fair, CGI is far from the star here, because the effects work is atrocious.  The viewer will not only be absolutely aware that they are watching bad CGI, they will most likely be taken entirely out of the film because of how bad it is.<br /><br />There are a number of gags that are entirely too laughable and unbelievable, testing even the strongest suspension of disbelief.  The very fact that Romero saw these scenes in post-production and gave them a thumbs up draws questions to whether or not he recalls what made his first three films so successful.  This isn't to say that Romero hasn't employed humor in his films, but there is something distinctly different between raiders engaging in a pie fight with zombies as they pillage a mall and a grenade blowing up the wall of a building and leaving those pressed behind it covered in soot like cartoon characters.  Both sound rather silly, but Dawn's gags and pratfalls seemed to fit in the context of the film, and was often a means to give the viewer a break from the film's overall bleak tone.  The latter gag isn't funny because it was intended to be, rather it is comical (but moreover depressing) that a man who generally deals in subtlety and nuance would think that a Daffy Duck pratfall would fit perfectly in the middle of his latest zombie allegory flick.  It would be a different issue entirely if Romero had made this film with the intention of being Looney Toons with zombies, but his focus seems too centralized upon making another film with something to say about us as a whole, and these gags are all the more ridiculous when the film fails to have anything to say.<br /><br />And as far as subtlety goes, Romero here has lost any grasp he had on the notion.  His theme here is man against man.  This is clear because he bludgeons the viewer over the head with the idea.  But it's not even an entirely interesting or new one, as the idea that we are the enemy has been a main thread in every Dead film he has helmed, and used to better effect in previous films.  But his previous films expanded on those ideas.  Night of the Living Dead made subtle allusion to Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement.  Dawn of the Dead questioned our obsession with owning things.  Day of the Dead asked whether it was necessary to know the answers to unanswerable questions if we must sacrifice our humanity to achieve that knowledge.  Land of the Dead focused on terrorism and the Bush Doctrine.  Even Diary of the Dead could be considered a statement about our dependency of technology and media.  Survival of the Dead has nothing subtle, nothing nuanced.  From the first scene to the final shot, Romero wields his message like a whooping stick, not content to sheathe it until the point has been beaten firmly into the viewers' skulls.  Here, Romero has traded in that skill, or he doesn't trust his audience to draw their own conclusions.  Like Diary, Survival ends with a ridiculous shot guided by voice over that is intended to provide the viewer with their catharsis.  Here, he drives home that so long as there are men, they will fight, and that the stubborn will carry their ideas with them to their graves (and, as he shows, beyond).  But given the awful execution of the rest of the film prior to that final \\"payoff\\", the fact that Romero's overall message is rather one-dimensional, unrefined, and has been done before (and, again, better) in his previous films is far more unforgivable.<br /><br />Survival of the Dead also continues Romero's downward trend in terms of casting and getting good performances from his actors.  No one in this film turns in a good role.  No one.  Every performance, like the characters, is throwaway.  It would be another thing entirely if a character was written to be over the top and the actor/actress portraying them did their job in making that character believable or selling the viewer on the idea that it is just that character's nature.  Look at Judith O'Dea's Barbara, one minute hysterical and another catatonic, played with just the right touch (and at times a little too much) melodrama.  Look at Joe Pilato's Captain Rhodes, almost a comic book villain, the prototypical career military man whose power has gone to his head.  For their films, they worked.  But here, everyone falls flat.  There is no strong lead.  There isn't even much in the way of a primary character.  Everyone simply blends in while the audience waits for them to kill something (sometimes in absolutely ridiculous fashion) or be killed.<br /><br />Perhaps we were spoiled by his other films.  Take Dawn of the Dead for example.  Every character has a purpose, and every character connects with the audience.  Roger, calm and collected, then at once fervent and violent.  Peter, the center, the backbone, a man who does morally ambiguous things at times but is all together genuine and strong.  Fran, assertive, the one who grows past the assumed role of den mother and learns to become every bit the valuable asset her cohorts are, all while facing down bringing a child into the world and the crushing reality of what their existence in the mall is turning them into.  Stephen, simpering and feeble at times, yet invaluable because of his skill, always trying to be one of the boys and coming across at times as mildly misogynist.  Even the mall itself is a character, the constant temptress.<br /><br />Here, decades and miles away, Survival of the Dead has no character and none of the requisite charm of Romero's trilogy.  Again, the characters are simply tools to prod along Romero's idea, one that even he doesn't quite know how to put to film.  In the same commentary track I mentioned before, Romero specifies that the characters come to him naturally after he gets his idea.  Here, not even the idea was fully realized, which makes it far less excusable to present a group of characters without any meaning or use.  But despite it all, a film without subtext can still succeed.  If a film has a middling plot but characters to drive it, or an exceptional plot with uninteresting characters, it still struggles to qualify itself as a good film, even if it has one piece of the puzzle in place.  It just so happens that Romero has made his reputation by being savvy and smart with metaphor and delivering an enjoyable picture to encapsulate that message.  With Survival of the Dead, everything is lacking.  Quite simply, George Romero has made a terrible film in the sub-genre he created.<br /><br />With this film, Romero acts as something of the old grandfather he looks to be.  He pulls you into his lap and tells you a story about how way back when, when he was a younger man, he made some movies about zombies.  And they were great films.  And your grandfather, well, he started something.  And Grandpa George has seen so many people in those years since take that idea that he created and have their way with it, for better or worse.  So it occurred to him that he did it better than anyone else (and he did, mind you), so what's to stop him from doing it better again?  And he tries, but it isn't the same, and it turns out that Grandpa George not only can't make 'em like he used to, but what he's turning out today isn't nearly as good as what some others are doing with a fifth of the experience and a tenth the prestige.  That for as hip and with the times as George tries to be, he's not that young man anymore who made those amazing films.  But you'll permit him his mistakes, because you love your grandfather.<br /><br />And I love George Romero, for he is very much the grandfather of not only the modern idea of the zombie, but of the thinking man's horror film.  I would love to see another Romero film on par with Night, Dawn, or Day.  I would love to sit back in wonder and watch George weave his magic one more time.  But Survival of the Dead seems to be a loud and clear death knell for that possibility.  Because Survival of the Dead is most certainly not that film.  The absolute fact of the matter is this: George cannot do it like he once did, and Survival of the Dead is very much a horrible film that proves this point.  It appears that his sense of style and ingenuity has atrophied, dried up, and blown away on the wind.  In the last few years, George Romero has made acceptable to bad films while others around him, no doubt influenced by him, have done it much better.  And even with those very good zombie films, the truth is that it is an absolutely unapproachable task to try and top the relevance and brilliance of Romero's Dead trilogy.  Even for the man himself.  Survival of the Dead would be a woefully inadequate attempt to follow up on that brilliance for a relative newcomer, never mind the complete catastrophe it is having been dealt by the hand of George Romero himself.nd used to better effect in previous films.

B002VPE1YS|5.0|When I first opened my case I was disappointed; It looked too slim to be of much use for me. But you'll be surprised by how much it opens up - My Kodak M20 digital camera (or my LG Cookie mobile) fits nicely inside [and there is room left over too] and there isn't any bulging. The drawstring top doesn't meet any resistance either, so if your camera is a bit bigger this model case will still be suitable.<br /><br />The soft case is lightly padded, so my camera survived 13 hour flights and a week of theme park rides, being dropped and taxi journeys. The case also has a clip attached to it, so you can fasten it to a belt loop if you need your hand's free to juggle children/food/maps/money etc :)<br /><br />Though it doesn't affect the product's function; The quilted design of the case makes it look expensive and quite designerish.<br />10/10.
B001F1YBP8|3.0|I bought this from another source (sorry, Amazon) and was totally unimpressed.  One reviewer mentioned about being able to read the Roman Numerals on a player's wristwatch.  OK, but did that really enhance the viewer's listening pleasure of the program?  One could have purchased the DVD version and have the same musical experience and paid, probably, half or less.  The point is that the enhanced video adds nothing to the listening experience.  Then, there is the overall value.  While this program would come close to filling a single-layered DVD, with Blu-Ray's single-layered 25GB capacity, this program did not come close to filling half of this disc.  This is why it gets only 3 stars.  Even if Blu-Ray's pricing came down to the level of a DVD, it would still be a poor value.  There are some types of programming that Blu-Ray is great for.  For concert footage...don't waste your money.
0064430227|5.0|I've selected this book for my grand-nephew after having read it to my grandchildren.  The book is imaginative, creative, and fanciful.  The kids to whom I have read this book have followed the story eagerly to the end.  [[ASIN:0064430227 Harold and the Purple Crayon 50th Anniversary Edition (Purple Crayon Books)]]<br /><br />Highly recommended
B0012GVKW8|4.0|I refused to buy the new \\"The Ultimate Grain free and detail free edtion\\", so i bought this first edition on BD that i think looked much better and had plenty of details and more of the natural grain that it is supposed to have. If you really like this film and bought the \\"Ultimate edition\\" on BD or only one of the dvd releases, i strongly recommend you to buy this first BD edition.<br /><br />I have seen many people saying this first BD edition is too grainy. I don`t agree. I have seen more grainy films than this before. I don`t think this film have excessive grain. I have read that from people that saw in the cinema in 87, said it had grain. So, naturally this BD has it. It`s supposed to have it. If you think this BD edition have too much grain, you shouldn`t see the BD of City of the living dead.<br /><br />It is even more grainier than this film.<br />Don`t believe the others that sayed it`s too grainy, i don`t think it`s so bad they wanted it to be. I think they exaggerated it.<br />Some scenes have more grain than others, but i think the picture quality was pretty good. The picture and sound quality surely was a lot better than the last time i saw on tv several years ago just in SD.<br /><br />I think the audio quality was impressive. The only thing stopping me from giving the audio 5, full score is that several times i hear hissing when they speak and the dialog at times sounds tinny. There was great deep bass, especially when the minigun was used and + explosions. I was happy with it. Good enough for me.<br /><br />Film: 4.5/5<br />Picture quality: 4/5<br />Audio quality: 4/5<br />Overall: 4/5
0439023513|4.0|I just completed MOCKINGJAY, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Once again the pages flew by and I finished it in just a couple of days.  The [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] series was writted for a teenaged crowd, but I found that it is a good story for most ages.  I think, however, that there is a bit too much in the way of graphic depictions of death for most elementary school students, at least K-4th grade.<br /><br />Collins continues the story of Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and others from the first two books.  Of course, this is the book where everything is resolved.  Will Katniss survive?  And if so, will she end up with Gale, Peeta, or neither.  Will the Capitol or the Districts win?  These things, and others, all need to be ironed out in this final installment.<br /><br />Collin does a good job of wrapping things up.  All I can say is that I highly recommend this series to anyone over the age of about 10-11.  It works well for tweenagers through grown-ups, especially if you enjoy science fiction, political thrillers, and dystopian stories.<br /><br />A solid 4 stars, but not the 5 stars that book one earned.  As I mentioned in the tag line, I didn't feel like this book had the same punch and gripping power of \\"The Hunger Games\\" (book 1).  Even so, you will be glad you read the whole series.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B002ZG97RY|2.0|The story is fictional. The whole reason we went to the war is due to a single faulty intel from a fictional character named Magellan? Give me a break. The movie is nothing more than a liberal's attempt to attack on Bush Administration and it turned out weak. They would make their case stronger if it was based on actual historial events.    Iraq would have avoided the war if they allowed UN inspectors to come in and VERIFY there is no WMD like they claimed. Makes you think who is stupider, Bush Administration or Saddam Regime?
0385493622|5.0|Simon Singh's talent is that he can write intriguing stories centered on advanced scientific or mathematical concepts that even the layman can appreciate. His decision to write a book on Fermat's theorem is spot on  - although the proof of the theorem cannot be understood by more than 99.9% of humans on the planet, anyone who has gone to high school can probably understand the simple problem statement. Singh starts off in his usual style of introducing the problem along with its historical background. The early chapters constitute a very nice condensed history of mathematics and number theory in particular. The middle chapters explain the initial attempts to prove the theorem. The last few chapters are centered on Andrew Wiles and his single handed quest to find the proof. By this time, the mathematics involved are out of reach for most of us but even then Singh is able to keep the reader immersed and spellbound. The story of Wiles' success in proving the theorem with almost zero external assistance is amazing and uplifting. He has become one of my heroes. A great book and highly recommended.
0670034711|1.0|I wanted to like this book. Everyone I knew loved it and said I had to read this book. I didn't make it past Italy. I was disappointed that she was paid to take this trip (book advance) and wondered how much of it was manufactured for the book. Also, to me, her tone seemed haughty and self-important.
1595141715|5.0|Anyone who has suffered through a not-so-glamorous high school life can, in my estimation, relate to the tragedy which is Hannah's life.  Feeling as though her world, and everything in it, has collapsed, she resorts to the tried and true method of escapism, suicide.  Though, I hope, we all know that this is not the answer, Hannah sees no other alternative to her bleak existence and as the story unfolds we learn why.  As Hannah herself expresses in the book, via recording, she has experienced a snowball effect in that one minor, but unpleasant, situation has led to another, each growing more insidious until she's left feeling bereft of hope and alone.  Clay, the protagonist, has had innumerable opportunities to intervene but for fear of being rejected chooses to remain in the shadows and only learns of Hannah's torment after she has already taken her life.  The situations, dialogue and experiences are as real as they come, some even pulled me right back into those high school moments I had long since forgotten.<br /><br />For anyone who has an adolescent at home, especially those having difficulty fitting in, this is a must read.
B0037W68F4|1.0|All I can say is:\\"Put the pipe down.\\"  No more crack cocaine induced albums.  If you want to fade off into obscurity, you've achieved it.  Good job.  Yeah!!! We're an indie band that no one wants to watch in concert  or listen to.  \\"Yes.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|\\"Under the Red Hood\\" is what fans have been waiting for ever since the \\"Death in the Family\\" story line. This animation stands out from all the recent DC Universe animated films (I'm talking about all of the superman/batman crossovers, GL movies, and even the JL films) in that the emotional response elicited from the viewers is real and powerful. No doubt the storyline being based on the comic stories of Jason Todd has something to do with this, but when you watch this animation, you will agree with me that it could seamlessly be translated into a blockbuster live action film.    Combining all of the classic elements of BTAS and the crisp modern production values of today's DC feature films, and adding a spice of realism and maturity that can only rightfully be explored in Batman's realm, \\"Under the Red Hood\\" is a work of art. This is the graphic equivalent of Chris Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight.\\" You will not be disappointed by this instant DC modern classic.
B00008J2PG|5.0|If you enjoy true stories about little known \\"heroes\\" during World War II, watch this. It is about a Roman Catholic priest at the Vatican who was instrumental in helping hundreds (thousands?) of Allied soldiers escape from the Nazi into Switzerland. Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer did a great job in their roles. My husband and I really enjoyed the movie.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|In Bruges, in 1930, a bright and willful young woman (Audrey Hepburn) enters a convent and undergoes rigorous training for the religious life.  As Sister Luke, her dream of serving as a nurse in the Belgian Congo is finally realized, but she develops a life-threatening illness.  When she eventually returns to the strict confines of the mother house, her years-long struggle to follow the rule of obedience and the outbreak of WWII bring about a crisis of conscience.<br /><br />I first saw this movie in 1960 and it had a huge effect on me; I'm glad to say I found it every bit as powerful today.  It is a deeply reverential look at traditional religious life and a fine character study of a young woman who strives to conform to the restraints of her vocation.  Audrey Hepburn is so young and serenely beautiful and shows great emotional range; I'm sure she inspired many girls to consider religious life.<br /><br />Partially filmed in Belgium and the Congo, the movie is beautiful and timeless.  It is adapted from Kathryn C. Hulme's source novel which was based on the life of a real nun.  Highly recommended.

Cake pops are SO good, so fun, and it's the only way we eat cake in our house now.  :-)  We make cake pops for EVERY occasion and they are always a huge hit with family and friends.  This book has tons of great ideas and they're so fun and easy to make.  Highly recommended!  Thank you for cake pops, Bakerella!  Our family loves you for them!  lol
B003JTHETY|5.0|This album is for true Maiden fans only!  Mother of Mercy and El Dorado are two of my favorites on this album.  If you grew up listening to Maiden then this is a must have for you, like it was me.  Up the Irons!
B0006L0LOS|4.0|This was a great movie. It moved a little slow sometimes but other than that it was really good. And Benjamin Bratt is hot.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|Few years back, I was mesmerised by his brilliant 'Pianist'. It was refreshing to see 'The Ghost Writer' this year . I saw it twice in three days and this film replaces all before it as the Film Of The Year. Truly Hitchcockian. What attention to details! Build up and suspense is truly magnetic. Embellished by an outstanding musical score by Alexandre Desplat. Hear it. Roman Polanski has handled this script with an ease like Alfred Hitchcock would have done with Saboteur and The Man who Knew Too Much. I was first bowled over by Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Tenant'. This film is in the true tradition of how a tale has to be told even if the tale has political overtones. Any other director would have found the going dry and tough. Ewan Mcgregor, I always felt had the potential to deliver; and he has done greatly. Pierce Brosnan is adequate. Good supporting work from Timothy Hutton, James Belushi and Tom Wilkinson. Let me get back to Polanski who is the Master Director here and excellent work by Aexandre Desplat. The visuals are breathtaking and perfect for the sombre mood of the script. The music is a perfect fit to this suspensul cocktail of a tale.
0061801313|5.0|I bought this boxed set for my 11 year-old daughter just before we drove from Minnesota to Florida. After a few hours into the trip, she started reading - and didn't stop until we got to Florida 31 hours later. Her Lexile score is around 1000, and I think these books range from 660L to 770L. They must be entertaining, because she absolutely could not put them down. I had to keep looking in the back seat to make sure I hadn't left her at the last rest stop.<br /><br />At $[...] for the boxed set, I saved $18.42 over buying the books individually. I knew if I bought the first book, I'd be looking for a store along the way to buy the second, third and fourth books - so I took a chance and bought the set. Each book is about 300 pages, so the set runs around 1200 pages giving your daughter (or son - probably not) a sense of accomplishment. Most parents would agree that they love to see their children engrossed in a book rather than playing video games or watching movies (both of which I also enjoy!). Buy this set, and I guarantee you won't see your beloved one until she comes asking for books five through eight.
143350393X|5.0|First, id like to say that this is one beautiful bible. The quality is top notch. The book is truly worth twice as much as you will pay.    At first, it may even be a little intimidating. It certainly was for me and i even considered returning it. There is soo very much information packed into this book. It is truly an amazing reference for any person serious about learning God's word in a much deeper way.    The best way i can describe it, to help any person considering buying it is, this book is more for the serious scholar looking to increase their knowledge of the bible and the word of God. Of course it is based on the ESV translation which is in line with all the King James translations which are more word for word and considered more accurate to the original word. This does make the reading well, not harder to understand, but lets say less easy with less story like flow of the thought for thought translations.    Like I said, at first it seemed a little daunting to me, as anyone who would read this through would be qualified to teach at the college level. But after a few days of reading little sections at a time, i come to realize that its very possible to learn many many things from this book and the beauty and quality of the book alone warrants keeping it. Just dont think that you will ever fully comprehend all the information that it possesses and you will be fine.    For people not sure which route to take...    I am going to purchase a study bible in the NLT translation as well. It is based more on a thought for thought translation that makes it easier to read and follow. Some feel it is not as true to the original word but i disagree as i have read both side by side and its clear they are presenting the same info, simply using different wording.    This would be the route to take for any person who does not want a college style religious fact book and wants a more down to earth study bible in hopes of applying the info to their daily living.    Unfortunately, the publishers of the NLT bibles not only are more down to earth in the translations they present, they are also more down to earth when it comes to the quality of the bibles they offer. They are far from bad, they simply are not as elegant and well made. For example, the covers are thinner, the bindings are not smyte sewn as these are, and are only glued. This simply means they probably wouldnt last as long, though there are beautiful as well.    I will keep both as i know that they are both excellent resources and both have their benefits. One is more scholarly and the other more down to earth. I do know this, after reading both throughout, any persons knowledge of the word of God will have increased exponentially.     I hope this helps clear things up for anyone in the decision phase. God bless.
B0035V35P8|4.0|that the Wachowski brothers had never been involved as writers, producers and directors of the dire Speed Racer but had gone straight from their triumphs of The Matrix and V for Vendetta to this film. Things would have been much, much better.<br />Now, while they didn't direct this film, leaving it to Vendetta director James McTeigue, they produced and had the entire story re-written to their satisfaction, and their stamp shows all over this film.<br /><br />***Possible Spoilers Ahead***<br /><br />The movie starts with a bloodbath and ends with one, with lots of CG blood spraying throughout. This is a good thing. When I see a ninja movie I want gore and this film is LOADED with it. People get chopped to bits with swords, perforated like Swiss cheese with flying stars and slashed to ribbons with a cool knife on a chain weapon that our hero uses most expertly. (Every great martial arts movie should introduce an outlandish new weapon, like the flying guillotine from the movie of the same name, or the spiked ball on a chain from Tarantino's Kill Bill.) The only thing that could have made this better is 3D.<br /><br />We also get the requisite back story detailing our hero's travails as an orphan taken from the streets and forced to undergo the rigors of the ninja training by a ruthless master at a remote fortress, which sets up the revenge plot that leads to a great climactic fight reminiscent of the finale of Enter the Dragon. The directing by McTeigue is perfect, as it keeps the story moving along at hyper speed for it's 99 minute runtime.  The acting is good, though our hero doesn't really have a lot to do, which is probably for the best. Nice to see Ben Miles from Coupling appear in another Wachowski production in the part of agent Maslow. Naomie Harris is charming and likeable as the clerk caught up in events beyond her control. Sho Kosugi is chillingly effective as the sadistic mentor.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the disc is that there were almost no extras, just preview trailers, English, French and Spanish audio options and 8 minutes of deleted scenes. Guess I'll have to wait for the Blu-Ray to get commentary or making of info.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars. Highly recommended
0596007124|5.0|This book is one of the best that I've read so far on design patterns. The examples are \\"crystal\\" clear and entertaining at the same time. And the interaction that it keeps (asking you questions, inviting you to ask yourself questions and inviting you to complete some exercises...) it really helps you and keeps you focus while you're going through it.   I recommend this book to all the beginners but also to all you code-warriors out there who want to be better at what you do.
B003EYVXYG|5.0|SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD is poetic & haunting. Romero remains the master of low budget/high quality independent film. CGI/digital visual effects are minimal & well executed/never jarring. Kenneth Welsh (villain Wyndham Earle from TWIN PEAKS) is magnificent as the patriarch of an island clan who wants to put the dead \\"out of their misery'. All the featured & supporting players are excellent as well. The layers of emotion, psychology, social comment & satire are brilliantly complex but ultimately serve the storytelling. if you have ANY fondness for George A Romero's work you cannot miss this film! The supplements are a bit fluffy but informative & worthwhile.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|The series is even better than I remembered - no comercials to cause you to miss the plot lines, 1080p video and dolby 5.1 surround sound. If you were a fan, this set will not disapoint you in any way. Every object and person is so very clear. I am seeing things I never saw when this was on TV in HD. Gotto go and watch the next disk!!
B003LL3NOK|5.0|I have read so many reviews of this latest Dead Head movie by George A Romero that I approached it as I always have with Romero's visions, keep an open mind and approach it within the mythos of his concept.  Doing this, I think that 'SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD' is Romero at his most poignant and this latest film is his best since the first two of the Zombie cycle. His emergence in the past two decades as a first rate filmmaker and photographer is evident in this films haunting images.  There is not one moment in Zach Snyder's unnecessary remake of 'DAWN OF THE DEAD' that chilled me to the bone and yet the vision in this film of the living dead girl riding her horse through the forest did just that to me in less than a minute. The poignancy begins to arise as the squad comes across redneck vigilantes at a camp site.  Our main character played by Alan Van Spring starts hearing grunting noises and comes upon the heads of zombies impaled on poles within their camp.  The heads still alive glaring and emoting sounds. Van Spring, disgusted by it all, starts firing at the heads and commences firing on the rednecks as Romero, dare I write it, has us feeling sympathy for our zombies.  This feeling persists throughout the film causing the viewers emotions to start bouncing around like a ball bearing. The scene of the character of Muldoon sitting down to have dinner with his captured female soldier as his living dead wife is chained in the kitchen going through her motions and eventually coming into extreme closeup with a look of death from beyond the grave also chilled me as none of the other countless remakes and spinoffs could ever do. The most poignant scene is the one where the two twin sisters, one living and one zombie confront each other , the living reaches out to stroke the dead's face and the suddenness of the attack on the wrist as the zombie cannot control the urge for warm flesh, showing pure motorized instinct at its most chilling, the living sister gasping in both surprise and knowledge that she is already the living dead. These scenes speak volumes as to how George A Romero is the quintessential filmmaker of the Zombie genre , breaking all odds to get his vision on screen. Even the bigger budget of 'LAND OF THE DEAD' released by Universal Pictures does not have the power of these lower budget sequences contained in this excellent horror film. Romero has always been a lone wolf when it comes to bringing his visions to the screen wishing he could do it all on his own rather than having over 40 people on the set trying to keep up with him. Watch the interview included called 'TIME WITH GEORGE' and you'll see what I mean.  No one can touch him and they never should.  Romero leaves us with a new idea at the climax, having the living dead exist off animals as an alternative food supply.  George, I can hardly wait for the next one.
B003JTHESA|4.0|I have been a die hard Maiden fan since the first time I heard the album Powerslave in 1984. I have to admit the first time I heard the current album I was disapointed, but after listening to it a few times it has grown on me. Iron Maiden is a victim of their own success. They have a huge fan base and many legions of die hard loyal fans, many from the days of old like myself.  When you have success many want the music to be the same as old or expect perfection on every album.  In the past 10 years the band has changed courses from their stuff in the 80's.  I actually feel a couple of their better albums have come out in the 2000's.  I love the Maiden of old ( we could argue all day what the best album from the 80's was, everyone has a different opinion on that), and this current album is not the best, but it is still Maiden. I am thankful that they are still around.<br /><br />The Final Frontier would be a pretty good song if they would get rid of the first 4:40.  El Dorado=Disaster.  Coming Home is slower but not a bad song.  I can see a combination of Maiden of old mixed with Maiden of recent in the song Starblind. The Talisman is good but not great. I actually really like the \\"epic\\" song Where the Wild Wind Blows. It follows in the footsteps of other great \\"Epic\\" Maiden songs as the last song on the album. Songs like Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Alexander the Great, and most recently Journeyman  and The Legacy. In the end I think the biggest problem is that their are no difinitive songs on this album.  There are no Run to the Hills, Flight of Icarus, Aces High, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Fear of the Dark.  There I go again talking about the Maiden of old.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Here there be spoilers.<br /><br />Stephen King's 1983 novel \\"Christine\\" was adapted to film and released in the same year. Placed in the hands of the brilliant John Carpenter with a budget of $9,700,000, the result was ultimately the best adaptation of a book to film I've yet seen, and one of my favorite movies of all time. There are few better ways, in a movie theater at least, to spend 110 minutes of your life.<br /><br />I won't carry on long about the differences between the standard DVD and this special edition, but I always buy the special edition of a film I like. Some have little in the way of extras, but I found \\"Christine\\" did not leave me wanting in terms of additional content, either. The list of cut scenes is enjoyable to watch, much as the film itself, and it's always fun to find out how a film like this was made.<br /><br />\\"Christine\\" has an opening that gets attention right away. A car motor, no doubt a powerful one, starts up, revs to a roar a few times, then idles and shuts off as the preliminary credits roll. We then witness a scene on a Detroit assembly line in 1957, in which George Thorogood's \\"Bad To the Bone\\" is brilliantly chosen as the background song and Christine herself, the only red Plymouth on the line, claims her first victim. See, while it is implied in the book that Roland LeBay's 1958 Plymouth Fury was simply a custom Plymouth early on, this made-to-order '58 Fury is bad right from the very beginning in the film.<br /><br />We soon meet Dennis Guilder and Arnold Cunningham, who have been good friends for years. After a scuffle in auto shop class that is broken up by the brilliantly-played Mr. Casey, the two are soon heading home when they pass by- we don't see what at first. But whatever it is, it grabs Arnie's attention right away, and he demands Dennis go back. Within moments Arnie is running his hands across the bodywork of a rusted but somehow familiar Plymouth, which appears to have been quitely decaying for not just decades but centuries (if that were possible) in a rather unkempt front yard. Dennis is unimpressed, and can hardly believe it when Arnie jumps right up and buys the car from the late owner's brother, George LeBay. See, ol' George must have gotten along with his brother Roland a whole lot better in the film, since he talks of the car much as Roland did. Dennis' attempts to dissuade Arnie fail, as do those of his domineering parents. Their refusal to allow the barely running Plymouth in their driveway introduces us to the cheery and personable Will Darnell, owner of a local junkyard and garage, who after a rant over the car's horrible exhaust allows Arnie to keep the car there.<br /><br />The acting in this film is as good as you could ask for. Keith Gordon and John Stockwell perform superbly as Arnold Cunningham and Dennis Guilder respectively. To name all of the actors who I believe did their jobs well would result in me naming the entire cast, one by one. But my favorites beyond the lead cast were Robert Prosky (Darnell), Roberts Blossom \\"George LeBay\\", and Harry Dean Staunton as \\"Rudolph Junkins\\".<br /><br />Witnessing Arnie's transformation from a downtrodden nerd to a hard-eyed, lean fella who nobody crosses is really something, and the film portrays all this very well. People step forward and attempt to harm Arnie, or worse, attempt to harm Christine, and all who make any transgressions suffer terribly. The scene in which Christine rebuilds herself before Arnie's eyes is one of the most brilliantly done moments in film I have yet to witness. This was before the kind of special effects and CGI we take for granted today. In 1983, John Caprenter mounted devices all over one of the Plymouths used to portray Christine and overall destroyed the car, then played all the footage backwards. Genius. The scenes in which Christine takes revenge on those foolish enough to cross her are some of the most gripping in the film, made all the better by the wonderfully-done soundtrack. Ivery much enjoyed the moment where the unfortunate Moochie Welch sees a rebuilt Christine idling, and calls out to Arnie, who he assumes is inside. \\"Hey, you ain't mad, are you?\\" Oh, I don't know about Arnie... but Christine is more than just mad. Considering she forces herself up a narrow loading dock and rams Moochie so hard paint is embedded in his bones (as Junkins tells us later) I'd say Christine a lot more than just mad.<br />Consider, also, the amount of time Christine takes in running down her victims. The boys responsible for beating her up in the garage one night suffer most grieviously, and in each case she takes far longer to get rid of them than she'd really have to. But unlike many films where the villian foolishly takes extra time with getting rid of an enemy, Christine simply draws it out, takes her time, but never once fails to get her revenge.<br /><br />Tensions mount in the Cunningham household as one could expect, and Dennis and Arnie's ex-girlfriend Leigh destroy her in Darnell's garage in a dramatic duel to the death between the regenerating 1958 Fury and a bulldozer. Christine's liking for classic 50's music I very much enjoyed, and even as the bulldozer runs her down she's blasting \\"Rock and Roll is Here to Stay\\" and struggling to get loose.<br />The ending of the film is superbly done. I know I must sound dreadfully repetetive in so widely praising the film, but it's true. I have few if any complaints at all, none very significant. Anyway, the end of the film shows Dennis, Leigh and Detective Junkins looking at the crushed cube that used to be Christine, lamenting Arnie's demise during the battle in the garage. \\"Some things can't be helped. Some people, too.\\" Junkins notes. Just then, we hear rock and roll playing, seeming to come from the remains of Christine. The look on the three people's faces, and the look on the face of the construction worker who has the radio on his shoulder as he walks by, is priceless. \\"I hate rock and roll.\\" Leigh hisses.<br />Soon, the three turn to leave, and the camera zooms in on the ruined, crushed remains of the evil Plymouth.

To fully adapt the book to film would result in a work lasting over four hours, and Carpenter clearly recognized that. Yet in many cases, I have been inclined to howl over the carelesness with which a director changed the work from one form to another. Not here. I regret the omission of so many subplots and details, but ultimately the final work is so good that I enjoyed it about as much as I did the book itself. \\"Christine\\" is a movie that I could not only like but love even if I had never read the book it is adapted from, nor ever heard of that most excellent writer, Stephen King. The movie can be appreciated from all angles: as a masterful adaption of written to visual form, as a John Carpenter-directed film, as a Stephen King movie, and simply as a stand-alone film. I cannot think of a time when I have enjoyed going to see a movie more. Among Stephen King film adaptations and among films in general, for me at least, \\"Christine\\" is as good as it gets.Welch sees a rebuilt Christine idling, and calls out to Arnie, who he assumes is inside. \\"Hey, you ain't mad, are you?\\" Oh, I don't know about Arnie... but Christine is more than just mad. Considering she forces herself up a narrow loading dock and rams Moochie so hard paint is embedded in his bones (as Junkins tells us later) I'd say Christine a lot more than just mad.  Consider, also, the amount of time Christine takes in running down her victims. The boys responsible for beating her up in the garage one night suffer most grieviously, and in each case she takes far longer to get rid of them than she'd really have to. But unlike many films where the villian foolishly takes extra time with getting rid of an enemy, Christine simply draws it out, takes her time, but never once fails to get her revenge.  Tensions mount in the Cunningham household as one could expect, and Dennis and Arnie's ex-girlfriend Leigh destroy her in Darnell's garage in a dramatic duel to the death between the regenerating 1958 Fury and a bulldozer. Christine's liking for classic 50's music I very much enjoyed, and even as the bulldozer runs her down she's blasting \\"Rock and Roll is Here to Stay\\" and struggling to get loose.  The ending of the film is superbly done. I know I must sound dreadfully repetetive in so widely praising the film, but it's true. I have few if any complaints at all, none very significant.

0439023513|5.0|4 hours, people. It took me 4 hours to read this book, and if I hadn't been so tired after the first time, I would have read it again. And again.<br /><br />Fans of the series know how I feel when I say I nearly died waiting for this book to come out. Hunger Games and Catching Fire are the first two books of this series, and after every single book you can't help but think 'It CANNOT get any better than this.'<br /><br />But it did.<br /><br />Sadly, Mockingjay is the last of the series, and I cried for ten minutes about that fact alone. The other times I cried were for the major...for the unexpected turn of events. In most books I can point out a character and think 'They aren't going to make it' or read a few lines and be like 'This is what's going to happen' but not in this book. That's thanks to an amazing writer and story-teller.<br /><br />Nothing will prepare you for reading this book. Nothing can prepare you for the profound love that you will read about. The immense greif that you will read about. The deep suffering, and tragedy that you will enconter as you read through this book. If you think the first two books had these things, if you think that they went beyond your expectations, you are in for one big surprise. Mockingjay is all that and more.<br /><br />There were very few times that I just had to set the book aside. I set it aside, and took a few deep breaths and when I was calm, I picked it back up. I'm trying to find the one word to describe this book, but I can't. Nothing seems to fit it properly. The words I'm typing and erasing just aren't good enough to describe the book. Maybe one day I'll find the right one, and I'll let you know.<br /><br />The only thing I can tell you is this: Mockingjay will haunt you. It will devour you completly. It will take you on a ride so exhilarating. Sometimes you will want it to stop, because it's so hertbreaking, but you know can't simply stop. You have the urge to keep going, because you know it's worth it. You hope it's worth it. You have to find out what happens. You want to see if there's a happy ending after all what has happened.<br /><br />I gladly give Mockingjay my highest rating : 5 stars.<br /><br />This is a book that will stick with me, and most of you, forever. The whole series will. It's...unforgettable. If I ever got to meet Suzanne Collins, I'd thank her profusely for giving books lovers around the world such an amazing story to read. I'll save these books for my neice, and my children, to read when they get to that age. That's how much I love this book, and the series. That's how good it is.<br /><br />-Brittany from The Ultimate Dumpeeshappens. You want to see if there's a happy ending after all what has happened.

0618918248|5.0|The truth about the imaginary being we were always taught to be afraid of.  Very liberating to know that the questions I always had have only absurd answers.  A must-read for anyone who has ever questioned religion or the existence of a god.
0375842209|5.0|I went to Indigo three years ago looking for the new edition of Lolita. My mother who was with stumbled into the YA section and picked this book up for me and said it sounded interesting. I bought it, but I didn't think much of it for the past three years. But last summer when I literally had nothing to read, I read this book after two previous attempts.     I devoured this book in one day.     *SPOILERS INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW*    There is not enough praise in the world I could give this book. Yes, I had read books about the Holocaust previously, but this book will stand out to me forever. Mr. Zusak's writing style is so captivating and distinct that no one but him could ever write like that. Sure, he breaks the cardinal rule of \\"show don't tell\\" but he does it in such a quirky way you really don't care and can't help but enjoy it.    There isn't too much action in this book (if you want action go turn on Transformers) but ever scene was written beautifully and masterfully crafted. Although much of the book is about Liesel learning to read and her relationship with Hans, and Rosa, and Max, and Rudy, the Holocaust was elegantly woven throughout the entire book. Even if Liesel is playing soccer or reading or having fun, you still sense the gloom and the mood of the war.     Even though Mr. Zusak's writing is superb, the real gems of this novel (tarnished however, in the best way possible of course) are the characters--each one his or her own individual and equally unique and realistic. Liesel was such a relatable character to me, because she acted like a normal 9 year-old girl at the start and 10, 11, and 12 year-old as the book progressed. She struggled to fit in, and she was, not to mention, illiterate. How she overcomes those struggles is what makes her such a wonderful character. Max was fantastic and you couldn't help but dread his fate, Rudy was lovable and you couldn't help but bawl when he died, Hans was the dad you wished you had, Rosa was an animated character that you couldn't help but secretly love.     But the most interesting character, perhaps, was the narrator: Death itself. No, we did not get a back story to Death (how could we ever?), but Death was so quirky and witty he was a character, too!     The book provided an interesting point of view from a German girl's perspective. This is a book that can be life altering--it really and truly opened my eyes. The ending was probably one of the saddest, most bittersweet ones I have read in quite some times. I cried for nearly ten minutes and then re-read the ending again. You will laugh at Rudy's witty remarks as well as Liesel's snarky comebacks. Your heart will melt when you read about Hans and Max. You will feel Rosa's pain. Most of all, you will experience all of this through Death's perspective.     One of the best books I have read in a while. Perhaps I am overrating his book like crazy, but in my eyes, it deserves it all.    Overall Grade: A++++++(Haha, no I'm just kidding....) A+  5 out of 5 stars (If only there was a 6 option.    Similar books include: The boy in the striped pajamas, Milkweed, and Hunger Journeys.

He finished it today and we spent time looking online for when we might expect the second book to be released.  He can't wait!  Hey, if a kid reads it and can't wait for the next one, I'm all for it!!!    Now it's my turn to read it!

She had no worries she just wanted to get out of her marriage and flit around with no responsibilities and no boundries. She is shallow and lacks any admirable characteristics.<br />I am glad I was able to get this book on Amazon.com for pennies. It will not be too much of a loss when I throw it in the trash.

B003PWJS9Y|5.0|For starters - this is not only one of the best albums I've bought in years, it's also Devo's best album ever. Huge thanks to A. Meador's phemom review and to all those who commented. I bought the CD and had no idea the other versions were available. Read his review to learn more about the music.<br /><br />Usually when there are several versions of an album - the only thing you need to worry yourself about is: A.) do I want to pay extra for bonus tracks? B.) Does it sound better on CD? C.) Is the packaging worthy enough to help the physical release edge out the download?<br /><br />I bought the CD - it features 12 of the available tracks in the best sequence - it starts strong and never let's up.<br /><br />CD vs. Download - winner (TIE)<br />Sound - CD by nature wins over MP3, though it's mixed wonderfully so it's too close to close call.<br /><br />Song Study Version:<br />The fan selected and sequenced \\"Song Study Version\\" download includes a few rare tracks not offered on CD, but deletes essential CD tracks like: Cameo, No Place Like Home and the absolutely essential March On.<br /><br />Deluxe Version:<br />This download offers your best bang for the buck - it has all of the essential tracks from the CD and fan versions, save for \\"Knock Boots\\" which you can easily add to your collection by visiting the evil apple empire. Buy the rest here and support DRM Freedom!<br /><br />Now a note for the DEVO virgins: this album combines the frantic momentum of The Futureheads with the quirky synth lines and instantly memorable, hummable and shoutable lyrics of the Kaiser Chiefs. Devo today sounds freshier than most bands a third their age. Monster hooks. Great choruses. Their prophecy of the human race's de-evolution declared in the late 70's sadly came true. So if you need cheering up, don't insert a hat-shaped pill in your mouth, insert  this disc into your CD player and play it loud.<br /><br />P.S. If you buy the CD, here's what you get in the booklet:<br />It contains no lyric sheet or liner notes - but the six pages of exquisite, high concept photographs are very fun. The booklet reminds me of Pulp's glorious \\"This is Hardcore\\" artwork. COVER: The hot babe who is about to swallow the DEVO hat in pill form; PAGE 2: hundreds of babies crawling on the DEVO hat; PAGE 3: the babe's high heel in a jello DEVO hat as an elderly fetishist looks on in ecstasy; CENTER: a photo of the entire cast: models and band members; PAGE FOUR: faded southern belle bridesmaids dive on the DEVO hat, PAGE FIVE: a religious DEVOtee receiving the hat as communion, TRAY INSET: in a reversal of the cover, the DEVO hat swallows a member of the band; BACK COVER: the band's mod new uniforms (I think these were hand-picked by the fans).

030745455X|4.0|Here on Amazon, another person wrote that he felt \\"bad\\" criticizing the first book, because trashing the book of a \\"dead\\" author, is unfair... (obviously he cant explain or fight back).<br />I also share that feeling.<br />So, I'm going to trash the Editor and the Translator.<br />What kind of idiot editor... leaves in mind numbing, boring details starting with the first 50 (plus) pages?!?<br />(This problem is not isolated to just the beginning of the book, but the \\"beginning\\" is the most boring part of the book).<br /><br />The beginning is a \\"very\\" detailed \\"re-hash\\" of the first novel.

I adore men!<br />But damn, do they always think only with their penis when it comes to a woman? (no pun intended).<br /><br />The only reason I even bought the second book... I found it in a discount store for only $3:00 Dollars.<br />I'm glad I spent the 3 bucks. It was worth it. (once I got past the first 60 pages).<br /><br />Seriously, the middle of the book is very good. The ending of the book... is \\"a man's\\" ending.<br />I'm not saying that a woman can't be \\"far more\\" intelligent, determined and vicious than a man.<br />(Ladies, you know we are).<br />But, Lisbeth is a woman.

1416955070|1.0|I read this book to see if it was appropriate for my 9 year old child to read.  It contains a totally unneeded for the story line anti-Jewish joke that is in poor taste and not even funny.  Really, it ruined the book for me and I think it shows poor judgement, poor editorial effort and makes me wonder about the character, or lack thereof, of the author.
0061353248|5.0|Freakonomics tried to show how some decisions could be sound, even if they did not appear as that for an external observer.<br /><br />Predictably Irrational goes one step beyond: Sometimes, we do not behave rationally. However, the irrational behavior follows some principles that make it predictable. The whole book is devoted to those principles. The message should be: Ok, Freakonomics; you show that rationality is far beyond the appearance and this is a good starting point. What if there are fields of our behavior where irrationality is prevalent?<br /><br />Some of the principles, like the decoy as a way to help changing a decision, are shown with amazing examples and experiments. It is especially interesting the example of nursery because it is shared by Freakonomics and the reader can see the differences in the approach by both books. Other principles seem more driven by the requirement to fill space but, even though, the book is worth.<br /><br />At the moment of writing this review, I did not read any other book by Ariely. However, it is going to be hard keeping the level of this one. The success could invite the author to write more books with the same subject. However, the fact that some of the shown principles appear as minor invite the reader to think that the \\"cream\\" is already extracted in this book.
B000JVSUS4|5.0|This movie should only be viewed on blu ray, full 1080P with a surround sound system. You can really feel the impacts of the bombing and gunfire on surround sound. This movie was awesome. It speaks of how the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and would bait the U.S. into WWII. But before that, a group of pilots would return the favor with their own bombing attacks on the Japanese. Seeing all those U.S. sailors running for their lives when they were being attacked is truly scary. Much respect to the men and women of the armed forces.
B001HN694K|1.0|A very ugly caricature of a great book. Its box office success reflects poorly on contemporary culture.
0439023513|4.0|I've not read all of the previous reviews and comments, so perhaps this has already been stated.  I do not think that Suzanne Collins \\"lost sight of her characters\\" as so many people are writing.  On the contrary, I thought she was very strategic.  Yes, the first two books gave the impression that this was primarily a love story between two young kids.  However, isn't that how all our lives begin?  Young, carefree, centered around happiness?  She took our beloved characters and changed them so greatly because that is what happens in the face of complete hopelessness.  Anything else would be unrealistic.         There are plenty of books out there that will tie up all loose ends and give you a happy ending for everyone involved, which is why, in my opinion, this book stands alone.  Granted, as other readers have pointed out, it is a Young Adult book.  Yet, if a YA book is tackling a concept such as war, do we really want our kids to grow up thinking that there won't be casualties?  Do we really want to paint a pretty picture of such a thing?      As for the love story of the book, I find it inspiring.  Peeta is damaged.  Katniss is far from perfect.  Yet they find a way to comfort each other and keep their humanity in the worst of times.  That is what love is really about-  actions, not emotions.        I think Suzanne Collins did a fantastic job of balancing the horrors of war with the story of her two characters.  My only complaint is that the end of the book seems slightly rushed. I didn't feel as though there was a great deal of closure with the conflict with the remaining Capitol survivors and the District survivors, or the rebuilding efforts in other Districts.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|2002's Vapor Trails was Rush's comeback in that it was their first album after an indefinite hiatus, but many honest fans were quietly disappointed - after a time, if not during initial enthusiasm. All were glad to have Rush back, but a truly good album was most fans' secret - or not so secret - wish. It finally came with 2007's Snakes & Arrows, easily Rush's best since 1991's Roll the Bones - if not 1981's Moving Pictures itself. Producer Nick Raskulinecz's claims that Snakes recalls 1970s classics is hyperbolic, but it furthers Vapor's hard rock, basically keyboard-less mode, which Rush had gotten away from after their prime. The musicianship is certainly the best since the early 1980s, well ahead of nearly everything between, and it is a joy to hear Rush again living up to its reputation. Far more importantly, their songwriting skills have returned. \\"The Larger Bowl,\\" \\"The Main Monkey Business,\\" and \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" are among their very best songs of the last few decades, and most other tracks are also stellar. Rush is one of the few classic progressive groups not only still standing but still making relevant music, and Snakes shows that they are indeed still progressing. To begin with, they are perhaps heavier than ever; hard-hitting opener \\"Far Cry\\" shows that they may have learned a thing or two from the progressive metal bands they inspired - or that they have always had it in them. Those who love the band's harder side will be overjoyed by Snakes. Yet it may also be Rush's most acoustic-based album. Acoustic instruments are everywhere - not just guitars, as Alex Lifeson flexes some of his instrumental diversity, renewing his bid for one of rock's best acoustic players. He is probably the instrumental star, but bassist Geddy Lee and drummer Neil Peart are still impressively near the top of their proverbial games - not as in-your-face as in the 1970s but still very powerful and propulsive. The three(!) instrumentals are indeed among the highlights; \\"The Main\\" is easily their best since \\"YYZ,\\" \\"Hope\\" is a beautiful acoustic guitar showcase, and \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" is also excellent. Another high point are Peart's lyrics; several songs are among his best, and Snakes is nothing less than his best album overall. He has become more thoughtful and piercing with the years, gaining maturity and objective wisdom and increasing his stature in the popular lyricist pantheon. The lyrics have in fact progressed at least as much as the music. For instance, the usually non-, even anti-personal Peart is more outspoken than ever, writing openly of love and explicitly commenting on contemporary events - including politics - for the first time. His religious criticism is also more overt and sharper-toned, ironically exacerbating the sniping of those who have always found him preachy. As for Lee's vocals, they continue to sound less and less like the high-pitched wails of yore, and his newly mannered phrasing may annoy some, but he is significantly more intact than most vocalists his age.     All this is not to say Snakes is perfect. For starters, it is a little overlong. No one would be more glad than me to have Rush return to lengthy prog masterpieces, but several cuts - especially \\"Armor and Sword\\" and \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" - go on too long, though nothing is over six and a half minutes. (On the other hand, \\"Spindrift\\" and \\"Malignant\\" frustratingly cut off just as they get to the best parts!) This is in part because the album suffers somewhat from a symptom that has more or less plagued all Rush releases since Signals:  too much chorus repetition and too many similar-sounding songs. The sequencing worsens this, as weaker tracks appear near the front, noticeably preventing momentum. Snakes thankfully hits full speed near the middle and lets up only a little, but deleting a few songs would have helped, as they at several points seem to bleed into one long track. This is not inherently bad in that Snakes is a sort of themed album,but more diversity and/or consistent quality would have helped. The production is also very questionable. Though certainly a big step up from Vapor, especially in the mixing and drum sound, it still suffers from the lack of instrumental separation and clarity infecting nearly every 2000s rock release. Raskulinecz was clearly a great writing and instrumental foil - likely the most sympathetic producer Rush has had since Terry Brown -, but a more classic, stripped-down approach would have captured the sound better. My first thought on hearing the production was a groaning one that it sounded like Marilyn Manson - which turned out to be no coincidence, as Raskulinecz produced that blot on the musical world.    Even with these caveats, Snakes is truly excellent. Though well below Rush's best works, it is worthy of standing near them; it is a far better album that we had any right to expect from a band with so many fine albums so far into its career and one of the best albums of the 2000s period.
B000003CUJ|5.0|If you are new to Wagner and want to explore his Ring this is the recording to get.  This is, to my knowledge the only recording Telarc produced with the Berlin  Philharmonic Orchestra. One of the finest ensembles in the world. Orchestral  execution is outstanding. The Telarc sound is wonderful. Lorin Maazel has strong  Wagnerian credentials as a conductor. He interprets the music without mannerisms.   Yes, there are more fiery readings of certain passages. Seasoned Wagnerians might  quibble about the selection of motifs and the transitional passages but this is the  case with any recording of this nature. I have a dozen complete Ring Cycles and  have attended one live Ring (Chicago). I still enjoy this cd when I don't have   time to listen to a complete opera. This disc has been a winner for Telarc and Lorin  Maazel.     TK

He is kind considerate etc. etc. Living with the couple is his brother Roman, who beats women and is out of jail on parole. He gives Jess the creeps. Roman confides to his girlfriend, who he slaps around, that if he could live his life over, he would do it as somebody else....Then accident happens. While going across a foggy bridge in opposite directions, the two brothers have a head on collision and both end up in a coma (this was the hard part to believe). Roman comes out of the coma and claims he is Ryan, knowing things that only Ryan would know. Now Roman goes from creepy to Twilight Zone eerie as Jess has to decide if he is the real deal or just playing as the movie shows the two brothers laid out on the bridge, their blood mixing while they are getting zapped.<br /><br />The acting was good, the plot execution was okay. Didn't we see this movie before?
B002ZG9968|4.0|This usually isn't my genre, but for a romantic comedy, I thought this movie was pretty good. It had a very decent storyline. Jennifer Lopez stars as Zoe. She wants to have a baby so badly that she has herself artificially inseminated. When she tries to get a taxi, a man named Stan gets in too. Throughout the day, they keep running into each other, and slowly begin to fall in love. After they start a relationship, Zoe finds it hard to tell Stan that she is pregnant. After doing so, Zoe can't tell if he still wants to be with her. During the nine months, Stan tries to be understanding and wants to be with her, but she still doesn't think that he is ready to be a dad. I highly recommend THE BACK-UP PLAN!!!
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Joe is great as usual in this footage.  I've enjoyed all his albums, but he truly shines and translates best in live performances.  The man's got some serious soul.  He makes it look easy, but that's just Joe bein' Joe.<br /><br />BIG GLARING CON:  The editor should be taken out behind the Rockpalast and beaten senseless, and be forced to wear Eric Czar's stinky, sweat-stained do-rag for the rest of eternity.  The viewer is practically forced into seizures from the spastic \\"artistic\\" camera angles.  I do not need to see a skewed view of the drummers boot in the middle of Joe's brilliantly blazing solo, or cutaways and weird tilts or zooms every 10 seconds.<br /><br />I just can't give the DVD less than 5 stars, though.  The musical performance transcends the camera editing.  The band is super tight, spot on - what a fantastic trio. Just.  Wow.  Buy up a few copies and give 'em out to guitar lovin friends and family - spread the word about Smokin Joe Bonamassa!

B0027BOL4G|4.0|I have been a vegetarian for almost all of my adult life and a vegan for the last few years.  I started out for ethical reasons, but even if I stopped caring tomorrow I would still eschew animal products.  The way they are produced is just too scary.  I've been reading about these issues for over twenty years, so there was little that surprised me.  For me, the value of the film was showing the human costs, both direct and indirect, in our food system.<br /><br />Let's back up- this film and many others like it would have you believe that McDonalds, Walmart and Tyson invented the model for the farm, restaurant and supermarket as factory.  They didn't.  We've been mechanizing our food systems to the best of our ability since we started trading in and consuming sugar.  The scary part now is that we can do it so much more \\"efficiently\\" than we could before because our technology has improved so much.<br /><br />The hell of sugar was the way it not only depended on slaves but literally destroyed them.  Slavery has been outlawed, but the conditions under which laborers in the food industry work are little better than what the slaves labored in.  One of the farmers makes the point that \\"Big Food\\" previously depended on African American men to, literally, do their dirty work.  Now it's undocumented workers.  One of the prices our country pays for cheap food.<br /><br />The story about the little boy who died after eating contaminated hamburgers- and then the inability of the corporation to apologize- drew both tears and indignant gasps.  And well it should.  Even worse, what people can say about food companies- Food, Inc- is heavily restricted.  When someone can sew Oprah Winfrey for speaking out against a food company, no one is safe.  And that's a shame.<br /><br />It was the story about the small family trying to balance the costs of food and health care that showed what the true cost of our food system really is.  Other organizations have cited that we spend the same 26% of our incomes on healthcare and food combined as we did forty years ago.  The difference is that we used to spend 18% on food and 8% on healthcare; now it's reversed.  Actually, the biggest difference is that we used to have a better quality of life when we did.<br /><br />It's a powerful film, especially for children, especially for meat eaters (although the message is emphatically not that everyone has to become a vegetarian).  But... it's not the comprehensive indictment of the food system I thought it would be.  They focus on one quirky, independent farmer as part of the solution.  What about more about CSAs?  What about how to make all of that work in a city?  (It felt like this, as well as many other films on the subject, was talking to someone in the suburbs.)  And while I understood what they were saying about Walmart being potentially part of the solution, there's A LOT more to that story, such as how vulnerable businesses become when 40 to 60% of their business becomes dependent on Walmart- and keeping them happy.<br /><br />This is a very good work and it should be required viewing in school.

0811876373|5.0|I just got my Cake Pop book yesterday and let out a little squealed with of excitement when I opened it. It has so many creative and cute ideas. I can't wait to start baking and decorating. Diets beware! My friends and coworkers will soon be hit with an onslaught of confectionary cuteness and sugary goodness as I try out the different designs.     Also, as a designer myself I have to commend the designer of the book. It is FANTASTIC! The typography, photography, colors and graphic details are all perfect for the theme. I am in love!     It is easy to read and easy to find things. There are lots of tips, tricks, and notes that make it even more fun and informational. Some things are a little repetitive, but it makes it so you don't have to constantly be flipping back and forth... which is handy when your hands are covered in cake.
B0031OCY2E|4.0|This is a very funny film and Matt Damon is perfect as a goofy-yet-conniving corporate schlub. What \\"The Informant!\\" is not, is slapstick. It didn't need to be . . playing the material straight was the right choice. The combo of Mark Whitacre's sincere cluelessness (\\"I'll bring down the company and then get to run it!\\"), hubris, and a stunning ability to believe his own whoppers was absurd . . and fascinating because it's all (or mostly) true.    The alternately stunned and incredulous looks on various FBI officials' faces as each new, game-changing \\"minor\\" detail surfaced was priceless, and was probably not far from the real agents' responses. I looked up the real Mark Whitacre and my first impression is that he really is that bass-ackwards. And now he's the COO of a different company. You can't make that stuff up.    This film was generally appreciated by professional critics and tends to polarize viewers. To me this is akin to a stamp of approval . . Soderbergh committed to specific storytelling and visual styles that won't appeal to everyone. Going for mass appeal when shooting quirky material like this (high-concept it ain't) typically results in a generic, forgettable experience that earns a lot of \\"It was OK\\" verdicts. \\"The Informant!\\" is deservedly getting \\"loved it\\" and \\"blows big time\\" votes in equal measure.    If you tend to enjoy understated, unique critical hits that confused and frustrated your average audience member, this is worth two hours. If you tend to dismiss the snooty critics' pronouncements and only enjoy pratfalls, one-liners, or underlined, rim-shot comedy, then don't waste your time. No need to torment yourself.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|[[ASIN:B0036EH3WK Lost: The Complete Collection [Blu-ray]]]  This is an amazing complete collection of the entire series.  I was on the fence about buying it for a while, not really wanting to spend the $200 for something that I have already seen.  But then I thought that it's only a little over $5 per blu-ray disc and that's not bad at all.  And now that I have it I am very happy with my purchase.  Actually for me to buy the complete series like this made a lot of sense.  I didn't become a fan of the show until the final season.  I caught up by watching the first 5 seasons on Hulu.  Needless to say, the Blu-Ray discs are a major improvement (plus I get all the bonus material).  Stunningly beautiful, especially for a TV show.  Being set in the lush, tropical location of Hawaii certainly helps there.  One drawback though is that some of the darker scenes tend to be a little grainy.  I turned the brightness level down on my TV and that seemed to help.  I am now in the process of rewatching the entire series.  I have to say that things make a lot more sense the second time around.  I really can't get enough of this show.  It is intelligent, thought provoking, beautiful, and emotional.  The episodes just seem to fly by.  There's never a time where I even think about pushing the fast-forward button.  LOST ranks up there as one of, if not the, best television show of all time.    That takes care of the blu-ray discs and the show itself.  As for the packaging, I give it an A+ as well.  All of the materials are of high quality.  It comes in the pyramid shaped box that you see in the picture.  The picture there really doesn't do it justice though.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is made of a thick cardboard and is coated with a rough, stone-like texture.  And it has a good feel and weight to it.  There are many cool little extras inside the box as well, from the Senet game that comes with real black and white stones to the small metal Dharma flash(black)light.  Then there are many \\"secrets\\" hidden in the packaging.  I found a few of them, but I am still looking for the instructions to the Senet game.  All in all a very well put together product.  You can see that the developers really put some time and thought into designing it.
1400052173|3.0|I found the beginning of this utterly captivating, very hard to put down.  Skloot does a good job of addressing the science behind the subject without making it too technical.  The part where the story derails is when the family gets involved, particularly the time spent with Mrs. Lacks' daughter, Deborah.  The author seems to focus more on the struggles of Deborah and her apparent disabilities, maybe in a human-interest sort of way, but I felt that it began to become a bit more exploitative.  I think it is very important to shine a light on the unethical way the black population was treated by the medical profession and how shameful it is that the Lacks family has not benefited in any way from the massive scale of production of the HeLa cell line.  If this book had merely contained the first half, or left the drama of the second half out or at least shortened it some, I think this book would have appealed to me more as a whole.  I would certainly recommend this to friends, but with a disclaimer of the soap-opera like drama that comes in at the end.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Our family loved this movie.    It is well written, acted and produced.    I was very impressed with how well they portrayed the story and am very happy that we purchased it. This is a movie we have already watched multiple times and will continue to watch it.
0061992860|5.0|I already reviewed positively the full sized book. Only thing I would add here is that it is the same content, but packed into a tiny size so you can take it with you anywhere. I have one in my car, and another copy for when I travel.     This is the type of book that comes in handy when you are dealing with an emergency far from civilization, or when emergency services can't respond. Very comprehensive, yet easy to carry and keep with you.
1597801585|4.0|This book is as hard to review as it is to get into. At least for me. One of the reasons may be that I hardly ever read science-fiction. It's simply not my genre. But when I stumbled across an excerpt of 'The Windup Girl' and read the reviews - well, I simply needed to read it myself. And I'm happy that I did.  It's a dark story, set into a dark world. A world of corporate domination, controlled by 'calorie companies'. A world shattered from worldwide epidemics and famine. A world where global warming has raised the sea levels and carbon fuel sources are nearly gone.  It seems to be a world without much hope and yet - as long as humans exist, there will be hope or at least a struggle to survive. And sometimes the same goes for non-humans.  Paolo Bacigalupi paints a disturbingly plausible future. Maybe someone will pick up a copy of this story in two hundred years and marvel about the author's foresight. And maybe everything will turn out differently.  Still, Paolo Bacigalupi wrote an engaging story with multi-layered characters that is well worth the effort to get into, even for those that usually don't read science-fiction. I'm happy that I did. It's a book well worth reading.
B002ZG9968|2.0|What were they thinking?  Obviously they weren't, with such a ridiculous film.  The sad thing is it's a waste of good talent.  JLo has great charisma on film and Alex O'Loughlin was hypnotic in Moonlight yet somehow managed to come across in this film as a real nerd.  So many gimmicks in the film and an unbelievable 8th grade dialog and plot make this film simply unwatchable.
B001Q2RXJ2|2.0|I have just bought the 3 re-issues and the first two cd's sounds just fine. BUT... I am afraid to say that something is terribly wrong with Strong Arm Of The Law. Mekon, have you noticed this?  You here it already in the thunderous intro of Heavy Metal Thunder, after 14 seconds.  A strange hissing, harsh noise over the sound, a thing I have not heard since the first KISS cd's were released (they fixed it with the remasters).  Also, the tempo is slower than the previous release. The track times are longer than they were originally.  It's probably a huge mistake, done at the mastering process, and somewhere lies the good mastering around. Did they use the wrong data files? It is that bad.  How can we let EMI and Saxon know, that there's been a terrible mistake?   There is definitely also some soft hissing noise on the intro of track 3, Strong Arm Of The Law. Barely noticeable, but it's there for sure, and also in the solo. Pay attention to your left ear on the headset. (if the wiring in the shop was ok, in any case, the hissing is on the same channel as the 1st track, Heavy Metal Thunder).  Furthermore, I noticed it on 20,000 Ft., the intro of Hungry Years (the soft guitar part before the song starts off), and the intro of Sixth Form Girls.  I don't think I'm crazy and hear things that are not there. I listened to the other cd's also very carefully. But I'm sure the Strong Arm re-issue has some serious issues (no pun intended). Unfortunately, because it is my favorite album. So, maybe some of you guys, I ask you once more, take a good head set on a good system, crank it loud enough, but not too loud, and pay attention. Maybe you pick it up too.  I almost begin to feel like Fox Mulder from the X-Files, that I am the only one who hears things that shouldn't be there......
0790729407|5.0|This is a good film however you should also watch \\"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\\" to get both sides. Both very well done films, both two opposing views.

See his troubles of keeping his countrymen alive and professing Irish independance at the same time.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|For me, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button stirred up an assortment of emotions. Where in the world did the writers get such an idea? What came to mind immediately when I realized what was going on was PROGERIA, a rare progressive genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly? I'd watched a few documentaries on it over the past few years, and what happened to Benjamin Button seemed to be the reverse. That could have been a contributing factor to the unsettling emotions it elicited.<br /><br />As bizarre as the situation was, the story held your attention from beginning to end. The acting was outstanding. The emotions that surfaced were bountiful. It really made you stop and think...about life, people, love, those that are different then us.<br /><br />The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a story that will remain with me for a very long time.
076790592X|4.0|I read this book for my high school summer reading because I thought it was going to be a quick and easy read, but it turned out to be me much more than that.  \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is a book about Mitch Albom and his favorite college professor, Morrie Schwartz.  Over the years Mitch and Morrie lose touch until Mitch see's Morrie on TV and discovers that his favorite professor has Lou Gehrig's disease.  Mitch decides to visit Morrie, not knowing that his weekly visits will soon change his life forever.      At each lesson, Mitch watches Morrie's illness progress.  Soon Mitch discovers that his weekly meetings with Morrie are more than just a visit with an old friend, it's a discussion on how to live your life.      \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" turned out to be a truly inspirational story.  Mitch Albom's writing style not only kept the book interesting, but he also taught me a valuable lesson.  Enjoy each day as if it were your last.
B001B1R1HC|5.0|The name of Sviatoslav Richter evokes an emotive resonance in which converge such pathos as passion,febrile tension and refined lyricism with inimitable results.<br /><br />Such curious phenomena is the outcome and not the cause of a indomitable capacity of concentration understood as introspective and thoughtful effort in consonance with the empathy of each composer in question. That's what explains his wide rank of sound. Since Bach and Haendel until Prokoviev or Hindemith.<br /><br />That feature confound to most of critics who are always trying to search and adjective capable to label into the well known categories. Is he a classical, romantic or contemporary pianist ? All of these fit but no one of them can describe him by itself.<br /><br />In this sense Richter is a true Renascent artist. It's not a mere casualty his main hobby has been the painting. And due it, he has the power to embody with admirable accuracy the minimum facets around the particular without losing universal approach.<br /><br />And the evidence is right here in this album where captures him in sum grade.

0553805371|4.0|This will be an important book, if only because of its co-author.  It is also a very interesting one.  Essentially, it summarizes the most recent developments in physics and cosmology and leans toward an `explanation of everything' using M theory.  Hawking doesn't quite clinch the deal, but says that M theory is the best possibility available for satisfying Einstein's dream of an all-encompassing, unifying theory.<br /><br />Commentators who know far more physics than I have been more guarded and readers should be aware that the putative claims of the book (for a be-all, end-all, final explanation of the grand design) are made more tentatively by the authors than the publication hype would suggest.<br /><br />Reviewers are likely to seize on the book's claim that--under the assumptions of M theory and under the authors' other assumptions--the universe could, in effect, create itself and that there is no need for God in the process.  I am already seeing commentators focusing on the no-need-for-God argument.  Early in the book the authors argue that philosophy is dead, since it hasn't kept up with physical science.  Perhaps, but my gut sense is that philosophers could challenge the `philosophic' elements of the book fairly easily.<br /><br />For example, the fact that God is not `required' for an explanation may `imply' that God was not involved, but it does not `prove' that.  God could have decided to create His universes by following the dictates of M theory, just as He might have decided to create our particular universe with evolutionary principles that could square with Darwin's.  God works in mysterious ways we have long been told and, `historically,' as M. H. Abrams long ago argued, He moves in dramatic, right-angled-turn, surprising ways.  There was nothing and suddenly there was light.  There was heaven and suddenly the revolt of a large chunk of the angels therein.  There was paradise and suddenly sin.  And a redeemer.  And His crucifixion.  And His redemption.  And, hopefully, ours.  Believing that one can read God's mind or explain His universe with human science may not be a great career move.  Hawking's late 17th-century Royal Society predecessors were very guarded with regard to `causal' or `essentialist' explanations, believing them to be, by their very nature, beyond human capacity.<br /><br />I am not a physicist, but when I read the authors talking about the Big Bang and the fact that an infinitesimal amount of matter (with the help of gravity) could become a set of expanding universes, I hear my old philosophy and theology teachers in the back of my head, asking, `but where did this matter come from'?  and `what about this gravity'?<br /><br />The book is a fascinating one, written with lucidity and clarity and a touch, here and there, of humor.  The authors' take on the new developments in physics are fascinating and the book is a quick, pleasant read with attractive illustrations.  As with all such books, its ultimate conclusions should be tempered by the arguments of other voices within the scientific community and it would be prudent to allow the philosophers and theologians to venture an occasional opinion.s.

0439023513|5.0|Rarely have I been more satisfied with the conclusion of a series than with Mockingjay.  The tone of the trilogy has been edgy and dark; and Collins refrained from ruining that with a fluffy happily-ever-after.  Certainly, we know the heroine will survive and pick her man.  Rowling couldn't kill Harry, and Collins doesn't kill Katniss, but she does put her through hell. Katniss is forced to make choices that eat at her soul (when do you cross the line from necessity to cruelty during war?), and she suffers under the guilt of so many deaths caused by her actions.  And there are a LOT of casualties before the revolution reaches its climax.  Peeta was captured at the end of book 2, and he doesn't escape the Capitol without being tortured.  He is almost unrecognizable from the character in the previous books.<br /><br />This book is very different from the previous two in pacing and attitude, which will likely throw some fans off.  Those were action-adventure stories.  Katniss fights for her life using her wits and bravery in the arena.  This is a war novel (as it had to be).  District 13 exists, and is nearly as totalitarian as the Capitol.  They want Katniss to be the face of the revolution, to inspire the rebels, but they also want to control her.  She becomes a true pawn in a game between President Snow of the Capitol and President Coin of District 13.  She believes in the cause, but not always the means.  War is not an adventure, so there's a lot of waiting and introspection, then boom! - a lot of hurried action, then more waiting.  It did make the book somewhat disjointed.  However, the novel becomes very fast-paced once the assault on the Capitol begins.<br /><br />I truly expected a cop-out on the love triangle with the author killing off one of the boys so Katniss didn't have to choose.  Instead, she creates a very realistic scenario that in hind-sight seems so obvious but while reading is very suspenseful.  And, it is not a cozy ending.  Though both have survived the war physically, mentally they have been broken down and nearly destroyed.  I also like that though Katniss is in near-constant turmoil over the consequences of her actions, she doesn't hesitate to do what is necessary - especially during the assault and the very end when faced with the resilience of human cruelty.<br /><br />Overall, though I had some issues with the book (mainly the uneven pacing), it was a spellbinding novel that I could not put down.  Highly recommended.hysically, mentally they have been broken down and nearly destroyed.

B0028DRGDQ|4.0|REC, directed by Jaume Balaguero and Paco Plaza, is a 2007 Spanish horror chronicling the assignment given to reporter Angela and her cameraman Pablo, employees of a television show documenting the goings-on of Barcelona's nighttime world.  For this episode, Angela and Pablo spend the night in a fire station conducting interviews and recording any subsequent developments.  Cursory introductions and plot explanations are promptly executed before the firemen are called away with Angela/Pablo in tow to an apartment complex for a woman in distress.<br /><br />I'll avoid any story specifics from here on because the horrific calamity most certainly deserves your own discovery, not mine.  I will say that there is an undead theme here, but with a unique derivative that I did appreciate.  Vague, I know, but American horror's blatant spoon-feeding of basic plots has pushed me in a foreign direction.  Because of this, I hate to give anything away about a movie that has so dutifully worked at a progressive watching experience.  Not to say REC is some sublime labyrinth of genius writing, but it is textured enough to be notable, considering the subject matter.<br /><br />REC is disturbing, volatile, and there were a few scenes that really did startle me.  The end of the movie houses one of the most petrifying character situations I've seen.  For these alone, the effort here, to me, is a win.<br /><br />The only problem I had was with the camera work.  I'm not unfamiliar with the shaky-camera style of filming, in fact, Blair Witch still hovers in my top-ten favorite movies of any genre.  REC hit it a little too hard, though.  Consider that in both Blair Witch and Cloverfield, the, \\"protagonists\\" did much better jobs keeping their cameras steady than the assumed professional in REC.  Jitters add realism to these films, but Senor Pablo exhibited grand mal seizure symptoms while standing still in a hallway.  It got old.<br /><br />Aside from that, this is a groovy little rush of cheek-ripping celluloid that should absolutely be required viewing for anyone interested in first-person horror.<br /><br />Well done, Spain.  I hope you'll allow my representation of the American proper so that I may apologize for our horrendous remake of your fantastic original.<br /><br />- t -uld absolutely be required viewing for anyone interested in first-person horror.

B000A88EVE|4.0|Upon its initial release overseas, 'The Man Who Fell To Earth' was a critical and box-office success. Somehow, it got hacked to shreds while crossing the Atlantic by its US distributors, and by the time it made its stateside debut, it was deemed \\"incomprehensible\\" by critics and largely ignored by audiences who weren't already enamored with David Bowie (who makes his screen debut), as it had no other star power behind it. It was considered \\"genre-less\\", and therefore unmarketable.<br /><br />Time has proven extremely kind to this film, however, and today it's hailed as visionary and ahead of its time, and this is quite true on both counts. It's not necessarily a literal interpretation of Walter Tevis' book (he also penned 'The Hustler', the film that placed Paul Newman on our radar) but it captures the existential loneliness that lurks inside us all, and the unspoken parallels to Jesus Christ are hardly veiled though never waved as flags either. It's about a savior coming to Earth not to save us but his own family and kin, and who is, in effect, mocked, crucified (theoretically) and buried (or in this case, drowned in a sea of alcohol).<br /><br />With its linear, fragmented storyline, disjointed narrative and genre-hopping visualizations, Nicholas Roeg is more preoccupied with showing us how life on Earth is  much more bizarre than the alien planet Thomas Newton (David Bowie) came from, which didn't go over big with sci-fi buffs of the 70's. No grand spaceships, alien monsters, or hi-tech wizardry to ooh and aah over.  The constant cross-cutting panorama of 20th century living mingled with the absurdist television lifestyle that was becoming more predominant back then (and continues to this day) is the cornerstone of the film's disassociation with what's real, both to us and the alien in our midst.<br /><br />The Criterion treatment is a marvelous way to become introduced to this film and book, as a copy of the book is included to cross-reference the two for comparison's sake. A beautiful slipcase to house both, a two disc version of the restored film and a second disc of welcome extras (though no interviews with Bowie are included - why?), interviews with screenwriter Paul Mayersberg, Candy Clark and Rip Torn, commentary with Buck Henry, etc. as well as a beautiful booklet of essays and wonderful pics of both the film and behind the scenes make this the quintessential edition to add to your library.

0385504225|1.0|Bad.  If you like books that hide information to keep you reading, mislead the reader so they can surprise you later with the truth, and claim to offer revelations that amount to shallow aphorisms, then this is the book for you.  Hey, we're all God.  Now you know the central message of the book.
0316067938|5.0|Stephene Myers is great and I can't wait for more books to come out.  I wish they would make a tv show out of it.  There is nothing wrong with happy endings and I never knew what was going to happen she kept me wanting more.  I loved the book and now I am having a hard time wanting to read anything else.  Someone always has to ruin something good.
B003JTHETY|2.0|Im a big Iron Maiden fan who saw them in concert before this album came out. I liked the single El Dorado and was ready for a great album. What I got was a very slow, tedious, repetetive, and uninspired album. This album sounds too much like the previous 3 and the songs sound too much alike. Ive listened to this album daily for a month hoping it would grow on me but, it hasnt. There are some good moments on this album especially the guitar work. This is not singer Bruce Dickinsons finest showing. He sounds hoarse and his range is not at all what you expect from him. The vocals and lyrics are mediocre. This album is not as bad as the Blaze Bayley albums but, is not close to being a Maiden Classic like 7th son of a 7th son, Powerslave, Piece of Mind, Killers, Iron Maiden, Number of the Beast, Fear of the Dark, Somewhere in Time, Brave New World, or Dance of Death. Dont get the Mission edition either. What a ripoff. Hope Maiden gets it all straightened out. Musically I give it 3 stars but, I take 1 off for the ripoff edition.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|Ok. There are MORE pros than cons for this wipes case.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. you can attach it to stroller or outside of diaper bag.<br />2. it's made of much harder plastic than the cheap travel wipes cases that come free in the box when you buy diapers in bulk.<br />3. you can really open it with one hand, allowing your other hand to be holding baby.<br />4. easier to remove wipes than it is from those cheap travel cases (mentioned above in #2)<br />4. holds WAY more wipes than those cheap travel cases do<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  The case snaps shut but tends to open on its own too easily. Example: I was walking and only holding the case by the black strap so it was swinging with my arm motion. The case popped WIDE open and all my wipes fell into the dirt (we were camping)! LAME-OLA. But in the case's defense, i did have it chuck full of wipes. so it could have been the sheer weight of the wipes that made the case open up. nevertheless, now I am \\"scared\\" to hook it onto the outside of things bc i am scared the wipes will all fall out.<br />2.  Easy for a toddler to pull off the red button, but it does snap back on. Just make sure you put it back on the right way b/c one side of the button is raised higher than the other to aid your thumb when trying to push it open with one hand.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I'm not sure how I feel....delighted, hurt, dreamy, edgy.  All and none are true.  How about this book made me feel.<br /><br />There are many truths in the Mercy Falls world.  The first, Sam loves Grace.  The second, Grace loves Sam.  Now if only their worlds wouldn't keep shifting between them.  Finally Sam has made himself a real boy only to find Grace smelling more and more wolf.  Will her latent wolf infection make her one of the wolves lost to the winter cold?  Or will she linger in her human shell?<br /><br />Cole, a new wolf, doesn't want to be human any more.  Why he is the first to change into a human for the summer is beyond him.  In order to stay wolf, he would do anything to the point of freezing himself in the bathtub.  He is broken edges raking at everyone around him.  The only thing to blunt his self is the ragged edges of Isabel.  She coats his edges in hard reality.  Strangely attracted to Cole, Isabel blooms into a wonderously poisonous flower to entice him.  She is the brutal truths Sam, Grace and Cole fear to see, even as she stands by their sides.<br /><br />Even with all the shifting of their lives, the four of them make this book reach for the cold stars above and transform into breathless life.  A dead brothers shirt, paper cranes, a red coffee pot and scarred hands.  Each item is more than it seems.<br /><br />I loved this book.  I'm praying to the muses and the gods of poetry that Maggie Stiefvater writes anther book in this series.

0060853972|4.0|This is the first Neil Gaiman book I've ever read and I can safely say it is not the last.  This man is deliciously witty and this story is pure fun from start to finish.  The overall premise is that Armageddon has finally descended on the planet and is scheduled to erupt from a little village in rural England.  From the birth of the antichrist, however, things go terribly awry and what is intended to be a modern day administration of the book of Revelation instead turns into a gong show.  Angels, demons, witches, witch hunters, and riders of the apocalypse collide in a delirious tornado of social satire and I was absolutely laughing out loud at many a point throughout the story.  Highly recommended!
0439023513|5.0|I just finished The Mockingjay, and WOW!  What a read!  I have mixed feelings on the way it all ended, I just want it to keep going.  The author does such a great job at bringing you into Katniss, Peeta, and Gails world that I just wanted the series to continue.  This book was great, you really feel for the charcaters and all that they have gone through, and how it will effect their lives forever.  I really did like how it all ended it fit who Katniss is!  It also makes you think about humanity, and what we do to eachother today in our own world!!
1594488916|1.0|There's enough material here for a good magazine article, but not nearly enough for a book.   The subject, John Gilkey, is not especially interesting. His fascination with books is not based on any   great understanding of book collecting, but instead based on the rather pathetic notion that stealing books   will make him a respected--if not respectable--individual.     Bartlett does not bring any deep understanding to her subject--the book is mere reportage devoid  of insight. On the whole it is a disappointment and the advertising blurbs on the back are even less  accurate than usual.
1452892156|3.0|My daughter had to read this book over the summer for a grade in her Honors English class. I liked the fact that it was cheap, but on the other hand, what I paid for shipping I could have went ahead and purchased it out of the store. I wasn't to thrilled about that!
B003XU7VM4|2.0|To start off with something good, this book is a lot of fun IF you watch the TV show. Which I do. However, the book is very short (much thinner than the TV series shows with its props), and it reads like a TV show, not like a modern mystery novel.

0385737424|4.0|When You Reach Me<br />By Rebecca Stead<br /><br />Book Review:<br /><br />\\"Wow, cool\\" is a likely response when all of the sidewalk characters in Miranda's<br />Manhatton converge.  There is a compulsiveness about an author who has the ability to write tightly and Stead used this technique very well.<br /><br />A lot of things go on in Miranda's home and to add to these her Mom is about to be a contestant in a TV game show.  Mystery and tension emerges as they find a range of new things begin to happen in their lives.  These are strange things - and unusual behaviours from those she knows - its all very different.  And then she finds a mysterious note on a tiny piece of paper. She finds other notes left in strange places and she realizes that whoever is leaving them knows all about her, including things that hadn't even happened yet.  Sal who is Miranda's boyfriend doesn't escape either,.  He seems to have an integral role but this is unknown to the others.<br /><br />Our author has devised a plot which is revealed slowly and only in small pieces.  There are changes which affect individuals and these are developed by the careful mixing of the ingredients in the plot.  These changes are very well handled and brought to our attention by the great skill of the writer, the cleverness of the plot and the interesting characters built into the story.  Of course there has to be a happy ending and like an old Western movie, the story concludes with Sal and Miranda walking off into the sunset to their homes.  Sal gives Miranda his normal salute and she gives the evening sky a raised clenched fist.  Good stuff indeed!<br /><br />Missing shoes, missing keys and the excitement of the game produce a strong tale and this ends happily for all<br /><br />My rating for the story is 4 out of 5 but there will be some who will rate it better than that.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tom Hampstead author of the soon to be published \\"The Kingdom of the<br />Two Great Houses\\">
1597801585|5.0|With global warming and peak oil on the near term horizon, and companies like Monsanto which are already nearly identical to \\"calorie companies\\", the futuristic world envisioned by Bacigalupi in this novel presents a disturbingly plausible future for the human race.  Wrap all that up in good yarn with a satisfying ending and this book is a clear winner; and easy 5-star choice.  The last futuristic book I read which was this scientifically realizable was \\"Snow Crash\\" by Neal Stephenson, but that book kind of fizzled out and had a most unsatisfying ending.  This book delivers the goods.  Highly recommended.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I didn't really \\"get\\" the movie until afterwards when I started reading some of the IMDb reviews and board comments. I had heard that the film was done \\"backwards\\" but it didn't really click for me until I read a bit more. The movie is engaging and it makes you wonder what's going to happen next. In terms of the climax, lots of things cleared up by the time the black-n-white (forward) and the color (backwards) met up. That's when the movie really started making sense.    There were some gross moments that turned my stomach, but other than that, the violence was tolerable. It wasn't as bad as I was expecting.    Oh,since I did mark it spoiler, I believe that the cop was telling the truth about everything. For a few reasons, one of which was Lenny's memory of giving his wife an insulin shot. By the end, it seemed to me that he made up the story about Jenkins in order to \\"deal\\" with his role in his wife's death. And then his monologue at the end where he pretty much set up the cop so that he would be the one he went after was creepy. Lenny was pretty dangerous, and if this were real life, it would be scary for someone like him to actually be on the loose.
0385732554|5.0|Jonas an eleven year old, is preparing for the annual Ceremony when he will become a Twelve.In essence, he will be leaving childhood behind and beginning the road to adulthood. This is not unlike some religions which celebrate the attainment of age twelve with some sort of ceremony.However, Jonas lives in a community which is strictly controlled in order to preserve a kind of perfection that has serious flaws. When Jonas and others who have been declared a Twelve (no individual birthdays are celebrated; every child advances to the next age in December each year at the Ceremony),they are assigned a specific role in the community. This will become their life's work.Jonas discovers that he has been selected to be the next Giver, which is considered to be a great honor.However, Jonas finds out that this is not such a great honor because his training will be the most difficult of all the others. He also learns the great flaws in the society into which he has been born.   The author, Lois Lawry, has incorporated in this story many concepts which are cleverly presented in order to show that the world is not a perfect place and in order to obtain the kind of perfection that is purposed, all undesirables must be eliminated.I'm not sure these concepts are evident to the average young person in the age group for which the book is targeted.
B002VECLVY|5.0|Going into this movie, I had no idea what it was about (which is the way I like it), so I confess that I was somewhat thrown when I found that the lead character is gay, since this is alien territory for me.  But I decided to keep an open mind and persist, and I'm glad I did.  It turns out that the movie is ultimately about finding meaning in life - a topic which I've lately been exploring fairly intensively - and the gay aspect is only of peripheral significance (at most).<br /><br />As I interpret it, the basic message of the movie is that we can best find meaning by attentively savoring and appreciating the present moment, perhaps enriched by drawing on our fonder memories from the past, all while recognizing that we and our loved ones may die at any time, with little or no prior warning.  The movie hints at the possibility of an afterlife, but this prospect is never fleshed out and thus remains uncertain.<br /><br />While this is a powerful and important message, it's actually delivered in a rather subtle and nuanced way, in an atmosphere of persistent but quiet tension, so you have to pay attention and meet the movie at least half way.  And also be sure to watch the interviews in the DVD bonus materials, since they add important insights which could even be considered an essential component of the movie.<br /><br />The only significant negative thing I can say about the movie is that, while the goal was presumably to present a generally positive and hopeful message, my overall feeling at the end of the movie was more in the direction of sadness.  Perhaps I'm predisposed in that direction due to having myself lost a loved one not so long ago, but I think this aspect has to be mentioned, in case anyone expects that this will be a straightforward feel-good movie.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I do recommend this movie to anyone seeking a delicately powerful exploration of some of the deeper questions of life.
0439023513|3.0|About the best I can say about this book is that the trilogy is ended. It was more readable than Catching Fire but not by much.
0439023491|4.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" is a terrific read, picking up only a short time after Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games victors depart the train in District 12.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" is more adult than the original in the series. The themes are a little stronger, the imagery a bit more vivid and the emotions run deeper and are more complex. The violence is more intense than \\"Hunger Games\\", but not because the language is more descriptive, nor more creative (although \\"Catching Fire\\"'s Hunger Games are new and innovative). The story is large in scale. The characters actions have broad impact across all of Panem's districts. Collins sets the stage for a Panem-wide rebellion and, all of a sudden, Katniss' little world of troubles becomes something much more substantive.<br /><br />We explore Katniss' relationships further...things change between she and Peeta, and while the relationship differs from the first book, the intensity grows. We also explore her changing relationship with Gale. While older teenage girls should be able to relate to Katniss' up, down, and sideways feelings towards the two young men, younger readers will will have a lot to absorb. That being said, I didn't find anything inappropriate for more mature pre-teens and any teenager.<br /><br />This second book of Collins' trilogy is a real thriller and sets up what should be a terrific conclusion to the series. I couldn't get through the final 150 pages fast enough, and felt throughout that the story was providing a very satisfying continuation from \\"Hunger Games\\", and a relatively satisfying conclusion in itself. Granted, I won't have to wait long to read the third and final story in the series since it's already available, but I certainly understand the agonizing anticipation for \\"Mockingjay\\".
B002RSDW80|3.0|Meryl Streep did very well in her role as Julia Child. She was a dead ringer, for sure. If only this movie could've been made as a biopic for Julia Child only. I would've enjoyed that very much, and it would've been a far more interesting movie.       Quite frankly, I could've done without seeing the antics of the Julie Powell, whiny chica who was attempting to ride Ms. Childs's coattails. At first, when watching the movie, I couldn't understand why Julia Child disregarded her. Then I finally read Julie's book and viewed her blog, so now I completely understood why Julia Child blew off Julie and her insipid blog and cooking \\"stunt.\\"  Anyone who read Julia Childs's book knows that Julia's life was far more interesting. She was no victim of circumstances. She had gumption, vision, she took the bull by the horns and when she was disappointed in something or when things didn't go her way, she didn't go falling on the floor in a meltdown like Julie did. I wanted to smack the Julie character when I saw that!    Amy Adams did the best she could with the material she was given. I don't fault her for having to play the emotionally immature Julie Powell. The screenwriter does deserve some credit for actually making that 'sow's ear' into a reasonable fascimile of a silk purse. Those who plowed through Powell's whiny tome will know exactly of what I speak.    I thought Stanley Tucci did an excellent job portraying Paul Child, Julia's husband. As for those complaining about the politics in the movie and the way it was portrayed, I think that is an unfair thing. It's good to see a movie that does deal with the way McCarthyism impacted the lives of regular people, not just celebrities.     Still, despite its flaws, I think the movie is worth watching, as long as you don't expect too much.

0307454541|4.0|The first half of the book is tough to get through and I almost gave up but my wife pushed me on promising it gets better and books two and three in the series are must reads.  And so many people were raving I figured I couldn't just give up.  I'm glad I kept going.  There are just so many characters with difficult Swedish names to track that is what made the first half of the book tough for me....but once I got in the groove there was no looking back.  The next book in the series is better...(I saved it for precious vacation / beach reading)and I look forward to number three!
0307454541|1.0|Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is boring. If you can make it past the 600+ mind numbing expierence, you are rewarded with a clever ending, but getting there takes time, lots of time. It kinda reminds me of Tale of Two Cites. We have to discuss the grass before discussing what is happening on the grass. Regardless of what Hollywood says, this book is crap and you should just wait until the Americanized movie.
0439023513|1.0|*Spoiler Alert*    One of my two basic gripes is that this book felt rushed. Too much happened in too little pages. I felt cheated in descriptions and details. Sure we got to hear how a bomb goes off a hundred times but there was very little dialog or interaction between the characters. Events happened with no build up and little intro and after awhile everything started to blur together. It was choppy and I felt like Peeta left to figure out what was real and what wasn't. At the end all I could think was 'man, she must have been feeling a lot of pressure to get this thing on the shelves.\\"     My second is lack of passion and emotion. I cried when Rue died in book one, I felt great sadness over Mags and Nuts death in two. And then, Prim, the little girl who started the whole series dies in one sentence and I felt nothing. I wasn't mad that she died, I was mad about how she died. There was no emotion, there was no heart of feeling. I felt cheated. Likewise with Finnick, whose character I originally did not like. I though, 'oh great another picture perfect Edward Cullen character with perfect hair and muscles that all the girls want but can never really have. How original.\\" but then we learn about his rather complex character, his history, his back story. And then he dies a rather uncreative, shortly descried death only to be mentioned again in passing. Again, it wasn't that he died, it was how. He had the ability to die a hero, to mean something and leave a lasting mark on the revolution, on the future, to be a martyr for his new son and his mentally unstable but pure wife. It was set up perfectly and then boom, he dies because he isn't fast enough. They both deserve better. The readers deserve better. I almost feel betrayed.     And THEN after all of this, after this long journey, a multitude of death and pain for ONE goal. Kill Snow. We don't even know how he died. Choked to death on his own laughter or died by being crushed from a stampede of people. Are you serious!?! They might as well have all died for nothing. Which, in my opinion, they did. It made the whole story seem pointless.    I didn't want Katniss to have some perfect ending, it wasn't realistic, and I was going to be mad as hell if Katniss ended up surrounded by family in some mansion with a dozen little Peetas or Gales in some happy leave it to beaveresque utopia. But I did want to feel something other than anger and disappointment at the author who ruined one of my favorite series in a long time. It would have been better with out the epilogue, since there was a glimpse of hope in that last \\"Real.\\" You can almost imagine Katniss and Peeta suffering through a long and great battle to be happy again, to be whole again. And then the epilogue crushes that dream to bits with it's \\"life is pain and sorrow but it could be worse so grit your teeth and get through it\\" attitude. It made me feel sick. Cheated, disappointed and betrayed. That pretty much sums up my feelings about MockingJay.

There is no spark. No creation. No fire. Just a de rigueur, pro forma recitation of other artists' old songs, attached with a bill and huge paper attachment of lyrics.    I prefer quality.    I will not automatically buy Natalie's work again.    Please, listen to it before you buy it. Better yet, do not buy it, just get another copy of Tigerlily.    Shame. Fie on you! Go back to the work and effort that you put into Tigerlily and your other albums please. This let us all down Natalie!    Seth
0060775858|5.0|My almost 2 year old loves this book.  Personally I really struggled with ever wanting to read this book since it seemed so boring, but its a great first book for the little ones.  THey pick up on something different each time.  This has been one of our night time favorites and I can see why people love it so much.  It took till he was about 15 months before he liked this story, but it is perfect for a kid as early as a year.
0393068382|5.0|This book is so good that I just had to write a review in the hopes that it would help convince someone that this book is worth buying. It's well-written, funny, thoroughly researched, and compelling. I enjoyed reading it, but it also is packed with insights and information that we should be exposed to. I'm recommending it to all my friends and family because it's by far the best book I've read in years. I absolutely couldn't give it a higher score. I might be biased because of my interest in cognitive psychology, but no one could regret buying this book.
0962477060|2.0|I think this book and DVD will only be useful for a beginning or an intermediate player at best.  I bought this book along with two other books -- Guitar Fretboard Workbook and The BEAD Method of Fretboard Mastery -- in an effort to become more familiar with the guitar fretboard.  For many years, I've been stuck at the intermediate level, relying mainly on memorized patterns to get around.  I wanted to break away from that and be able to instantly find and identify notes and intervals anywhere along the fretboard.  Sadly, Fretboard Logic did not help me achieve this goal.    For beginning guitar players, learning about scales and chords can be a daunting task, and I think some of the patterns and abstractions found in this book may be very useful to them.  After all, most beginners don't want to sit down with workbooks or learn how to sight read -- they just want to play some rock songs, and this book can probably help them achieve that quicker.  However, the book becomes far less useful when it goes beyond simple major/minor chords and pentatonic scales.  In fact, the extra level of abstraction starts to make things even MORE complex than they would be without it.  Using fretboard logic, playing in E Phrygian may translate to playing in the G position of the C major scale with the root at the 3rd.  It's easier just to memorize the notes on the fretboard and the intervals of the Phrygian scale.  When you get right down to it, fretboard logic is just another position/pattern based method.  I don't really see any added benefit to using the CAGED system, but if anyone can explain it to me, I'm willing to listen.    I got a little more use out of the two other books that I purchased (mentioned above).  The Guitar Fretboard Workbook in particular introduces many of the same insights found here, but does a better job of presenting them.  Instead of the CAGED sequence, it numbers the positions based on the root notes.  While this may not seem to like a big difference, I found that identifying positions by numbers is far less confusing than identifying them by their open chord shapes.    I want to add that I bought this book and DVD (verified purchase) after reading many glowing reviews, and I was disappointed to find that the book had nothing new to teach me.  I believe my disappointment stems mainly from a misunderstanding of the book's intent.  Fretboard Logic IS NOT a fretboard trainer.  It doesn't even explain \\"the reasoning behind the guitar's unique tuning\\".  Rather, its real intent is to give new guitarists a gentle introduction to chords and scales, and provide them with some simple tools to apply that knowledge.  Therefore, if you already have a basic knowledge of music theory and you are relatively comfortable with pentatonic and diatonic scales, you will not find much use out of this book.  I think the book can be okay for beginners, especially for those who are \\"visual learners\\".  However, there are plenty of books/DVDs out there that are as good or better.    For guitarists who are looking for a freboard trainer type book, both the Guitar Fretboard Workbook and the BEAD book were okay, but I think you're better off simply learning how to sight read and working through a book like \\"A Modern Method for Guitar\\".
B003Y5H59C|5.0|A real hoot of a comedic-drama that attractively portrays the alternative sex world in the simplest of plots;  : Boy meets girl, looses girl and re-finds girl. It's hard to notice because of the unusual behavior and visual and sonic styles added to by Angelo Badalamenti's score reflecting the overall quality of the production. Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader light up the screen with tender anger and love!  A gem of sorts.    A/V; BD is competent in all ways ... soft image and grainy skies momentarily appear but the pic is strong and the sound has tweets and woofs at times.  Xtras; good feature and commentary add insight to production

What should/could have been a beautiful, poingient ending to such an epic story fell completely flat on everything that made the first two books wonderful: brilliant pacing, thoughtful character development, and complicated relationships between those characters.     In sharp contrast, Mockingjay was a rushed, thoughtless ending to what seems to be a different story entirely from the first two books. War is full of human atrocities and horrors. I get it...you can stop beating me over the head with it after chapter two, Suzanne Collins.     I truly wish I'd stopped reading after book two.
0679720200|4.0|I first read The Stranger ([[ASIN:B000NVTL10 Albert Camus: L'&Eacute;tranger]]) in French Literature class in school. I recently re-read it in English, specifically the first (and it would appear from much feedback, the best) English translation, by Stuart Gilbert ([[ASIN:B000QIYPB6 The Stranger]]). The quotations I have chosen below, and for the title above, are from that edition. This is a fairly important point; see Postscript at bottom.<br /><br />==================================================================<br />\\"Mother died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure.\\"<br />==================================================================<br /><br />I found myself appreciating the book--for that matter, even Meursault's viewpoint on the world--much more now than I did as a teenager. Perhaps one needs a few years' worth of frustration (at bosses, and government, even traffic!) to get in the proper mood. Camus succeeds at asking, even in translated form, classic existentialist questions such as What are we doing with our lives? and Does anything really matter? The book could have easily been titled, \\"L'Ennui.\\"<br /><br />==================================================================<br />\\"I learned that even after a single day's experience of the outside world a man could easily live a hundred years in prison.\\"<br />==================================================================<br /><br />At just 150 pages, The Stranger moves along quickly. You could finish this in one evening's sitting, but the unease it leaves you with would last much longer. I recommend this short course in the Absurd, especially if you read it once (and moved on promptly) when you were young.<br /><br />==================================================================<br />\\"I decided that if ever I got out of jail, I'd attend every execution that took place.\\"<br />==================================================================<br /><br />Not an uplifting book, this. Still glad to have rediscovered it. We'll see how I feel in another twenty years! On my way out to view the guillotine, let me add that I never realized how closely Seinfeld's Finale was based on the trial in Part Two here.<br /><br />==================================================================<br />\\"Is my client on trial for having buried his mother, or for killing a man?\\"<br />==================================================================<br /><br />Postscript: Amazon has combined the product listings so everything is listed together regardless of translation. Know that there are three English versions: Stuart Gilbert's classic from 1946, Joseph Laredo's little-known effort from the early 80s, and Matthew Ward's more recent Americanized version.

1439181780|4.0|...The secret works and the more you read and learn, the better you become at getting what you want. you could have read Think and Grow Rich over and over and would have gotten to the same result, ot takes practice and knowledge till it CLICKS. exactly like a guitar, youneed to learm and practice and learn and pratice till you GET IT. there is nothing wrong with scret or all the others. once it satrts working youdont need to buy any other book but untill then, it pays to learn. justlike an education. u need to invest time and money, unless you re one of the few lucky ones who intuitively got it.
0783230370|1.0|This film is BORING!!! Granted,the actors are all right and Arolnd does not come across that bad but that's part of the problem. We wanted him to be bad in this movie. Out of all the films we wanted him to be goofy & over-the-top,Junior was the one. It's like it was written for a woman but at the last second,they got A.S. I give this film a 2 out of 10.
B002UJIY70|5.0|Well when this movie was in theaters I didn't pay much attention to it, but my friend highly recommended this, so I rented it on dvd when it came out and all I can say is that now this movie is one of my favorites. It has an awesome cast such as Timothy Olyphant ( awesome actor!), Steve zahn, and mila jovovich.<br />The movie is about a newly wed couple on their honeymoon in Hawaii and decide to hike a big trail when they hear about a couple that was murdered by another couple. Along their trip they run into a couple \\"different\\" couples, this movie is fully of suspense, I bought it on blu ray and it looks amazing on my 100\\" projector screen along with my surround sound. I highly recommend this movie!
0307454541|2.0|So, I finally get around to reading this INTERNATIONAL PHENOMENON.  Where to begin?  Hm... Well, first of all, it's really poorly written.  The writing style is trite at best, often choppy, full of unenlightened cliches, red herrings and loose ends that never get tied.  As far as the plot is concerned, the mystery is fairly predictable, and the plot \\"twists\\" utterly unoriginal, except to say some of them are just DISGUSTING for the sake of being disgusting.  People make a big ado about how the female protagonist is such an \\"original creation\\" and a heroine of post-modern feminism, blah blah.  No.  Lisbeth Salander appears to be just one of Larsson's (many) ways to exploit and glorify rape and female brutalization.  By the way, the book's title in the original Swedish is \\"Men Who Hate Women.\\"  That's right, even the original title sucks.  At some point, Lisbeth decided to sleep with the OTHER (utterly unimaginative) main character (who smells oddly of Larsson himself, and yet is apparently a walking aphrodisiac) only to first lament in the mirror the fact that she allegedly has no boobs.  Seriously:  a heroine for the ages???  Also, what's with all the product placement in this novel?  Was Larsson getting kick-backs from Apple?  I guess we'll never know now...<br /><br />Watch the Swedish film instead, which is much better than the book, seeing as it's free of Larsson's crappy writing and many of his pointless \\"plot details\\" (most of which involve everyone having sex with the Larsson stand-in anyways).
B002XTBEDI|2.0|Take my advice: stick to the First series \\"Cranford\\"...don't bother buying this...I was so disappointed.  The story line barely follows the first \\"Cranford\\" and there are so many new added people that it just doesn't make any sense at all.  I wish I had not wasted my money on this one.  The first \\"Cranford\\" was so very good and the story was wonderful...so I was really pumped to see the sequel.  But in the first 5 minutes of watching \\"Return to Cranford\\"...I thought \\"Uh-Oh\\" and I was right.  I normally love the BBC stuff but this one just stinks.  Not good at all.
B000001F29|5.0|Since this album first came out nearly 30 years ago - I was in Hong Kong at the time and remember buying the cassette in a little record shop in Wanchai - it has always been right at the top of my all-time favourites list, which for me is saying something considering my enjoyment of a number of different genres.<br /><br />The first track, I'll Find My Way Home, is full of positivity about the search for meaning and the benevolence of life, and slides effortlessly into the epiphanic and extremely dynamic State of Independence. These two tracks have been included in a number of Vangelis compilations and as a result have tended to overshadow the next two equally hypnotic songs, Beside and The Mayflower, the last of which features the mimicry talents of one David Coker, as does the title track, the extraordinarily creative and original Friends of Mr Cairo, with its changing melodies and sublime lyrics that weave between mystical experience and the appreciation of old films. Here's a sample from towards the end of the 12 minute track:<br /><br />Did you see in the morning light?<br />I really talked, yes I did, to that early dawning light,<br />And I was privileged to be as I am to this day,<br />To be with you, to be with you, to be with you, to be with you...<br /><br />After that comes what for me is the low point of the album, the rocky and rather out of place Back to School. Perhaps the lads felt a ballast was needed after what had come before. But the last song, Outside of This (Inside of That) brings back the sublime and hopeful mystical feeling that characterises the bulk of the album.<br /><br />Of the four Jon and Vangelis albums this is probably the most impressive, though others might disagree - certainly it is the most consistently excellent and shows both the highly original Jon Anderson and the magnificently gifted Vangelis Papathanassiou at their brilliant best.
B00006I53S|5.0|I was looking for a walk-around lens for my xsi because I am not totally happy with my 18-55. I was considering tamron 28-75/f2.8 and canon 28-135, eventually I got 28-135 partly because it would cost me less. I am convinced tamron can give me better low light performance, but really like the usm feature on canon lens and the canon brand lens on canon body.    Performance-wise, this lens give me no problem. Faster focus, sharper picture, longer range than my old kit lens. Losing a little wide angle didn't bother yet. The focal range on this lens really make it a perfect walk-around lens. It is heavy, but I never feel small and light weight are attractive features to me. If I have money, I don't mind carry 24-70 and 24-105 around either. The IS really works, the focus is quite and fast, and very nice bokeh when the long focal ranges are used. A nice macro feature, but don't dream too much of it.    Beside all the good things about it, there are some be noticed.  The front part does feel a little loose, a little more than my other canon lens. However, I haven't notice the unwanted barrel extension when point the lens down. Like I said in the title, it is perfect outdoor lens when light is sufficient. Low light performance is not too impressive to me. Again it should not be held against this lens because of its f-stops range. You'll need flash to compensate the light, and still get good photos.    Overall, it is a good product from canon. It has been there for ... almost forever. I can understand why Canon pairs it up with 7D, which is a semi-professional body.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I just got this bag delivered today and I was amazed as soon as I took it out of the box.  The quality of the materials on the outside are equal to the Lowepro and Cannon bags.  The padding inside was a concern of mine but this bag has more than enough padding to protect.  There are plenty of dividers that can be configured for whatever type of gear you carry, and when the bag is zipped up nothing can roll around.  Now to the big question- how much can it hold?  I have a Nikon D5000 with a battery grip and an 18-105mm VR attached.  A 55-200mm VR, a 35mm F1.8, a SB600 flash in its pouch, a Cannon 35mm  film Rebel, a cannon 28-90mm lens, and a small Sony flash memory video camera.  That all fits inside the bag correctly without having to cram anything together.  You still will have all of the pouches inside and a 2nd zipper section to fill with cables, cards or whatever. I was at a major camera store the other day and found exactly the same layout in a major name brand bag with the same quality of materials for $70.  The Amazon Basics line are definately my first choice when I shop from now on and I will definately recommend this bag to friends.  Thanks again to Amazon for saving me money on a great product.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Trust the reviews!  Ordered it, connected it, Works Well!  Great buy for the money!  Do not listen to the store salespeople!
B0001WE6U2|5.0|This is just like the one that I lost.  No issues on fit or finish because it is a Nikon product.
B003ZSIS6C|5.0|Chris Guillebeau rocked the online world with his manifesto, \\"A Brief Gude to World Domination.\\" This book is both useful and thought-provoking, providing both personal anecdotes and helpful suggestions for anyone who's not satisfied living life in the way everyone says you need to.    The book is divided into three sections. Part 1, The Remarkable Life, delves into setting one's own terms for living. This includes fear management and finding ways to \\"fight authority\\" without falling into the traps of ineffective sign-holding or getting beat up and arrested for smashing windows and burning down buildings. Part 2, Reclaiming Work, gives various strategies for making one's way without being permanently stuck in a cubicle doing mind-numbing work that is useless and meaningless. Part 3, The Power of Convergence, discusses finding one's legacy work and letting go of things which no longer serve you, be they excessive e-mails, clutter in your home or tasks you don't want or need to be doing.     Unlike other books of its kind, the Art of Non-Conformity features both description and prescription, offering useful suggestions and examples to help pave the way without being preachy. It is refreshingly idealistic without smacking of fantasy. It has an international perspective, and draws on inspiration of many people doing some great work around the world.    As a former wage slave turned freelance writer, the Art of Non-Conformity gave me many things to ponder, and I've been reflecting on changes I need to make both in my daily activities and long-term vision. I was also left with a list of useful resources and interesting people to look up. An added bonus is some great information on what Guillebeau terms \\"travel hacking,\\" which gave me some great ideas for an upcoming trip of mine.
0061122416|1.0|I think Paul Coelho as an author is interesting and wise, but this book was a big disappointment. It took me a long time to get through The Alchemist because I found the rhythm of the writing to be flat. Yes, the over all message was good, but it could of been summed up in the form of a proverb. I don't understand the hype of this book. I've read better stories for spiritual enlightenment, and metaphysical intrigue, this was just a drag. It's a shame too, because I was so excited to read it, being such a fan.
