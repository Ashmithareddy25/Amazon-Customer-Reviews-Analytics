B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great fun game for all ages.  You can play Vegas or standard style.  Also, the background and the cards can be customized.  All around awesome free app.
B003L77GRY|5.0|Love this show.  Haven't watched the full season, but if you've seen the other four, you know what to expect. Julia Stiles is fantastic.   The Blue-Ray is great. Excellent picture quality and easy to navigate.
B0000WPADK|5.0|Identical as a replacement for one built more than ten years ago. Happy to know that it was still available.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Force close each time the app is accessed. Rebooted phone and that did not help. Galaxy S Vibrant running 2.2.
B000O176Q6|5.0|The dvd arrived sooner than expected in excellent condition. It was for my boyfriends  xmas gift, he loved it. I recomend the product and who ever sold it (dont remember who lol)
B0011UJMK2|4.0|This book was extremely intense but also exhilarating.  A worthwhile read for sure, but not for those easily queesy or those who don't like thrilling literature.
B000GSA59M|5.0|Have'nt installed the software yet,im sure it will be great as I am pleased with this mixer,it is just what i needed,compact with enough mic pre amps for vocals,and easy too operate.
B005IGDW24|1.0|I specifically bought this for my girls for both the 3D and the digital copy.  The Ultraviolet Digital Copy is NOT a usable digital copy but instead a proprietary digital copy that I can't use on half my devices and on the ones it will work on it requires special software (flixster, which I might add crashes on my Dual Core 3GHz/4GB-RAM MacBook Pro after a few minutes of watching).  I contacted Sony about getting a real digital copy and was simply told UltraViolet wasn't compatible and nothing else was offered.  I am not impressed with this product or Sony's response.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Absolutely a must see.  The steamy Mad Men centers around the advertising world of Madison avenue in the 50's, more specifically star marketer Don Draper played by Jon Hamm, (he also had a small role appearing in the final scene of the A-Team movie as Lynch #2) Filled with a classiness no easily found in this day and age Mad Men is on track to be one of the best shows of the decade.  It's adult themes and subtle period chauvinism may be a little much but it is period specific and though gritty at times, it is a very watchable show.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|every song has a life of its own this is the best album from 2011 and my instant fav its an honest album this is the album that every band should listen to and learn how to relaese an album megadeth didnt just start thrash metal they had resurrected metal and kept it alive \m/
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is one of the most fun I have had. I believe that anyone with a kindle should have this game.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|By an excellent film story, and piece of film history.  As we like to say:   \\"they just don't make-em like they used to\\".    It is such an important part of the Christmas Season.    Film with a message should be the focus today..... sadly, it is not.    There's just something so real about \\"feel-good\\" movies.  I just bought Mr. Smith Goes To Washington... can't wait for it to arrive.  Thanks to you, Amazon, for making this film so available.  Season's Greetings...  Michael
0439023521|4.0|The book itself was awesome, the shipping was quick but the quality of the book wasn't the best...the pages were very thin and the binding not so great.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game its really fun to play you should try it well that's all that I have to say about this game.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|It would be nice to get instructions. How do I sub menu? I want to make a list of things to get at each store but can't without making each list a new topic. Doesn't make sense to me. I'll stick to Out Of Milk and Cozy for my shopping needs. This app just doesn't do it for me.
B005HSL626|5.0|I LOVE this game. The ads are a bit annoying, but that is to be expected. It's addicting. Also good for entertaining smaller children. I have it for the Kindle Fire and have had no problems with it. Really good app for free!
0316056863|2.0|Bottomline, if you want to read about some average female comedian's life, that has really nothing out of the ordinary about her then this is the book for you. It's not like she came up from the \\"mean streets\\". How about chronicalling your own middle class child's life and you'll get about the same amount of action. Totally unimpressive as a read and apparently as a person too.
B00005JKGO|4.0|I had never seen this Fellini film that the world was all abuzz about in 1960.  I do remember Anita Ekberg however as certainly did all teenager boys with a pulse.  As a Swedish-American actress coming to Italy to play, she has her most famous and memorable role.  Her drunken boyfriend in the movie is played by former Tarzan, Lex Barker.  In one scene, one of the paparazzo even says something to the effect of \\"can you believe he used to be Tarzan\\".<br /><br />The film is really centered on wonderful Marcello Mastroianni, who like other actors here, may be playing a version of himself.  He's a gossip columnist and full time party boy who is in action from dusk to dawn.  In fact most of the various scenes begin at night and end at the break of day.  Marcello (character's name too) is all about the party and of course, the women.  He lives with one, but cheats on her constantly.  He loves her and others but can't be tied down.  His friend and mentor warns him as he led a similar life at one time.<br /><br />The movie is sexy, fun, sad and dramatic at times.  Fellini manages to pull it off and adds some wonderful music to boot.  Most of the love for this film comes from the acting and the story, but the technical aspects are terrific as well.  Shot in stark black and white, it includes masterful artwork and cinematography.  Great cars from the era including a '58 TBird and a '59 Eldo, both convertibles, add industrial glamour.  Classic filmmaking.

B002ZG974M|3.0|Aw, aren't they cute.  Four babies, one from some remote African country, one from rural Mongolia, one from Japan and one from San Francisco are in fact, cute and fun to watch.  Even at 80 minutes however, it starts to get monotonous.  I guess the one takeaway, is that at birth up to about year one, babies pretty much are the same in any environment.  Another might be that siblings treat their younger brothers and sisters equally bad.  Perhaps the filmmaker plans on tracking down these kids every 5 years or so.  That might be fun to follow, but in the form of a 60 minute National Geographic special.
B0007939NO|5.0|My mother and I used to stay up and watch this film when I was a little girl.  I bought it for my mother for Christmas and it was the perfect gift!  Still a classic movie!
B002ZG99TK|4.0|Unlike his previous train movie (\\"Pelham 123\\"), Denzel Washington gets to drive the train this time.  Based on a real life incident, a mile long freight train carrying toxic chemicals is turned loose - by accident not terrorists - across the Pennsylvania countryside.  Frank (Washington) and Will (Chris Pine), become reluctant heroes who get stuck on the same track.  The film is the right length (98 min.) and has the right plot.  That is, not much of one.  Just the train hauling ass across the state.  Not much sidetracks the action.  Just how it happened, how can it be fixed and can it be done in an hour and a half.  Granted there's nothing of heft here, just thrills.  Yes, there are a few too many police cars showing up in critical scenes and one too many car crashes, but I sure liked the 70 mph locomotive demolishing things that get stuck on the track.  Plenty-o-fun.<br /><br />This is a solid Blu ray transfer with excellent detail and a vibrant (and loud) surround application.
B004LROUW2|3.0|As the title of my review states, this is my opinion.  I truly believe that everyone must decide for themselves if they like a particular book or not.  I will give you my views and hopefully this helps you decide if this book is for you.  Also, I read this on the kindle so my references to any \\"number of pages\\" is equal to pressing the forward button on the kindle that many times.<br /><br />Story:<br />The overall story of the book is interesting, a little strange at points, but interesting.  The ending could have been better...many things are left unresolved.  I won't say any more because I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone reading it.<br /><br />There are a few other small things that bothered me.  Like one of the main character's (Tengo) reactions to events surrounding him.  I understand this is fiction and the author can make his characters feel/say/do anything, but some of Tengo's actions were (to me) beyond common sense.  I can't think of one person that I know that would react in the way he did in some of the situations.  I could not relate to it at all.  It felt like Murakami didn't know what to say/write so he just filled some pages with whatever he could think of at the time and never went back to reread it for a \\"sanity\\" check.<br /><br />Style:<br />I don't like books that run on and on and on...talking about ALOT of things that don't contribute to the story.  Some side stories are fine but when an author takes 5 to 6 pages to explain something that will never be significant in the story, that's too much.  Murakami does this MANY times.  He also goes back and restates things MULTIPLE times to where it made me skip a paragraphs a few times to avoid reading the same or very close to the same words AGAIN.  Mr. Murakami, I'm not stupid, tell me once or maybe twice...4 or 5 times is too much to say the same thing.<br /><br />Another thing is when Murakami refers to other works in the story.  He doesn't just \\"refer\\" to them, he states them WORD FOR WORD.  Some places he goes for 3 to 5 pages with sections of someone else's book, reciting song lyrics, recapping someone's story.  WHY?  Just say what's important...I mean 1Q84 is about 900+/- pages!<br /><br />Overall:<br />As I said, everyone needs to make their own decision on any book.  I see the reviews on this book are very mixed.  I read ALOT and many of them I would read again or have already.  Most books I read (and finish) I would rate 4 stars, this one I gave 3 stars.  Did I enjoy reading it? YES. Would I read it again? NO!!!<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.sections of someone else's book, reciting song lyrics, recapping someone's story.  WHY?

B001JNND9W|4.0|This is one of those movies that got away from me. I don't even remember it or the 1997 remake. The special features suggest the movie bombed in the U.S. when it was first released but was a huge hit overseas. It then was re-released as the second half of a \\"French Connection\\" double feature. Still, somehow the cult classic lives on and I'm glad I finally caught up to it only 39 year later!<br /><br />I guess one thing that stands out and many who saw the movie remember is Gilda Texter's nude motorcycle riding and yep, it's worth watching. She gives an interesting interview in the special features as a now 60 something part time actress. Also fave, Charlotte Rampling shows up as the hitchhiker you dream about.<br /><br />Having said all that, this movie is about a '70 Dodge Challenger RT and some of the best stunt driving you will ever see. No CGI just exciting chases from beginning to end. Hidden underneath however is an understated political statement about freedom, cowboys and here it comes...the last \\"American Hero\\". The movie is hampered by a lame musical score, but fortunately does have a few good rock tunes here and there.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This movie is perfect for children ages 3-8years old.  It's a classic story about a boy and his friend the snowman.  Highly recommend for parents and teachers to show during the holiday season.
B00004CXX9|1.0|The Beatle juice DVD I purchase did not work. We were not able to watch the movie on Christmas day as planned. I currently still have the movie. Not sure what to do with it??
0553801473|2.0|After watching the fascinating first season of the HBO show I devoured all the books. Was incredibly let-down by a Feast For Crows, and while Dance is a little better it's not saying much. The book is too long and the worst part is that for most of it is just too boring.<br /><br />I understand Martin wanting to create an expansive and \\"realistic\\" world but he has lost his way and keeps on introducing new characters again and again. Especially when it comes to Dany's storyline there are so many new characters (not to mention the \\"older\\" ones are forgettable enough) that I couldn't keep track of who did what. He also keeps introducing new characters for the other storylines - Martin needs to focus a lot more.<br /><br />Skip the 4th and 5th books and wait for the TV show seasons instead. I think the TV producers will be able to scale back on all the extraneous stuff and focus more.

0374290024|1.0|Morris defines the \\"West\\" differently at different times. The \\"West\\" is seen as comprising Mesopotamia, Egypt and Persia in the years 14,000 BCE to 400 BCE, while in the years 400 BCE to 700 AD the West is confined to the Mediterranean regions. In the period 700 AD to 1300 AD the Western core is identified with the Islamic world, while from 1500 AD to the present with Western Europe and the United States. The West is thus seen to extend back 15,000 years.<br /><br />The \\"East\\", for its part, is defined as China from 14,000 BCE to 1900 and China/Japan from 1900 to the present. Morris claims that the West has \\"ruled for fourteen of the last fifteen millenia\\". The thousand or so years when the \\"West\\" fell behind the East happens to coincide with the period when the West was under Islamic rule--during the Islamic Golden Age no less.<br /><br />Why not define the \\"West\\" as Western Europe, North America and Australasia? Well, because that would present the inconvenient fact--to Morris in any case--that the West has been behind the East for 1,000 of the past 1,200 years. This clearly does not sit comfortably with Morris.<br /><br />In order to circumvent this inconvenience Morris defines the West in such a way as to prove that it--not the East--has been the ruler of the world for the past fifteen millenia. If Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia, and the Islamic world are omitted from the definition of the \\"West\\" it turns out that this region has been ahead of Western Europe/United States for 15,000 of the past 15,200 years...<br /><br />As to whether the West is in decline relative to the East or not.... Morris says that the East may catch up in the first years of the 22nd century if it gets lucky. By then, however, the question will not matter since the human race will either have become extinct through nuclear armageddon (Nightfall) or will have morphed into robotic ubermenschen (Singularity).
B0045XKJBI|2.0|I stumbled on to the Twilight series in the 3rd installment, so I had much to catch up on when viewing the movie with a friend who had seen it several times.  I bugged him throughout the movie:  Q. So who's this guy with the eyebrows, and why is he wearing so much makeup?  A. He's the hero - a vampire.  He needs to look undead, thus the makeup.  Q. A teenage vampire for a hero?  I guess he must be a \\"good\\" vampire, then?  A. Yes, he's a good vampire.  He and his coven fight bad vampires.  Q. But what does he do for food?  I mean, doesn't a vampire's dietary requirements pretty much drive his moral character?  A. No worries -- the good vampires have managed to become vegetarians.  Q. Very progressive.  So what's the deal with this other kid who can't keep his shirt on?  I mean, he's definitely ripped, but it's a bit gratuitous, even in a movie like this.  A. He's a werewolf.  He takes his shirt off when changing form so that it isn't ruined.  Q. But what about his pants?  They always seem to come back somehow.  A. Maybe they're made of Lycra or something stretchy.  Q. No, watch: he's a wolf right now - no pants.  Now he's turned back into a human - pants.  A. I don't know what to tell you.  Q. And what about this female wolf?  Somehow both her shorts and top conveniently reappear.    A. Maybe they needed to keep the movie in PG territory for demographics, okay?  Q. I will grant you that.  One final question:  Why are these two guys practically killing each other over this girl?  Aren't there any other women in the Pacific Northwest?  She's not especially pretty, and always seems to have a sneer on her face.  What gives?  A.  She's the female lead - take it or leave it.  Conclusion: If you are not a member of the target demographic for this movie, I recommend the latter option.
0525423842|4.0|In my youth, I read multiple installments of Encyclopedia Brown, a kid from a small town where his father was the chief of police. Brown solved mysteries, both big and small by deciphering clues with a Sherlock Holmes flair. Grisham has recreated the Brown prodigy as a kid from a small town with lawyer parents and a near fetish for all things legal. Sure he's a bit strange, but that's part of the appeal of the kid. It's never easy to write for youth, especially as a well respected author with a sophisticated, adult audience, but Grishman gives it his best and pulls off an eminently readable tale.  Boone follows the legal activities in the town, but also helps out kids with advice on minor matters as well as giving them an assist for their parents who are sometimes not well informed. In the course of Boone being Boone, he runs into some information that could impact an ongoing murder trial (which is a big deal for the town). Boone needs to be creative to see that justice is served without injuring any innocents along the way.  Hard core, gritty and coarse, this is not, but compared to what passes on TV for legal drama, this is far more captivating and kid friendly as well.
B003Y5H5C4|2.0|[THE REVIEW INCLUDES MILD SPOILERS]  Two delinquents Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson) want Dwayne's rich and domineering father (Fred Ward) dead. So, what should they do? Hire a hitman, of course. But they need money to hire one. OK, make a bomb, strap it to a pizza delivery driver Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) and makes him rob a bank.   The story of \\"30: Minutes or Less\\" starts off pretty well, but for all the talented cast involved (with Aziz Ansari as Chet, Nick's best friend), the film soon loses momentum, not knowing what it really wants to do. Even at 83 minutes (with a post-credit scene) the action/thriller/comedy feels very long.  \\"30: Minutes or Less\\" stars Jesse Eisenberg and is directed by Ruben Fleischer. They are also the star and the director of a more effective comedy \\"Zombieland.\\" Eisenberg, whose character in \\"Zombieland\\" was much more interesting, does his best here, but in the end most scenes are stolen by Danny McBride and Nick Swardson in \\"30: Minutes or Less.\\"  That leaves the viewer with no one to root for. No matter how desperate Nick and Chet may become, we simply do not really care. \\"30: Minutes or Less\\" is sporadically funny thanks to the cast, but in spite of some good ingredients, the film suffers from the half-baked writing.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I wish they would tell you how to play each game. I would rate it a five if they added instructions.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I liked this movie.  It is in the vein of \\"About Schmidt\\", \\"Ulee's Gold\\" and \\"Ordinary People\\".  It is a good sobering and uncomfortable view of some of the ugliness in life and about forgiving and moving on.  It ends on a positive note - a hopeful one for the family.  The scenery and cinematography are terrific.  Never been to Hawaii but now I definitely want to go!
B005V20JKI|5.0|The controls take some getting used to, but this game is a blast.  So much more fun than Angry Birds.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|A great fire case that is not bulky and does not add weight. I like that the fire will fit in your pocket. This case will add protection without increasing the kindle's size

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I enjoyed this game on all of my other Android devices, until I recently bought my Epic 4G Touch, for some reason it closes without warning. I can't even pass the seventh level, this is very disappointing and from what I read on XDA it seems to be an issue with the new Epic 4G, otherwise great game. It works flawless on the Tmobile Galaxy S II, LG Optimus V, and my HP Touchpad with CM7. Great game

0061997811|5.0|We're all huge fans of both the books and movies, so I bought this for my 15-year old--BIG hit! There's lots of articles about the making of the movies, as well as lots of little extras: pull out letters, Marauders Map, and other \\"artifacts\\" from the movies. I've found myself picking it up as well. Highly recommended for both children and adult Potter Nerds!
6304401736|4.0|I was very pleased with the item I ordered and it was received very quickly. I gave it as a gift. My friend has a dog that loves to watch animal movies. The dog loved the movie.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|The Debt is a fictional spy thriller about the Israeli Mossad searching out Nazi war criminals and they are after the \\"surgeon of Birkenau\\" Dr. Dieter Vogel. Dr. Vogel is the fictional equivalent of Dr. Josef Mengele, the infamous \\"Angel of Death\\".<br /><br />A team of three Mossad agents (Rachael, David and Stefan) are sent to East Berlin to find, identify and bring Dr. Vogel back alive to face trial for war crimes of mass murder and torture of 100,000s of prisoners. Rachael, the female agent is pretending she has medical issues and is visiting doctors to find him. She finds the right doctor and plans are made to kidnap him and extract him out of communist controlled East Berlin to face justice.<br /><br />The kidnapping goes well but the team's escape with the doctor fails and they are stuck in East Berlin with no easy way to get out. Having seemed to kill Dr. Vogel in an escape attempt the three return to Israel as heroes of the first order. They are placed in powerful positions in the Mossad for their bravery and courageous efforts. Thirty years later when sad death of one member of the team, David, reaches the other retired secret agents, they investigate what happened and discover news that can bring them all down and destroy their careers!<br /><br />This was a very good and suspenseful movie and the actors were outstanding. I did not mention their names as the movie changed time periods so often that every character had two actors and they all did a superb job. The rapid time changes occur very quickly and you have to stay on top of the story to follow the action and plot. This spy thriller is entertaining and suspenseful and you will enjoy it. Dr. Vogel will make the hair on your neck stand up so be ready!
B0000714BP|5.0|It was great. It was a present for a friend and she loved it! \\"This is so romantical!\\" It's a must buy.
B004YTGRMI|5.0|One of our sons is a huge R.E.M. fan and had this on his Christmas list. And where else to buy it other than Amazon??? In all the yrs. I have bought on Amazon Either I am very lucky (which I know I am not) or Amazon has the best service I have ran in to.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|I will lead with four facts. I love to discover outstanding soundtracks by composers with whom I'm unfamiliar.  I have not yet seen the movie.  I have not read Larsson's book on which the film is based, although I will. I'm 59 and love virtually all forms of thoughtful, well-performed music.  Here, then,  are some reasons to purchase and revel in this wonderful recording.   Except for the lead cut, a powerful cover of Zeppelin's IMMIGRANT SONG, this is a quiet, ambient, three disc collection at a price so low I find it practically amazing. So,you can actually LISTEN TO these 35+ cuts, half of which do not occur in the film, but still reflect its dark-hues and omens.  You can also WORK with it humming away.  The score is, with a handful of exceptions, low-key, synthesized, imaginative, atmospheric genius.  The engineering is splendid, too, although there are no notes whatsoever. I can live with that.  The same team composed last year's Oscar®-winning score, but I never heard those compositions nor saw THE SOCIAL NETWORK.  BUT, if you love really competent minimalism.  If you enjoy composers who develop scores based on stories or characters that are exhaustive and expansive, there's a lot to love here.  I will also pay the composers and producers two more compliments: (1)Because of the score, I'm reading all of Larsson's books and plan to see THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATOO next week. (2) I've listened to the album four times in its entirety, and will do it again.  It doesn't wear out.  Superb creativity and production in a tasteful, high-value package. These days, with so much predictable, derivative junk on the market, it's pure pleasure to strike gold.  At this price, I'd seriously doubt you could go wrong.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Perfect fit.  Great price (compared to the other overpriced Kindle fire cases).  The angle the stand ends up at could have had a couple more options (as it is now, it is a little too upright).  I'd like the option of a couple different angles (would have been two more grooves on the back of the case).
B002QFYJF4|5.0|At this point this movie is over 12 years old. I saw it soon after it had been released on video, and I'm sad I never saw it on the big screen.  With almost 700 reviews at this point, the plot and its implications have been hashed over repeatedly. I will instead give my personal experience with this movie.  The soundtrack is amazing. After 12 years I still listen to it regularly, and in fact I'm listening to it now as I type this review. It's sad and poignant, and the music and the movie fit together perfectly. You know those movies where they put in a random music video to evoke an emotion because the director was too lazy to shoot a real scene to evoke that emotion? That's not the role of the music in this movie. It's a power supporting element, but doesn't take over at any point.  At another point a few years ago, I sat down to watch a few minutes of the movie and didn't stop until it ended 3 hours later. I'm unable to put this movie on pause while I'm watching. When I first received the movie on DVD, I watched it, and then had to watch it again the next day because I wanted to experience it again.  Much has been said whether you \\"get it\\" or not, and whether the people who love this movie are film snobs. In this case, though, I think it's different. Film snobbery I associate with liking movies on an intellectual level. The people who passionately love this movie love it on an emotional and experiential level. There's no need to analyze why someone likes or doesn't like a movie. Just know that the polarization is out there.  Lastly, if you haven't yet seen this movie, you should watch it, and I envy you your opportunity to experience it fresh. Just remember that there's only 1 first time, and if you love it, be prepared to watch it again many times.

B006MHWXMS|4.0|Really the best thing about this app is the widget. Its got bugs, all minor, which will eventually be fixed. But compared to other task programs for Android out there its got a great set of features and a good and solid interface to go with it. The picture function for adding a picture to any given task is pretty neat.   Flawed but functional and complete in places that the competition is completely behind. Solud app of the day
B006MHWXMS|5.0|To the child leaving a bad review: rate the app not that you didn't get a free game.   Works with gmail sync on kindle fire. So many apps use google services framework, which is not on the fire. the UI is pleasant and easy to use.  couple of bugs though,  Jan 2012 has 32 days in due date picker. in landscape mode some of pop up lists should be white text on grey background, but are white on white  overall still a 5 star app. It's. a good app.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|I wanted a case that would hold my camera with a standard 18-55mm lens, but I didn't want a big bag that I had to lug everywhere. I wanted something that would protect my camera, but be slim enough to slip into my messenger bag so that I wasn't advertising to the entire world that I was carrying a very expensive camera. This case is perfect. You can fasten the case around the strap so that you can pop the camera out for a quick picture and not worry about holding or losing the case.  There is a small amount of wiggle room in the case where you could fit maybe a UV filter, battery, and some SD cards, at most. And they would just be in there loose, as there are no pockets.  The case flap where you remove the camera fastens with velcro--something to know if the noise would interfere with your photography. It's pretty quiet as velcro goes. I would have preferred this to be a snap, personally.  This case is perfect for me, but it may not be right for you. Think about what you want to use the case for--day trips, permanent storage, multiple lenses, etc.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this app is awesome! perfect for the kindle fire because its not too small like on an ipod or something like that!! its the perfect size!!! get this app!!

B004LROUNG|4.0|I have always been a huge John Grisham fan since I was 10 years old. I have read almost everyone of his books and I recommend almost all of them. There were a few in the recent years that were a bit of a disappointment. The Litigators did not disappoint. I read the book in two days this past New Years weekend! What a great read ! Suspense, anticipation, an unlikely outcome - all the ingredients for a good Grisham novel. Perhaps the one thing it was missing that is reminiscent of oder Grisham novels is a murder on the plaintiffs side perhaps that would have added to the drama a bit. But overall, very pleased with this latest novel ! Get the book !
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I love this CD!!! When I first heard the preview clips of this CD, I got chills! I felt like I was back at the Staples Center hearing her sing live! If you are or know any Taylor Swift fan who didn't get to go to the concerts, this is a must because like I said you feel like you're at the concert! It's amazing and what gets me every time, is that the recordings are so clears that you can even hear the crowd chanting the lyrics to the songs!! Totally recommend this to any Taylor Swift fan!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Love it. Use it on my android phone,  laptop, desktop, and now Kindle Fire. I access it at least two to three times a day. Great App!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|What makes this album unique is that it tells an entire story. We feel her love, her pain, and we can painfully empathize with the feel of a broken and mending heart.  It's obvious that the love she sings about is a haunting to her, and she carries us through with \\"Fire to the Rain,\\" \\"Turning Tables,\\" and \\"Someone Like You.\\"  Adele's sophomore album is refined, because she was obviously healing through her songs. Beautiful.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|Now I only hoped it was worth buying. It WAS! The packaging was handled with care and my movie being low cost. I recieved it as if it was brand new. The quality was awesome. Thank You!! &lt;3 LOVE MY MOVIE!!

B005H0IW6W|5.0|Loved this Christmas album.  Listened to it all December in the car and brought it in to play white we opened gifts.  Would highly recommend.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I've been watching season 1 on netflix, it's great.  Lots of energy, like a spy/action movie in each episode.  The lead, Maggie Q is believable and serious, and she's interesting to watch.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well, delivering solid performances.<br /><br />Nikita is much better than many other action type shows, this one's a winner.  Having almost finished season 1 as I write this, I'll be re-watching these in years ahead as well.  If you like beautiful women, 'black box' government agency assassin type shows with machine guns and solid story lines, like I do, this one's definitely recommended.  Thanks to all for writing/producing it.
0374532281|5.0|What a wonderful ride! Characters were genuine, plot was well thought out, funny with a great little twist in the end. Looking forward to picking this book up again next winter and giving it another read. E-A-G-L-E-S  EAGLES!
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book had me dreaming of the characters, great read and I look forward to reading the authors other novels.
0060873027|1.0|I am utterly disappointed by the story, the narrative, the style of writing, and, and, and.  We have seen a felt dozen or so 'shrinking stories' over the last decades, in black and white as well as colour - kids, scientists, little submarines, and other stuff - so THAT is not really new.  Unfortunately, neither are there any new laws of physics, which is why - even if we assumed for an instance that a giant magnet could in fact shrink matter - such matter would keep it's weight. Which is why, instead of merrily jumping around on the ground, our dear micro human students would sink into the ground like a speed elevator, concentrating the weight of a human body on the area of a rice corn. Ever stuck a knitting needle into loose soil with your full weight on it ? Well, there you go. In the fifties and sixties, this would have probably been forgivable, but today ? Give us a break.  As if this wouldn't be enough, the story is poorly written, full of logical breaks, flaws and inconsistencies, and the writing style is very bad, even for me as a non-native english speaker.   A shame, really, since the topic of the \\"micro world\\" in general is highly interesting. Nanobots, micro drones, little devices inserted into the bloodstream - all these are real, or will become real, and researchers around the world are spending billions of dollars in that field, be it for medical, civil, or military purposes.  It is very sad that \\"Micro\\" has omitted to really dive into this world - delivering a brain dead gonzo story, instead of a scientific thriller.  If Amazon would allow to rate \\"ZERO POINTS\\", I would do it. Unfortunately, though, therefore one star only.
034552554X|5.0|This was a beautifully heartbreaking yet uplifting novel whose elegant prose will grab you from page one. After being abandoned as a baby, Victoria Jones is bounced from foster home to foster home to group home until she is finally emancipated as an adult and must find her place in the world.<br /><br />Her traumatic \\"childhood\\" experiences have left her emotionally withdrawn and unable to attach...even after she is placed with Elizabeth who genuinely cares for her and wants to adopt her.  After a tumultuous year with Elizabeth, she ends up in a group home but Elizabeth, through her love of flowers, has given Victoria the only tool that she has for the genuine expression of her feelings---the old Victorian Language of Flowers.<br /><br />As an adult Victoria must now not only figure out a way to survive in the world, but how to break down her walls of anger, fear, and self hatred so that she can finally let love in.<br /><br />While this book is a frightening commentary on the foster system in this country, it is also an inspiring tale of those who can love truly and completely and the capacity that we all have within us for change, growth, forgiveness and love.<br /><br />This book is a must read.<br /><br />NOTE: I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Is it science fiction? Is it a Western? What is a lot of science fiction but a Western with bigger and more sophisticated toys?<br /><br />This is a big, gooey, hot-fudge-sundae of a movie, complete with eye candy. A rough-and-tumble character (Daniel Craig, the Steve McQueen of this latter day, looking like he's just been salivating to sink his teeth into a Western role all his life) wakes up in the middle of the desert with no memory and a peculiar device sealed on his left arm, the properties of which he has no clue. He also has a nasty wound in his side. While he's trying to sort this out, miscreants chance upon him and discover that perhaps they should have just kept going, as he deals with their attempts to interfere with him in an almost offhand way, adopting their dog as he does. His efforts to mend his injury at a seemingly deserted homestead turns up his first ally, a crusty preacher (Clancy Brown, a great utility actor who continues to pop up in good roles over a score of years), who sews up the wound after determining that whatever else this man-with-no-name is, he's not a consummate evil. This brings the injured man into the realm of a small cowtown, where he makes friends and enemies, finds out at least what his name is - to his detriment - and is thrown together with the rest of the populace in finding a way to combat the aliens, when they come to town after dark.<br /><br />Great people are involved in this movie. The aforementioned Mr Craig, always watchable, is joined by that icon of American film, Harrison Ford (as a mean sumbitch called Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde, who runs the place because of his cattle baronry but who is inside just a big softy); a strong female lead (Olivia Wilde) as the mysterious Emma Swenson, good rider, good with a gun, and who packs a pretty mean wallop; Keith Carradine as the town's sheriff (I didn't recognize him at first); Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine, There Will Be Blood) as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow's spoiled son; Sam Rockwell, as the town saloon owner/doctor, on the verge of packing it in and going somewhere else; and Adam Beach, as a young man Woodrow took in as a child. In the business end of things, there are some heavy hitters as well; Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, and Jon Favreau. With all this firepower, something good was bound to come out.<br /><br />Highly enjoyable from beginning to end, and adapted from a comic book, while the action takes on the spirit of a graphic story, the great technical effects and good acting make it realistic as well (as realistic as a movie with 9-foot ugly green aliens can be). Nothing dull here; the only part I found remotely unbelieveable was Daniel Craig's Jake Lonergan calmly reclaiming a fighting force of thirty, formerly his gang, who have switched allegiance, by just ordering them about. I guess charisma is everything; I might be induced to do as I was told by Mr Craig, myself.<br /><br />This was not a wasted 2 hours. A lot of movies these days produce a lot of noise and action, but this one provided a lot of story as well, and one that wasn't difficult to follow. And it's good to see a Western again, even if it's got aliens as its motivation. There was a lot of heart here. A very good adaptation from a comic book, and it's plain that everybody involved was having a great time as well.Don't miss the bonus features. I'd already like to see it again.

B005KELQEU|5.0|The way the sleeve shapes to my Kindle Touch and how it allows for quick removal and storage are the features I like most about it.  I did not like the idea of permanently entombing my Kindle in a case so I got this.  There are other sleeves available for the Kindle but most DO NOT have zippers for that added security against the entrance of dust/debris and accidental slipping out of the Kindle.  The zippers really complete it.  There were reviews about people concerned with the zippers rubbing up against and scratching the sides of the Kindle but this is in no way a problem with this sleeve if you are using a Kindle Touch because there is a soft raised border stitched in the inside to prevent any contact with the zippers.  This inside raised border on the edges also allows for really easy removal and storage without you having to take precaution against touching the zippers too.  The soft, cushy feeling continues through the sleeve itself, making it feel really good to hold in the hands for extended periods of time and protecting it in the backpack from other hard and sometimes sharp objects.  Should last anyone for years due to the quality of stitching and partial leather body.  Get it, you will not be disappointed :)

B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game but... where are all the awesome mini games? Where is endless mode? Why can't the &quot;mini games&quot; show that we beat it or something. I prefer the Xbox version or even the iPhone version to the unfinished feel of this android game :(
0451228375|1.0|I loved Follett's \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" and recommended it to many people, so I was eager to read the sequel. But within the first 30 or 40 pages, I could tell that:<br /><br />* The tone was condescending to the reader, treating the reader as utterly ignorant, and, possibly, as twelve years old.<br /><br />* The author did not take the time to imagine what it must have been like to live in the 14th century -- his characters are all 21st century people in feelings and thoughts.<br /><br />These two things combined made me feel the book was written hastily. Possibly it was written by a ghostwriter, though, if so, that doesn't absolve Follett from making certain the book was up to snuff. In any case, I could not subject myself to this tone and these 21st century people pretending to be 14th century people. I quit the book.
0446547654|1.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books, I own every one, so I wanted this book as soon as it was available.  This is nothing like the Nicholas Sparks books that I love. First, it involves a married woman which is NOT OK under any circumstances. Second, the guy (Dawson) has been treated terrible his entire life just because of his last name but is really a good guy that you fall in love with.  You would think he would at least get a happy ending since his whole life has been crap (not of his own fault) but Nicholas Sparks couldn't even give the poor guy that.  After reading this, I'm not sure I will buy the next book, I might borrow it from a library before I spend my money on another horrible book.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|This product completely fixed our Kinect for Dance Central.  Prior to having the Zoom installed...we had to stand 6-10 feed away from our TV in order for the Kinect to fit us into the frame.  This was tough for us and we had to re-arrange furniture every time because our room was so small. Also...if people moved in the background the Kinect would get confused and would try to focus on that person rather than the person that was dancing.  The Zoom has fixed this 100%.  We can now stand 5ish feet away from the TV with no problems...and the kinect does a much better job of locking in on the person dancing and ignoring what's going on around it.  With this add-on the Kinect is now performing how we had hoped it would out of the box...definite recommend.

B002GJT4YQ|5.0|I have not watched this yet, but I have seen the original release of Chamber of Secrets and loved it.  I am sure this is the same release but in Blu-Ray HD format, which should be better.  I have seen the \\"Creating the World of Harry Potter\\" feature on the Biography channel and loved it.  Would recommend this to all Harry Potter fans, old and new.  :)
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I found that this game is harder, which makes it fun  It was very very fun. I liked it very much.
0385513755|3.0|This book was a fun read, but having read Angels & Demon's beforehand, my expectations for this one were astonishingly high. The plot was fun, and the controversial facts were also fun to read about, but the plot just didn't satisfy me as much as Angels did. I was hoping for more twists and turns than I got out of it. But overall a decent read.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|It was soooooo fun.... at first. All these stupid adds. When I got this for christmas my dad said there are no pop up adds. What happened to that?
0061128562|3.0|got the mini book, but no CD, enjoy the book for a good price, so didn't worry about the hassle

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great variety of translations; for registered users (free) it includes off-line use (download) for some translations which is great for when there is no network coverage.  A good selection of reading plans with auto-tracking and reminders are also included.
1400064287|5.0|The book takes its own advice and writes in a truly sticky way. The thing I loved most about the book is the chapter summaries at the end. Once you have gone through the book the first time, simply browsing the notes at the end will bring back all the concepts quickly and easily. It's really easy to read but you learn a lot of lessons. It tells stories and reflects on them in a way that cements the ideas in your mind. Would recommend 1000 times over!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game! I can spend hours (and have) playing it. the adds get annoying but for a free game it's awesome.
B00632HWOG|2.0|yesterday the app wouldn't stop beeping notifications at me on my kindle fire. I finally had to uninstall to make it shut up. The fact that you cant view more than 10 emails at a time is also pretty cumbersome. I am going to wait to reinstall and use the fire's email app for now.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J are terrific in this spin off of the normal NCIS series. The characters are slowly developed throughout the first and second season. A great follow-up for anyone who enjoys the regular NCIS series.
B005HI4LMS|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I expected. I watched this with some friends on New Year's Eve. It was a very funny and clever take on the horror/comedy genre. Two innocent redneck hillbillies named Tucker and Dale are on their way to a run-down cabin in the woods for a Memorial Day vacation. They run into some college kids that mistake them for maniacal psychos. When Allison of the group falls in the lake, Tucker and Dale save her, but Allison's friends assume they kidnapped her. Thru a bunch of hilarious misunderstandings, the kids begin to die in gory ways. I would definitely recommend TUCKER & DALE VS. EVIL!!!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Excellent movie. Well put together. It gives you a clear picture of what happened to the 2008 financial crisis and what/who may have caused it.   Everyone should watch it.

B006MHWXMS|1.0|Looks like a great product but the fonts are actually blurry/hazy on my Nook Tablet.  There are no settings to change the font that I could find.  This is a show stopper.
B0034G4P94|3.0|This had the potential to be a really good movie, but whoever decided that the VERY close up filming during the fight scenes ruined it AND gave me motion sickness. I did not want to see extremely shaky close-ups of the body of the fighters and not be able to see the actual fighting. During the last scene between the two brothers, the camera went from extremely close-up to really far away and then back again. Really?!? My kid could've done a better job filming this.    Nick Nolte gave a good performance. It was weird to see him in a wimpy role but he did it well.    Cinematography: Masanobu Takayanagi:  Dude you suck. Go find another profession before you ruin any more movies.

B000002G85|4.0|Eric Clapton's debut solo album is fun, enjoyable but lightweight.  While the compositions are solid none have the depth of his best work (such as Layla and his Cream albums).  The performances are solid, Clapton's vocals are strong (for Clapton)but his guitar isn't showcased quite as much as one would hope.  The backing band keeps in line but producer Delaney Bramlett choses arragnements that give too much space to the band instead of Clapton's expert playing.  That said, the production here is solid, faithful, acoustic, and natural early 70s, without the bombastic AOR slickness that plagued many artists in the upcoming years.  Not Clapton's very best release but one of his best solo records and an enjoyable and fun album.

B005ZNM01O|4.0|Queen 40 years, that was 2011, the reissues, the box sets, books and documentaries, all flooding the market.<br />Among them this little documentary gem, released in the UK (mid January 2012 release date set for here in the US) on region free Blu ray disc.<br />There has been some consternation about the fact that the BD runs longer than the trimmed DVD release, and I can offer no insight. The BD has nice picture and sound, but is by no means stunning, most of the footage shown in the documentary is old and not restored, or upgraded to HD, so it's a good picture, not a stunning one.<br />The main feature is a two part documentary charting the beginnings of the band, through to their last live performance in 1986, and then what came next.<br />Most of the footage is narrated in interview style with Brian May, and Roger Taylor mostly. John Deacon (the bass player) seeming to have disappeared intentionally from the public eye, is not seen much, and the footage of Freddie is obviously old.<br /><br />There is quite a bit of new footage, some unseen screen tests for videos, and the unseen live aid practice, all padded out with a chronology of hits, shows, ups and downs.<br />It was interesting to learn about some of the inner turmoil, the quiet solo attempts, not only from Freddie, but Brian and Roger also.<br />There are many interesting interviews with the likes of Paul Gambucinni, long time roadie Peter Hince, and their former manager, as well as news reports, clips covering the highs and the lows.<br />The immense crowds of South America, the mistake of Sun City, the long time break through to the USA, and so on.<br /><br />The second part of the documentary deals with the high points, virtual split and then masterful reunion for Live Aid, and the massive '86 tour.<br />It also deals with Freddie's health, decline and ultimate end, and though delicately handled, it is sad and very bittersweet.<br /><br />So 40 years? Well yes and no, 25 years since their last live concert as a complete band, and 20 years since the death of Freddie, yet here we are - still absorbed, still watching.<br />Arguably one of the greatest rock bands of the 20th century, certainly one, if not THE founders of \\"stadium\\" rock, who left an endearing legacy of great music.<br /><br />Much of the the footage can be seen in other documentaries like [[ASIN:B000FWGVW4 Queen - Under Review - 1980-1991]] and [[ASIN:B000BDH65S Queen - Under Review 1973-1980]] but these are mostly the ramblings of other people. This BD has probably the most real input from the band, mostly Roger and Brian as already mentioned, but for any fan, or anyone who simply wants to know more about the band, it's certainly worth the money.die, yet here we are - still absorbed, still watching.

0312641893|5.0|Cyborg Cinderella. I think that it was the concept of an altered twist on the Cinderella tale that really made me yearn for this release as much as I did, and Marissa Meyer fulfilled all of my fantasy dreams. Castle on Earth, yes! How about a evil empire on the Moon that is hellbent on taking over ruling Earth by offing a huge portion of the population so evil Queen can marry hot prince who is crushing on said cyborg Cinderella?! OH yeah!<br /><br />  Cinder is a story about a girl named Cinder who lives with the evil stepmother in New Bejing surviving by hiding out in her workshop and selling parts and repairs in the city market. We open up to Cinder revealing to readers that she is a cyborg, part human-part machine, living in a futuristic world that wants nothing to do with cyborgs (constant discrimination) and yet they are also looking to sell off a cyborg to two into research for a cure to end a crippling disease rippling through the population. Cinder is soon asked to repair a service machine to the one and only horribly attractive, conflicted and kind Prince Kai.<br /><br />  Is this book just about a relationship, nope, it is about the harsh reality of interplanetary conflict, death and disease, machine repair, medical practices, and personal leg repair. The character interactions between Kai and Cinder are fabulously written and intertwined in the plot throughout the story but really what caught me was Cinder. This amazing young woman lives a harsh life but also she carries within her a spark to greatness. We soon find in these pages a complicated past and a harrowing future for this young heroine in a world out to shun her. Marissa Meyer has taken an old tale and fashioned it into a new beautiful work that will captivate readers and keep them anticipating until the very last page.
0312576463|5.0|Like all great works of literature the plot comes in second to the prose. This is a beautifully written book. There were passages I read over and over because of their beauty and depth.  My only wish is that Jonathan Fanzen could writer faster, but great work like this takes time, a lot of time, so I'll just have to be patient for the best American writer of out generation to pour out another masterpiece.
0765324857|5.0|Yes this is the story of a multi-billionaire who has a plan so top secret that he hides it under the ocean.  Like the Hotel California you can go into Rapture, if you meet the criteria, but you can never check out. Lots of action in this novel and how a small community of chosen individuals determine what they want in their secret society is fascinating.  An excellent novel
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I have saw the movie, but as always, nothing compares to the book.  I did have to re-read a few lines only because of the way they spoke.  But seeing most of the movie first and then reading the novel helped out tremendously.  A great read!!
B00000DCHI|1.0|I received the the greatest hits cd's and was very excited to play the vol 1 CD. However as soon as I put the cd in my player said CD error. The whole CD would not play. There are no visible scratches on the CD. It is simply a faulty cd. I then put the vol 2 CD in my player and it works fine. I am extremely disappointed, especially since I don't much care for the songs on vol 2. I was really looking forward to these CDs.
B001HN6922|5.0|My daughter loves watching this movie in bed after all the lights go off and we've read all our bedtime stories. She now owns a Lightning McQueen remote control and we have small die cast cars that hang out with us while we walk around. We love Lightning!
1451627289|4.0|Until now, I haven't read any recent Stephen King. Probably nothing more recent than [[ASIN:0451160444 Christine]]. Yeah, I know. And another factoid: the first \\"grown-up\\" novel I read was [[ASIN:0671039725 Carrie]]. I think I was nine years old. Hey, my parents had it on their bookshelf... In any case, I didn't know what to expect from 11/22/63, and I hadn't read anything about the plot, but I decided to pick it up and give it a shot. I anticipated a well-written book of macabre thrills.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, and impressed. This intricate tale is in the vein of Jack Finney's fantastic [[ASIN:0684801051 Time and Again]]. Or, more accurately, it's in the vein of Finney's less wonderful follow-up, [[ASIN:B000C4SWQS From Time to Time]]. King openly acknowledges his debt to Finney's work. While I loved Finney's first, more character-oriented tale, he faltered when confronted by his second tale of one man facing the opportunity to alter world events. King does a much better job with this in his tale of Jake Epping, a man who intends to prevent the Kennedy assassination from occurring.<br /><br />Although he takes some liberties for the sake of his plot, King did a whole lot of research into the Kennedy assassination, and it shows. But truly, the assassination attempt itself isn't as important to this book as is our protagonist's arc and what he learns about himself and about the nature of time along the way. King deftly handles the odd stickiness of time travel, and gives us a history that really, really doesn't *want* to be altered. Can Jake overcome the surging tide of events that want to happen? By the time the events are in motion, will he still want to alter them?<br /><br />11/22/63 doesn't reach five stars, because it did sag a bit in the middle as Epping establishes his life in in the late 50s/early 60s, carefully tracks Lee Harvey Oswald, and scouts out important locations such as the Texas Book Depository. It's possible that some judicious editing could have helped the pacing in some sections of the book. However, I admit that the slow build to the climactic events at the end helped to make their impact even stronger. There is also a very, very weird and unexpected twist near the end that goes toward explaining why Jake can time-travel. I sort of admired the explanation, and sort of wish that King had left it out. It wasn't really necessary, I think.<br /><br />This may be a time travel book with nicely developed characters and plenty of intrigue, but Stephen King is still Stephen King: there is enough creepiness/spine-tingling here to satisfy fans of his other work. I highly recommend it!
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Installed fine. As soon as I tried to install the widget for Honeycomb on my Evo View tablet, it gave me an endless FC with HTC sense. An uninstall fixed it. Too bad, looks like a good app but totally unusable on my tablet.
1400032717|3.0|A friend said this was one of the best books she had ever read, but I really can't see why. The books is quite interesting in how the author shows how the mind of an autistic person may work, but I found myself frequently bored by all the math explanations from Christopher's autistic mind. The plot started out as fairly interesting with the mystery, but then became more tedious as the mystery was solved and I had to force myself to finish it. Not to my taste (which runs to Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb), but some may enjoy.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This cover is awesome - it is thin and light weight meaning it adds little bulk so I can fit it in my purse.  It protects it from the possible scratches and bumps it might get while in my purse or being handled.  Before I got  the case I was almost afraid to use the fire but with this case I feel much more secure.<br /><br />The stand is cool but I typically use it in my lap so don't need it.  By the way people who have rated this cover as low because they can't use the stand in their laps it clearly says in the instructions and the instructional video online that it only works on flat level surfaces.  In addition it doesn't feel \\"flimsy\\" it is indeed light weight but unless you plan on dropping your fire you should be fine (if you do feel like dropping your fire get a big giant case or the accidental protection)<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it came in different colors besides pink, white, grey and black.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I'll have to bump something off my top 10 list, because this book was that good. Took me awhile to get in to it, reading it 20-30 minutes at a time for 3 or 4 days, but then, at around 25% I couldn't put it down. Read the last in one sitting yesterday. A very entertaining novel.
0064430227|4.0|Although the illustrations are interesting, I'm constantly working to keep my daughter's attention. It is a great storyline, but we'll have to grow abut before she appreciates the book.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|u can see all the weather videos u wunt .u can see tomorrows weather, the weakly. I loved it and so will u!!!!!!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of my favorite books.Once you get to page 25 you're already drawn into the book- I really couldn't put the book down! It has an amazing plot,great characters, and it makes you feel like you are actually in the \\"Hunger Games\\". I'm pretty sure I cried when one of the characters died; she was my second favorite character! Personally I think that the whole series was great, but some people didn't like Mocking Jay... If you aren't sure if you should get the book, you should get it anyways so when the movie comes out you'll understand the plot better. :) :D :) (;
144234430X|3.0|Be careful.  This product is NOT a regular CD of an audio book.  It is an MP3 disk that will only play on a computer like device!  We had to download it to our iPad to be able to play it in our car.  Sam Freedman
B004A8ZWXS|2.0|Did not hate or love this movie.  Great photography, but the story kept going too long and the owner finding his horse at the end was almost a \\"what else can we do with this\\" type of scene.  The happy ending doesn't do away with too many downer scenes that made me wish I had seen a more happy film.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Though I am not an afficionado of this franchise, I am partial to good high rise stunts (Vertical Limits!), hence my family had an easy job dragging me into a cinema for this.<br />While I dislike Cruise as a person in theory, I can't help being intrigued in practice by the huge ego of this little man. Allegedly he does his stunts himself. Chapeau!<br />In this all in all not unusually dumb action story (Evan Hunt, aka Cruise, saves the world again), Cruise gets to climb up the outside of Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Imagine 130th floor and the wind that comes with the elevation. Magnifico.<br />Also good: the sand storm comes to Dubai and we have a nice car race in it.<br />Forget about all the rest.<br />(Talking about little Cruise: I just reviewed a volume from the popular Jack Reacher series and found it very trashy. Then I learned in google that Cruise is supposed to play Reacher in a film. Another case of his huge ego: Reacher is supposed to be a huge man, 6 feet 5 or so.)
B0013ND30M|5.0|I was just amazed at the rate I received my order, I had looked at 3 different stores for this item and it took me about 15 minutes to set up, find, and purchase my order. I was even more amazed at the fact I received my order in just 3 days, and that included a weekend being in there. Thank You Amazon for making my Christmas shopping so easy and convenient.
030788743X|5.0|I just finished Ready Player One and I'm confused. I'm confused by the reviewers who apparently were either born after the 80s and don't get the pop culture references or who have been living under rocks all these years. It's obvious they have never played an Atari 2600, ever searched for Easter Eggs in games, ever had their butt kicked in those coin op games or ever tried to beat the high score at the local convenience store games. I'm sure these same people have never played an MMO or even watched an episode of anime.   I'm not sure where the dislike is coming from. I found it funny and amusing, as well as a look at we may see in the future (immersive VR gaming). The characters were likeable and I found myself cheering for the protagonist and his friends. The ending had me grinning from ear to ear and cheering. This is undoubtedly going to be a well lent out book as I tell my friends and family about it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i.like this game and not just for the 2 5 0 0 0 0 points fir rating this selected game title
1439153663|1.0|Weak characters.  Unbeilevable plot line.  I would not recommend this book unless you like soap operas and romance novels.    I had to finish it because of book club or I would have tossed it
B006C1DH92|5.0|I love this game. It is just as fun as fruit ninja but have a twist with the  Desparado mode.  I highly recomend this app.
B004EPZ02A|5.0|Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 were alright, not really scary but very entertaining. I went to the midnight show of this thinking oh, it'll be hilarious like the other too. Boy was I wrong. I screamed. I jumped. I slept on the couch instead of in my bedroom that night. It was such a good movie and very thrilling. I, however, don't really get scared easily in movies. But this one just blew my mind!
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Everyone I know who read Wuthering Heights hated it. Said it was sad and the people were horrid. I actually enjoyed it. Yes, they were silly people who held in their feeling until it was too late and concentrated on revenge other than trying to make the best of life, but that's what makes it so great. Plenty of life lessons in this novel. I loved the ending. How one person could find a way and make everything right. Of course, I don't want to spoil it for you, just know that it is worth reading it through to the end to see how Emily brings everything full circle.
0817439390|5.0|To start, I suppose I would say I'm an experienced photographer, having been shooting in manual for a few years now and not looking back.  I know how to get the correct exposure, how to get the right DOF, etc.  So for me, reading this book covered a lot of topics that I already know.<br /><br />However, that doesn't make this book any less interesting to me.  For one, I enjoy travel and landscape photography (what this book focuses on; sorry portratists), so I think the photographs in the book are great.  It's also helpful, even as an experienced photographer, to see the settings that were used on specific photographs.  And I've picked up little tidbits here and there that have been helpful as well.  It's a nice book to have in my collection, even if I already know a lot of what he's talking about.<br /><br />For a beginner, this book is invaluable.  My brother bought it for my mom for Christmas to help her understand how to use her camera better.  If she follows through this book and experiments with her camera based on what the author discusses, she should have no problem understanding exposure.  I highly recommend this for anyone out there who has a camera and sticks to auto or P mode because they don't know how to use the other settings.  Shooting in Av, Tv, or manual makes a huge difference because it gives YOU control over the image, not the camera.  And for those who have recently started using manual settings, it's also worth a read to help you brush up on your knowledge, and/or introduce you to things you haven't learned yet.
B004S7VSES|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase and with the buying experience; very convenient.  I would recommend both.  I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I keep finding more and more songs on this album to love.  Adele's voice is so interesting, and the songs really accentuate that voice.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game sometimes freezes and it closes all of a sudden, but when I get to play it it is very interesting and very addicting.....
B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this from Amazon because it was hard to find in the toy stores.  My son was thrilled to get it for Christmas and has played it several times already.  He played both by the rules and making up his own games.  Great purchase!  This seller was excellent as well.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It could be better, only if the led light worked instead of the color light being the only thing that works. The color light is good and bright also can light up a room, but it could be better if the led light worked. oh well.
B00061RZBA|1.0|I got this movie because its one of my favorite. I guess I didnt pay close enough attention to detail because i am unable to watch it. It says im in the wrong region. Amazon did everything right i just wish i would have known what region 2 meant.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I really didn't enjoy the last one, this one IMHO was much better, the plot kept me engaged and tied close enough the other movies to keep the continuity.
B0041IXVIK|5.0|Predators (2010) (Ws) Mostly all my purchases are gifts---my son is a DVD collector...This is just another movie added to his collection...Sure he enjoyed watching it..
1423113454|5.0|I bought this book to read to my sons (ages 9 and 7 years) at bedtime and I so pleased it was recommended because I think I'm enjoying it more than they are!<br /><br />I love the fact that they are learning a little about Egyptology, mythology and experiencing adventure through reading while they are this young. Not quite the books I had when I was their age.<br /><br />My eldest son has started nagging me to read this book to him during the day and not just at bedtime which has never happened before. While my greatest wish is for them both to become avid readers, I don't want them to read this on their own. I don't want to miss out on the story.<br /><br />Well done Mr Riordin..... you've bridged a gap!
B003UESJF6|5.0|No problems at all--this movie came just as expected. The movie itself is really fun, a great family movie. It can be for all ages, young and old. I got this for my father's birthday, and we all love it :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i first played this on a road trip and didn't stop until my kindle's battery ran out. i loved unlocking all of the games and trying them out. but you should not get the update since it gets rid of all your progress.  but other than that this is my favorite app!
B005IS565S|5.0|To start... I'm not the biggest fan of Five Finger Death Punch. I've heard a few songs on the radio, but after hearing 'Under and Over It' on the radio, I bought the CD. Wow its an awesome CD. High energy heavy metal, awesome lyrics from start to finish. It kicks off with the hard rocking 'American Capitalist.' If it weren't for the swears it would be on the radio... or maybe swears don't matter anymore. The drums, the lyrics, its a fantastic hard rocking song that gets your blood pumping! Then is the radio hit 'Under and Over It' which I think is a song making fun of famous people and how they're always in trouble... Coupled with the first song, its an awesome one two punch that every CD should have to set the pace of the entire album. I've listened to it dozens and almost a hundred times now.  So that's the candy to get you to listen, but the meat of the album is awesome too. Diverse tempos, great lyrics and great energy. Kick ace songs like 'the Pride' and screaming songs like 'Generation Dead' to heavy songs like 'if I fall' and 'Menace.' The lyrics to some songs explore the past and growing up without being mellow, lame or anything else but a punch in the face!  The vocals are fierce, the lyrics are fight provoking, memorable and diverse. The guitars are energized and sometimes mellow for songs like 'Coming Down' before they kick up and get angry. This is heavy music at its finest. The band knows how to build up in their songs that adds an extra dimension of building your heartbeat into a frenzy of emotion and energy that most bands have never done.  If you're into rock from male models or pretty people, this isn't for you. If you're into intense, diverse, clever, catchy, heavy music that you can fight to or scream out fierce, memorable lyrics this is for you. Buy it now.
0399536108|3.0|If you've read \\"The 4-Hour Work Week\\" by Tim Ferris then you don't need this book.  I bought it after numerous recommendations and because of all the hype surrounding it.  When I finally sat down and read it, I found it to be nothing more than a poorly written version of \\"The Secret\\" with a few humorous, but original anecdotes and tidbits thrown in.  (Same can be said for the online resources.)  I promptly resold my copy after I finished it--less than a weekend, which I felt was wasted.  If you'd like a cliffnotes version of the book (and where to get all the info in it for FREE) allow me to elaborate:  1) Join Fat Wallet forums and read the \\"money\\" section and read the sticky posts.  2) Join Flyer Talk forums and read all sticky posts.  3) Read \\"The 4-Hour Work Week\\" by Tim Ferris.  4) Join a bunch of free online college courses offered by MIT, and others. (Google)  5) Join Dave's TESL Cafe or Woofing and fulfill the offers therein.

B005HP2J66|4.0|The oldest stories of all, the stories of animals on the move, animals fighting, animals reproducing, animals just being beautiful and fascinating, were depicted on the walls of French caves by artists so long ago that we don't even know what their spoken language was like, let alone their own appearance.  In this spectacular documentary, we see the best of what scientists were able to capture on video, and we hear the stories of their rediscovery after 28,000 years, and modern attempts to preserve them by limiting access.  I found it visually fascinating, but I wish it were available without the intrusive musical soundtrack, which at times overpowers the spoken narrative.

B00000K31V|5.0|A virtual reality game is created which draws upon the ideas of the players. 12 people hook up to a game and then...things happen and you don't know what is real or what is part of the game. Players lose themselves and can't tell. Excellent SF movie for the mind. I can't believe I haven't seen this one before now. Picked it up for $5.00 as part of the \\"10 Movie Sci-Fi Pack.\\"

0307959856|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Ms. James, as usual, did a masterful job with characterization. All my favorite P&P characters were present and I wanted to wring Lydia's neck!  I think Jane A. would approve.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Now this the first movie that I am seeing that talks about a man's relationship with his Creator and responsibility to his family, without getting all religious. It screens real life issues men all around the world are going through and show an example of a solution that encourages making a Commitment to self, God and family.   This I recommend to every man to watch.   (I know Hollywood would not like to promote this)
B00004TWZG|5.0|Best movie ever. The only thing to say is get the uncut ( extended ) version, it has 24 minutes of extra scenes that really aren't extra, they are important . Normal version is cut for prudes in the american market, though you have to wonder why really, must be pretty up tight. 10 out of 10  - no doubt at all
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Really well thought out app. The screen widget works great and I love how you can swipe to different lists. Lots of features and a good looking interface.

0316056863|5.0|This book was hilarious! I highly recommend buying it. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that it was too short. I wanted to laugh more and continue reading. I will be waiting with bated breath until her next hilarious book comes out.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This has to be 1 of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time! Unfortunately, it's so funny that I uncontrollably hit my husband next to me from laughing so hard!! The characters in these rolls are perfect! You find yourself relating to a piece of every single 1 of them lol!  As the title said, this show is a little dangerous from uncontrollable hitting haha! I can't get enough of this show. We bought the 1st season for Christmas, and it's seriously 8 days later and we have to already buy the 2nd series! haha! Highly recommend this to anyone!
1451648537|5.0|I found Isaacson's story of Steve's life to be compelling and very well done. Jobs was well known as both a fiery tyrant and a driven, inspired genius. To appreciate the man requires a deep understanding of both sides of the personality coin. I think Isaacson did justice to the reality that was Steve Jobs, the good, the bad, and the ugly. He captured the essence of what made Steve tick and how his mind worked.<br /><br />I've always been impressed with Steve Jobs and his accomplishments, but this book makes me see him in a somewhat different light - a better one, actually. I regarded him as one of the best business leaders of our time. As a pure businessman, I'd have to place Jack Welch and Andy Grove above him, but that elite club is very small indeed. What Jobs had that nobody else had was a passion that ran far deeper than just the business. His artistry and vision far surpassed just business execution and this is what separated him from all other business leaders. This is evident in the end results, what Steve Jobs did to the world around us.<br /><br />His absolute belief in an integrated system came through again and again in this book - maybe a bit too much - but it's emphasized for good reason. To know Steve Jobs and his life story, you need to not just read about his supreme perfection, but to feel it for yourself. This, above all else, is what I gleaned from the book. It is also the key to knowing why he was so difficult and why is creations were so fabulous.<br /><br />One reviewer complained that the book is more a story of Apple than it is of Steve Jobs. How do you separate the two? Apple IS Steve and Steve IS Apple. Of course it's a story of Apple! That's fine. The book is peppered with lots more than just Apple, but you have to stress more about Apple than anything else. Steve's greatest act was his final decade, when it indeed was all about Apple, the reinvention of the company, and how the company reinvented not just technology, but the human race itself.<br /><br />All of this reinvention would never have happened under the stewardship of anyone other than Steve Jobs. This is precisely why I worry about the post-Jobs life of Apple. Yes, he instilled a lot of his DNA into Apple. Cook, Ives, and the others now leading Apple are amazing, but the hole left by Steve's death cuts right through the core of the apple. Nobody will ever be able to fill his shoes, but I hope people will learn from his life and his creative management style.<br /><br />In my opinion, Isaacson's book is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to learn from Steve. There are nuggets in this book that you will never find anywhere else. It's not a book meant to venerate him. Like all of us, he had his dark side, arguably darker than almost all of us. It's a book about the true man. He changed the world at least six times. That is enough to put him in the company of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Albert Einstein, and others who left a similar indelible imprint on humankind. Yes, Steve Jobs belongs there. He was an original and a genius and the world will never be the same thanks to him.<br /><br />Thanks Walter!

1451627289|5.0|For some reason, I'd stopped reading King's books after he concluded (at least, concluded at that time) the Dark Tower series. I had enjoyed On Writing, but had read none of his fiction since.  The plot of 11/22/63 grabbed me. I've always enjoyed time-travel yarns but there aren't a ton of good ones. So, you tell me Stephen King wrote a time-travel book? How can I not read it!  The book is one of my favorites from King, and the man is clearly near, if not at, the top of form. Some may feel the story dawdles from time to time, but I'll take King's dawdling over most authors' most earnest prose any day of the week. King shies away from some of the more interesting paradoxes, but he does entertain other ones, and his ideas seem fresh to me. There is even a surprising link to one of his best early works that fits well (as often happens in King's world).  I'm very glad I read this 850 page monster- it was a page-turner and certainly a praiseworthy new direction for the author.

B005HV6Y5W|4.0|No matter what you think of \\"The Tree of Life\\", you can't deny the passion Terrence Malick put into this project. It is ambitious, to say the least. You'll encounter a tight-knit family from a small Texas town, nature in all shapes and sizes, dinosaurs, and the creation of the universe. I've never seen a film like it, it is truly unique.  I'll be honest: I was nervous going into it. I'd heard everything about the film: the positives, the negatives, the booing at Cannes and the Palme d'Or it won at the end of the festival. It has divided people like few movies before it. Many have hailed it as a modern masterpiece, others have called it a pretentious piece of drivel. The film is pretentious for sure. But I don't have a problem with that as long as I don't experience the cardinal sin of filmmaking: boredom.  Well, I was never bored during \\"The Tree of Life\\". It is a beautifully shot film, the best I have seen... perhaps ever. It is that good! The cinematography is breathtaking. The visuals of space, waterfalls, fields of plants... it is a sight to see. I felt like picking up a camera and going outside to snap photos when I was done watching it. The music is well selected and goes along hand-in-hand with the imagery. The acting is just fine, Brad Pitt doing a great job, but it's the kids who do most of the acting, and they're fantastic. There were many shots in the film that gave me a sense of déjà vu. Images came into my mind of when I was a kid, playing outside, and it made me smile.  The film's plot... well, there is no plot. The film is about life. Brad Pitt is a frustrated father who struggles to support his family and many times takes it out on his three young boys. The mother is the opposite; she's a loving, affectionate woman who enjoys playing and reading to her sons. The rest of the film asks questions: why are we here? Why does God allow certain things to happen?  The film is told in nonlinear narrative. It works for the most part. However, for my tastes,I would have preferred if it had played in chronological order. I think it would have been nice to see the creation of the universe at the very beginning, see the family in the middle, and end with Sean Penn's character. I feel it didn't need to jump around as it did sometimes. In fact, I found the first fifteen minutes confusing and a little frustrating. Thankfully, once it got into the creation part of the film, I enjoyed it the rest of the way. I'd have to say, the twenty minute scene of the creation of life was perhaps my favorite part of the film. It was just so beautiful to look at. The colors, the sound; it would be worth watching in IMAX just for this sequence alone.  Like I said before, I didn't find the film boring. But I did find it a little long. I'd like to think since there really wasn't a plot, the family section of the film just kind of seemed to drag toward the end. Since they were just living life... at times I wished something would happen. The only part I didn't enjoy too much was the ending. It sort of ends with a dream/fantasy(?). Sean Penn seems wasted here. The material is not too strong and he spends most of the film just looking at his surroundings, confused. And I didn't feel the ending had a resolution. It really just... ends. I would have liked a better closure.  Ultimately, \\"The Tree of Life\\" is a poem. It will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea. In fact, I'm not sure I could really recommend this film to anyone. You really need to go with an open mind. The film takes its sweet time, and the dialogue is minimum, but the power of imagery and sound is at full force. It is a beautiful piece of art.
0312641893|3.0|This cover. This cover is in the running for my favorite cover of the year! I love it that much. And I love the title. And, even more than both of those put together, I love the premise of a sci-fi/cyberpunk retelling of Cinderella with a cyborg as the main character. You should have seen my face when I first found out about CINDER. It's like Marissa Meyer asked me for my list of all that is good and then slapped them together into this book. Add to that the fact that it's the first in a quartet (oh, how I love quartets), and the name of the series is the Lunar Chronicles. I don't know . . . it kind of seemed like this book and I were a match made in heaven. I've been reading sci-fi for as long as I can remember, and I feel like we don't get enough of it these days in young adult fiction. So I would have been on board for that aspect of the book alone. But a sci-fi/fairy tale mashup? Fuggedabout it. And so it was with much relief that I started it and found out it was legitimate on both counts.<br /><br />Linh Cinder is a mechanic and a cyborg. Orphaned as a child in a terrible accident, her life was saved when doctors intervened, replacing her missing hand and foot with metal ones. Now she works long hours in her stall at the market in New Beijing, and she goes home to a loveless household headed by her evil stepmother. There's certainly no love lost between these two. But while her older stepsister Pearl takes after her mother in every respect, her younger stepsister Peony is as innocent and sweet as Pearl and her stepmother Adri are cynical and conniving. Unfortunately, Cinder also has the question of class working against her. Cyborgs are second-class citizens in every way. Looked down on, and often outright loathed, by the people of New Beijing, cyborgs are the first to be offered up for medical testing and the last to be invited to social events such as, oh, say--a ball. Incredibly, our girl Cinder is headed for both, though she has no idea yet. Then one day the emperor's son Prince Kai shows up at her stall with an android in need of repair. The emperor himself is dying of the deadly plague letumosis, which has been decimating the population for the past decade. And before she knows it, Cinder is caught up in  both the fight against the disease and an unlikely friendship with a young man who has his own set of problems.<br /><br />CINDER is quite a serious book, both in the sense that it takes itself seriously and that it deals with serious issues, such as death, disease, class conflict, and war. I think I was expecting something lighter, but the whole taking-itself-seriously and the fascinating world building quickly set me at ease. I loved the attention to detail with which Ms. Meyer depicted the grimness of Cinder's life and her world. She's a mechanic and an outcast. She wears castoff coveralls and a worn-out work belt in place of the flouncy dresses and jewels other girls her age are flaunting. And her outlook matches her clothes. Cinder is a realist, and that is my favorite thing about her. She knows the way things work. And mechanics with steel appendages do not make good with emperors' sons. No matter how charming they may be. As a result, there is very little of the lovelorn teenager about this girl. As much as she slowly allows herself to enjoy the prince's company, not once does she fool herself into forgetting the horror that would blossom on his face were he to discover what she is. Instead, she reserves the majority of her emotional energy for fixing up an old car she finds in the junkyard, harboring the long-shot hope that it just might serve as an escape vehicle when the time comes that she can no longer stand her abysmal home life. Then when the plague strikes close by, Cinder taps already flagging reserves of strength to help and support the ones who are stricken. She's tough and pragmatic. We like Cinder, yes we do. Then there's Kai. Prince Kaito. What you need to know about Kai is he's . . . very cute actually. Determined to do right by his own obligations, he won me over as he did Cinder for being more than he seemed. At the same time, this is the aspect of the novel that needed more development, in my humble opinion. I liked that the story took its time, but with all that time, there wasn't actually much of it devoted to these two developing their relationship. What was there was good. I just needed a little more. Perhaps a better way of putting it would be, I wish that the relationships between characters had benefited from the skill applied to the world building and the awesomely creeptastic villain. There's quite a buildup by the end (the end is possibly the best part). But just when things finally get going, it ends. On one big, fat doozy of a cliffhanger. Which is fine. I'm not opposed to cliffhangers, per se. But I did expect just a hint more in the way of resolution depth for such a slow cycling climax. I was left wanting. My needs aside, I thought the characters deserved to have it out. I realize there are three more books in the series, and there is clearly more to come. I just could have done with a little more emotional payoff to keep me believing, if you will. That said, I loved each of Marissa Meyer's clever sci-fi tips of the hat to the elements of the original fairy tale. Word is the next books will incorporate more fairy tales, including Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, and Snow White. Color me intrigued (and hopeful) for more development in future installments.ed to do right by his own obligations, he won me over as he did Cinder for being more than he seemed.

0307891372|4.0|A perfect gift for the modern day gamer.  This guide was a hot item that really was appreciated when opened Christmas Day.
0439023521|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best fictional book series to come out since Harry Potter. Suzanne Collins has a unique way of putting you inside the character's mind, and her writing style is easy to read. I quickly got absorbed in this story and was frantic to get the 2nd and 3rd books of the trilogy. One warning is that these books are graphic, and go into detail about a cruel and violent government including murders and death, so it is not good reading for young children or anyone bothered by this sort of thing. However, Collins does not glorify the violence- the main character is increasingly disgusted and outraged at the oppressive government in the novel, and the attitude of shock at the inhumane way the people of Panem (the country) are treated is a constant throughout the trilogy. This is a classic good-against-evil, fighting the man, dystopian story with a hero everyone can relate to. I highly enjoyed this series and I would recommend this book to fans of fantasy, sci-fi, fiction, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, 1984, etc.
B004EPYZXU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely! Don't understand the bad reviews. Can we leave the Blair Witch comparison for a bit, the camerawork really added to the realistic nature of being on an alien planet with a growing foreboding. If sci-fi is your thing, you'll like this.
B004LUS390|4.0|I bought a kindle fire as a gift for my young daughter,   She is artistic so on the first day I bought the Sketchbook Mobile and Drawing Pad app. I have to give ease of use to the Drawing Pad app with its simple brush selection set up. The first few days she used Drawing Pad almost exclusively, however as she got more comfortable with drawing on a digital device I sat down with her and showed her how to use layers and opacity for blending on the Sketchbook mobile and now it is all she uses.  Pro's:  Layers- So far this is the only app I have seen that uses layers, and uses them well. Moving between layers or hiding them is an easy thing once you have done it once. It just works. You can also import other images as a layer...a must have feature.  Zooming and moving- Zoom in and two fingers on the screen moves the area your looking at. You can zoom very close in and it has brush sizes small enough to take advantage of very detailed changes.  Brush Selection- All the basics are here, and a few odd ball ones as well. I would like to see one with \\"thicker\\" looking brush stroke lines (like oil paints look on Drawing Pad) but generally if we wanted it do do something it was available.  Con's:  Blender- No Blender?! This is a big con one, and apparently one the ipad version doesn't suffer from. With this many layers and selections they need to put a blender tool on this. Instead of having to pick 4 different opacity to blend a color I would really like a simple blender tool. Not getting 5 stars without a blender tool. I spent ten minutes looking for this because I just assumed it was there and I was missing it its conspicuously absent.  Some Lag- At times the stylus would just not register. Normally this was right after a zoom and just slightly zooming in or out would fix this problem. It isn't that noticeable but it does happen. I would still give this 5 stars if it just had the lag as it is so rare.  Overall:  Best featured drawing/painting app I have seen so far on the android market, most features you would expect on a high end drawing program are here. It does have a learning curve and better customer support (or a help page just for the fire) and a blender tool would make this a 5 star app. As it is 4 stars and definitely worth the 1.99. After getting past the learning curve my ten year old uses this more than any other drawing app and as much as any other app period (its saying something when you can get someone that age to do something besides play plants vs zombies)

0439023491|5.0|She's done it again- Collins manages to capture our attention even more with this second book, and proves that the story gets more interesting as it goes. This book left me hanging and quite eager to get to the finale. Katniss' story is just as engaging as it was in the first book, and there is great character development and movement as the story progresses towards the dynamic ending.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|I first bought Back to BLack and was immediately taken by the old soul of Amy.  You cannot teach one to sing with heart and soul, emotion and passion--she does all so effortlessly and naturally.  The quality of her voice is unsurpassable. What a gift this young lad had--what a loss for all of us who appreciate exceptional musicians. \\"FRANK\\" is a must have if you appreciate Amy's voice. At times you feel as though you are sitting in the Blue Note.  Different from the more pop collection on Back to Black--you can appreciate that Amy was truly a jazz singer when you listen to FRANK. Don't let this gem pass you by.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Skeeter wants nothing more than to be taken as a serious writer. While her parents believe she should find a husband and settle down (after all she is getting old), she has a dream to set the literary world on fire. Living in the South (Jackson, Mississippi) during very turbulent times (the 1960's), Skeeter decides to write a story from the perception of the \\"help\\" (black maids). Secretly interviewing those around her, she finds more than she ever bargained for. Looking to her own home, and the relationship she had with her own housekeeper (Constantine, played by Cicely Tyson, who left under mysterious circumstances), Skeeter hopes that she can do the overall story justice, as well as shed light on what it means to be a second hand citizen.   The story revolves around the lives of Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) and Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis). Minny (a rebellious maid) works for quite the character, Hilly Holbrook (played by Bryce Howard) whose sole focus is to keep the help in their place, maintain her position in Jackson society,  and starting a movement to build separate facilities for the black help. While Minny does not hold her tongue or take anything from anyone, she accepts her role, while a victim of domestic violence. Then there is Aibileen who spends more time raising others children instead of her own. Regretting not being there for her own son who was killed years earlier, she looks at her participation in the project as a way of healing. Feeling that it is her duty to empower the children she is raising, she gives them a mantra to create character and belief in themselves. As the story culminates and the turbulent south erupts following the death of Medger Evans, Skeeter soon has enough participants to write quite the story.   In conclusion, \\"The Help\\" was a wonderful story told by a very talented cast. Perhaps stealing the show was the charmingly beautiful Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) who wants nothing more than to be accepted by those in her community and have a child. Celia proves to be what Minny needs to give her the strength to do what she never had the strength to do (leave her abusive husband), while Minny accepts Celia for who she is. Their mutual respect and understanding make them a force to be reckoned with and you know that they will both find happiness. I really enjoyed \\"The Help\\" and would recommend it to others.
0743201140|3.0|MAKE SURE the book is NEW!!! I have heard great things about this book but a USED book is almost worthless. At least half of it's value is in the on-line test you can take to determine your areas of strength. To access the test you need a code which is on the inside of the book (usually the book COVER). The code can only be used ONCE and then becomes inactive. I bought a copy that was supposed to be NEW. When I got it, there was somebody's bookmark in it and when I tried the code, it had already been used. I contacted the seller and they e-mailed me another code to try but that code had also been previously used.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|As the other reviewer said this app won't work on 3G so what use is it? You might as well go to your other computer. Plus your host computer is not secured so if you are looking at videos or reading books that you don't want everybody else to see forget this app. It also is very slow in operation and in file transfer rates which makes it a pain to use. Take my word for it this app is not worth .$99.

Although I must stress that I figured out the OMG moment quite ahead of time, even though I wasn't certain I had the itch that I was correct. This usually bothers me because it makes me feel like the character is stupid for not figuring it out too. I didn't feel that way with Cinder, I only felt mildly disappointed that I did know so far in advance.<br /><br />I enjoyed the twists that the plague gave the story as well as the research lab that was trying to \\"cure\\" it.<br /><br />Setting<br />New Beijing. The culture is set in an Asian style which  I found interesting. Not only did Marissa retell a fairytale but she completely re-imagined it by putting it in a different culture. New Beijing is probably what Beijing is like today: over crowded. Minus the androids and the plague (Letumosis).<br /><br />Writing<br />I had a hard time putting this book down. Written in third-person narrative I was never in need of Cinder's \\"I\\" thoughts or even Prince Kai's for that matter.<br /><br />Originality<br />Being a retelling of a favorite fairytale I didn't know what to expect. Suffice it to say that I was thoroughly surprised with how much I LOVED this book! Not only did Marissa make this story worthy of this era but she turned it into one of my most favorite genres: dystopian with a splash of sci-fi. Or is it sci-fi with a splash of dystopian? Yeah, I think that's the proper way. Either way it was fantastic and required a ton of creative thinking.<br /><br />Characters<br />Cinder is a female, cyborg (human with some andriod parts) mechanic. She is treated like dirt by many of the other civilians of New Beijing and especially mistreated by her step-mother and one step-sister. She's forced to work everyday and pay for the wants of her step-mother and sisters. Her best friend is Iko, an android, and Pearl, the nicer of the two step-sisters. She's a super skilled mechanic and while not a social butterfly she's nice and woes the Prince without even trying.<br /><br />Price Kai is one of the smoothest male characters since Edward Cullen. Yes, I said it. He is Mr. Suave, he's naive while still smart, he's handsome and geniunely charming.<br />Iko: Cinder's android was hilarious and I hope to see her in book two.<br />Adri: Cinder's step mother wasn't as horrible as I thought she'd be. I did abhor her right to control Cinder, even with the force of the police.<br />Pearl: Was the nice step-sister and I enjoyed her character.<br />Peony: The snotty step-sister but I didn't hate her.<br />Levana: The Lunar Queen is one nasty lady. I will enjoy seeing her upcoming fall from the throne.<br />Dr. Erland: I loved this character! He was such a prime role in just about everything Cinder did. He was smart, strong, and a very dependable friend for both Cinder and Prince Kai.<br /><br />Romance<br />It's funny to see Cinder fall for Prince Kai. She's all \\"Everyone thinks he's soooo handsome. Idiots.\\" and then she practically drools like a puppy dog the first time she meets him! She does play hard to get but I don't really blame her.<br /><br />He's nothing like I'd thought he'd be. He's super nice and sharp as a tack.

B004EPYZSK|2.0|**Some of this review may include spoilers.   Jack Lonergan (played by Daniel Craig) wakes to find a metallic cuff/weapon on his arm and no memory of who he is or how he got there. As he struggles to remember, he finds that he has to protect the world from an unknown threat. Along the way, he must align himself with Woodrow Dolarhyde (played by Harrison Ford) a greedy cattleman whose sole job seems to be protecting his spoiled son, some superstitious Indians who blame the white men for this new threat, and the beautiful/mysterious Ella (Olivia Wilde) to defeat a new threat, aliens seeking gold.   The pros of this movie: There were some amazing and established actors involved. The setting (in the Old West) was extremely compelling. After all, what more could you ask for than a battle between the aliens and the earthlings......laser-like weapons against Old West weapons (i.e., arrows and guns)? There were plenty of gunfights....some you simply got lost in the battle scenes and scenery. There were even men on horseback fighting aliens in fast moving space vessels. The special effects were great and in and of themselves worth a 4.   The cons of this movie: With so much talent available to this director (Craig, Ford, Wilde, and several more), it was the plot that lacked real bite.  I felt that gold seeking aliens was (for lack of a better word)... pretty lame. Why would aliens who have access to any and everything, want earth's gold? I mean I would have rather the aliens wanted us for food (which isn't original but more likely) or the desire earth's most valuable resource, water like a lot of other movies and novels. Really I would have appreciated them wanting anything but our gold. It seemed that the aliens could have arrived on earth and taken secretly what they wanted without snatching humans and turning them into mindless beings. I don't know, I just thought that while I didn't expect this movie to win an Oscar, with the caliber of actors involved, it could have been better.

B00005K9LK|5.0|Screaming for Vengeance is pure driving pleasure, the ultimate CD to crank up on a long drive by yourself. It rocks from start to finish, with only minor glitches, standing up as one of Priest's best.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very fun game. great to have handy when waiting for an appointment, or getting through commercials. highly recommended for all to download.
B004TB6GQI|5.0|my daughter loves this cd and loved receiving this for Christmas. She loves to sing along especially with Jar of Hearts
B0063IH60K|5.0|Cards run smooth. I really like how you can touch the card and it goes to where it suppose, you do not have to drag. Choices in colors and patterns are a nice touch. Fun to play!
B004EPYZXK|4.0|Apollo 18 delivers a nice low budget story.  The look of the footage taken on the moon was very nicely handled. And it was no man-in-a-can picture...there's plenty of lunar landscape, a Lunar Rover, and more.  Technically, very well done.  The story itself was pretty intense.  There was a single, nearly insurmountable  problem: if the movie was constructed of \\"found footage\\" left behind by the guys on the last mission to the moon, who went to the moon to fetch the cameras?  Even if there was a TV camera sending footage back to NASA on Earth in such a way no one else would pick it up, there would only be one feed....which fails to account for all the camera angles.  (Most footage we have of the moon landings was taken by film cameras not TV cameras.)  And for critical periods of the movie, they are out of touch with Earth anyway.  That occured to me at the beginning, and the problem never went away, even when the credits rolled.  If you can get past that, it's an excellent nail-biter.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|Excellent movie; a real masterpiece collection.   The life of Mahatma Gandhi - the dialogues are very well written, thoughtful and inspiring. One must watch this movie to learn how to be clam in the time of great turmoil and unstability.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Playing on my Kindle Fire and love it.  Like being able to choose which deals I want to play.  Great time killer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is so much fun and challenging!If I didn't get this game I would not know what to do during the day.
0316098515|5.0|It's beautiful!!!!  I had purchased one for my Son for his Birthday....It was so nice I bought another one for me!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Basic solitaire that is very easy and User friendly.  It only has your one basic game but I like the graphics and simplicity
0439023513|5.0|Such a well written book and series. I havent been able to put it down and neither has the rest of my family! Cant wait for the movies to come out starting this year.
B003Y5H5FG|2.0|I have loved vampires for as long as I can remembered, so even though I thought this may be a horror movie (which I do not ever see), I went ahead and got it from the library because it was indeed a vampire movie (and Colin Farrell isn't hard on the eyes ;)). I have to say, this was a weird, disappointing movie. I actually wanted to turn it off after Jerry chases them and tries to kill the mom, Charlie, and his GF. You can tell they were trying to make the characters have depth, but all you see is this facade of \\"care about this character\\" without any real reason to. I never even really got why Charlie would get involved, because he didn't care about his friends that got killed.. maybe only because Jerry talked to his mom? The overly CGI vampire teeth and morphing was very distracting as well. (I rather hate it when movies make vampires totally morph). And David Tennant's moments and humor were far too brief.   Overall, if you generally like vampire movies, maybe check this out to see for yourself, but I for one did not enjoy it. But be warned, I felt the characters sucked, it was mostly one note, and the fact that at the end everyone just acts like nothing happened and no one is hurt is rather blah.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|I bought this music for my son who is \\"into\\" Miles Davis. He loved it. I too was impressed with the quality of the sound. I'm always impressed with the prices & service of Amazon.com.
B00004RF9G|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies (and plays). It just doesn't get better than this! The dancing is wonderful, the singing super. Don't miss it!
B0049IHX2C|5.0|My boys love this movie! I purchased it for Santa to put in their Christmas stocking. It was a big hit, they love the crazy monsters, and Will Smith (Who doesn't love Will Smith?)
0439023491|5.0|Such a great book and series!! No one in my family can seem to put them down. A must for anyone with a teenager or even an adult family member that just loves a good book.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Excellent, quick service and price from Amazon and my video arrived on time and in excellent condition. The Lion King is one of my favorite Disney movies and I was not dissapointed, in the lease bit, with the Blu-ray release. We enjoyed viewing this great video that looks and sounds even better this time around.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a really good game.you never get board cuz there is many games to choose from it u should get it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My 3 yr. old downloaded this app. She loves it but plays it for a short time. Game is repetitive, thus does not hold her attention for long.
B00177YA1K|5.0|Purchased this movie for my son for Christmas. I have 2 boys ages 10 and 14. They love the monsters, the guns, and the action in this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app that I have downloaded yet.  I love the ability to listen to the Bible, while I am working or driving, in any one of several  different versions.  Thank you so much for this app.
0439023491|4.0|I loved Hunger Games to death and eagerly started in on Catching Fire as soon as I could.  However, the book was a little disappointing and the first half drags.  Compared to the urgent nature of Katniss' life prior to the Games in Hunger Games the first half of the book is largely a rambling introspection peppered with mounting horror of her watching her life spin further and further out of control.  The second half of the book is enjoyable and involving but lacks the punch and gripping nature of the second half of Hunger Games.  In the end I enjoyed this book, but after reading all three in the series I feel like the main reason to read Catching Fire is to get through to Mockingjay, which is a great book.
0061928356|5.0|The book was in awesome shape and came within days of when I ordered it.  I was excited to get it and was able to track it all the way to my door.
B003LZJI86|5.0|Excellent video footage. Great selection of songs! I don't own any BJ cd's but bought this DVD to watch while i work out, and this is one of my favorite ones to watch!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I app-solutley love this app. The best part is: the price. The price is so good because you get so many games, not just one, for free.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Challenging, unique, so much fun!! Geometric concepts, physics & a plethora of other educational bonuses; learn these skills w/o even knowing one is doing so.
B004PUG7MG|5.0|I have listened to Avril Lavigne for the past 11 years. I have realized that she has grown up and her sound will change. I really thought that this album was different than her old albums, but also sounds like her first album called Let Go and it reminds me of the old days when my sister and I would dance around the house, listening to Avril. I really expected this to be more like The Best Da*n Thing, but boy was I wrong! It was better!!! I really liked it!!  Should you buy it? YES! You should buy it right now!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire. I enjoy playing this game to pass the time. I have not had any problems.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I don't know why so many posted that the [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]] does not fit or that the cover doesn't close once you get it in the case. If fits perfect and closes just fine. Are the elastic corners snug? Yes, but it makes me feel better knowing it's secure. If you remove your Kindle frequently then you might have a problem losing the elasticity in your elastic eventually.<br /><br />One review mentioned that the magnetic closure doesn't hold it closed... well, that's because there's no magnetic closure; the magnet was in the cardboard packaging to hold it closed on a store shelf. Like others, I wish there was a band to hold it closed but this case is just so pretty that I didn't care; besides, I have the [[ASIN:B005S1CYO6 Marware Kindle Fire ANTI-GLARE Screen Protector]] on my Kindle Fire and has been holding up really well so far. If you really want some sort of closure, I recommend buying some elastic and make your own to fit around it.<br /><br />Overall, if you like it and don't mind not having a closure, get it. It fits perfect, works great, feels durable/secure, it's not bulky and most of all it's pretty. :)<br /><br />Side note, you can find this same case at BEST BUY. Sadly, Amazon won't let me post the link but you can do a search for it and then order it for free by doing an in-store delivery and pick it up (sometimes the next day). I also got mine on sale there for $10 less. :)
B0049985XW|5.0|This is a classic movie, and for good reason. It's an engrossing story of how greed can twist even good men. It's a story of adventure and danger, of the hard work of treasure seeking, and of how different men respond to the circumstances - good and bad - that they experience.  The script is exceptional, the characters fully realized as individuals, the actors are perfect for their roles, and the cinematography is wonderful. This movie is great entertainment, but with much more depth than the normal fare.
145551389X|5.0|First, I love Lady Gaga, and the photobook is amazing, the photos are awesome, I LOVE IT,  I received my book after 10 days I ordered. Everything was great
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I love how this collection of songs are mostly love songs, but they also are just originals. I think this is a really good album for any true Beatles fan. I have had it for years and still listen to it. Its got songs like 'Love Me Do' and 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' and more!
B006MHWXMS|2.0|Remove day 32 in January and add the 29th in February and this app will be useful. Til then not so much.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|Great product works well if you have limited space and want to play 2 player Kinect games. I'm satisfied thus far. The only concern is the product may scratch the Kinect but I'll be very carful and use the plastic protectors.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I bought this book over a year ago.  I tried to get through the beginning and my friends did keep telling me to keep with it.. It gets better.  I put it down for over a year.  I didn't even know what it was about.  The beginning was just boring.  I couldn't get into it.  A year later I picked it back up and tried again.  This time I got to where it gets good.  (If I had stuck with it for just two more pages...!)<br /><br />When this book gets good it really gets amazing.  A real page turner.  I know that the movie can't possibly live up to the book.  I couldn't put it down and spent ALL of New Years day curled up on couch reading this book until I finished it.  I am really glad I gave it another shot!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app. keeps me up too date on the bible and reading the bible.I do not have to carry a big book around with me. my phone fits in my pocket and so does the bible app.
B0043GXYBO|4.0|I really liked this book! I am currently reading the whole series. Zoey Redbird is the main character who has to deal with going to a vampire school, but also having to deal with typical high school problems. She also has to deal with a vampire 'change' which SPOILER ALERT she can either die or complete the change, making her a vampire.  Pros:  1) I like how the story has an interesting main character and villain. I really liked who the story surrounded around.  2) I really like how Zoey's friends really helps her out when times are rough.  3) I really loved the way that the villain is always shunned, but she has a story behind her.  Cons:  1) The language in this book really could've been laid back from being more adult-ish. It said a lot of cursing and cussing.  2) The book had marijuana being used in it. I really didn't see it to be necessary.  Bottom line: I give this book a grade of B.  Age restriction: The age of the readers should be around 15-20.
B0063IH60K|5.0|you can lose yourself in playing this game. easy set up for actual winning but you have to pay attention or you can just as easily lose. love it.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Skip this app as all you will get is a black screen.  I have repeatedly tried to get this to work and yet it just gives a black screen.  Buyer beware this is a ripoff app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great on kindle fire, no problems at all! would highly recommend to anyone. very addictive and fun to play
B0012Y1J3K|5.0|Complete works, brand new, worth for the price, quickly delivered, excellent orchestral interpretations, highly recommended! It was quickly shipped and delivered
0451169514|5.0|This is one of the best books in English literature. Its two stories being told, but of the same characters. One side of the story is the kids' story and the other part is them being adults. Its a pretty long story, but its a good story about facing your fears.   SPOILER ALERT: It has an alien who takes the form of a clown named Pennywise and he kills a kid. He scares these kids to the point where they are grouping up to get rid of him. Eventually he comes back to life to haunt the kids when they grow up.  WARNING: THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR ANYBODY UNDER THE AGE OF 16 OR 17!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The ads do not bother me at all. This is a great game to play to help me pass time.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Got the item on time, excellent for everyday basic use and protection. Stand works as described on flat surfaces. Inexpensive and useful protection for the Fire. Recommended.
B004EPYZXU|5.0|Suspenseful fun. I wish they had more special effects and movie was longer. Refreshing to see the Russian Moon lander that the Russians would have really used historically if they could, put in this movie. You definatly feel like your on the moon. More so than From the Earth to the Moon
B004MGMIA8|5.0|Complete collection, excellent performances, beautifully packaged, with descriptions, a   Ittle expenive, but worth for it.   Quickly shipped and delivered, highly recommended
B005TBN3EU|2.0|I never seemed to find this movie funny. It was full with adult humor which didn't appeal to me. Yes, I have seen the first movie, but it wasn't as sexually humorous. And the language in the movie is definitely not what you go to a movie theater and expect to hear. Yeah, I'm okay with a couple 'he**' and a few 'da**' some places, but I definitely never would let my child see this movie. It just doesn't seem funny. I am not saying that you shouldn't see this movie, I'm just saying that you are now WARNED! DO NOT SEE IT IF YOU DON'T LIKE SEXUAL HUMOR AND/OR A LOT OF CURSING/CUSSING!
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This maze is hard, but insanely addicting!  Very challenging for both kids and adults, and not a good toy for those that are easily frustrated.  My son was given both this and the regular perplexus as gifts and was able to almost master the regular one within days, but this one continues to elude him.
B005I6EVUG|1.0|This cover is so beautiful but it has a horrible odor that I can't get out.  Tried to ask the manufacturer if there was something I can do get rid of it with no response.  If you are sensitive to strong smells, don't buy this product!
0307943194|5.0|I always enjoy John Grisham novels but this one is the best so far.  My pleasure was enhanced by the reading. It was amusing and thrilling at the same time.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|So exactly how do you find \\"lost footage\\" when the mission crew and the cameras never return to Earth?  I'm a little lost on that point.  Other than that, this is a not-so-good movie.  Good closing scene though.
0439023521|4.0|I picked this book up one day and I devoured it in one sitting. I was just drawn in, but it got slow at times. I stayed up all night just to know what happens next. If you ever read the Maze Runner Trilogy, you would like this. It is a dystopian novel about North America being broken into districts and they have to compete in a life or death 'game' which they have to kill each other. Will Katniss get out alive? Can Katniss live through the games without anybody to rely on or even befriend? Find out all the answers to these questions by reading The Hunger Games! Its really worth your time!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I used to use this app a long time ago but couldn't find it in the android market.  I love that you have the option to download as mp3's as well as videos.  Great app!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like these games some are kind of hard but for the most part it has most of the games / apps that I have already downloaded.
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|1970's \\"New Morning\\" was hailed as a comeback of sorts for Dylan after the universally panned \\"Self Portrait.\\" Shying away from the country influences of his previous two releases, Dylan returned to his trademark sneer (albeit with a more polished, mature edge) and was once again writing songs that showcased his ability as a master storyteller. \\"New Morning\\" reflects a very significant period in his personal life, as he was firmly in the throes of marriage and fatherhood and was clearly reveling in this newfound serenity, as evidence by the laid back, romantic feel of the record. It's the kind of record you listen to while eating breakfast in bed on a sunny Sunday morning, and sustains a certain mood like few other Dylan albums.<br /><br />Some of Dylan's best love songs are on this record, such as the sparkling \\"If Not For You,\\" (covered by George Harrison later the same year on \\"All Things Must Pass\\"), the title song, and the soulful \\"The Man in Me,\\" later made famous in \\"The Big Lebowski.\\" There are some more underrated gems on here as well, such as the sublime \\"Day of the Locusts,\\" \\"Went to See the Gypsy,\\" supposedly about an imagined meeting with Elvis, the jazzy \\"If Dogs Run Free,\\" the gorgeous \\"Sign on the Window,\\" and the gritty \\"One More Weekend.\\" The whole record is warm and inviting, even the clumsy waltz \\"Winterlude\\" has its own charm to it.<br /><br />The remastered edition is excellent, and serves its somewhat ramshackle production, giving it a punch and clarity it lacked in previous editions. \\"New Morning\\" isn't a masterpiece but it's a solid, well above average entry in the Dylan catalog.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|neat little app to pass some time when you are bored. not too challenging either. control is sometimes lagging though.
B005HHSYMW|4.0|Steven Pinker argues, persuasively, that humans have over a long period become less violent. He suggests reasons why this might be so though his reasons are less convincing than his recognition of the trend.<br />The difficult part of the argument concerns the first half of the twentieth century - the two World Wars as well as the violent inflicted by Stalin and Mao on their own people.<br />Pinker's case is that this period was an aberration in the long term trend and that the \\"long peace\\" since the end of WW2 reflects a return to the trend.<br />I was (almost) satisfied with this position, though many readers and some reviewers will not be, arguing that the period 1914-1945 shows that humans are just as violent as they have ever been.<br />As in his other books Pinker does not just rely on assertion, he give detailed facts and figures.<br />Whether the reader accepts, broadly, Pinker's case (as I do) perhaps depends where one sits on the optimism/pessimism spectrum. Whether one believes that humans are inevitably violent (and perhaps evil) and incapable of improvement or whether one believes they are a mixture of good and bad and that the good is capable of coming to the surface.<br />But whatever the reader's conclusion, this is a book worth reading. It stimulates thought in an area worth thinking about. To me, that is the most valuable thing that I can get out of any book.
B004UID2LC|1.0|please bring back the ability to download as an mp3.  That was the only reason why I used this app.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Very glad to have this app. Perfect for those busy days when you know you are going to be pulled in ten directions at once AND you have to rember to bring home milk and bread as well....5 stars
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I am really happy with this DVD. The movie is fantastic and the extra content on the DVD is really good as well. I was pleasantly suprised with the extra content.
B005HV6Y5W|2.0|Despite reading all the negative reviews on here, I decided to give this movie a chance especially since so many critics have praised it. And while I can see why some critics love it, personally I disliked the movie as a whole. There are parts of \\"Tree of Life\\" which make sense and would make for an average movie by itself. The bulk of the movie centered around a couple raising 3 sons in a rural town in the 1950s. Due to the editing and sparse dialog, even this portion is a bit unconventional but at least it is cohesive and interesting at times. Brad Pitt is a great actor and does okay in his role. Sean Penn's role is so limited it feels like he was barely in the movie. Overall, the portion showing the family is a nice little \\"slice of life\\" feature; however, this is just a part of the whole.  My main problem with the movie arises from Malick's attempt to include all of existence in its scope. The portions dealing with the beginning and end of the universe feel like a completely different movie. The idea of trying to handle all of existence is too ambitious and the movie fails because of it. Scenes composed of swirling light in the middle with whispered phrases (yes, he really does this several times) come across as pretentious. I laughed when I saw the dinosaurs because I wondered just how much of earth's history he was going to try to cover. As with most of Malick's movies, the cinematography is quite wonderful at times, which is the movie's one saving grace.
0452287022|5.0|This book is a treasure!  It is a historical fiction, lovely!<br /><br />It is the life o a girl, working in the house of the famouse painter Johannes Vermeer.  The description of the household and of the  town of Delft will take you there.  In fact I was so fascinated with the story that I had to visit Delft for myself, and see what Tracy Chevalier so well described.<br />Griet, a young girl leaves her home to work as a maid in Vermeer household, but endes being his model and assistant as well as his lover...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought the book started off slow. It took a while to build up, but it flowed really well. It was slow, but not boring. The main character, I felt, was a little flat but I find that is often the case with young adult novels. After you get half way through the book becomes un-put-downable. A good read!
0307891402|5.0|This a beautiful book. I wanted the first edition but got the second when I ordered it from Amazon to replace a banged up first edition I got from a seller on this site.    The book is really massive and has so much detail and information.  It truly is exhautive. The code for the online Prima map is a true bonus, it's selling for $14.99 on the site but, included with the book.  Get the book, first or second edition... it's still a great guide... The second edition does say that on the cover.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like this except that when I tap cards for a play, they go to any valid spot, not necessarily the spot I intend.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I have been wanting a way to put my store list on my galaxy sll for EVER and when I saw this for free today I thought might as well give it a try. I succeeded in doing EXACTLY what was in my minds eye with this app and i would have even paid 5 dollars for it. No more crazy notepad widgets for me! Thank you thank you thank you for making this available and having it for free!
B00656C6KK|5.0|When I was about 7 I heard Doris's smokey, sexy \\"Sentimental Journey\\" and was hooked.  Doris Day sounds like she's 25 on this album, and she's as languidly libidinous as she was 50 years ago.  This is romantic, heartfelt and carnal.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This CD is filled with great music from the Musical episode of Buffy but it also has some of the great soundtracks from other episodes as well. only thing missing is the theme song to the series but other then that this CD is excellent! Great Buy!
0545265355|5.0|At first I was hesitant about reading these books but after a spontaneous click and buy, when I first read the first book I couldn't put it down. The first book really draws you in quickly. Must read before the movies come out in March!
B005WY8YZW|1.0|I was incredibly excited to order this album, I've loved everything Maynard has done musically and as a huge Tool/APC/Puscifer fan, I was checking my mailbox daily waiting for this album to arrive.  However, when it DID arrive, I realized it's just a bootleg copy, FROM AMAZON. I've ordered plenty of other CDs from Amazon and they have been legit and in perfect condition, but this time...not at all. It's clearly just some home-printed liner notes with no artwork, nothing official on the back or inside from any record label, and it's a terrible quality CD to boot.  I should have ordered it directly from Puscifer's website, but I received an Amazon gift card for Christmas and thought I would spoil myself with some Maynard-y goodness, and now I'm just disappointed. I will re-order this album, but from Puscifer's website to make sure I get the legit, proper album and not this basement-made CD some guy with too much free time made.

B003UESJH4|5.0|The number one fear of most people is speaking in public.  Combine that with stuttering and being required to speak publicly because you are royalty.  If there was ever cause for panic, this is it!  The King, his wife and the coach were all superbly played.  Even knowing the story doesn't keep you from being drawn into the emotion of this real life drama.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I ordered this movie, one I've been trying to find for a while, and i received it 4 days after I ordered it, and 2 days before I was supposed to get it. I am completely satisfied with the DVD, and with the promptness of the seller.
B001O9BB3G|5.0|this book was a free rental with my prime membership.it is an outstanding piece of fine literature.the characters are believable and the story realistic.it is absolutely top of the line.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|This case we purchased for my husband. He absolutely loves it. Very bulky and thick. Silicon case and a Hardcase that goes over top. Makes the phone about double the initial weight it feels and makes it alot easier to handle. I didn't care for the way it sticks up in the front around the screen just because I play alot of games and use. My screen for. Everything just about all day and I prefer thinner ones. But it doesn't bother him. And he is constantly saying. I love my case. Amazon is also the cheapest we found it. And found it instock which seems to be rare.
0439023521|5.0|I'm standing in the park on Christmas Eve, finishing the last dollups of words on my iPhone as my wife and son play on the nearby playset. My wife is quite content to be watching our boy while I read, because she knows what I'm experiencing. I'm floating through the last of \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins. It was my wife, after all, that insisted I read this book - a tactic she never deploys. There is a mutual understanding that the moment that one insists one reads a book, then one is skeptical. And skeptical I am. Already, no less than four people have insisted I read this book. Memories of Harry Potter begin floating in my mind and as I recall the fifth book was out before I bregudgingly read the first - then of course, I was hooked and caught up within three months.<br /><br />Not exactly wanting a repeat of those dark ages of being without Harry Potter while the rest of the world lived so blissfully with their secret, I sense that this time - perhaps The Hunger Games is something I should pay attention to. Before the movie comes out and before Suzanne Collins becomes a household name (although I may already be too late for that).<br /><br />And as I finish the last words of Collins' book, I'm left with only one question:<br />\\"How quickly can I download the next one onto my iPhone . . .\\"<br /><br />But, of course, with Apple's new and stricter app ecommerce restrictions, I cannot simply \\"buy\\" and \\"download\\" from my Kindle app, so I'm left with no recourse but to open my iPhone's browser, navigate to Amazon's website, login by clumsily punching in my password and then search for the next book. Fortunately, I have one-click purchase set up and the deed is done.<br /><br />I'm three chapters in before my wife realized I'd finished the first book.<br /><br />Collins has done what many authors aspire to. Her Odyssey so transforms the universal consciousness of readers that rabid zealots are born in the midsts of her storytelling. The outlandish environment of her characters are made so completely believable by the third dimensional depth of the characters themselves that one has no question, not one, of their literal and tragic existence. The mind of Katniss is mine and by the time I'm left to hunger for more, I feel as if a part of me is now gone. I need Collins' words in order to feel complete and whole again. Such is the affect of so thoroughly living with another person's thoughts. It is hard to reconcile that she and this world are not real. So I begin transposing her world onto mine. And I wonder, as I walk the park with my family and reluctnatly set aside my iPhone, just how long will I have before the Capitol pulls my name and sends me to the arena.<br /><br />And I count myself lucky that it has not yet happened.by the third dimensional depth of the characters themselves that one has no question, not one, of their literal and tragic existence.

B0034G4P94|5.0|Simply the best movie I have seen in years. A real emotional roller coaster and a great story. For me, it was easy to relate to many of the characters in this story and the loyalties they were trying to convey about family, the many types of family and social bonds not just blood but those we develop over time through mutual trials and tribulations, and it also speaks of the struggles that we so often endure and the sacrifices and decisions we are forced to make for those we care about. Furthermore, the actors played their parts perfectly. I couldn't be any more satisfied with the direction of this film, the evolving plot, and each actors performance was phenomenal. This isn't just your average movie about a single fighter who's struggle to the top is the focus of the entire film but follows several people though their journey, each with their own style and personality, and each has their own rich story to tell which unfolds to you as the film progresses. It is full of ups and downs for every character and is testimonial to how not everyone can win all of the time and that sometimes we must just pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off, sometimes with the help of others and sometimes on our own. As I stated earlier, this really is the best movie I have seen in years. I must see!

B005LAJ16I|2.0|This is a sort-of manchurian candidate thing remade as a series and retrofit into the war on terrorism. The story is worthy of a 1950s sort of paranoia. And there is plenty of tinsel wrapped around the show to convince people that this is somehow a realistic look into the world of counter-terrorism. Its somewhat like 24 at a slower and less hysterical pace. They could have used the plot for another series of 24 if anyone had wanted one.<br /><br />The plot is silly and unrealistic. The scheme is too complicated to make any kind of sense. Dana Brody is one of the annoying characers I can remember in a long time.<br /><br />The series is so stuck in 2005 that we even have \\"evil vice president\\" running around. There is a minimum obligation in this sort of thing to at least keep it up to date.<br /><br />The evil arab behind it all seems to run and revise his elaborate plots in near real-time. Every time he gets near success, he comes up with an even more implausable plot to destroy America(tm). But he isn't all bad because the US government killed his son.<br /><br />And best of all, the lead character is a mentally ill CIA agent on serious anti-psychotic drugs. Her mental illness solves one problem these shows usually have. Anytime she gets close to figuring things out, they can have her forget about it through the magic of selective amnesia. Better yet, mental illness gives them an all-purpose excuse anytime her behavior (or the plot) leaves reason behind. The way things are going, I would not be shocked if she became a terrorist for a season and then came to her senses after a coconut falls on her head.<br /><br />She is in many ways less any sort of character and more of a massive plot device with a built-in excuse for doing anything. I can't wait until she falls in love with Abu the terrorist in (lets say) season three. I bet she has about seven ex-husbands and 15 children that she doesn't even remember because of her bipolar disorder.<br /><br />If you liked 24, you will probably like this. But there is nothing deep or interesting in this. Its just an overheated melodrama about terrorists and americans gone crazy where the ultimate villian is still somehow Dick Cheney.r interesting in this.

B0049985XW|1.0|The disc that arrived was not the movie but a \\"Special Features\\" disc.  The case was made for only one disc but the movie isn't on it, only the added stuff.  Never had this happen before so I didn't check the \\"customer reviews\\" beforehand, after all, what could go wrong.  After I received the disc I did check and found out this happened to several other customers.  Buyer beware!
B002ZG975Q|1.0|Well I was initially drawn to this film because I'm a big Alex Pettyfer fan.. however as good an actor as Alex Pettyfer is, even he couldn't save this bland, mind-numbing drivel. With the exception of Alex the acting was atrocious, the script felt very stale and there was just nothing to hold my interest. Maybe this film is more for the 15 and under crowd. I can't imagine anyone much older than that enjoying this film. For a really stellar film that shows Alex Pettyfer at his best - try 'Tormented' (2009) or 'Tom Brown's School Days' (2005).
B002N5N5M0|4.0|I can't get enough of DEXTER and Season Four was no disappointment. It seems like each season gets more and more intense as Dexter continues his killing spree while trying not to get caught. This season we are introduced to the Trinity Killer played with relish by the remarkable John Lithgow. The first killing was so gruesome and unexpected. The serial killing aspect eventually gives way to a psychological thriller. We begin to get into the minds of kindred souls Dexter and the Trinity Killer.<br /><br />Both men kill for different reasons and with different rules. We soon learn that the Trinity Killer is not the expected loner. There is much much more and Dexter begins to dig deeper. As Miami Homicide comes closer to finding the Trinity Killer, Dexter has to think of ways to throw them off the trail. He'll go to any lengths to keep the Trinity Killer to himself with very tragic results.<br /><br />John Lithgow shows his amazing acting skills as the episodes progress. The writing this season continues to impress as Dexter maneuvers his way out of one jam after another. He is always one step away from getting caught. Luck always seems to be on his side but how long can this luck last?<br /><br />Rita's relationship with Dexter becomes more and more tense as he is always away from home. Dexter begins to realize how important his family is to him. He finally experiences true feelings. Dexter's rules come in to question when it appears he kills an innocent man. The drama and excitement never ends with Dexter.<br /><br />Season Four ends with one of the most unexpected and shocking finales I have ever seen. Dexter's life comes full circle. The show totally amazes me with its character development and it becomes stronger in these season and we dig deeper into the psyche of Dexter and the Trinity Killer. This is one season not to be missed.

0439023491|5.0|Finished first of series in two seatings and this will be the same. The only reason I didn't finish in one seating is that I didn't have time. I am happy to have the last part to savor this evening.<br />Although I agree with some of the reviews that it is similar to first, I am still intrigued and filled with wonder at Collins imagination and development of the story. I am sure to finish this series by the end of the week. Hope she will write another trilogy with a new theme. Just LOVE it.

B003GXC8VM|2.0|I  was so happy to get this copy of GNR AFD with the original cover. The disc said it was new but when I opened it the disc had scratches on it already. Then I went to play it................SOUNDS TERRIBLE!!! What a depressing pressing. I'd want my money back but I did get this for the cover in all actuality.
B004132I20|5.0|I have never found a Sherlock Holmes series that beats Jeremy Brett's. But my 28 year-old daughter started me on these and I'm very glad she did!  The stories are set in modern times but they have captured the personalities of Sherlock and Doctor Watson very well.  We watched them over Christmas and found them worth buying and watching again. The plots are interesting--serious puzzles with quite a bit of humor injected into the stories.

B00004CZDS|1.0|I ordered this movie for my neice for Christmas.  It is very hard to find in the US.  I found someone selling it outside of the US.  I received it in time for Christmas and I was so excited.  My niece was also excited!!  It's her all time favorite movie.  BUT....when she took it home to play it in her DVD PLAYERS, she got a message that states \\"wrong region\\".  She got the same message in 2 different players.  What should it matter if the DVD was purchased in the US or another country?  Heck, I am sure the stupid player was made in China or Japan.  I e-mailed them and told them of the situation and have not gotten a response.
B006NXIO7O|1.0|I love action movies and I really did not enjoy this one.  I mean come one...it is ridiculous.  What a corny lame film.

B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I loved this book, read it in one day.  It has great romance between these two characters.  Great price on Kindle.
B005SFR7YE|3.0|Having attended this musical (more than) twice (including Antony Warlow as the Phantom) I was expecting this to match if not exceed my past experiences, sadly this was not the case - as previously mentioned, using rendered screens only destroy the entire experience of going to watch a musical. The old way makes you appreciate how transitions occur between stage sets, the intricate work and timing that goes on behind stage - Using the electronic screens (right up to the red curtains) only 'masks' the entire experience, and makes you think of the short work they have opted.  The chandelier didn't drop like how it was supposed to, there is no wedding mannequin, and the guards with Meg did not descend from the gates at the end.   The cast was an improvement over the above nagging issues, their vocal ranges were within their abilities and role played, and they were clearly not saving up their voices for other performance like you normally hear in a live musical schedule.  The after show was a nice surprise, and I won't spoil it for you to experience yourself if you haven't read the other reviews yet.
B0028IDXDS|2.0|Although very cute, does not really help in keeping the pacifier in place. If the animal (ours is the monkey) were weighted a little more (I presume this is a safety feature) it would possibly work better. If the baby is lying flat on his back it does assist a little, if reclined at all in swing or car seat- which is where you really need it, we have not found it to be any better in keeping the pacifier from falling out as frequently.
0312641893|4.0|You've never seen Cinderella like this...  It's been so long since I've read something as good as Cinder. I can't remember the last time I was so thoroughly in love with a book that I read it in just one sitting and starting raving about it to anyone who would listen. Cinder is unlike everything that I've read all year.  This retelling of Cinderella takes the classic fairy tale into places no one has ever seen or imagined before. Cinder takes place into a semi-dystopian future with heavy Blade Runner-esque cyberpunk elements, unique Asian elements and something of a Firefly feel that's sure to delight any science fiction fan. Set in New Beijing, Cinder is a mechanic cyborg, a second-class citizen used by her stepmother to make money. Her life changes one day when she meet Prince Kai and is asked to work on his robot -and she's blamed for her stepsister's deadly illness and sent off for medical research. Little does Cinder know that this would throw her into a strange new world of secrets, politics and betrayal.  The first thing I fell in love in with Cinder was the setting. Weaving together elements of cyberpunk, science fiction and dystopian, along with heavy anime influences, Cinder paints a truly unique, in-depth setting that sets the novel apart from everything else in the YA genre. Come on -androids? Cyborgs? Moon kingdoms? How can you go wrong?  After I settled into the setting, I became engrossed by the characters, especially Cinder, and the compelling writing style, that balances description with pacing very well. Honestly, with all of these elements together, I found virtually nothing lacking in this novel: I was never bored, I was completely pulled in by the characters and their struggles, and I loved watching an unexpected version of Cinderella's story unfold.  As much as I loved Cinder, there was one major flaw that kept me from placing it on my bookshelf of truly immortal novels that I will cherish forever. What was it, you ask? I don't want to give itall away for fear of spoilers, but I will point out that I figured out one of the big reveals at the end around 100 some-odd pages in. You heard me -I totally called something at the end that was meant to be this big shock fairly early on. For someone like me -who has read far too many books in this life, and thus has become very critical of what I read -figuring out a major piece of the plot reveal long before it's actually revealed drives me insane. It's just about the worst thing that can happen to me when reading a book. In fact, when I discovered that all my speculations were completely correct, I nearly threw Cinder aside and fought the urge to deem it a complete loss. I hate it when books do this to me -especially when I find something that I really enjoyed.  Okay, semi-rant moment over. Despite this, I finished the book, really enjoyed it, and have been raving about Cinder to anyone who will listen to me. Despite this flaw, I can't wait for the next book in the series, and I already have an empty spot reserved on my bookshelf for these books.  Seriously, go read this book.
B002N21UKM|3.0|Download quality is not the best. Sometimes movie stops and you have to start from the begining. It uauLY pauses long enough for you to see where you are in time. Amazon has a way to go before I can say they are top notch at movie delivery.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Phenomenal movie!  An absolute must-see!  Fantastic actors, well written script, and well directed.  Keep the tissues nearby when you watch this one!
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I really like the cover for my new kindle - only problem I see is that there is no latch or way to keep it closed.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|I really loved the first part of the book where the author put past events side by side with current.  While the main story is fiction, it is built around actual history which I never knew about.  I wasn't quite sure why the 2 protagonists went unnamed for so long.  I thought there may be some explanation or plot device for that revealed, but if so, I didn't catch it.  I read this book over 2 days, beginning in the afternoon of one and having a hard time putting it down to sleep.  I picked it back up in the morning and read until I finished, though once the chapters left the past and only covered present day, it lost it's momentum.  I think Julia's story drug on a bit too long and had no where near the impact of Sara's.  I would recommend this book to my friends.
B005GVA2L0|1.0|Ben made the band and when he left it went bad. Amy lee has a great voice its just too bad the music does not sound the same anymore. One good song on the whole cd just glad i listened to the samples and did not buy the cd.
B0027MJU00|4.0|The story started out a bit slow but it quickly sucked me in.  I couldn't wait to find out the truth and wow what a twist of events.  I would be interested to see if a sequel will be written. The author left it open a bit but I still really liked it.  I came into it expecting a dark story and the author did not disappoint.  I am a quick reader (blessing or a curse?) and I had to slow down a bit to really get the intensity of the story. I am looking forward to reading more from this author.

But now he's having the same problem. Now I feel dumb for recommending it to him and having him pay for it.

0545259088|2.0|Probably the most annoying thing about this book is the author herself.  She takes herself waaaaay too seriously for someone who is bascially riding on the coattails of Stephenie Meyer. Unlike Stephenie Meyer, her prose is lyrical, but again, takes itself too seriously.  Forever is the third and (hopefully) final book in the Mercy Falls series.  Shiver, the first, could have stood on it's own because Linger was so forgettable, I actually had to look up the synopsis before beginning Forever.  I won't post any spoilers, but I think readers and lovers of this series should know that absolutely nothing happens in this book. I read a review where someone said the action picks up after the first 100 pages but 200 pages in, I was still waiting for something, anything, to happen.  There are no resolutions.  Sam and Grace are the most boring \\"couple\\" in print.  I emphasize couple because this book makes you forget why they fell in love in the first place.  I wasn't a huge fan of the series to begin with so I wasn't too disappointed. I just could have wasted my time elsewhere.

B001NP8PQW|4.0|I wasn't really familiar with the Cure, but after a few Youtube searches decided to buy it.<br /><br />Concert: The Cure plays well here, though I do think that a lot of songs sound to familiar to one another. Maybe this is because I'm not a fan, but with a few exceptions there aren't that much standouts. Don't expect a wild performance neither, as they are more focussed on their performance than on any stage theatrics.<br /><br />Video: Great video quality, this was being shot with a HD camera. There is a good variety of long shots and close ups and a easy editing style (so no MTV style esque 2 second shots).<br /><br />Audio: Once again this Blu ray shows its merit in the audio department, with a great distinction between instruments (I was always able to make out the different instruments) and they have a good impact to them (in one of the rare instances a guitar solo occurs, it really enveloped the soundstage).<br /><br />All in all, I can recommend this Blu ray.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is a delightful little film about falling in love with the city of Paris. The cinematography captures the beauty and mystery of the city. The performances are great, particularly Owen Wilson in the lead as a Hollywood screenwriter searching for his passion. The script is great and hopefully its nominated for an Oscar. If you are a fan of Woody Allen's movies, you won't be disappointed by this film. If you are new to Woody, this is a good place to start. And if you like romantic comedies, this is a can't miss film.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I read many of the reviews on here before deciding to ask for this for Christmas. Based on many negative reviews I almost disregarded this set, but thankfully I realized most of the 1 star reviewers had not ever seen this product. I usually don't post reviews but the extreme biased rating compelled me to add balance.  the bulk of the negative reviews take issue with Lucas and his choices in editing not the quality of this release. I am so glad I decided to watch this and make my own decision about the quality.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|After buying a cheaper cable that didn't work, I broke down and spent the money for this gadget.  The kids iPod Touch devices are in Otterbox cases which makes them impossible to dock.  This works to extend the dock port so the ipods charge and play.  The price gives it 4 stars instead of 5 but I don't recommend going with a cheaper model after our experience.

B000127LW2|2.0|I am one of many of the biggest Trekkies out here and this was the best rating I could muster for this series. As for the show itself, I fully agree with all the highest star ratings. I was a dedicated fan when it was on the air and watched any reruns as they aired as well. But, I'm a believer in keeping up with technology especially when its so obviously available. And in my opinion it sucks to open the crap packaging, insert the first disc only to realize I paid good money for an aspect ratio that is antiquated beyond current memory. I haven't had a 1.33:1 aspect (square) screen TV in over 15 years and own no DVD's that aren't widescreen. For all the technical wowzer that any Star Trek production is, or should be, I find it hard to believe it is only available in stone age format. Yet, the original series with Kirk and Co. is available in BluRay. In my opinion, if you are considering the start of a Star Trek collection, begin with the original series in BluRay and wait on all the others that followed 20-30+ years later to catch up. Talk about an inversely proportional universe. Maybe this is Gene Roddenberry's idea of a joke. I understand converting standard DVD to BluRay is time and resource intensive but at least we could have a widescreen version. That would be a no-brainer...wait...maybe that's what we have now...go figure.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|This movie is really different. I really liked it.  The aliens are pretty cool.  Love Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde.  Lots of action and some great special effects.
1603420398|5.0|I'm very pleased with this book. The instructions are easy to follow and the photos are excellent.  Pros:  Spiral bound, clear instructions, great photos, many diagrams, some stitch instruction (ex: how to make a magic ring).  Cons:  None! Others have mentioned the lack of finished project photos, or not enough square shapes. But read the title of this book again: \\"Beyond the Square Crochet Motifs\\". Duh! This book delivers exactly what it says it will!  I give this book five stars!

B006MHWXMS|1.0|Nice looking as far as to-do lists go.  But, as pointed out by others, the 32 day January is an annoyance, and 2012 is a leap year, which does not appear in February.  This is a critical flaw that needs to be corrected immediately.  I can't understand why Amazon would offer this as a freebie with so many REAL problems.
032147404X|5.0|I loved reading this book. I didn't get bogged down in it and read it quickly picking up pointers to being a better photographer. I even highlighed some of the suggestions so I could remember where to find them again. This guy is funny but realistic and has a way of describing the use of digital cameras and Photoshop. He is somewhat like your best friend good photographer out on a photoshoot with you! He has great picture examples too. A begginer or more advanced photographer will enjoy this book and learn from it. If one doesn't use Photoshop they may get a little confused. But if you have used Photoshop a little as I have then it does help more to read this book. The book isn't too heavy making reading it more pleasant and could be carried easily with one's camera equipment. I recommend this book.
0812550706|5.0|I'm pretty sure this book doesn't need another review. I read it back in the 90s and then again just recently as our book choice for the 5th Grade Boys' Book Club I run.<br /><br />ENDER'S GAME by Orson Scott Card (Tor, July 15, 1994)<br /><br />(the cover of my edition)<br /><br />I'll sum up the review by saying...<br /><br />  I'm a huge Orson Scott Card fan<br />  If you haven't read this book, no matter what genres you think you like to read, do yourself a favor and pick it up. It's a classic, and kind of one of those books that should be required reading.<br /><br />So what can I talk about when it comes to ENDER'S GAME?<br /><br />Well, I loved it as much the second time reading it as the first. That said, the second time I read it, I wore my \\"Mom\\" hat, and as with all things when it comes to being a parent, the book had an entirely different look.<br /><br />First, there are bad words in the book. I kind of cringed when I first remembered this, seeing as I was the one who picked the book for book club. So I brought this up when we discussed the book. (And I sent an email to the parents to let them know so they could make the choice if they wanted their son to read it.)<br /><br />It's funny how much the boys noticed these bad words. I asked them if any of them learned a new cuss word, and of course the answer was no. These are 5th grade boys. There have been many an incident in the boys' bathroom at school already involving cuss words. There have been many other incidents in the boys' bathroom, too. But still...the kids were kind of a bit shocked.<br /><br />Second, there is the killing off of an entire race. Not a single boy in the club had a problem with this. After all, the book is about war, and war seems to fascinate many a 5th grade boy. These boys play Halo on occasion. The war was no problem.<br /><br />Would I recommend ENDER'S GAME again for 5th grade boys? Totally. But this is one of the main reasons I run the book club. I want the boys to have a chance to read books they otherwise might not pick up, but I also want to read along so I can talk about any issues that may come up. So if you've got a 5th grade or above kid at home, consider reading this one along with them.<br /><br />Source of book: Already owned in my collectionany issues that may come up.

B005FMZWD8|4.0|This is a BIG watch that comes in a very nice bright yellow box with instruction manual and warranty.<br /><br />It measures 1.75 inches in diameter, 2 inches if you include the crown. It weighs 3.5 ounces and also is 1/2 inch thick. The thickness makes it tough to fit under the cuff of a dress shirt but this is a casual/sport watch and not designed with that in mind.<br /><br />I like the black cloth strap with leather stitched to the underside. I just wish the strap was a little bigger for my husband. His wrist measures about 8 inches in circumference and has only 2 holes left on the band. When summer hits, he'll probably need the remaining holes in order for the watch to fit comfortably.<br /><br />The blue face with white numbers makes it easy to read the time.  It glows in the dark after being exposed to light for a few minutes.<br />The 3 subdials measure minutes, seconds, and 1/10 seconds as part of the stopwatch feature. However, it is a little tough to read the subdials due to their size.<br /><br />Great watch overall and made well with a leftie in mind.  Definitely worth the price.

B004U52VPS|2.0|To me, this just seems like a quickie game to capitalise on the Angry Birds brand's popularity. This is rated 5+ but my 5 y/o gave up in frustration. I tried to help but... first off the person who *builds* the \\"castle\\" should be the one who gets the points! Some of the diagrams are so difficult to achieve without everything falling down (before the 1st bird is shot) we think there may be \\"joker\\" cards in the deck. The air-weight plastic used for the \\"wood\\" pieces has no balance whatsoever. I think I sense the odor of something that was developed on a computer, then sent straight to the factory without bothering to test any of the game's pieces. The sling shot device is impossible to manipulate so as to have any control of the birds' distance. It's just a bendable plastic - not a spring or rubberband like you'd think. When I read I had to rate this game's \\"educational value\\" the Gatorade blew out of my nose! I only gave it an extra star (above the minimum 1) for \\"fun\\" because we plan to use the birds and piggies as cake toppers for my daughter's birthday.

0374275637|5.0|I'm about to graduate with a BA in psychology, and all I can say about this book is \\"Wow.\\"  I've learned more about psychology as it stands TODAY from this book than I have collectively from the past four years of college.  This should be required reading for anyone with a serious interest in behavioral and brain science.  Daniel's explanations may be a little dense for those who don't have a background in the subject, but I don't see any barriers that couldn't be overcome with a little focus and deep thought.  I only wish that I had read 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' before struggling through my first experimental projects class.  This book not only illuminates how deeply psychological influences can run in daily life, but also inspires the reader to question just how much we have yet to learn.  For those who don't like to think of psychology as a real science, I challenge you to read this book, see how far this field has come in the past three decades, and not feel at least some obligation to reassess your views.  Kahneman's work is to Gladwell's what differential calculus is to high school algebra.  Do yourself a favor, read this book!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|You have a Kindle Fire.  You don't need a light.  You do need a stand.  You don't need a case the size of a pillow.  You need the MicroShell Folio.  Ok the case is to protect your Fire...and this does just that.  The case will work perfectly as a stand so you can sit and watch a video.  It will not increase the size/bulk of your Fire by 2 or 3 times.  What is the point of getting a case that makes your tablet twice as big and twice as heavy?  You are correct, there IS NO POINT.  What is the point of surrounding your table with pillows?  There is NOT ONE.  Don't drop it...duh.  Look, this thing is slick, real slick.  The Fire snaps right in with a solid, um snap!  With the cover closed, you have probably added 1 millimeter of case around your Fire- by this I infer that it has NOT increased substantially in size.  The stand works...if you can't get it to work, well, I can't help you.  If you drop your fire on to the street from a tall building and it gets run over by a car, will this case save it?  Um no.  But then if you are that silly to do that, well you kinda deserve what you get.  Will this case protect your fire while traveling?  Oh you bet it will.  Stick it in your suitcase, your backpack or a big jacket pocket.  It will look like new when you pull it out.  Unless of course you drop it out of a hot air ballon above Sedona.  I have never been in a hot air ballon.  They seem scary to me.  I bet your Fire feels the same way.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I purchased this product on a sale a month ago and I must say I have been NOTHING but Impressed! The screen is top quality and the unit is a lot lighter than I thought it would be even with a PS3 inside of it. I purchased a PS3 slim to go along with it and it has completely changed to way I play games. The only complaint I have is that the display CAN actually do some 1080p but, not all (?) If you are planning on watching a bluray on it then you must disable the 24p output setting for videos otherwise the display will flip out when you watch a movie. The response time is great and the headphone jack works well. If you are at all on the fence about this product by all means go ahead a purchase because you will not regret it!!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I got this app so that I could write poems and stories. It hasn't failed. You can lock your notes. There seems to be no word limit. You can color code the notes. It automatically saves after you changes a message. It is perfect for me. :)
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I know the current crop of critics prefer the nostalgia of WW2 or the Korean war, but the Iraqi war brought home alot of questions about how we portray the way we operate and the real thing. It's obvious that the Marines that placed their faith in their government and commanding officers had to deal with a distinct lack of compliance of rules regarding the safety of not only unarmed and innocent civilians, but the men under their own commands. A series like this would never have been able to be made before current communication technology, it would never have gotten approval from the powers that be.  It's obvious that many of the Marines were conflicted about the command's distinct lack of empathy for fellow human beings, in order to enhance their own military careers and agendas.  Kudos to the actors and the director for their amazing performances, I had to remind myself several times that it wasn't a real documentary, but a mini-series. The grunt-speak was right on target, and the revelation that our troops are less prepared, inadequately equipped, and sometimes incompetently led, than previous generations of our military, was an eye-opener.  I recommend this series for anyone who takes their comfort for granted....
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I have been looking for a task organizer that would sync with Google tasks and support GTD methods. Although not perfect, this app is a step in the right direction. I found it very intuitive and easy to use.<br />Developer: A couple of notes. The 32 day month of January needs to be fixed as you probably already know. Also, there needs to be a preference for date formats. The US uses/prefers a mm/dd/yyyy format. Integration of additional GTD features would be awesome. Otherwise, great app. Thanks!

0553386794|4.0|This was the second book I read of the series. I'd bought 'A Clash of Kings' and had read that immediately after watching the TV series.<br /><br />The problem with the series was that there was a lot of information to condense into 10 episodes. I finished the series knowing the major plot points and characters. I didn't understand the rest - the other characters and their motives - because there was far too much information to digest.<br /><br />I believe that any fan of the series should read this. The TV show was very faithful to the book, except for the addition of a couple of scenes. The main difference was that the book allowed me to understand the plot correctly.<br /><br />The book allowed me to understand all that. It has allowed me to understand what is going on in future books.<br /><br />I really, and unexpectedly, enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of fantasy, nor do I enjoy reading books after I've seen the film/series that inspired them.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|The Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware works well with the Kindle Fire.

B00005LK94|5.0|We watched this movie as a family, kids are 11, 8 and 4, and overall it was great.  Well, actually, we covered my 4 year olds eyes for the opening accident scene, there were a few unecessary bad words, and we didn't need to see the Dad in his underwear.  But the rest of the movie was great.  Watching the documentary that came with the movie is a MUST!!!  I had no idea of what this movie was about and it was a pleasant surprise.  The fact that it is very loosely based on something that was actually done for the benefit of endangered birds is fantastic.  The whole family loved the movie, but only the 11 year old and my husband and I liked the documentary.  The documentary is long (over an hour?) but truly fascinating!!  It's like getting 2 movies for the price of 1!
0385534639|5.0|One of the best fictional books I have ever read!  Erin Morgenstern brings you into a world of mystery, romance, and vivid imagery.  Once I started, I honestly couldn't put the book down.  It is a bit spendy then my usual book buys (I try to stay under $3.99) but definitely worth it.  If your into magic (similar to the Prestige) then you'll really enjoy this book.

0470876417|5.0|The depth and breath of this book is second to known; the examples used made its use more real and practical. I learned so much from it that it has changed my language as a consultant and also a life/executive coach. It is written in such a simple way and the overall design allows one to read it from front to back in no time. Knowing what I know now and how I know it, means the possibilities have just opened up for me and being a victim is not an option. I would be doing the BGM movement a dis-service if I choose not to share this with others. Great book and well written. All the best!

I like Jillian Michaels style, I know she is not for everyone, but I am a fan. My husband does not like workout DVDs but he does like Jillian since she does not do overly complicated moves to give you a great workout in a short amount of time. My fitness level is intermediate, for beginners JM does offer modified moves.

B0058YPG1G|4.0|I'm glad this season improved compared to the previous season. After Season 3 I was about ready to give up on the show. In this season we get back to the drug wars (which I found the most interesting) and as creator Gilligan commented this is a \\"13-episode chess game\\" between Gus and Walt. Additionally, we get to see Gus in his younger years and how he came to hate the drug overlord in Mexico. Hank continues to follow the bread crumb trail (even though seriously injured in the finale of the last season) and seems to be getting closer at times. The flashbacks were some of the best parts of this season. The other part was of course the ongoing \\"chess game\\" between Walt and Gus, especially when Jesse was manipulated. STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; CHESS GAME: A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: November to December 2011.

No amount wearing it, shaking it, and swishing it would get it to start back up.<br /><br />Got another one a few months later.

0385535139|5.0|I enjoyed, The Litigators, but was disappointed at some dubious research by the author in the area of cardiac physiology.  The dubious sections can be found on pages 232, 297, 303, and 334. Each of these instances revolves around the misuse of the word regurgitation.  Love Grisham, though.  Good book, John.

It changed my way of thinking with my kids and with religion in general.This movie touched me so much, that I actually cried and weeped openly in the theatre. If you see this movie bring a box of tissues--I wish I had,  I wiped my tears on my shirt sleeve periodically. I can actually say this was a great inspiring well acted movie--which will bring you back to or closer to God. See it, show it to your children and give it to your friends to see---you and they will never regret it.
0446547654|2.0|It seems that Mr. Sparks has lost his ability to come up with new ideas.  If you took all his books, putting the plots in a bag and shook it up, \\"The Best of Me\\" would come tumbling out.  This book is a little Notebook, Rodanthe, Safe Haven, Dear John, Rescue, and Guardian.  I have every book he has ever written.  On it's own, \\"The Best of Me\\" is a good book, a quick read, and entertaining.  However, for those of us that have read all Nicholas Sparks' book, we expect more.

034552554X|5.0|An extremely beautiful book, both heartbreaking and uplifting, Diffenbaugh's writing is both luminous and stark, in nature. Diffenbaugh's novel chronicles the story of Victoria Jones. Victoria uses the language of flowers to communicate her emotions,desires and grief - a skill taught to her by her last foster mother Elizabeth. Victoria's life has come undone in the foster-care system, and her self-destructive behavior has only served to distance her from others. But when she begins working for a flower shop, she runs into a mysterious flower vendor who tears open old wounds, brings up new desires, and has her questioning her entire life. This book shows us how Victoria grows, and the hardships she goes through - all the while using flowers as solace for her soul and the language of flowers, as a means to express her innermost feelings. A brilliant book, that really makes you feel!
0307454541|2.0|I purchased this book a week ago due to how much I enjoyed the original Swedish adaptation-movies. Unfortunately, $10 later, I am realizing the movie is much better than the book. I am only 120 pages into the story and am having a very hard time picking it up to finish it.<br /><br />Sadly, I think this is one of those \\"cool books\\" you're supposed to like because only the cool kids like it; one that should have been a story line & script, only.<br /><br />I have to admit I am very disappointed.<br /><br />Side note - A few days ago I watched the new Hollywood version of the movie. I truly disliked it. I have to think that's largely due to the fact that it followed the book so closely.
B006ISJQ1W|3.0|I found out about this movie (then just in the making process) from NetFlix about 2 years ago.  It was taking FOREVER to get this movie from NetFlix-started a little investigation personally.  Turns out it's Johnny D. & Hunter S. Thompson hooking up again (ala \\"Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas\\" )so it's taken a while to really turn this into a movie - that's @ least what I've been able to find out.  Amazon alerted me about the release so I could pre-order, well in advance of the release date.  I really appreciate that kind of service.  I ABHOR SHOPPING!!!!!!<br />Amazon works for me in so many ways.  & get this dandy first kid on the block, pre-order op too!!<br />This movie outta be great - it better be...I know not everyone is really informed on this movie so this may be confusing to you.  I do hate the waiting soo-o-o long for this one, the intrique of the wait - a Hunter Thompson type move perhaps????? or more likely Hunter didn't quite recall.....?????  And Yes, I know Mr. Thompson is dead.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I ordered this case when I ordered my Kindle Fire. After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about it's ability to function as a stand. I was wrong. This case is just what I expected. The Fire snaps in, keeping it secure and giving you peace of mind without adding much bulk. The stand functions works very well. I haven't seen the issues cited by other reviewers. I've used the case as a stand to read, highlight, and type notes on the Fire without issue. I'm very happy that my first choice of case was this. I recommend it to anyone looking for a functional case to provide protection and act as a stand without having to spend a large amount of money.

1451648537|5.0|I always knew, from the early days of Apple, that Woz was the hardware wizard and Jobs was the business guy. I also always knew that Jobs could be pretty rough on people, and that he had some very strange ideas regarding taking care of himself.<br /><br />Yeah, but I never knew just how far all of those quirks went. This book gets you, maybe not into Jobs's head, but certainly into his life and his relationships with others. There's a lot of detail here, from the reason he was put on the night shift at Atari to his wife's frustration with his delay in treating the cancer that eventually took his life. You read about how one guy, at Apple from the beginning, wasn't awarded founder's stock options because he was too low on the totem pole. You feel for the people who routinely went through verbal beatings; some learned to deal with it, but some didn't.<br /><br />What comes out is a respect not only for the consumer product genius, but also for the product design and engineering talents who made those consumer products happen. After all, no one is lining up around the block for Windows phones or Android tablets, are they? Jobs couldn't have done it alone; I really appreciate that Isaacson gave us a glimpse into those people, too.<br /><br />Whatever you thought of Steve Jobs, this book is a good look at why Apple doesn't have customers, Apple has fans.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie sets the Harry Potter Sega to all time HIGH!! Voldemort takes over Hogwarts and no one is safe.

B00457X7XQ|5.0|This is my first book review so please bare with me if I get off track. I don't read much out of work so I bought Kindle Fire recently to encourage myself to read more. In any case...  Coming from a background in computers, I personally found Zero Day a very good read. I absolutely love the short chapters and the chopping and changing back and forth between the various characters and their storyline. I found that the pace of the book just kept increasing as it went on which really took me into the story.  I bought this book solely on the fact that I admire the work of the author in his real job @ Microsoft and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. With that being said, I wouldn't recommend this as a read to someone with no, or little, computer knowledge. But to those that do I doubt you will be disappointed.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|The music is spectacular; this is one of those really great albums.<br /><br />The best news, the vinyl pressing is fantastic. Heavy vinyl, perfectly flat, pop free and perfectly centered. Everything I want in a vinyl album.<br /><br />The album includes a download code for the MP3 files. This is always a fantastic addition to any vinyl release.<br /><br />The album is a simple single opening, no gatefold here. The heavy paper sleeve has lyrics and a few more pictures printed on it.<br /><br />A great album that sounds even better on vinyl.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Really easy to use. Great for getting tasks down and reminding you of all your todo's.  Only gripe would be it showing 32 days in January, and then showing 28 days in February. Was thinking it was some weird bug with the leap year, but as soon as you change the calender to February, the Jan 32nd changes to Feb 1 and the 29th is not shown for the leap year. A quick update from the developer will make it great!
B006MHWXMS|3.0|As others have pointed out, there are a number of bugs and missing features that make this a beta app at best. Also, what's up with the service started toast? Was that for testing and it was never removed? Good free app, but not worth my money.
0439023513|5.0|I don't really write reviews, but this whole series and this book had me riveted from beginning to end. I cannot remember the last time I read a 1,000 page trilogy in a week and a half's time, and that is high praise.  _______SPOILER__________________SPOILER_____________________SPOILER  \\"Mockingjay\\" is very nihilistic in nature, but isn't that the trilogy as a whole? Katniss is dead inside and void of feeling from the moment her sister's name is drawn at the reaping. The entire time we follow Katniss she never does know reality or who speaks the truth to her. She has to rely on her own suspicions that only lead to her and Peeta coping with a world where it would be better if humans ceased to exist. Collins captures this message perfectly and this upsets people into writing one or two star reviews, but how else would the book end?  I applaud Suzanne Collins for an amazing book that should be widely read by all.
B00337KM2S|5.0|Job security is a concept that belongs to another era.  In this day and age, workers have to keep adding to their skill set to prepare themselves for promotions ... or, if they are job-eliminated, to be able to survive as entrepreneurs or make themselves attractive to their next employer. UP IN THE AIR gives an original and enlightening look at the precarious nature of life in corporate America in this day and age. 5 Stars!
B004BSFC46|5.0|My baby loves these & will stare at them intensely as if she's waiting for them to talk back! She is still too small to wear them & notice them at 6 weeks but what I do is attach them to her [[ASIN:B000S9RF4M Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll]]above her rock n play and she is sooooo happy! It's been amazing this last week because we really started to notice her smiling at her toys and she loves her little bee & lady bug! I can't wait to see her wear them to play soon!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A very fun app!! It is nice to have a challenge in unlocking the other games. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who enjoys playing games. :)
B005HI4LMS|4.0|I can't say I recall any precedent for this movie. Though it can be considered an entry into the slasher genre it stands out as being unique in its storyline.  Here's the scoop. A group of college friends are off to go camping in the mountains of Virginia. Tucker and Dale are, coincidentally, going to be nearby to renovate Tucker's new \\"summer home.\\" The two parties happen to run into each other at a gas station/store where a minor misunderstanding ensues. Later that day, as their paths cross again, the misunderstanding escalates to the point where bodies begin to pile up. Things are now so far out of hand there may be no way to get back to square one.  This is a pretty wild ride. Tucker and Dale (Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine) do not play the stereotypical hillbillies. They're goodhearted, gentle souls who want to take their less than ideal circumstances and raise them up a notch or two with this summer home. The college kids are are an Okay lot though maybe a bit wary of their surroundings and those that inhabit them. One of their bunch, though, is a nasty sort who is almost singularly responsible for things getting out of hand. Once the ball gets rolling the movie becomes a series of set pieces. You see where it's going. You just don't know how it will get there. Some of the missteps strain credulity but it's still fun to watch.   A fair amount of the budget seems to have been spent on the gore effects of which there are many. They're done pretty well. It's shot and edited well enough to make it work. The acting is decent and the characters are fun. This is just a weirdly funny movie. I don't know how well this would stand up to repeat viewings but for good time call......Tucker and Dale.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|The famous saying, \\"The rich are different from you and me ... they have more money,\\" really fits the facebook founder as he is depicted in this film.  He may be the youngest billionaire in the world ... but the film gives a revealing look at what it cost him to get there.  Also, Zuckerberg may be a programming genius, but he's no businessman ... and he is a bonehead in social situations.  The movie's tagline, \\"You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies,\\" is right on target.  All of Zuckerberg's facebook friends are probably on the payroll.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I read this book right before Christmas and I couldnt put it down.  As a lapsed runner due to injuries, this book has given me hope and I am beginning to train for a 1/2 marathon.  The author does a fantastic job of tying everything together and packs a ton of information that appears to be well researched and just makes sense.  From the evolution of humans to the very expensive garbage shoes we've been led to believe are essential, to the wonderfull descriptions of the ultra-runners, the stories of the 1994 Leadville 100, the plant-based diet tips, to the crowning end of the book - the Tarahumara race in the Copper Canyons.  I just wish it were longer, that is the only fault i could find.  This book struck very close to home for me because I grew up in SE CO and am familiar with coach Vigil and with the Leadville100 and I remember reading stories of both, also and this is bizarre, but I was born in Chihuahua and am very familiar with the native Tarahumara and their huaraches.  My father ran marathons when I was growing up and I ran CC and track in high school.  Now that I am in my early 40's and have to see a physical therapist because of sciatica I am convinced that years of running on \\"running\\" shoes have resulted in my pain and injuries.  God bless you Mr McDougall, you have opened my eyes.

B005ZUR724|1.0|I knew the update was available, but I had to uninstall my game first.  I uninstalled it, but for some reason everytime I try to download it, it says there was trouble installing it on my Kindle Fire!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the feature where the app will actually read to you. I can just follow along while it's reading. Love it. Other than that I usually can't access when I don't have an internet connect. I haven't explored to see if I can download offline texts/bibles. But for the most part, it's a good app so long as you have a net connection. Great for studying.

1455870145|5.0|Paper Towns was the first John Green novel I picked up. I have no idea how I missed out on this for so long! I finally understand the awesomeness of Green's books. His characterizations are right on - his characters realistic and relatable. The writing is clever, with dialogue that's honest and... real.<br /><br />There are so many things that I loved about Paper Towns... I loved how insightful Q, the protagonist was and how he observed people around him and analyzed himself. I loved the message about accepting a person for who they really are, not how you think they should be, and being real - finding your own truth. My favorite quote from this book is: \\"What a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person.\\"<br /><br />The storyline is witty and realistic (have I said that word enough?), about Q's quest to find Margo that includes an epic road trip with his crew. Paper Towns is somewhat of a mystery as Margo leaves clues for Q when she up and disappears. I loved the road trip - there's excitement, adventure, and parts were downright hysterical. It made me feel nostalgic and seriously had me laughing out loud! I also really enjoyed how the Green incorporated Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, and referred to The Great Gatsby and Moby Dick.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of this book. I felt that the narrator, Dan John Miller, suited Q perfectly... I never doubted that he was the character. I think he did a great job with timing and the voices.<br /><br />Paper Towns was a great introduction to John Green's novels, and honestly I think it's my favorite (I've read/listened to 4). I give it 4.5 stars! DFTBA.<br /><br />Review originally posted on my blog, A Book and a Latte - bookandlatte (dot) com.

B006MHWXMS|2.0|I've been amazed that Google hasn't made an app to sync with its Tasks yet. Until then, apps like this have to suffice.<br /><br />Yes, it syncs with Google Tasks. However, online, Google Tasks let you nest items under a top level item. In other words, you can create a heading entry and then have subordinate items under it.<br /><br />For instance, you can have a top-level task, \\"buy at costco:\\" then have, \\"toilet paper,\\" \\"shampoo,\\" \\"cucumbers,\\" \\"batteries,\\" & \\"oil,\\" as 5 separate subtasks listed below \\"buy at costco\\" and slightly indented, so you can checkmark each item off while shopping). Kind of like this:<br /><br />buy at costco:<br />  #toilet paper<br />  #shampoo<br />  #cucumbers<br />  #batteries<br />  #oil<br /><br />Well, this app does not display the nested subtasks properly. On the other hand, an alternative app, Google Tasks Organizer (GTO) ([...] syncs with Google Tasks and displays the subtasks correctly.<br /><br />(Can't believe I took the time to tap this review out on my Bionic, initially!)<br /><br />Edit: For the record, I'm neither suggesting that GTO is the best app of its kind nor am I affiliated with the publisher. I simply stated two facts - it syncs with Google Tasks; it displays my subtasks correctly. I never provided any opinions about GTO as this is not the place to review it. Honestly, I'm \\"forced\\" to use GTO because, of all the task apps I've tried, it is the only one that correctly displays the subtasks on my device. Having the ability to see my subtasks is a necessary feature for me, if you haven't figured that out yet! :) If you have knowledge of another task sync app that can do this, then please leave me a comment.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Got this and thought this is just going to break not the case. The case fit perfecly its worth it to pay the extra money and not get a cheaper case. But u should get a screen protecter because the white gets dirty and the screen does too.PAY THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET THIS CASE ITS WORTH IT!!!!!!
B005HSL626|1.0|the game itself is fun, but the pop ups are very much inappropriate for children. parents be advised before downloading.
0743289692|5.0|Very compelling and interesting book.  She uses reason and critical thinking skills to arrive at her own conclusions.  This means she's smart, and her book is worth reading.  A great role model for everyone.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder is a sci-fi retelling of Cinderella and he first thing you notice is how you fall so easily into this carefully constructed world of androids, crowded apartments and controlled data.  I was immediately drawn into this futuristic metropolis and Cinder's hard existence.  At the core of the Cinderella fairy tale is a young woman who has a good heart but finds herself at the mercy of those that want only to use her for their own gain, and that is the case in this wonderful version of the tale.  Cinder's stepmother is a villain worth hating and the cruel step sister is so hateful you'll wish you could reach in the book and throttle her yourself.  It is the realness of the characters that helps make this story so enjoyable.<br /><br />Let's talk about Prince Kai for a moment!  He is handsome, kind, endearingly clueless about Cinder's identity as a cyborg, a good dancer and everything a Prince Charming should be. I predict he will be considered one of the dreamiest love interests in 2012 debuts!  I am a fan of sci-fi, but the way that Marissa Meyer blends the traditional romance of a fairy tale with the bleak and futuristic landscape of New Beijing is truly magical.  A good sci-fi novel takes you to a completely different world than the one you live in and makes it seem as if riding in a hovercraft or having an android as a best friend is no big deal, and this book does just that.  Cinder's excellent world building puts you right in the middle of the story and it's a world that you won't want to leave anytime soon.  I cannot WAIT for the second book!
0312641893|5.0|I have to admit, the cover turned me off this book. I wasn't going to give it a second thought! But after hearing countless praises and such, I decided to review it for the DAC 2012 tours. Boy, was I happily mistaken! I loved this book!<br /><br />Now the list of Cinderella retellings runs over a mile-long, I'm sure, but this story is uniquely twisted. In addition to being set in an alternate and futuristic China, which I love since hardly any books have an Asian setting, this isn't just your typical mistreated girl with step-sisters who meets a handsome prince. Cinder has a very important past and many hidden secrets that even though I easily figured out, it made the tale quite different from your average, run-of-the-mill Cinderella retelling. I mean, one of the step-sisters is even nice & likable!<br /><br />The prince was especially charming, even though we don't get much of him, but each time is highly enjoyable. So sweet and playful, I could definitely see myself falling for a guy like him, prince or no prince. My favorite character though would have to be Iko, Cinder's beloved little robot. I imagine her as this cute, funny little robot who is always on Cinder's side and even though she doesn't understand much of the world, has some very insightful thoughts. I loved reading each and every part with Iko in it, as she added a bit of fun and lightness to the book.<br /><br />Now you might be turned off by all the sci-fi, cyborgs aspect of this book, but let me assure you, it was worked into the book in a very fun, creative, and enjoyable way that didn't make me feel like I was reading a documentary. The book ends at a very pivotal moment, as per the usual with books in a series, and I'm dying to know what happens next. Another great thing about this book is that Cinder is an awesome female lead. She's smart, resourceful, brave, and stubborn. You know how I love a witty, tough girl-kind of female lead.<br /><br />Everything flowed really nicely and I honestly couldn't put it down. Marissa Meyer did an excellent job of creating a unique world and memorable characters that everyone will love. I'd gladly recommend this to any and all my friends and bookworms.xcellent job of creating a unique world and memorable characters that everyone will love. I'd gladly recommend this to any and all my friends and bookworms.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|This video is great in the regular \\"2d\\" version. I watched it on my old plasma set and enjoyed it. The pacing is slow, but the thoughts and feelings of the movie stay with you and evolve after you've finished watching. The \\"3d\\" aspect gives the movie a different feel. While many people thing 3d is a gimmick (and let's face it, it's not quite perfect yet), the difference for this movie is striking. The scale of the cave becomes clear in 3d in a way that is not apparent in the usual version. Furthermore, the art has a different feel when you get a better texture of the space.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Bar none, this is one of the greatest anthologies EVER put together.  6 Blu-ray's long, with two of them being behind the scenes and making of, documentaries and more goodies than I've still had time to watch.  Not to mention, all in high def from the masters of creature creation!  Honestly, if you, or someone you know if a fan, this is something that needs to be in your collection.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I like it cause I played it before but I cant get the free app on my kindle. :)  :(
0553582038|1.0|The Others are not mentioned. Tyrion and Daenerys do not appear. Jon Snow hardly does. Nothing major happens not even close to what happens in the prior books. My only guess is that he saving everything until the last book but right now I really don't care. Will skip the next one and just wait for the last. What a waste.
0545265355|5.0|I am not a huge book reader, but I opened the first book to see what the rage was and I couldn't put it down.  I read all three books in 4 days.  They are so well written - so descriptive.  I'm not a sci-fi futuristic person either - but this trilogy will take you were you never thought you would go.  Amazing books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app never ends! with games that will keep u coming back for more by far the best game app out there!

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|The movie Soul Surfer is an amazing story of an extremely brave young woman.  She was a professional surfer who was attacked by a shark while in the water.  The shark took most of her arm, but she survived and fought back.  The movie is very grounded in the Christian faith of this young woman and her family & showcases the courage she had to return to surfing.  My entire family sat riveted to the screen.  Its hard to find a good, clean movie for the entire family to watch together ~ this is one of them!  The fact that it was based on a true story makes it that much more appealing.
1451627289|5.0|I have never been a big Stephen King fan.  I've read a few of his books and thought they were ok, and some of the movies based on his short stories are great(The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Stand By Me)  When I heard about 11/22/63 something intrigued me.  A man goes back in time and tries to stop JFK from being killed.  Yes, I was interested. But then I thought this is Stephen King.  Something weird or supernatural will come into the plot.  And I think that's why I never really liked King in the past, that supernatural element.  I envisioned him having Wyatt Earp, or Sam Spade suddenly appear through the time portal to help save the day.  And then I got the book as a christmas gift.  And I have to say that other than the time travel aspect, King plays it straight.  He manages to not only transport the hero back to the 50's, he sweeps the reader right alone too.  This is one absolutely excellant book.  It works as a thriller as well as a historical novel.  I can't say that I will definitely read King's next book, but I will give it a chance and not judge it just because it was written by Stephen King.  I can't say enough good things about this book.  Read it!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Although I haven't finished the book just quite yet, I still think this is an amazing book. I got to part 2 in the book in one night. In this book I really wished that Gale had been, was, is the one who could of been the star-crossed lover with katniss because they were really meant to be together. I mean Peeta was really good all but gale and katniss were obviously meant to be together.I think after awhile you get used to Peeta and he gets you into more of a love relationship understanding between him and katniss, he makes it better. I think if you didn't like first book and you think the second book is going to be worse your sadly mistaken.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|A brilliant bit of marketing, if not so brilliant literature.  Collins marries a tired young adult plot with food and fashion themes and ends the book with an annoying lack of closure in an all too obvious move to get the reader to buy the remaining two books in the series.  The characters are flat, the dialogue is stilted, and the plot is both contrived and predictable.  Did anyone not see the second rule change coming?  Your time will be better spent reading Lois Lowrey's \\"The Giver\\", Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\", Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\", or any number of other (better) dystopian novels.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|I feel cheated with this game. It crashes halfway through the game. When will it be fixed. As is not worth the price.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this. Use it all the time. Usually with groceries or other lists. Works great. I've never had a problem with it once! I like that it's easy to edit lists, it marks them out instead of having to delete each individual item. It also has many other uses I haven't even got into yet~!
0071762345|5.0|This book is a gold mine of information for any size business.  It not only breaks down social media marketing in a clear cut, manageable way - it is easy to read, incorporates entertaining stories and just makes sense.  There are tons of articles and blogs that give you the mechanics of Facebook marketing but Likeable goes the extra step and tells you how to be successful once those mechanics are in place.  It is my new social media marketing bible!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Nice bog simple painting program with undo, shows brushes in a tray, pencils, stickers, other tools, leaves a bit of transparency when using the paint brush, all large sizes, no small sizes or brush size selection, would be nice if it had at least ONE detail brush per color, like painting with a wet brush, very fluid, great for kids, I do find its simplicity and quick color ok, it has a graffiti feel to it because of the transparency built in to the strokes, it can make for nice color effects, the lack of a detail brush is a limit. The colors are limited to what is on the limited number of brushes, other tools, made for kids, sure, but it could cross over a bit with some changes. The other tools, color pencils have less range because of the tip size selections do not get down to a nice hard, thin line. This makes it a bit tough to use. One cannot write over the drawing, or sketch over it, to make notes in it, I would love one of these drawing apps to be able to use a text tool. Big thing missing that would make a drawing app sing, is a text tool, in this case one fine line tool with very precise size changes. This one just needs fine lines. How about ONE tool that is an ink pen. With fine tip adjustments. Then its a very useful app. Other than that its a really nice program.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|Really enjoyed this album. Just in time for Christmas time of year! Her voice is amazing. Love them. Deffinately worth a try! They did a much better \\"re-done\\" Christmas songs then a lot of other artists.

The app itself is great and it makes this purchase worth it simply from the standpoint of effortlessly being able to stream the music from your phone right to the receiver. The GUI on the app is very good.

She's watched it a few times and I know its going in her collection right next to Dream Girls and the old Christmas Carol lol. The Package it was in was easy to open and it got here well before then what it said it would I would order from them again. When I actually watch the movie I'll update my review to reflect that.

0312641893|4.0|Cinder is a cyborg--human with mechanical parts that were inserted after a near-fatal hovercraft accident when she was eleven years old. She doesn't remember anything about her life before the accident, and the only life she knows now is drudgery working for her cruel stepmother as a mechanic in New Beijing. But when the prince commissions her to repair his android and the plague strikes close to Cinder, she is suddenly exposed to a new world of secrets and politics that will help her unlock her past, and put her in danger.  Marissa Meyer's debut novel is a fun sci-fi take on the classic Cinderella fairy tale. Meyer's futuristic Beijing is imaginative and a fascinating setting for the story to unfold. There's a lot happening to Cinder in the very beginning of the book to suck the reader in, but the drama surrounding Cinder's past and the political struggles of Prince Kai aren't a huge mystery to the reader. Still, it's easy to just go with it considering that the growing relationship between the heroine and her prince is a lot of fun, and Cinder has a hard time fighting her attraction for him and at the same time hiding the fact that she's a cyborg. There are a couple of twists toward the end of the novel that help set up a few more fairy tale-esque mysteries to explore in future Lunar Chronicles installments, but Cinder winds down pretty quickly with a bit of a cliffhanger ending. This smart and unusual combination of fairy tales and interplanetary politics is engaging, and readers will look forward to future books in this fun new series.  Cover Comments: I like the bright red shoe, and the mechanical parts in the leg, but I admit that I am not a huge fan of the font that the title is in. Oh well, that's just a small thing!
B0068AWQQ2|1.0|I wanted to like this movie but I was disappointed at how bad this was. There was nothing scary or funny about this movie.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|Bought this movie for a friend as a Christmas gift. The movie is an eye-opener. It has everything in it....you will cry, you will smile and you will sit in silence and just think.
B0014I4KH6|4.0|My daughter has been crazy about Taylor so we gave her some music to listen to. CD came in good shape and has been played until the cows come home.....
B004QYTRRS|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and beautifully done. I loved Johnny Depp, Angelina Jolie & Paul Bettany in this movie, they pulled it off perfectly. Although this is a remake the director has managed to turn it into a fun and enjoyable light heart'ed thriller reminiscence of the classics like To Catch A Theif with Carry Grant.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|Bought the Zip Sleeve (Graphite) first.  Then I bought a leather cover.  Hate the cover, love the Sleeve.  In my opinion this is all thats needed to make the Kindle somewhat safe and easy to carry around and I can also store a stylus and a cleaning cloth in it too.  In the leather cover there is no storage of any kind, and the folding process does not produce the desired need for proping up.
0756405890|5.0|The Name of the wind is an absolutely incredible tale. It is highly imaginative, brilliantly executed and near impossible to put down.  The best way that I can describe this book is by calling it an Ursula Le Guin, George R Martin lovechild.   If you are a fan of dark fantasy and intelligent, captivating storytelling, do yourself a favor and buy this book!

B004PGNB1K|5.0|I enjoyed The Wise Man's Fear more than The Name of The Wind... if that is even possible.  This tale is magical and so very difficult to put down. I lost many hours of sleep reading this book, to the point where I would only stop reading when I could no longer keep my eyes open.  I loved the length of the book, as I was constantly left wanting more.   I do so hope that day 3 is released soon! I'm sure it will be absolutely brilliant.   Buy this book!
0062060554|2.0|When this book was assigned as our reader's group \\"pick-of-the-month\\" and I heard the synopsis, I got the book right away because I couldn't wait to dig in - especially knowing that Anita Shreve and Tess Gerritsen had given it good reviews. After reading about 50 pages, however, I started to wonder if Shreve and Gerritsen, not to mention Dennis LeHane, had taken leave of their senses. Because the book had been assigned, I felt compelled to finish it, but reading every page proved as painful as walking on a bed of nails. For one thing, I was unable to feel any sympathy for the central character, Christine, because the author created her out of a piece of cardboard. She was THAT one-dimensional, and the other characters didn't fare much better. I found the plotline plodding and tedious and not at all imaginative. At one point, I put the book down and said to my husband, \\"There had better be a payoff at the end. Otherwise, I've wasted my time reading this.\\" Sad to say, there was no payoff. It was as predictable and boring as the book itself. I applaud Mr. Watson for his perseverance in getting his work published, but I can't for the life of me understand what his literary agent saw in this book. And to think it made it to the NY Times Bestseller List? I'm sitting here scratching my head over that one.
B000KC4LNU|4.0|This is my least favorite Simon and Garfunkel album, but thats just my personal taste. I still listen to it and enjoy it but there better ones :)
B000PMG16U|3.0|Whereas George Lucas endlessly (but unnecessarily!) tinkers with the Original Trilogy (R2-D2 hiding behind a piece of rock in EP4 for this release for instance: Where did you get behind it, R2, btw?) the new Blu-Ray release would have been such a great opportunity to make some important changes to the Prequel movies to improve them. Considering the already available deleted scenes from the DVD-release EP2 and EP3 even significantly!  For a better movie one has to realize that adding the 100th action scene/frame is redundant as long as the main characterization, motives and feelings are not fully established/fleshed out!   EP1: Changes are almost negligible compared to EP2 and EP3 but IF the first choice should be \\"Farewell to Lira\\" naming Anakin the kindest boy in the galaxy! But even he could later fall to the dark side (by caring \\"too much\\" (especially meaningful when you have watched watched all 6 films!) Second might be a longer Tusken Pod race round 2 sequence (with the Javas!) for a better \\"merciless\\" connection to Anakin's slaughter of EP2.  EP2: THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE! As already stated by many critics and fans alike: Anakin's and Padme's romance has a SERIOUS, in fact HUGE, believability problem especially regading Padme's perspective! (He is yearning, so everything clear in that department!) Therefore it is essential for the whole story and for Anakin's final downfall in EPIII that the love story works and better well! For this it is essential to reinsert the \\"extended Naboo arrival\\" (where she speaks of having a family herself and her sister having the cutest kids in the whorld!) and the scene at \\"Padme's parents house\\" (showing the kids, the way both look at each other and of course the conversation in the kitchen). I am not perfectly sure about the Bedroom scene but I think I would add it too as a first sign of slowly \\"letting him in\\". If there are worries about the length of the film cut out or trim one (or more) of the aforementioned 100 action scenesfor compensation!  (I think the other \\"romance\\" scenes could be edited better as well - maybe there is some more material to choose from!)  EP3: By far not as important as changes in EP2 storywise but nevertheless would deliver additional perspective/insight. In short the whole complex of Bail's office, Padme's appartment and the chancellor's confrontation displays whole new dimensions in the doom of the republic and of course Anakin's: Padme ahgrees a secret loyal comitee (keeping it from Anakin), Jedis cannot be trusted anymore, gouvernors (temporarily?) ruling the sectors(!) and of course Palpatine reacting to \\"Petition 2000\\" in a harsh authoritarian way and talking with Anakin afterwards. Maybe even add the \\"plot to destroy the Jedi\\" for extraordinarity of action and seriousness. Again, cut out or trim action scenes like in EP2 in terms of movie length.  All this is without even taking the Blu-Ray deleted scenes into account...but I am sure they give even more options for improvement.  (The biggest issue with EP3 is Anakin's too abrupt final verge to the dark side after killing Mace Windu and rescuing Palpatine! Mybe there is some more footage for a re-edit to make it more fluent and smultaneously more convincing???)  Finally I have to say: The Prequel movies DO have potential! They ought to be better and they can! I pray for the next Blu-Ray release with improved versions to buy them!!!   Come on, George! Please!

B006P8KKYW|5.0|Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross strike gold again with an absolutely pitch-perfect score to compliment the twisted world of Stieg Larsson's neo-noir mystery thriller. Trent has said that he felt a bit out of his element with The Social Network--though that didn't stop him and Atticus from winning an Oscar--but in the case of GWDT they agree that they are more at home with the dark themes involving murder, violence, and torture. I can't think of a single track on this massive three hour score that doesn't ooze moodiness and atmosphere. Allow me to gush over some of these tracks for a moment.  The skittering noise and slow layering of frantic strings and drums in \\"Great Bird of Prey\\" all build up to a breathtaking climax, which works for the more intense scenes of the film. The booming drums and shakers give off a primal, animal-like quality which calls to mind the more bone-chillingly unforgiving side of Lisbeth's nature. Then there are the extremely sinister sounding ambient tracks such as \\"Cut into pieces\\", which begins with an unsettlingly insistent blare of static that gives way to discordant strings and swirling synth. The track evokes a feeling appropriate to its foreboding title.  Though the film doesn't have one consistent main theme, certain more melodic pieces are recurring in the film and help to give it a sense of cohesion. \\"Hidden in Snow\\", for example, is a piece which contains an immediately recognizable 12-note loop, accompanied by a shivering howl, and is used twice in the film during investigative phases. It makes you feel as if you are right alongside Lisbeth and Mikael, wading waist-deep through snow that obscures your vision so much, you can hardly see your hand in front your face...is there a killer lurking just around the corner?  \\"While Waiting\\" sounds like someone has taken a children's fairytale and thrown it into a warped alternate dimension. The track has the quality of an off-kilter lullaby which transforms the peaceful shadows surroundingan infant's cradle into looming monstrosities that look like clawed hands slowly inching forward to pull you deep into the darkness, never to return. The female voices, which should be the soothing croons of a loving mother, have an alarmingly hollow dissonance surrounding them.  Then there are some tracks which aren't featured in the film but are used in the trailers only, including \\"A Thousand Details\\", and \\"An Itch\\", which was featured largely in the last half of the 4-minute trailer. \\"A Thousand Details\\" in particular is one of my favorites, and has the fingerprints of Reznor and Ross all over it. A repetitive piano loop melts into a blood-pumping guitar riff, as a heavy bass and rapid drumbeats build, and build, and build, and build...into a climax that positively makes you want to scream from all the crackling, pent-up energy it produces.  \\"What if We Could?\\" is one of the more gentle tracks on the album, and seems to function as a theme for Lisbeth Salander. It's lovely. Both vulnerable and melancholic, yet simultaneously strong and with a touch of hawkish vigilance behind it, it embodies the fascinating character to a T. Reznor and Ross, as usual, know how to layer and build a track, and as writhing strings and synth encroach on the fragile melody we get a glimpse into the conflicted, contradictory mind of Larsson's heroine. For a moment, there seems to be a spot of intensely blinding brightness and hope...but then, all else recedes into the blackness, and the piano takes spotlight, trailing off unfinished and uncertain...a beautiful way to end the film.  Lastly, It would be a mistake to not mention the two fantastic covers which bookend the film and the score. First is the bass-heavy cover of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song, featuring Karen O on vocals. And can she sing. The amount of explosive, raw-lipped energy she brings to the classic rock song is incredible, and lets you know exactly what you're in for with Fincher's adaptation of the book. It sounds like she just screamed until her voice was hoarse, and the result is stylish, defiant, and spine-tinglingly spectacular. Perhaps Led Zep fans will find this to be sacrilege, but I now consider this to be my favorite version of the song. Finally, over the end credits comes a version of Bryan Ferry's oft-covered \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough?\\", performed by How to Destroy Angels, the band featuring Reznor and Ross on instrumentation and Reznor's wife Mariqueen Maandig on vocals. It's fairly different from the stuff found on their six-track EP, but no less effective. Featuring the trademark atmospherics of R&R's other work, the HDA cover leans towards a decidedly more grandiose tone than the original.  I cannot praise this score enough. If you are a fan of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' other work then this is a no-brainer, and even if you aren't, I encourage you to check out some of the tracks on youtube to see if they spark your interest. In my opinion this score handily surpasses the one for last year's Social Network; it is absolutely transporting. Press the play button and be prepared to enter another world, from which you will not emerge for the next three hours.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|So, this was a Christmas present for my kids.  The Blue-Ray disc has some problem that prevents it from being read properly by our player and the UV service is completely unusable.  Like others, I thought I was getting a real digital copy to download to iTunes, but instead we have have yet to be able to view the movie. The customer service from Flixster for the UV service is completely unresponsive.  I just submitted my second ticket with them after no response.  Not even the automated response assigning a ticket tracking number.    If at all possible avoid this product if you're looking for Digital copy.
B001993Y3G|2.0|Five stars for the movie and two for the blu-ray/HD transfer. Like many pre-2003 movies, this one has rather poor clarity and sharpness prevalent in most newer blu-ray movies. Some of the darker scenes are heavily pixelated and are comparable to VHS quality....from a very worn out tape. There are even a couple of spots where the audio is grossly out of sync with the video. Warner Bros. should be ashamed for releasing mess such as this! If you can get this on sale, then get it solely for it being the extended version. Otherwise, don't waste your money and opt for the cheaper DVD version instead.

1451627289|5.0|Each year, for Christmas, my brother-in-law presents me with the newest Stephen King book. Some years there isn't a new one but this is a very good year. It is not the usual \\"horror\\" that Mr. King (and I) prefer but it is a very good book.  There is one phrase that is close to the story of my life. It is the last line on page 371, \\"Dancing is life.\\" I totally agree Mr. King!
B000W4HIX6|5.0|Even though Christmas is over, the title still stands, this is the ultimate movie for Christmastime, but it can be watched year-round for full enjoyment.  Aside from being the ultimate Christmas movie, this is one of the absolute best action movies ever, certainly a fine reason why the 80's was THE decade for action movies.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />It's Christmas Eve, and a New York Cop named John McClane (Bruce Willis) flies into Los Angeles to  visit his estranged wife, but things go awry when a group of German terrorists/thieves led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) invade the office building and cut off any possible contact to keep hostages from calling the cops.  The only one out of Gruber's control is McClane, who desperately and quickly has to come up with ways to stop the terrorists.<br /><br />TENSION/CHARACTERS<br /><br />What separates most action movies from Die Hard is that the hero, McClane, is very vulnerable.  This creates a lot of tension while watching the movie, and I'd even say that compared to even the best action movies, Die Hard probably has the largest amount of tension because even after the initial viewings, I was still riddled with tension in the scenes where McClane gets really hurt.<br /><br />This is where the characters come in.  Because of the fact that John McClane is such a vulnerable protagonist, he's more believable as a person and this vulnerability makes him creative with his plans to  weed out the terrorists infesting the Nakatomi building.  While it's natural to root for the action hero for an action movie, you're rooting for McClane even harder to win because he faces steeper obstacles than most other action heroes.  Rickman, despite being an Englishman, manages to pull off a rather convincing German accent.  He also does a great job playing a slimy terrorist leader, since he has no problem personally killing his hostages and has a smooth charisma that keeps him from going into over-the-top territory.<br /><br />The supporting cast is solid as well.  Reginald Vel Johnson does a great job as Al Powell, a police officer whose the first to uncover the clandestine terror heist Gruber and his cronies are conducting by McClane throwing a dead terrorist's body on his car just as he's about to leave the Nakatomi plaza (with humorous effects).  I must say, as a kid of the 90's, it was weird seeing Vel Johnson spew profanity and even be in this type of movie because of the fact that I grew up watching Family Matters (where he played Carl Winslow).  Bonnie Bedelia is solid as Holly Gennaro-McCane, John McClane's estranged wife.  The actors playing Gruber's cronies all do a good job, particular Alexander Godunov as Karl, Hans's right-hand man, since they're all good at being loathsome and menacing.<br /><br />ACTION SCENES<br /><br />The action scenes in Die Hard are top notch and highly memorable.  The action scenes, going along with the premise of a highly-vulnerable protagonist, exercise a great deal of creativity with the methods of combat McClane adapts to make it out alive.  For example, after the LAPD arrive in droves in response to claims of terrorists in the building, they deploy an armored car, but Gruber's cronies start attacking it with a tripod-mounted anti-tank guided missile launcher.  Because McClane is several stories above the attackers, he drops a block of C4 strapped to a broken computer monitor and computer chair down to the floor the anti-tank personnel are to wipe them out.  McClane eventually gets confronted by one of the terrorists and engage in a brutal gun and hand-to-hand fight.  This ends with McClane beating one of the terrorists and hanging him with a  bunch of chains.  When the top floor of the Nakatomi building is blown up, McClane escapes by swinging from a firehose he tied to himself and breaks through a glass window to get somewhere safe, but the spool holding the hose breaks loose and falls, dragging McClane towards the edge of the floor, and has to quickly untiehimself so he doesn't plummet to his grave.  That scene was really, really tense.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT<br /><br />This is R-rated for good reason.  Being a top-tier action movie, there's a good deal of bloody violence and death infesting this masterpiece.  Towards the beginning of the ordeal, Gruber executes Takagi, the executive of the Nakatomi corporation, since he won't cooperate with Gruber, and you see a bunch of blood gush against the glass wall during the execution (which looks realistic and really daunting).  One of the hardest scenes to watch is when McClane (whose barefoot throughout the whole ordeal against Gruber), has to flee a group of terrorists through a floor covered in broken glass.  This leads to a scene where McClane hides in one of the bathrooms to pull out the glass shards out of his bloody feet.  There's even some nudity towards the beginning when one of the terrorists grabs one of the female hostages and pulls down her party dress to reveal her breasts, and McClane bumps into a calendar depicting a nude female model a few times in one of the rooms under construction in the building.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />The music in Die Hard is top notch.  Overall, it's rather daunting and exciting, and the music is a perfect fit for the type of movie being played here.  Michael Kamen did a great job with the music here, and he'd do really well with the soundtrack for Event Horizon nine years after this.  There's even a Christmas song done by Run-DMC played towards the beginning of the movie, and some other Christmas tunes being played to bring about the \\"Christmas feeling\\" to this movie.<br /><br />NOSTALGIC ELEMENTS<br /><br />While this thankfully isn't a dated movie by any stretch, there's some bits of dialogue and character details that make it a perfect snapshot of the 80's.  For example, when Argyle (McClane's limo driver) brags about all the gadgets in the limousine, he brags about it having VHS.  Also, when the terrorist heist catches wind of the media, the reporter states that Gruber is the head of a West German terrorist organization.  I guess it's because the Berlin Wall collapsed when I was only two years-old, this particular element certainly shows its age, but like I said earlier, it doesn't deter any enjoyment to be had in this film.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />This is an action movie masterpiece, and probably John McTiernan's best film.

0307387178|5.0|There's a lot to like about this short book.  There's Alex McCandless - quixotic, recalcitrant, atavistic, naive, charming, intelligent young man hopelessly caught between the modern and natural worlds.  While it's a story about his struggle with his place in the world and survival in the wild, it is also about our struggle with the detachment of our selves from nature.  Have we completely lost our way from our animal past, can we live in the wild again, should we want to?  It's also the story of youthful rebellion and the role just blind dumb luck plays in whether we truly suffer, and therefore understand, the consequences of our actions.  Alex was compelled to find the highly idealized version of nature he read about in the books of London and Thoreau, without realizing it's really only a fiction.  It would be easy to write Alex off as a kook, in way over his head in the wilderness of Alaska, but he was more than that.  Here's a guy who made a lasting impact on nearly everyone he encountered along the way, even if he interacted with them for a few minutes, that's why we care and that's ultimately why the author was able to piece together what happened to him.  Really a great book, well worth reading.
B004MWI2M0|5.0|Bought this set for my 10 yr. old godson for Christmas.  He has a collection of Legos, but mostly Star Wars.  He wants to start collecting Pirates legos now.  When he received it, he put it together immediately.  After playing with it for about 20 minutes, he commented to his mother that this was the best of all the Legos he has.  I would recommend purchasing this for any kid who's into Legos and or building things.  It has a spinning wheel, and does not break apart easily.

1416955070|3.0|*Spoiler-free  Ok. So, I did actually enjoy this book, but it left me torn. Ya see, I found it entertaining. It wasn't a literary masterpiece, but nevertheless, it was good in that it kept me interested. Yah, I saw certain things coming from a mile away, but the plot and character interactions were good enough to override that. I definitely made allowances for some weak plot points and awful editing, but good storytelling usually wins me over.   I have heard all the plagiarism talk about this author, but whatevs. Most previous reviewers have likened this book to other series, Star Wars, and to her fanfic stuff, but again, whatevs. When I read a book I am engrossed in that world and all that other stuff is nonsense.   Here's the thing though, while I won't spoil it, the author ended this book on a really unpleasant note. Vom-inducing if u ask me. C'mon, Clare. It marred an otherwise decent book. I know it was a ploy and I know it'll get resolved, but she just left it out there hanging in the wind and ended the book. Arggh.   Anywho, will I read the next in series? Yah. Am I in a rush to do so? Nah.

034552554X|1.0|I had such high hopes for this book when i read a preview on my nook.  However, i was thoroughly disappointed.  The main character, Victoria, is very weakly sketched out.  The reader is given no reasons to like her.  I felt empathy for her at first because she is in the foster care system and very alone.  But throughout the novel, people are reaching out to help her and love her, and she constantly repels them.  It is unclear why these other very likable characters continue to wait for her and pine for her over months and years when all she does is cause them misery.  When she is given her own room for the first time, she is thrilled, but proceeds to ruin the room for the next inhabitant.  This happens again when a stranger helps her out with an apartment.  It is really hard to root for this character or to care what happens to her next.   Learning about the Victorian language of flowers, i.e. using flowers to deliver covert messages and meanings, seems like it would be interesting, but it becomes tedious and almost superfluous to the story.    I hated this book and could not wait until it was over.

B000002GXX|5.0|Eagles / One Of These Nights:  This is another great album from Eagles.  This is also another Short album from Eagles.  Nevertheless, this album deserves Five Stars.  For you fans of \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\", the track \\"Journey of the Sorcerer\\" was used as the intro song to the old BBC Television version of \\"Hitchhikers\\".
B001E57SH8|5.0|This lighter is amazing!! I could not find any Zippo Premium fuel, I have been using Xikar fuel with no problems. This lighter can be lit at an angle.

B00003XAVA|5.0|David Crosby & Graham Nash / Wind on the Water: This is Crosby and Nash with a little help from Levon Helm, James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Danny Kortchmar, David Lindley, and a bunch of other great musicians.  There is not a bad track to be found here and many of these are familiar hits.  This is a masterpiece album that stands equal to the best of the CSN, &Y releases.  A true Masterpiece.  Five Stars.
0393064476|5.0|I finished this book in two sittings, a rare experience in my life. I was amazed at how easy it was to read, considering that it could quite easily have become a pedantic bore.  I should also note that, while it officially checks in at 356 pages, fully one-quarter are endnotes, bibliography and index.  The text most of us will read was only 266 pages.    The book is in three main parts: 1) a short biography of Poggio Braccolini of Terranuova in Tuscany, who discovers Lucretius' poem in a German monastery, has it transcribed and brings it to the attention of other intellectuals of the day, but who also served as a high level assistant to multiple popes and as the titular head of the republic of Florence, which career enables the author to present numerous highly sensational anecdotes illustrating the intrigues within the upper echelons of the Roman Catholic Church at the time; 2) a brief exegesis of Lucretius' poem in the context of the philosophical trends in the Roman Empire from the time of the Caesars to the time of its collapse, which enables him, again, to pepper the text with numerous sensational details and stories about life and death in the Roman empire; and 3) illustrations of ways in which the philosophy of Lucretius's poem resonated in late Renaissance, Reformation and Enlightenment thinking.  Not too many juicy anecdotes in that part of the book.  I found this surprisingly entertaining, while it manages also to maintain the serious intellectual perspective one would expect from the author (whose \\"Will in the World\\" I also read and enjoyed very much).
B00000IIXH|3.0|Bruce Springsteen / 18 Tracks:  If you're a looking for a decent collection of Springsteen's best work, there isn't one (as of 2012).  The closest you can get is to buy the \\"The Essential\\" 3 CD set and then add this \\"18 Tracks\\" CD to it in order to fill in the glaring gaps.  The result will be that you will get Almost all his best work and will still end up with a lot of filler.  As a single CD however, this is a Three Star release (at best).
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs was a remarkable individual who contributed immensely to the growth of humanity's information revolution. Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs is outstanding. The book provides a remarkable amount of detail about Job's personal and business life, but it does not get lost in the detail. The book reads like a novel and I found it hard to put down. Now I must admit that I have been a Macintosh computer fan for over 20 years and that fact probably helped me to identify with this book. But I highly recommend it to any lover of biography and especially to those interested in the development of the personal computer.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|Bruce Springsteen / The Essential...:  Not being a Springsteen fanatic, I wanted a good collection of his best work (without the filler).  Discovering that such a collection does not exist, I settled for this decently priced (at the time) 3 CD set and then purchased the other \\"18 Tracks\\" CD in order to get close to a proper `best of' collection.  As a result of these purchases, I got Almost all his best stuff and ended up with a lot of filler anyway.  Perhaps someday they will make a proper retrospective of Springsteen's best, but this set (and \\"18 Tracks\\") will have to do.  Four Star set.

B000007ODL|4.0|J. J. Cale / The Definitive Collection:  J. J. is the writer of many hits for other people.  This CD has his own versions of those hits plus several other excellent songs.  This album is very enjoyable and is a fine collection of his songs, but the best versions are still the ones that Other people has done.  J. J.'s writing is fantastic.  His singing is fair.  This CD is a solid Four Star release.
0385523912|5.0|This is a great book and details the lives of six people who defected to South Korea.  This country is falling apart and literally, nobody gets paid or has useful jobs.  However the West pumps in billions of dollars of food aid so the military can build missiles and nuclear weapons.  With the recent death of Kim Jung Il, it is time to cut this country off aid, and stipulate that they must give up their nuclear weapons before any more food is given to them.<br /><br />This regime is a totalitarian dictatorship similar to Stalin or Mao.  The West needs to put itself at arm's length with this regime.  They starve their people, create a class system, have a slave labor system and endanger the world.<br /><br />This is a great read about a bad political regime.  This communist dictatorship starves its people and provides nothing to the general population.
B000001EGA|3.0|Elton John / Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy:  There are several radio friendly tunes here, all sounding like they came from The Partridge Family, or a concert from `Up with People'.  If this is a concept album, nobody realized it until decades later when they proclaimed they were making a sequel to it.  Elton and Bernie took all the Wrong lessons away from their \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" masterpiece and became `hit' makers instead of album makers.  This CD can serve as a collection of Elton John's mid `70s radio hits, but that all it's worth (and we still get this stuff over the radio anyway).  This marked the death of Elton John as an artist.  I'll be generous and give this one Three Stars.

B00008BLB8|5.0|Grand Funk Railroad / Caught In The Act:  This is an excellent live album that includes some early greats along with their late era pop-songs, which makes this the perfect substitute for those rather embarrassing late albums that had one or two hits and not much else.  GFR was always a better live band than studio band and this CD is a treat.  This however is far from being an `ultimate' live CD for, as good as it is, this is more of a companion piece to the earlier GFR live releases.  Yet, this live CD deserves Five Stars.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game supplies hours of fun for all ages. Beautiful levels and simple controls make this game a must have. The best part-its FREE. The only downside is that it has ads that are constantly popping up and getting in the way.

B000056JYC|5.0|Peter Frampton / Frampton comes alive (deluxe edition - bonus tracks):  When this album was originally released, it was priced a few dollars cheaper than comparable double LPs of the time and so folks who would not have bought it at the higher price were picking it up.  However, when they played it, they found that this was not only an excellent live set, but also a Fun live set.  From there, the word of mouth spread on this gem and the radio stations started playing the best cuts.  This Deluxe version of the album adds four missing songs from the tour and they are a fine addition to the release.  This still holds up as a fun and wonderful live set.  Five Stars.

B000002GYG|5.0|Tom Waits / Nighthawks At The Diner:  With a voice like rusted sandpaper, Tom Waits' live album is audio performance art at its best and it is one of the very best albums ever made.  The songs and stories all seem to come from some distant forgotten place and yet they all speak of the times we have lived in, whether that was the 1930's, 1950's, 1975, 2001, or today.  This album is a Masterpiece.  This one deserves a Sixth Star.  Highly Recommended.

B000002I99|5.0|Alice Cooper / Welcome To My Nightmare:  For a musical version of a total mental breakdown, this is very entertaining stuff.  This one ain't for the kiddies however.  The addition of Vincent Price as the `curator' is a stroke of genius which lifts this good album into a solid Five Star album.
B005R5U5B2|5.0|This really is one of the finest pop albums of many a year! It's done exceptionally in the UK where the group had the indignity of coming second on 2010's The X Factor. This usually means career death but both OD and the equally popilicious Olly Murs have beaten this curse.<br /><br />I have the so-called Yearbook Edition of the album, which apart from featuring superior hard-book style packaging, also includes 2 bonus tracks, the upbeat Stand Up and a co-write by man of the moment Ed Sheenan, Moments. It goes without saying that this is the version to buy.<br /><br />1st single What Makes You Beautiful rips off Summer Nights on the intro but is a perfect pop single. It's hung around the notoriously fickle UK for three months now. 2nd single Gotta Be You has done well too but isn't actually one of the better tracks. One Thing is the third single and is just the most joyous thing. It does sound rather similar to the Backstreet Boys' I Want It That Way, but actually improves on it!<br /><br />In truth, there isn't a bad track here. There's nothing too soppy, the vocals and production are first rate and the group's youth and vitality really come across. You just can't help but smile when Up All Night is playing and after 2 or 3 hearings you'll be singing along too. At 15 tracks the album really should outstay it's welcome but it honestly doesn't. It's a gem.<br /><br />Of course One Direction will never be the critics favourite. But if you love pure pop music with great choruses and sparkling production, you should be enormously happy with Up All Night. I hope the US take the group to their hearts and that the album becomes a regular fixture on the radio there.
B000002KFJ|1.0|Black Sabbath / Sabotage:  apart from a single decent track, this album is wretched.  This band once had guts and imagination.  Now they are a full blown parody of themselves. The band should have posed for their picture wearing rubber ball noses and big floppy shoes.  One Star

B000002KCC|5.0|Neil Young / Tonight's the Night:  Neil wrote this album with the anger, frustration and sorrow he felt about the death of his Crazy Horse band mate Danny Whitten.  That death hung over the entire recording of this album but did not diminish the quality of the album.  There may not be many `hits' on this one but it is still a keeper.  Five Stars.
1593157134|5.0|Avid readers of life enhancement books often come to the realization that what they are reading is the same thing they have read many times before, only in a different package. These books are all helpful and even if it is just re-packaged information you've read before, repetition is always helpful, but you can really get the urge to read something genuine and new. Look no further than Darren Hardy's THE COMPOUND EFFECT. Are there going to be things you've read before? Probably, but there is also a ton of original content and actionable ideas that will really help you develop a new path for life.<br /><br />Of course the basic premise of the book is built upon the compound effect of a penny doubled each day for a month. I'm sure most readers know well the dramatic results of this simple exercise. Hardy illustrates how to apply this same compounding principle to virtually any aspect of life. The book is filled with pearls of wisdom such as finding your motivation. Hardy uses the example of walking a plank 10\\" wide and 30' long. Sitting on the ground, walking the plank is no problem, but when suspended between two 100' buildings we wouldn't do it; unless, as Hardy suggests, our child were on top of the other building and it were on fire, then we would cross the plank without hesitation.<br /><br />Course corrections, goal setting, developing good habits and eliminating bad ones, building momentum, why-power, personal associations; it's all here and all laid out in easy to apply methods that cannot help but have a positive impact on your life - IF YOU APPLY THEM.<br /><br />Darren Hardy has a real winner here. As the editor of Success Magazine - an indispensible resource in and of itself - Hardy has had the benefit of learning first hand from some of the most powerful and influential leaders of our time and he has compiled his knowledge into this volume that will surely take its place as a staple on most `must read' lists. I give this book my highest recommendation.

0312641893|5.0|One word: AMAZING. It's billed as a fairy tale retelling and while I caught the references to Cinderella, Cinder is so much more than that. This one has it all--an engaging and relatable heroine, a unique plot, a prince, an evil queen, magic-like powers, cyborgs (YES, cyborgs), a futuristic setting, and a deadly plague threatening to decimate the population of Earth. Yeah, it doesn't get much better than Cinder.<br /><br />Add to all this the smooth, easy writing style of Marissa Meyer and you have one of the best debuts of 2012. I'm already counting down the days until the release of part 2 in 2013. Feiwel & Friends seems to be just hitting it out of the park with their releases for the coming year.<br /><br />Cinder is totally likeable. Her guardian (evil-stepmother) Adri treats her as a servant and as a burden. She has no friends save for her stepsister Peony--who contracts the plague--and a \\"defective\\" android. But she's feisty, smart, and confident even though she is trapped in a hopeless situation. I couldn't help but love her.<br /><br />Kai wasn't ultra swoon-worthy, but he had his moments and I certainly found myself sympathizing with his plight--losing his parents to the plague, the burden of becoming emperor at such a young age, dealing with the demands and the threat of war from the evil Queen Levana.<br /><br />Speaking of Queen Levana, I have to tell you that she is one of the creepiest villains. She's unfeeling, calculating, manipulative--all while projecting an image of perfect beauty and wearing a painted-on smile. I LOVE her.<br /><br />The setting is a futuristic society in China, still reeling from the effects of World War 4 and currently suffering from a plague that kills everyone it touches. I liked the fact that while there was a mixed populace, hovercrafts, and androids, there was still a sense of Old World tradition and prejudices that made it familiar and real.<br /><br />In the end, I was left wanting more. I will warn you that there is a cliffhanger ending. This story won't be resolved in one book, so don't be surprised when it happens. That being said, this is an incredible book that is not yo be missed. Covet, borrow, acquire. Do what you have to do, just get your hands on this book. You won't be disappointed.book, so don't be surprised when it happens. That being said, this is an incredible book that is not yo be missed. Covet, borrow, acquire.

B005HIBWFW|3.0|The Music Lovers shows its age and the quality of the film is clearly not as pristine that are currently shown on our high quality video machines.  The story is good, not great as is the acting.  I thought it interesting but lacked the depth of acting or direction that characterizes the best of our films made today.  It sacrifices a better view of a great man to the lurid relationships to gain general viewer interest.  Good, not great.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America is one of those super hero movies that actually lives up to it's promise. Chris Evans is perfect as the spirited young American boy who has his heart and mind in the right place. What he lacks to go with his indomitable spirit is a body to match. This 80 lb weakling with the spirit of a lion hasn't long to wait as WWII brings a need for men like Steve Rodgers, but he lacks the physicality to serve in the military. His patriotism and spirit won't allow him to take \\"NO\\" for an answer. Rejection is not in Steve Rodger's book. After receiving \\"several\\" F4 ratings for being physically unfit for service, Steve tries one last time and is noticed by an imminent scientist, Dr. Reinstein, who takes notice of Steve's spirit and determination and that makes him the ideal subject for his experiment to create a \\"super soldier\\" for the US military. Reinstein ok's the papers and Steve is in the military, but it won't be easy sailing as Steve is about to discover, as his life and body are changed forever. Along for the ride is Steve's best friend, the businessman/inventor grandfather of Ironman, a lovely female soldier with eyes for Steve, both before and after his transformation and a team of fellow soldier misfits who form a \\"lose\\" team headed by Captain America.<br /><br />I saw this movie in the theater it's opening weekend in a packed house. The movie was an instant hit with the audience. There were actual applause and cheers during the showing. Something I haven't seen in a movie showing for some time! The film is rich in American patriotism, as was common during the story period, and is not shy with a positive American presentation. The villains are perfectly matched to the heroes. Red Skull was created using an imperfected version of the process that created Captain America. As head of Hydra (an organization created by Hitler and the Nazis to further Nazi military technologies), Red Skull betrays the Nazi government to fulfill his own plans and desires and turns Hydra into his own power base with a totally loyal army of his own. He even kills several top Nazi leaders to send Hitler the message. Using top Nazi scientist and advanced Nazi technologies, he and Hydra are a true threat to the world that leaves the Nazis and Hitler in the dust.<br /><br />To stop Red Skull and Hydra brings out the best in Steve and his team, but at great cost. And this leads Captain America to become a true super hero as he must sacrifice everything he knows to do what is right. His ultimate challenge will be his long sleep in frozen hibernation, after thwarting Red Skull, that allows him to continue into our modern times and to become a part of the Avenger team today after his body is discovered in a glacier.<br /><br />Not a cheesy or quaint film or story, but a rediscovery of what it truly means to be an American and what America stands for. All embodied in a boy given the chance to prove himself and the spirit of Americanism within him.into his own power base with a totally loyal army of his own.

B005CMSDLE|1.0|What do you do when you have good actors in a terrible movie?  Well, that is the problem with this movie.  The story was great.  The actors were great.  The music was HORRIBLE!!!  Reminded me of that European expiremental garbage.  Just didn't felt like a cheap movie soundtrack.  One review mentioned it was made by the \\"The Chemical Brothers\\".  They're name fits the music...\\"Toxic\\".  One of the other movies I heard a soundtrack similar to this was on the \\"Tron: Legacy\\" movie.  But, that soundtrack flowed.  This one was just a lot of confusion.  At one point it sounded like the music was the sound in the movie, then I realized it was the song!!!<br /><br />The movie could've done without that little obnoxious girl she ended up \\"befriending\\".  Wow, what a weird family that was.  Product of hippie parents.  That whole little side-story really was unnecessary.<br /><br />I had never seen the girl that played \\"Hannah\\".  She was really good and believable.  Too bad she was a product of a bad film.  I don't know who to blame.  The Director, Producer, or Screenplay.  So, I'll blame them all.<br /><br />I do agree that the photography of the movie was excellent.  Great angles, shots, etc.<br /><br />The pace of the movie was slow and you wanted more action and intensity.  Unfortunately, you didn't get that.  The fight scenes you wanted to see more of.  They were just over too quickly.  I know that the movie was supposed to be more realistic, and not a Kung Fu movie per se.  But, it could have been done a little more interestingly.<br /><br />I really didn't like this movie.  But, that is just me.  I go more for substance of story and pace.  This movie had none of that.<br /><br />It reminded me of a bad version of \\"The Professional\\" with Natalie Portman.  Now that was a very good movie.  This one couldv'e been in that same level as story and production.  But, it fell very short.  My recommendation is to avoid this movie.<br /><br />It's PG-13, but I think it could've and should've been \\"R\\".  Some of the \\"themes\\" in that movie were more fitting for \\"R\\".  I'm glad I didn't let my oldest son see it.for \\"R\\".  I'm glad I didn't let my oldest son see it.

1594744769|4.0|I was exceedingly interested in reading the rest of this book after reading the \\"look inside\\" pages on Amazon. I went out and bought the book the same day after I got off work and ran home to read it. Over the next two days during work and after, I got though almost all of it until about the last five chapters and put it down. I didn't pick it back up until the next week when I decided to finish it. I was awaiting a gigantic ending for such an epic children's tale of fantasy verse reality. I was, in so few words, let down. I wanted more from the ending and it was just a slighted cliff hanger to a sequel I haven't heard much about come out. If there is to be a second book (and I really hope there is for the sake of the lovers of this novel) then this book is EVERYTHING that a great read should be. If there isn't a sequel to come... I must say that if not for the ending, this book would receive the highest rating.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|I was disappointed for the first few minutes of the movie.  It seemed more like a travelogue.  Then it started to improve.   It became very thought provoking and a fascinating view into human beliefs.  I ended up loving the flick.  Wonderful, thoughtful, insightful, really brilliant movie.
B003O97W5K|4.0|\\"Poltergeist\\" is the closest that Steven Spielberg has come to making a horror film. Yes, I know Tobe Hooper got credit for directing the film but Spielberg's fingerprints are all over this movie.<br /><br />The film remains creepy all these years later holding up remarkably well probably because Spielberg and Hooper rely on old fashioned suspense thrilling techniques to anchor the movie while employing some novel (at the time) and new techniques. The other part that keeps \\"Poltegeist\\" so potent are the strong performances by the actors particularly Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson in the main roles as the parents.<br /><br />\\"Poltergeist\\" looks quite nice in its Blu-ray debut--the film looks surprisingly sharp with robust colors (particularly when compared to the original DVD transfer--the remastered DVD comes from the same high definition source and looks quite nice as well). Detail is quite nice and while there is some mild speckling springkled throughout the film, the presentation looks spectular for the most part.<br /><br />Unfortunately when the movie was remastered for Blu-ray and DVD we didn't get any extras such as a commentary track (no suprise given that Spielberg doesn't like commentary tracks) nor do we get any extras on the making of the movie (not even the vintage featurette done at the time).<br /><br />We DO get a rather clever featurette that discusses the subject matter of the film. The featurette entitled \\"They Are Here\\" is pretty good even if it isn't tied directly into the production of the film. We get a parade of parapsychologists surrounded by clips from the movie discussing the REAL world of spirits.<br /><br /> The film is surrounded by tragedy (as there was the murder of one cast member and the premature death of Heather O'Rouke. Perhaps the rumors that swirled around the film at the time that Spielberg had stepped in and taken over the direction of the film played a role in the decision not to include anything about the making of the movie itself.<br /><br />The audio isn't lossless which is a pity--it's presented in a 16 bit presentation that's quite nice but I'm a bit surprised we didn't get a lossless presentation.<br /><br />Although I'm a little disappointed by the lack of extras here the film itself looks exceptionally good and THAT'S what you'll end up viewing over and over again.<br /><br />Recommendeda pity--it's presented in a 16 bit presentation that's quite nice but I'm a bit surprised we didn't get a lossless presentation.

038572179X|4.0|How can you atone for a mistake which so drastically alters someone's life?    13-year-old Briony Tallis aspires to being a writer. On a summer day in 1935, she witnesses a part of scene between her older sister and the son of a servant, and her imagination takes off. Later, she accuses Robbie of a terrible crime, and once the attentions of the adults and police are focused on her, she feels compelled to complete her story. This is her crime, whose repercussions the book follows through World War II and beyond, and for which Briony will spend her life trying to atone.   This is a complex novel that explores issues class, guilt, love, war and forgiveness. The reader knows this is an injustice and can only hope for an eventual resolution. I was horrified that no one took a good look at the situation and saw the obvious flaws in this young girl's testimony. But then, she was an upper class young lady of a fine family, and he was the strong laborer trying to \\"get above his station.\\"  Cecilia, in my opinion, is equally to blame for locking herself in her room at the outset and not coming forward until it is too late to save Robbie. She also atones; she completely cuts herself off from her family and continuously works to try to reverse the damage. Robbie is left to try to piece together some semblance of a life; his service during WW 2 is in part an effort to expunge his record.   Jill Tanner's performance of this audio book is wonderful. She's able to express the boredom and outrage of the young teen Briony, the passion and excitement of Cecilia, the anxiety and confusion of Pierrot and Jackson, the petulance and superiority of Lola, and the hope and determination of Robbie.   .  .   * * * *  SPOILER  ALERT  * * * *    .  .  .  The issue of class is further evident because while Cecilia firmly believes that Robbie had nothing to do with the attack on Lola, she automatically focuses her attentions on Danny Hardman, a lad from the village. She never suspects Paul Marshall. Paul, after all, was the scion of a wealthy family, a college man, and a good friend of Leon Tallis. And later in life when Briony wants to tell the \\"real\\" story, she is advised against doing so because surely the Marshalls would sue her for libel. Yes, Lola marries Paul Marshall, and is now the wealthy wife who, along with her husband, supports many worthy charities. Their \\"class\\" insulates them from scrutiny.
0439023491|5.0|As I said on the initial review of The Hunger Games, this entire series sets the standard for all other books in this genre.  It is an outstanding story, and you need to read it at least twice to fully appreciate it.  It's so intense, you'll miss a lot on the first go around.<br /><br />Catching Fire picks up right where Hunger Games leaves off, and doesn't stop until you turn the last page.  I found myself reading late into the night because I just couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />The dynamic between Katniss and Peeta, and also Katniss and Gale is further fleshed out in Catching Fire.  Katniss begins to realize the Capitol will never let her live the life she had expected in District 12.  The extent the government will go to in order to control its people becomes even more apparent as the Quarter Quell games are announced.  This in particular shocked me, that Katniss, having survived the Hunger Games once, must now face it again with Peeta.  I enjoyed Finnick's character, and you'll come to appreciate him even more in the next book.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending, but it has all of the unexpected twists this series delivers on.<br /><br />Parental concerns are the same as what I listed for The Hunger Games.  I would personally not let a child under 8th grade read this due to the violence it contains.  It's a gritty, gripping tale, horrifying at the core (as it should be) for pitting people against each other to the death.  Peeta and Katniss kiss on several occasions, Katniss and Gale kiss (she's a confused young woman), but the biggest concern for me is the violence.  A child needs to be old enough to verbalize the emotions evoked from what they're reading, and this book will provide plenty of opportunities for that.<br /><br />I have read Suzanne Collins series \\"Gregor the Overlander\\" also and thoroughly enjoyed it, but Hunger Games is her absolute best work, IMHO.  You won't be disappointed.

0439023521|5.0|I've read the entire Hunger Games series twice, and I loved it the first time, but love it even more after the second read.  I think you do have to read it again to truly appreciate all that this story is.  I'll get to that in reviews of the other books.  The Hunger Games is a gritty story - it's not for the squeamish or faint of heart.  I initially resisted reading the series based on the idea of children pitted against each other to the death.  It is horrifying to consider, and it should be.    Katniss's character is well fleshed out and relatable.  Due to her circumstances, she has been forced into the role of caring and providing for her family, a burden no child should have to bear.  Because of the protectiveness she has for her younger sister, Prim, Katniss volunteers to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games.  From that point on in the book, it all breaks loose into a roller coaster ride that will leave you reading through the wee hours of the night just to see what happens next.   Side note - as others have mentioned, I also cried when Rue died.  Katniss showing the tenderness and compassion that she did for her friend, plus acknowledging the bread that came from Rue's district had me reaching for the kleenex box.    For parental concerns, I personally would not let a child under 8th grade read it due to the amount of violence it contains.  I think a child needs to be old enough to verbalize what they are feeling as they are reading, and this book in particular is ripe with potential conversations you can have with them about it.  There is no cursing in the book, Katniss and Peeta kiss on several occasions.  Katniss is stripped by her prep team as they prepare her for the Hunger Games, but it is only mentioned in context.  There is nothing sexual about it.  The biggest issue for me was the violence and making sure my child was emotionally ready to read something this graphic.  Be forewarned though - once you read Hunger Games, all other books in this genre will pale in comparison.  Suzanne Collins is unparalleled in her writing skills.  Some advice though, do read the series *at least* twice.  You'll be surprised at what you miss the first go around.

0802130208|3.0|I know A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is a classic, has won tons of awards, and is some people's favorite book of all time, but I found myself underwhelmed. Ignatius was original and a lot of the writing was hilarious, but the plot was so clunky and uninteresting that I spent a lot of time wondering where the book was going. I tried to give Toole the benefit of the doubt, but over time even Ignatius and his little stories became repetitive. I grew bored reading about a character without any real plot to bring it all together. When I finally got to the climax I had a 'this is it?' reaction.

B004QK5N5W|1.0|I bought Apple instead of an after market product so that I wouldn't have any problems. Used the product one day with my iPad and it worked fine. Tried to use it the very next day and it wouldn't work. I kept getting the message \\"\\"this accessory is not supported by iPad\\". I wouldn't feel quite as bad had I not been showing it to a friend. I was bragging on how good a picture it showed and I had to eat my words. Now I'm confused as to why it worked at all. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get it to work again or if I'll have to eat the $39 bucks as well. I feel like I wasted my money. I had the product for a while before I used it so I think its too late to send it back. I read other reviews and they were mixed. It worked for some and not for others. If you take a chance on this product make sure you try it out right away so that you'll still have time to send it back if it doesn't work. Only problem is it might only work that first time. It's a shot in the dark.
0385535139|2.0|I had promised myself that I would not read another offering from Mr. Grisham after he treated his readers rather flippantly by admonishing them not to question is research at the end of the last book I read from him, \\"The Confession: A Novel\\".  However, I decided to give him another chance but in retrospect, I should have stuck to my original decision.  The book was predictable down to the last word on the last page.  The broad story arc is reminiscent of previous (better) books by Mr. Grisham where the protagonist is depicted as a cog in the wheel of a large corporation that is intent on sucking the very life force out of him or her.  However, early on in this book, the protagonist has an epiphany that causes him to trade the rare air of the expensive corporation for the dodgy confines of a law firm that makes its ends meet by chasing ambulances.  (In fact, the pet mascot of this shady law firm is a dog called AC, short for Ambulance Chaser.  Funny.)  We follow the travails of the protagonist as he whips the partners of the small law firm into shape, while managing to find the time to reconnect with his wife, have a child, and save immigrant children from lead-paint poisoning.  All in a day's work.  I am sure this book will do well; Mr. Grisham has quite a following.  However, I think Mr. Grisham best do some research to see if he can reconnect with the odd readers who think his early work (A time to kill, The chamber) is by far his best (December 2011).

0385534639|4.0|The Night Circus Starts of with a great POV experience of you the reader entering the circus, which I found quite fitting and really puts you in the story.<br /><br />  The story then introduces you to Celia and her father, Hector Bowen, or as he is otherwise know as his stage name Prospero the Enchanter.  Hector is an illusionist or a magician, only one thing he isn't merely preforming tricks but real magic.  Celia,6, is dropped off with a suicide note attached to her shirt by from mother, telling Hector that she is now his responsibility.  He soon learns that Celia has the gift of magic.<br /><br />  Upon learning of his daughter's gift he meets the Mysterious Mr.A.H- and makes a wager that will that will determine his daughters life or death in a game of skills.  Mr.A.H. has yet to pick an opponent to teach to rival Celia power, He hold auditions at a London orphanage and picks a boy who names himself Marco, And Mr.A.H. begins training him for the game. the rules of the game are unknown for most of the book as for the players knowing whom their competitors are.<br /><br />  They meet each other at auditions for a new kind of circus a Circus of Dreams, where it only takes place from dusk 'til dawn.  Celia is auditioning for the illusionist act, while Marco is the understudy to Chanderesh the creator of the Night Circus.  Once Celia performs Marco is hit with a sudden pain, every time they one up each other with addiction to the circus the other is hit with a wave of pain.<br /><br />  As the story builds they find that the people at the circus are their chess pieces to the game they are playing.  The stakes are ramped up as people start dying as a result of the game and Marco and Celia fall in love.  There are a couple of side stories all surrounding the conclusion.<br /><br />  The romance and the overall love for the circus reminds me of \\"Water For Elephants\\"[[ASIN:1565125606 Water for Elephants: A Novel]], and the approach of how the circus was born and how the team reminds me of how the World's Fair was described as coming together and how the structure of the book is formed. in \\"The Devil in the White City\\" [[ASIN:0375725601 The Devil in the White City:  Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America]]<br /><br />  I will say at the start this was one of the easiest books to picture, towards the end it got a little harder to imagine.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|This performance is amazing!!.  Firstly, Ive always liked Michael Crawford as the Phantom. His vocal performance on the cast cd has always been what I have compared others take on the role to. Sorry to say this but I think I may like Ramin even a bit more. Sierra as Christine was wonderful. Both of their performances were really moving. You can feel the anguish for both Christine and the Phantom at the end. Something that even the 2004 movie lacked.  Also, a big surprise is the performance of Raoul. For once new life is breathed into what is a very  shallow part. Had the movie been close to what this filmed stage show is, it would have been so much better.  The movie was supposed to  capture the musical in the best version possible ( full sets, huge orchestra,) It didn't happen.  Thankfully this production came along. It is a better representation of the musical ( considering the changes that had to be made due to venue chosen).<br /><br />Note. I know a lot of people had a problem with the screens as opposed to using the full sets from the show.  I see the argument, but if anything I think it only adds to the theatrical side of the piece.  In a way having to use minimal sets and props, it sort of resembles a shakespeare play. Now, of course I wouldn't suggest doing this for the show  from now on, but for this occasion it worked really well.<br /><br />I give this five stars ( i'd give it ten if such a thing were possible)

B0068AWQQ2|1.0|Confession: this viewer has not seen the original 1985 version of FRIGHT NIGHT and is not a fan of the interminable line of vampire movies that flood the screens year after year.  So why watch FRIGHT NIGHT 2011?  Seeing the names of fine actors such as Colin Farrell, Toni Colette, +/- Anton Yelchin suggested this might not be a bad movie if those actors committed to it.  And perhaps it is partly due to the fact that lack of exposure to this genre creates the problem of deciding why some people find these films funny while other find them frightening. So, preface over.  Given the virginal approach to this vampire film, this viewer finds it silly, poorly written, self indulgent - and  an unexplainable waste to talent.<br /><br />Tom Holland is recycled by Marti Nixon and the updated Las Vegas suburb community form is handed to director Craig Gillespie.  The 'plot' centers on the presence of one Jerry (Colin Farrell, subtle acting at first and then falls apart) as the resident vampire next door to Century 1 Realtor Jane Brewster (Toni Collette) and her nerdy son Charley (Anton Yelchin).  Charley's equally nerdy friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is convinced that Jerry is a vampire and carries crosses and stakes etc in preparation for meeting him (an early taste treat for Jerry, Ed becomes a ridiculously distorted mad man).  The two lads are mocked by fellow classmates Mark (Dave Franco, brother of James Franco) and Ben (Reid Ewing) and teased by the very beautiful Amy (Imogen Poots).  Kids go missing and soon Charley becomes a believer and form there on out it is a detective game to rout out Jerry.  Charley, once convinced that Jerry is indeed a vampire, seeks guidance from the alcoholic scare-showman Peter Vincent (David Tennant) who has secrets of his own.  Of course it is evident that it will turn out just fine, but getting there (to the end) is a tedious bore.  The musical score is by Ramin Djawadi and the cinematography (thankfully mostly in the after hours dark vampires so need) is by Javier Aguirresarobe.<br /><br />Perhaps this is funny to some and perhaps it is frightening to others: after all there is a faithful cult of addicts who run to the theaters whenever one of these vampire flicks is released.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has brought me much closer to God. Having His word available at anytime had helped me out so much when being faced with temptation. Much love and prayers are going out to YouVersion!

0812548094|1.0|This book is absolutely terrible.    If you take out all the repetitive dialogue, the equally repetitive inner monologues, and all the derivative ideas he stole from about 23 other authors, this book would be about 700 pages shorter.  Goodkind needs an editor...or his thumbs broken.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|Let's be honest here.  When I first heard one of these songs online, I hated it (I think it was \\"The View\\" but I can't be sure because I didn't listen to it all the way through).  I thought Metallica had gone way out on the furthest limb and fallen off the tree.  By now, I have listened to the album all the way through, and while not Metallica's best effort, it is definitely not their worst.  But it isn't a Metallica album.  I can't say whether it's a Lou Reed album (I'm not a fan), but there's definitely enough Metallica on here to suggest that it isn't.  I think the best way to describe this album is, if you took the end bit off of \\"Devil's Food\\" by Alice Cooper, replaced Vincent Price with a beat poet, and expanded it to create an entire album, you'd have something like this.  The subject matter is disturbing (more disturbing that Welcome to My Nightmare by a long shot), and the music emphasizes the subject matter perfectly.  There is a sense of unease throughout the compositions, if you can call them compositions.  I can understand the one star ratings.  This album is made up of the strangest \\"music\\" I've ever heard, with an old guy rambling profanity over a solid wall of doom.  There are even some bits reminiscent of Black Sabbath (\\"Frustration\\").  It feels at once new, edgy and different, but it's a combination of techniques perfected in the classic rock era.  The best part of this album is that you can feel that the musicians who collaborated on it had a lot of fun in the making.  It's a sound that is missing from most music these days.  This album is well-thought out, perfectly executed (you get the sense that it is exactly what the artists wanted), and produces an odd harmony between the music of Metallica and what I presume to be the music of Lou Reed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game!  has different. categories and is easy to move cards around and easy on the eyes card placement!!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote for many different lists. Appointments, shopping lists for different stores. I've stuck photos in it on the fly. Very easy to use and I can access it from any of my computers. I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire as it's the most handy to post a note/reminder to myself.
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|Let's face it- the kind of movie embodied by Lethal Weapon franchise has become cliched.  2 cops with radically different personalities are thrown together, and despite their differences, they become buddies, and take down the bad guys......a premise that was thoroughly used both before \\"Lethal Weapon\\", and after it.  But you know what?  The \\"Lethal Weapon\\" movies manage to somehow keep things endearing, even with the over-the-top approach used, by balancing the action with a sense of continuity and growing familiarity, with not only the main characters, but also their coworkers and family.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the franchise, \\"Lethal Weapon\\" opens by introducing two very different cops: Martin Riggs, a suicidal loner, whose daily attempts to court death are a reaction to the loss of his wife, and Roger Murtaugh, a veteran cop and family man, whose catch phrase is \\"I'm getting to old for this @!$#$!@\\".  The first movie throws them together when Riggs is transferred to homicide, with Murtaugh being stuck with the guy no one else wants to be stuck with.  As the movie proceeds, we get to meet Murtaugh's family, in between the action sequences.  Mel Gibson does a good job of playing crazy here (although by now, his real life behavior has managed to outstrip Riggs' nuttiness in more unsettling ways).  Danny Glover does a great job in selling the more grounded Murtaugh in such a way that the average guy can really identify with him.  It's that dynamic that manages to inject the good-natured fun into this franchise that sets it apart from just another set of action movies.<br /><br />The second film ups the ante, as this time, the bad guys seem more untouchable, being crooked South African diplomats, with diplomatic immunity and high-grade armaments to back them up.  The supporting cast continues to grow, including the introduction of Joe Pesci's likeably obnoxious Leo Getz character, while the movie also ties in the death of Riggs' wife to good effect.  I actually like Lethal Weapon 2 a bit more than the first one.  Lethal Weapon 3, as is often the case in franchises, shows a bit of sequel fatigue, as the bad guy is a bit forgettable.  But Richard Donner manages to pull some more tricks from his sleeve, including the introduction of Lorna Cole, an Internal Affairs cop who is tough enough to impress Riggs, yet feminine enough to be a believable romantic foil for him.  Maintaining the same supporting cast members and their characters (Leo Getz, the hard-bitten police chief, the misguided police department psychologist, even the bomb squad guy from the second movie) also goes a long way in making it feel like a worthwhile series to be a fan of.  Of course, when you hit the 4th installment in a franchise, you're playing with fire, artistically speaking.  Fortunately, Lethal Weapon 4 is not awful in the way that Batman and Robin was....it's just a bit forgettable.  Jet Li's character is a bad guy who's not really the head bad guy, but ends up being the defacto chief villain because his superiors are some ill-defined quartet of Triad bosses we barely see.  The plot also seems to be running on autopilot at this point.  That being said, the movie is saved by......yes, you guessed it, franchise continuity/affection, and the fact that it resolves multiple running themes in the franchise.  Fortunately, the creators decided to end the franchise at this point on a satisfactory note of closure....well, at least as of now.<br /><br />The DVD set is, like the Superman, Batman and Matrix franchise 4 Film Favorites collections, on a set of 2 sided DVDs.  The picture quality is pretty decent, and it's also worth noting that LW 1, 2 and 3 are all the Director's Cut versions.  Aside from that, the extras are pretty skimpy, but for a bargain price like this, I can't complain.  Finally, I'd like to discuss a couple things that were a point of contention in another review I read.  You can't really fault this franchise for its so-called \\"reckless\\" portrayal of violence, as it's silly enough to be clearly intended to not be taken seriously, and is presented as such.  This isn't like a Michael Bay movie, where tone-deaf brutishness and excessive collateral damage is combined with the attitude that the movie is supposed to be taken seriously somehow.  On another note, the fact that Mel Gibson has revealed himself to be someone with serious, serious personality issues doesn't impact my enjoyment of the movies, in the way that any \\"real life\\" personality flaws that Wagner, Ted Nugent or Christian Bale exhibited don't prevent me from enjoying their work.  That's just my approach, though.  Anyway, this is a pretty good budget collection, in my opinion, and worth the price.as it's silly enough to be clearly intended to not be taken seriously, and is presented as such.

B006MHWXMS|5.0|it's a good, easy to follow app that I don't need a degree to use.  it is very User friendly and has a nice set up.  I have already set up lists for upcoming functions and it was very simple to do.  Thanks for making an easy but good looking app!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Would give it 5 stars if it could edit tables and all formatting of desktop application. Aside from that one issue it's great
B005MSD75U|2.0|I thought this movie was going to be funny, and I couldn't be more wrong. Story was slow, and not even my kids were into it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, but I do not think Stephen King did enough research on the details of the assassination to make the ending add up to the suspense he was building the entire book.  In the afterword he admits this plainly, and even says his wife believes the other conspiracy theories too but I suppose it's fiction so he can write it how he wants to, however I couldn't help but thinking this was a glaring hole in the book.  The book was great, the time travel stuff was fun, and the alternate reality scenarios and parallel universes were great, but I just had a problem with the Oswald as the lone assassin direction he took.  In my mind he could have easily left the ending more open-ended like he used to, more tragic if you will, (think \\"The Myst\\"), and would have had an even better book, and maybe even a scarier book.  At then end, I wish he could leave us in the nightmare \\"changed\\" world a little longer, or how about when he comes upon Oswald in the book depository, Oswald is just eating a sandwich, and the assisination still takes place.  That way it could have been more about the complexity of that day, and less about the controversial fact of whether or not Oswald acted alone.  All in all a great book, if it was more historically friendly on the conspiracy theories, it would have 5 stars.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Months have extra days others have less days. I have multiple Google Task accounts to make my life easier. but this app only allows me to connect one account.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas present for my wife. We both really enjoy Harry Potter but didn't really get on the bandwagon til a few years ago. This collection is great for those out there that want to own the films without paying a bunch of money or sifting through all the special features. All 8 DVD's are placed in a slim plastic case and are firmly placed. This is both affordable and durable. I highly recommend this product.

B004YJMQCS|3.0|The final destination movies are getting worst with each sequel that they make. Part 4 the only thing good on it, is that it is in 3D witch is not the best 3D I've seen but even so, is the best way to see this movie.<br /><br />The caracters are forgetable, bad actors, the plot is the same, and the special effects are.... crap.<br /><br />When watching a final destination movie and you reach to part 4, you feel is the same movie only with a diferent cenario.<br /><br />Even though, it's a must boy for fans of the franchise and 3D fans. Not all the movie works, but the parts that work are really cool.

B000002UJQ|3.0|It may not as frequently reach the critic's lists as \\"OK Computer\\" but upon repeated listens to both albums, there is a much more richly detailed sonic tapestry at work on \\"Kid A\\" than \\"OK Computer.\\"  So, as to a rating of \\"OK Computer,\\" when comparing to \\"Kid A,\\" I'd say it's just OK (or three stars).  Had I not heard \\"Kid A,\\" I'd bump it up to 4 or 5 stars depending on my mood.  So, OK is just that, OK.
B005I64U34|1.0|Not very climactic. I would not buy. Very little plot and no lead for a part 2. Acting not great either.
B000002ADT|3.0|Up to 1959, despite it's seeming stately, calm form, it was revolutionary.  It's just that later releases in early to mid-60's better provide in my listening experience a kind of compositional and performance related heft that lasts upon innumerable repeated listens. For instance, two notable albums are \\"Blues and the Abstract Truth\\" by Oliver Nelson and \\"Nefertiti\\" by Miles Davis.    It must be said that Nefertiti is by far the most underrated album in history out of all music genres, and in fact, could be the penultimate statement in all of music, but, alas, the world is still not ready for that statement, some 45+ years later.
0439023483|5.0|I had heard people speak the praises of this book for a while but neglected to pick up The Hunger Games. It was not until my aunt went crazy for it that I bought The Hunger Games. And I must say, it did not disappoint! From the first few pages I was hooked! The story, the characters, and the brutal struggles for life will keep you turning the pages for hours. It may be a little violent for 12 year olds, but as a 17 year old, I do not want to read a kiddy book. An absolute MUST READ!!!

1451626657|5.0|I read this book first in 1967. The fact that I still remember it well and am reminded of it often in everyday life situations speaks to its impact, at least on me.<br />It is one of a very few books which can prompt the reader to laugh out loud while reading it. There are also passages which carry profound messages about the reality of war, life, and love. What more can one ask?<br />We read many books and immediately forget them. That has not been the case for me with Catch 22, nor do I think it is with most readers. I would have no hesitation in numbering Catch 22 amongst the most inmportant 100 books I have read. I recommend it unreservedly.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|FINAL UPDATE (Dec 2012): ALL of my data was erased AGAIN!! Luckily, I learned from last time to back up my work every time. I used it mostly for taking notes. I initially gave it five stars, then four. Now I give is ONE (since I have to give it some stars). Also, the sync function is pretty unreliable. All in all, Evernote needs to fix their glitches. From what I hear they updated their permissions policy, but it just isn't worth it anyhow if you lose all your data.<br /><br />***Update: Sept 26, 2012: I initially gave this product 5 stars. While I still use it, it erased ALL of my data when using it on my Kindle Fire. This happened a while ago and luckily I back up my stuff, and have access to Evernote on several devices. For that I take off a star. So I def wouldn't advise anyone to put anything important here without backing it up. Like I said this was months ago, so maybe they fixed this glitch, hopefully.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this album.  Every song is very good and half of them are exceptional.  Two are great!  I heard \\"Someone Like You\\" at lunch at a fast food restaurant and tagged it with Shazam.  I then searched for Adele on YouTube and found \\"Rolling in the Deep.\\"  I checked the song prices on Amazon Digital and on Google Music and decided to buy the physical media from Amazon.  Two days later I ripped the CD and uploaded the songs to Google Music; I dig Amazon Prime.  The odd numbered tracks (\\"Rolling in the Deep\\", \\"Turning Tables\\", \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\", \\"Take It All\\", \\"One and Only\\", \\"Someone Like You\\") are the best but all eleven tracks are very good.
B000X107GI|5.0|Outstanding product.  Works well. Great components.  High quality material.  Great price for set of batteries.  Much cheaper than hardware stores.
B000066744|5.0|This is a very good movie about one of the best books I have ever read. I wold go as far as saying it helped me understand the meaning of life! Novecento, toward the end of the movie, talks about how a keyboard is finite, it only has 88 keys, but the music one can play with it is infinite. So is life: one has a finite number of years to live (a number that is more or less the same as the number of keys on a piano!) but one has infinite possibilities on how to life those years.<br /><br />And it is just as well that it is so, it would be impossible to live an infinite life, just as it would be impossible to play music on a keyboard with an infinite number of keys. Only God, 1900 tells us, can play on such a keyboard. Very deep, even if you don't believe in God

0307949486|2.0|Okay, okay, so I tend to be one of those people who doesn't read the hot, bestselling \\"must-read\\" books until everyone else on the planet has, but sometimes there's a good reason for that--and this book is a prime example of that. After finishing this book, I can only shake my head in amazement at its popularity.<br /><br />There's no reason to get into a \\"loved it/hated it\\" war with fans of the book. Instead, I'd like to give an honest blow-by-blow description for those who haven't read the book yet but are considering it. The book begins with about 100 pages devoted to intrigue in the world of Swedish financial publications...zzz...huh? What? Oh, I'm sorry. I fell asleep just typing that sentence, so imagine how bored I was while slogging through those dreary chapters. The book does begin to get interesting afterward, when an old man hires our intrepid main character to investigate the disappearance of his beloved relative, who vanished from an island years before in a sort of a \\"locked room\\" type mystery.<br /><br />During the investigation, our intrepid main character comes across a series of old murders that could be linked to the disappearance of the old man's relative. Was she the victim of a serial killer? Did she vanish because she knew too much? These plot twists make the book much more exciting--for a while. Unfortunately, though, the mystery behind the disappearance of the girl is laughably un-mysterious, and the story of the serial killer is trite, worn-out, and needed far more explanation in order to be really interesting. For instance--and I don't feel a spoiler alert is necessary here--the killer performs some strange rituals during the killings, but the reasons behind these are never explained. Once the killer is revealed, the only explanation seems to be that the killer was a nut job who did crazy things.<br /><br />So, in conclusion--tired plot, poorly-executed mystery, too many boring chapters about Swedish financial publications, and about 300 pages too many in general (I'm starting to think there's a dire shortage of editors in Sweden). My advice? Read at your own risk--but keep plenty of strong coffee at hand. You'll need it.starting to think there's a dire shortage of editors in Sweden). My advice?

This show is so poorly cast as to make it unwatchable.
0312641893|5.0|First Impressions: If you would have asked me a few years ago if I would read a story about a cyborg or about space, I would have told you no way. My tastes have changed a lot since then, obviously, because I was beyond thrilled to get my hands on a copy of this book. I'm in love with the dystopian genre and I think it is because I just got tired of reading the same old stories over and over again. I liked the premise of this story. It sounded very unique and interesting to say the least. I knew I had to give it a shot.<br /><br />First 50 Pages: I have to say, I think only this author can pull of a science fiction novel with a Cinderella twist. Obviously I have never read anything else from Marissa Meyer since Cinder is her first book, but I can already tell just from reading a little bit into this story that we are going to hear a lot more from her in the future. She is a creative and imaginative writer and her work reflects those aspects as well.<br /><br />I must have been completely dense to have missed the Cinderella connection when I first read the book synopsis. I mean really, really dense. The cyborg is wearing a red shoe on the cover. I must not have been drinking my coffee that day. Not to mention, the title should have given that fact away. However, I was slightly bored with the first couple of chapters in the story. I shouldn't say it was boring, it just began slower than I expected it to.<br /><br />Characters & Plot: There were more than a few fun surprises in this story! I want to mention first Marissa's world-building skills. I could easily see this novel being turned into a completely awesome movie. Like I have already said, this author is very imaginative and it was fun to read all of her futuristic creations that I found in the book. Even for it being in the science fiction category, it still felt very real to me. The author did a great job making everything realistic enough so that her readers could still connect to her story. It was brilliant!<br /><br />Cinder was a pretty cool character. I wasn't sure what to make of her at first, but she really grew on me as the book continued. I think after Cinder is taken to the cyborg draft her character completely changes into someone much more likeable. She becomes stronger and much more self-driven and determined. I think in the next book we will see her as the kick-butt character that she has the potential to be. She got really close to being a great female heroine in this book. I can't wait to see what how this character continues to change.<br /><br />The romance in Cinder is very light and so far, under-developed. Again, I think we will see much more romance in the book that follows. I think I would of liked to have seen a bit more of Kai, Cinder's love interest, in this book then what there was. I feel as though this character will become more developed as the series continues. So far, he intrigued me and I enjoyed his interactions with Cinder.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Overall, I really enjoyed this book! You are definitely going to want to keep an eye out for this author and this book. I loved the pace of Cinder and the unique mix of genres. Cinder has to be one of the best re-telling of Cinderella I have ever read. Marissa Meyer is very talented with world-building and it comes across as effortless. I would most definitely insist on checking out this book!acter. I wasn't sure what to make of her at first, but she really grew on me as the book continued.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|As a standalone action movie, this is passable. The plot is lame, derivative, and not very clever (also not Trek canon at all), the acting is poor to average, the characters are one-dimensional and cast too young, frankly. But, the special effects are great! If you're looking for explosions and showy lights, this is for you, just don't expect substance or quality of story, acting, or really anything but the effects.  This is not Star Trek in anything but name. I don't think it necessarily befouls the legacy of \\"Trek\\" but it may come close. I watched it once. Not again.   It makes me sad that this is what Star Trek has become. REAL Star Trek appears to be gone forever. Like everything else in mainstream Hollywood, this movie has nothing memorable. No substance. Just shallow, pretty faces and bodies badly reading poorly written lines while shiny things explode around them.   Rated as an action movie: 2 1/2 stars.  Rated as a Star Trek work: 1/2 star, and that's being very generous.

B004XWLN20|5.0|This box set is just amazing! I was planning on purchasing the complete series in a box set that only contained the dvds. This would have only cost me $75, but i'm sure glad I spent and extra hundred for this box set. The artowrk and extras are just incredible. I remember watchin Smallville a decade ago when it first aired on television. It's funny, I remember watching the show but don't ember any episodes :P Have absolutely no regrets with this purchase. I am on cloud nine right now!  :D!!!!
B005ELQVGW|5.0|When I first popped this in, I was very confused but knew I heard good parts in the confusion. I listened a second time and was not as perplexed but still could not completely wrap my head around Bjork's style for this album. I listened a 3rd time and it finally clicked.<br /><br />The truth is that Bjork has become so good that everything she does raises the bar and is always unique. This album has it's own unique style that stands on it's own and can't be categorized. Neither can the majority of Bjork's other albums. Some Parts are reminiscent of \\"Homogenic\\", \\"Vespertine\\", and even \\"Medulla\\". Somehow though, this album has it's own sound though still.<br /><br />If you're a beginner to Bjork, start with something like \\"Post\\".<br /><br />If you're a longtime fan of hers, I guarantee you'll like this album.

B0058VW36U|5.0|Of all the games I've played on my Kindle Fire, this is my favorite.  It's a simple game that's easy to learn, but still requires enough thought to make it interesting.  The only bit of disappointment I had with it was when I completed the last available level and realized that I had exhausted my favorite time killer.  Thankfully, a couple days later an update came through and added more levels.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Excellent drama. Not an MMA fan, find it barbaric but the matches are secondary to the story which is that of a family torn asunder, hurting and some still carrying resentment to their own detriment. By the time the fighting action starts, you're so drawn in; you wonder which brother should win? Well, that one. Which brother should lose? Why, that one. No matter which brother you'd pick for those questions, you'd be right. One of the best things about the movie is the dialogue. The conversations are so very true and free of movie speak, of the kind of things only said in a film. I'm not going to add any spoilers but I will say of the ending, while not Hollywood pretty or completely satisfactory, is the right one. This movie will stick with you.

1451648537|3.0|This book is well written, and is a gripping read. It is well researched, and seems to have a *fairly* balanced perspective on Jobs - it doesn't paint him in an overly-positive light. It provides some interesting insights into Job's character and leadership style, and into his personal story. It also has a good balance between being a biography of Jobs and a history of apple: people interested in either should find enough to keep them reading.  However, although there is a lot of information about Jobs' story, the insights do not run deep. The portrait of Jobs is one-dimensional, and can get a bit repetitive: he gets angry with people, he drives a hard bargain, he micro-manages, and he becomes very successful - you don't really get to know what he's thinking. Isaacson may have got closer to Steve than any other journalist - but Jobs didn't let him *that* close - it doesn't seem that Isaacson really 'connected' with Jobs, and neither does the reader. This means the book loses some impact as a book on leadership: It's diverting, but in no way life-changing.  The other gripe (and this is a smaller one) is that when discussing products, the book focuses almost exclusively on Steve's obsession for the look and feel of devices, but does not really cover the technical aspects. It's understandable to an extent - everyone can appreciate the aestetics of apple products, but not everyone is interesed in how they are programmed. However, it would have been nice to have a bit more on the differences between OSX and Windows XP, for example. You get the sense that these sections were a little 'fudged' - that Isaacson isn't really a techie - and that's a shame, considering who the book is about.  Overall, this is a book that I'm glad I read, but it didn't really affect me on any deep level - which is a shame, because I *think* the life story of such a remarkable man could have been told in such a way that it would have done.
B000002KAT|5.0|If you love this album as much as I do, then you may wish to hear it in its most pristine form. Rhino Handmade has remastered and released this CD in 2008 overseas in stunning audio clarity. You may still be able to find copies in Japan if you look now, but do not hesitate! My understanding is, that along with \\"Moondance\\" which received the same treatment by the same company, these CD's will not see another production run. Once they're gone, they're gone, and henceforth we live with the Warner Brothers analog masters. The remastered versions are worth every penny you will spend on them.<br /><br />Live \\"Astral Weeks\\" however, left me dissapointed at Van's treatment of this material in this Hollywood Bowl performance from 2008, I believe. His vocals seem slurred and off-handed. They don't contain the passion of the album. Granted, none of us are who we were in 1968, but it feels like Van is going through the motions here. On the other hand, the band is really great and the recording is absolutely top notch. This could have been a REALLY special night if Van had emotionally shown up for the performance.<br /><br />So, buy the remaster and forget the live album. You won't be sorry on either count.

It seemed rushed and choppy, but overall a story worth reading.
1451627289|3.0|A man stumbles upon a wormhole in time and tries to reverse the Kennedy assassination.  What would today be like if Kennedy hadn't been assassinated?  That's a great premise for a book!  Stephen King, you are such an awesome horror/ sci-fi writer - tell us what would happen!<br /><br />He didn't.  He barely addressed what would happen if Kennedy hadn't been assassinated.  Instead, he wrote a long, long, schmaltzy, long, long, and ultimately disappointing book, just like every Stephen King book since \\"Bag Of Bones\\".<br /><br />This book was inexcusably long.  Tediously long.  It had too many literal pies in faces (there were at least two instances of pies in faces) and too many cute dances.  Such cuteness in this book.  And a tooth achingly sweet, perfect in every way, female love interest for the time travelling protagonist.<br /><br />75% of the book is about the slightly flawed protagonist falling in love with a completely perfect woman in a charming, super progressive, completely unrealistic, early 1960's Texas town. 10% is about Lee Harvey Oswald, 13% is about how you can't save people even though you have good intentions, and 2% is about what today would look like if Kennedy hadn't been assassinated.  What today would look like if Kennedy hadn't been assassinated is pretty much an afterthought, not important, more a way to tie up loose plot ends than anything else.  Which is disappointing.<br /><br />This book is 849 pages of sentimental claptrap.  Well paced sentimental claptrap, yes, but sentimental claptrap nonetheless.<br /><br />Stephen King has written many great books.  He's also written some crappy books.  Considering the subject matter, you might think \\"11/22/63\\" could be his Magnum Opus.  Nope.  Remember how \\"Under The Dome\\" was great until the preposterous ending (one King's immortal character Annie Wilkes would have hobbled a writer for writing)?  This book is worse.  I read most of it, had to skip some parts (like a boxing fight and most of one high school dance that ended in pies being thrown in people's faces), but I have to give it three stars because I kept turning the pages until the underwhelming end.<br /><br />If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have bought this book. I'd have checked it out at the library.in people's faces), but I have to give it three stars because I kept turning the pages until the underwhelming end.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|A great picture.  Everyone should see it.  It makes you sad, mad and yet it is heartwarming.  How can you sit still and do nothing?  I think it should be showed to our young people in spite of some of the language.  A good motivator and great for discussions.  Hard to believe that things like this happened?    I also read the book and didn't want to see the movie as I loved the book.  However, the characters in the movie are perfect in representing the book characters and I ended up loving the movie also.  The book and movie are an inspiration to have courage to stand up for what's right, to stand on what's right and speak out.

0062112430|5.0|SPOILER ALERT  Dear people that want to read this book,  I started reading this book and couldn't put it down. The author puts great emotion into it and tells a suspenseful plot. I strongly recommend reading this book because the authors writing gives a great image of what's going on with the emotion and connections between Alex and Lena. In this book everyone is afraid of the disease love, so at age 18 you get matched to a partner and get a surgery so you can't love someone. The Thing that makes Lena different is that she lives with her aunt because her mother could never be cured of love and Lena was told her mother killed her self. But that isn't the case! Lena meets Alex who posses being cured, but is actually from the wild. Alex tells Lena that love isn't bad and \\"there\\" lying to them. She falls in LOVE with him!! Will they be able to escape so they can live happily ever after? What secrets is Lena being kept from about her mother? Read the book to find out What happens in Delirium.

159562015X|1.0|I didn't buy this at Amazon, but sure wished I had as I naively paid full cover price at a local big box retailer because I was so excited to discover it and what it promised and didn't want to wait.  Yes, it was nice to identify my top 5 strengths.  No real surprises, but good to have specific words and wording to describe them.  The disappointment is that I mistakenly assumed it would actually be able to help me pinpoint career options using the combination of my top themes.  It does not.  Each strength is given a very short list of general suggestions (maybe 5-7).  Most of mine were similar for each of my strengths and several were positions I have held in the past and did not enjoy in the least.  (Hence why I bought the darn book to figure out where ELSE I could use my strengths.)  As a former career advisor (yes, I am fully aware of the irony-- know that it's always easier to help others than yourself), I believe there is a definite limitation to an assessment instrument that forces you to choose between two options that are similar.  I too found that often the choices were equally strong or equally weak.  So in choosing \\"neutral\\" as my answer, the instrument has no way of distinguishing between those I hated equally and those I loved equally.  Suffice to say given this flaw, I have little faith in the online tool's ability to truly measure my strengths and provide any meaningful guidance.  If I were designing it, I would have a continuum for each option individually so the tool would definitively be able to measure whether both were very high or both were very low interests/strengths.  Or another option might be to have two different \\"neutral\\" options:  hate equally and love equally.  I would not recommend this book as it does not begin to scratch the surface as say something like the classic What Color is Your Parachute (still in print and annually updated after all these years).    For those poor souls who mistakenly bought this book used, Amazon needs to figure out a way to do a better job of describing that the main value of the book is that code and that without it, the book truly is worthless.  (Honestly, it isn't worth that much more with the code so I'd consider yourselves lucky you didn't pay full price like me.)  Perhaps it should be flagged as a book that can't be sold as used or in the title it should have to include \\"code already accessed\\" or \\"code not accessed/still valid for a single user\\" in the same way it identifies whether it is hardcover or kindle version.  I don't believe there is a way to just go online and pay just to take the test so these poor people truly were ripped off and will have to repurchase the book new in order to ever use it.  Once that access code has been activated, this book is only good for the recycling bin after the user is done with it.    For now I'm looking for resources to go beyond what little I gleaned from this book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a wonderful book -- it engaged me all the way to the end.  I've never been much of a Stephen King fan, but this, while \\"supernatural\\" in that involves time travel, was really an adventure/love story.  It would be a wonderful book to take on vacation.
B002ZTQVGQ|2.0|I am a huge fan of all things Ghibli. I do not like this. Disney ruined this film. The bonus-jonas and Cyrus hand-me-down cheapened the whimsical and mystical qualities of this film. The theme song, alone, should have been a dead giveaway. An auto-tuned fanservice? Really, Disney? What part of a small demigod's quest to be united with a small boy--and ham--told you that you should make an auto-tuned pop song? Ridiculous. This film could have been good, or at least less campy. If the English scriptwriters hadn't botched the plot, and if the voice-casters were less interested in loading a DVD BLURAY case up with familiar (and overrated, overdramatized) disney pop star names, and were more invested in conveying the magic of studio ghibli--a formula and institution which has proven itself true over the years--then I would be rating this higher, instead of posting what I'm sure will be a very ill-received review.

B004DK5CW4|4.0|The movie starts off with the narrator quoting a horse-related passage from the Book of Job in the Bible and then the narrator ends the movie with another biblical quote. The movie gives a vignette that brings out the ancestry of Secretariat rather well. The movie shows the birth of the colt and then basically skips to Secretariat's first race. The movie shows how the trainer and jockey are selected. The story is about the races, but does a good job with the background stories about the race. The races are exciting even when you know the outcome.  Diane Lane does a great job as the owner. Malkovich is very good as the trainer. The family is ok. I thought they could have done more with the family issues, but it works. The movie sets a goal of telling the story of the horse and achieves it. \\"SeaBiscuit\\" is a better movie, but when Secretariat absolutely crushes the competition in the Belmont, the desire to stand up and cheer is hard to resist. The movie has some nice scenes. However, it is too squeaky clean. The \\"hippies\\" preparing for protests looked like the Brady Bunch. The movie does have some subtle religious overtones. The choice of music being played on the radio and in the play. I'm not sure what message the movie is supposed to have.  I enjoyed the movie and if I could I would give it another 1/2 star.
1451648537|4.0|Anyone who knows anything about the design process (and reads this book) will quickly understand that ONLY Steve Jobs could champion greatness at Apple. Inevitably, the greatness will be watered-down and mediocrity will creep-in and find its way back.  Why?  Because no one will ever be empowered the way Steve was empowered.  Even when he was asked to come back, he wasn't just given the free-reign.  He simply \\"took\\" it.  The board (this time)didn't dare mess with him.  No man or woman will ever again gain that kind of trust at Apple.  Any future CEO will always be afraid of the board, and they will walk timidly when it comes to making the big decisions.  Steve was fired once.  And he was willing to get fired again.  He came to work each day absolutely willing to be fired.  And that's what allowed all of this to happen.  So for you fans of \\"great\\" design, start mourning the real loss.  We'll likely never get it this good again from any corporation that makes things. So few people in the world get exposed to great design (and learn for themselves what makes it truly great).  Fewer create or rise to the top of a company that empowers them to USE that appreciation of great design.  In other words, start your profit-taking on the stock.  Even if Ive stays, and the top engineering teams stay, they will never get the same great leadership that forced them to go one notch higher.  Good book.  Wish there were deeper interviews with the people that surrounded him.  But I'd imagine that they only spoke in dribs and drabs.  Steve might lead an engineering team to his way back from the dead, and then they'd be REALLY sorry ;-)

I tried to put the Kindle Touch into the case and the zipper would not close all the way because the it hits the corner of the device that's kind of sticking out.  After some manual stretching of the case I did get it to fit but it is still very tight on that corner.  I am afraid that after some use it will wear off the paint/scratch the corner of the Kindle.  This Sleeve should not be labeled as compatible with Kindle Touch in my opinion, as the Touch device is slightly larger than the regular Kindle.

B004EPYZXU|2.0|Found footage movies are all the rage right now.<br /><br />I get that. Heck, I'll even admit that I'm a sucker for them. So, when I heard about a found footage movie based on space, well, I was excited. Space is scary. We don't know what's going on out there. And, for a little bit, Apollo 18 did an amazing job at bringing that scariness to us. That is, until we see what's going on.<br /><br />I'll be frank, Apollo 18 is bad. They do nothing to make us care about any of the characters, you won't even remember any of their names. The only thing they did right was the moral dillemmas they created. While watching the movie I kept thinking how stupid they were, how if it was me I would just kill him at the first sign of infection. Yet, when I really thought about it, I would've done the exact same thing as the character. It all goes back to my initial thought, space is scary. There's no one out there to save you if something goes wrong. That's the only thing they did right though. The ending was nothing short of aggrivating and I was so irritated at how dumb they were about everything.<br /><br />It may just be me, but if I'm on the moon and weird stuff starts happening the last thing I would do is leave my lander and start investigating. Nevermind the fact that...<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />They found a Russian lander with blood in it and a dead astronaut. No way. I'd cash out and sit in my lander till I was radioed to leave. I would not keep having stuff happen to my equipment and think everything was okay.<br /><br />SPOILER: It's not okay.<br /><br />So, again I say, Apollo 18 is bad. They could have done so much more with this movie. What are we left with though? Rocks. Avoid.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|When the Turtle Beach PX series came out, I was very excited to get these. I needed to get rid of my X11's, because my dog had chewed the cable and screwed up some wires. About 3 weeks after I got these, they did this odd thing where I had to unplug the cables and plug them back in or else I could only hear from the left ear. This went on until a month ago. The reason it stopped: I threw them away. Eventually before I got rid of them, they would only work threw the left ear, then eventually it made me mad, so I, (eh-hem) threw it on the ground! (Andy Samberg style). All in all, you should either buy the MW3 editions like I recently did, or save your money and buy Astro A30's or A40's.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|As someone who has read and loved Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy and watched all the Swedish film adaptations of the novels, I was quite skeptical about the Hollywood treatment of the first book, fearing that it would take too many creative liberties and not stay faithful to the essence of the novel. Well, my fears were thankfully misplaced, as I love this film adaptation, rivaling the original Swedish remake (which I am a fan of).<br /><br />The casting for the Swedish film adaptation was excellent, and I think the Hollywood remake gets it right too. Daniel Craig plays the role of besieged journalist Mikael Blomqvist, who has just lost a libel suit filed against him by Hans Wennerstrom, a billionaire industrialist. Mikael has to pay a hefty sum of money to Wennerstrom, and to add to his woes, the publication he works for is also in financial trouble. Robin Wright plays his married lover and editor/ owner of the publication. Respite comes in the form of an offer from Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), scion of a wealthy family, and retired CEO of Vanger Corporation. Ensconced on the hauntingly beautiful yet desolate Hevestad (which I believe is fictional), Henrik wants Mikael to investigate what happened to his beloved niece Harriet, who mysteriously disappeared several decades ago. Tempted by hefty financial compensation, Mikael is further lured by the promise of confidential information that Henrik possesses, information that could potentially help Mikael against Wennerstrom. Soon, Mikael finds himself holed up on Hevestad in the dead of winter, investigating a cold case, and facing a cool reception from the other members of the Vanger clan, including Harriet's mother, uncle, etc. though he does get some encouragement from one of Harriet's cousins, Martin (Stellan Skarsgaard), who is now the CEO of the company.<br /><br />Rooney Mara plays Lisbeth Salander, a 23-year-old ward of the state, who has been deemed asocial and incompetent of making adult decisions. Her state-appointed guardian has recently suffered a severe health setback and is unable to perform his duties, so Lisbeth is assigned to a sadistic lawyer who uses his position of authority to sexually abuse her. Mara is credible in her portrayal of an obviously tormented soul who can hold her own and shows that her frail frame belies a steely determination which is at times tempered by emotional vulnerability as seen in her later interactions with Mikael (Lisbeth ends up assisting Mikael on the case).<br /><br />The movie is about 2 hours and 40 minutes in length, yet I never felt the story lagged at any point. Each scene is important, and the setting and sense of place is as integral to the film as the acting. The cinematography is breathtaking, especially of Hevestad in the depths of winter - cold, brutal, and unforgiving. The procedural aspect of the story, with Mikael and Lisbeth investigating the case together and alongside each other is well-paced, with suspense being gradually built up until the climax. The use of technology is vital in this film, and viewers get to see Lisbeth flex her investigative muscles as she hacks her way to crucial information.<br /><br />There are some very graphic scenes in this movie portraying violence in the form of rape, physical assault, and nudity. There are also some graphic images of crime scene photographs.<br /><br />I read the novel several years ago, and it has been a while since I watched the Swedish adaptation but I loved this latest adaptation, and can't wait to see how the filmmakers adapt the other two stories in the series, and am especially interested in how they show the evolution of Lisbeth Salander's character.d guardian has recently suffered a severe health setback and is unable to perform his duties, so Lisbeth is assigned to a sadistic lawyer who uses his position of authority to sexually abuse her.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Surely it's bad form to extensively quote another reviewer in one's own review (especially right at the start), but having stumbled upon the perfect quote, it's hard to resist. It's with that recognition and understanding that I quote the introduction to David Denby's review of \\"The Help\\" from August's issue of The New Yorker:<br /><br />\\"'The Help,' based on Kathryn Stockett's best-selling 2009 novel, is, in some ways, crude and obvious, but it opens up a broad new swath of experience on the screen, and parts of it are so moving and well acted that any objections to what's second-rate seem to matter less as the movie goes on.\\"<br /><br />As Denby says, this isn't a necessarily unpredictable movie. I would add that there's plenty that this movie glosses over regarding race relations in 1960s Mississippi, but this is a Disney film meant for mass-consumption and a kind of salve on white guilt - along those lines, is it any surprise that the only church scenes we see are uplifting ones in the black churches, rather than the massively racist rants of white preachers at the time? For the reality of the situation, though, the curious should head to the classroom or to important novels of the time, such as John Howard Griffin's impactful \\"Black Like Me\\". That being said, this film, written and directed by relative newcomer Tate Taylor, offers an important primer on the importance of respect and equality, even in the face of adversity.<br /><br />Emma Stone, nominated for a Golden Globe for last year's flip \\"Easy A\\" earns her status as a leading lady here, capturing the humor, strength and tenacity of Skeeter, a would-be journalist in a tumultuous time. The rest of the cast is equally strong, with Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer providing the emotional gravitas to buoy the story. Davis provides solid and grounded depth while Spencer mixes her performance up providing some much-needed comic relief. Bryce Dallas Howard works exceptionally well as a holier-than-thou white supremacist - all smiles and \\"love\\" while working to disenfranchise those around her. Jessica Chastain shows a surprising comic side as a ditzy blonde and Allison Janney continues her streak of  powerful supporting characters. All said, this is an undeniably strong all-female cast and it's exciting that a film like this performed so well at the box office.<br /><br />The story itself centers around Skeeter (Stone) on her return to Jackson after completing a degree in journalism. Deciding that she wants to make a difference with her writing she sets out to record the stories of the local maids in the area - what it's like for them to make a living raising white children while their own children sit at home, perhaps under the care of someone else. There's a lot of discussion of the risk these women face exposing their employers to a journalist, and not much payoff in that area, but luckily that's not the only story here. With the aforementioned supporting cast in tow, Skeeter covers much more emotional and political ground over the course of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Help\\" does simplify things a bit, creating some caricatures and predictable situations, but Taylor was lucky enough to have a dynamite cast on his hand that handles even the cheesiest of dialogue with a deft hand. Towards the end, each and every scene turns into a tearjerker, and this somehow manages to be a welcome and appreciated dramatic turn. The Help may not be the deepest movie of the year, but it offers important lessons and stories for our own time. As Oscar season approaches, here's hoping that the powerful acting in this film won't be overlooked.\\" while working to disenfranchise those around her.

B005SZNZAY|5.0|Chris Cornell has always been in the habit of moving forward. With blinders firmly affixed, Cornell has moved from band to band, occasionally taking a break for his own solo efforts, never doing more to acknowledge his past accomplishments than the occasional cover song during a concert with his latest band. With a resume that includes lead vocals with the likes of Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, and Audioslave, Cornell certainly has plenty of material to fall back on, but Cornell has always chosen the road less traveled. That is, until now.<br /><br />In 2010, Chris Cornell reunited with Soundgarden and embarked on an immensely successful tour. Revisiting much of his original material for the first time in over a decade, Cornell then capitalized on his once again heightened fame for a solo tour; offering his fans a retrospective of his entire career. Armed with an acoustic guitar and his uniquely powerful voice, Cornell toured the world with his \\"Songbook\\" and is still working his way across the U.S. for the remainder of this year.<br /><br />\\"Songbook\\" captures some of Chris Cornell's finest performances to date of both well-known hits and forgotten gems. The album opens with, \\"As Hope and Promise Fade\\" which was originally released as a hidden track on his 2009 record \\"Scream.\\" The track is filled with as much heartache as the title suggests, even more than his performance two years ago. With each emotional cry perfectly in tune, Cornell's vocals have never sounded more personal. As the album progresses, it becomes clear that each track is special to him in some way and the track listing was hand-picked. These are the tracks he is the most proud to be a part of.<br /><br />Although the album leans heavily on Cornell's own material with each of his past bands, there are also two cover songs; Led Zeppelin's \\"Thank You\\" and John Lennon's \\"Imagine.\\"<br /><br />He does take a few creative liberties with the melodies of both tunes, but they remain phenomenal tributes to two of his greatest influences.<br /><br />Like Nirvana and Alice in Chains, Soundgarden's catalog translates to acoustic instruments beautifully. With Cornell's solo, Temple of the Dog and Audioslave selections each mixed into the 16 track setlist of \\"Songbook,\\" there is plenty of variety to keep the listener interested despite the lack of any heavy electronic instrumentation. Fans of any of his past projects will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"The Keeper\\"Nirvana and Alice in Chains, Soundgarden's catalog translates to acoustic instruments beautifully.

B005URRCUY|4.0|The Black Keys are finally at the top of their game and getting the recognition they deserve. At first, there was a host of competition in the throwback garage rock scene. With bands like The Strokes and The White Stripes taking the early lead, The Black Keys quietly released records. First came 2002's \\"The Big Come Up.\\" Then it was 2003's \\"Thickfreakness\\" followed \\"Rubber Factory\\" in 2004. Dan Auerbach's gritty guitar playing and vocals with just a touch of feedback and slapback delay proved to blend perfectly with Patrick Carney's heavy-handed and even heavier footed drumming. Although they weren't quite selling out arenas or headlining festivals just yet, each of their records was praised by critics.<br /><br />In 2008, the producer Danger Mouse stepped in and took The Black Keys to new places. Although many critics and fans alike consider the resulting album, \\"Attack & Release,\\" the worst album The Black Keys have released to date, Danger Mouse's fame after working with the likes of Gorillaz and Gnarls Barkley took The Black Keys to the next level. Now it's nearly impossible to watch an hour of television without seeing at least one commercial with a song by The Black Keys in the background.<br /><br />Generally considered a two-piece band, The Black Keys began to add instruments to their mix on 2010's \\"Brothers,\\" their most successful album yet.<br /><br />With nearly an hour of music on the record, Auerbach and Carney brought in organs and bass guitar to fill out their sound. Although they could no longer perform all of their songs live without the aid of a backing band, The Black Keys went on to win three Grammy Awards while being nominated for two more. With other bands in their genre fading away in listeners' memories, The Black Keys are finally on top.<br /><br />Where many bands would ride the wave of their newfound success as far as it would take them, The Black Keys are looking to rise even higher. \\"El Camino\\" pulls together everything that worked on their last two albums and combines them for a fast, fun and fantastic new release.<br /><br />Danger Mouse is back as a full-time producer on \\"El Camino\\" and where he may have fallen a bit short on \\"Attack & Release,\\" he completely redeems himself here. Thanks to The Black Keys bringing their supporting instruments along for the ride following the success of \\"Brothers,\\" the added effects in the background created by Danger Mouse are far less distracting and much less present than they were three years ago; in fact they blend right in. The Black Keys' immense popularity likely also kept Danger Mouse from wanting to take too many creative liberties with the band's sound.<br /><br />Opening with the lead single, \\"Lonely Boy,\\" \\"El Camino\\" feels like a party that is already at its peak. With an accompanying video that features a well-dressed middle-aged man showing off every hip-shaking dance move he has ever learned (including \\"The Carlton\\"), it's clear The Black Keys have become absolute professionals when it comes to marketing themselves. They know what sells and they know what their fans love so \\"El Camino\\" gives them eleven new favorites to choose from.<br /><br />\\"Dead and Gone,\\" with its backing vocals, tremolo guitars and xylophone accents, shows off the Danger Mouse element perfectly. Fresh off a project titled \\"Rome\\" with Italian composer Daniele Luppi, Danger Mouse has always been a fan of the Italian western.<br /><br />Although he doesn't quite transform \\"Dead and Gone\\" into another \\"spaghetti western,\\" there are familiar elements that link \\"El Camino\\" to \\"Rome.\\"<br />Tracks like \\"Gold on the Ceiling,\\" \\"Run Right Back,\\" and \\"Sister\\" each keep the good times rolling with a combination of snappy beats and witty lyrics.<br /><br />In fact, \\"El Camino\\" is probably the funniest album by The Black Keys to date. Sure, they've had their clever moments, but with lines like \\"Well she's such a special thing, she doesn't read too much, but there's no doubt she's written about\\" it's hard not to come away from this album grinning.<br /><br />The dark horse in the race to the top of the singles charts on this record is \\"Little Black Submarines.\\"<br /><br />As the only song on the record to top four minutes, it takes some time to get going with a two minute acoustic introduction, but as soon as Patrick Carney begins to slam sticks against his drum heads, the track blossoms into a classic Black Keys jam.<br /><br />\\"El Camino\\" is the most fun you'll have listening to a Black Keys album. The songs are relatively short and with the exception of \\"Little Black Submarines,\\" each one dives head first into a new catchy hook. \\"Brothers\\" offered up more diversity than you'll find here, but now that The Black Keys are on top, \\"El Camino\\" will ensure they stay there for the time being.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Gold on the Ceiling\\"top of the singles charts on this record is \\"Little Black Submarines.\\"  As the only song on the record to top four minutes, it takes some time to get going with a two minute acoustic introduction, but as soon as Patrick Carney begins to slam sticks against his drum heads, the track blossoms into a classic Black Keys jam.  \\"El Camino\\" is the most fun you'll have listening to a Black Keys album.

The Amazon product information does not state this. The back of the box does state \\"that it may not play on some players\\", in very fine print of course, but how is one to know until it's opened and tried. One doesn't usually read the fine print of a blu-ray or DVD! Waiting to hear from him if it worked on his PS3. Not happy- Beware of this blu-ray!

B002PQ7JQK|4.0|My review is a bit delayed, as I purchased this set last summer. It took me over six months to go through all 20 BD disks, and I finally finished watching in early December.<br /><br />I'm a long-time Star Trek fan (my first episode was the 1967 summer rerun of \\"Balance of Terror\\" on NBC). Yet I have never owned the complete series in any of its formats (VHS or DVD). As the complete series DVDs disappeared and became impossible to obtain (except for the disappointing remastered DVDs--more on that below), I thought I would never be able to own this classic series in its original, unaltered incarnation.<br /><br />Thankfully, Paramount/CBS has released an absolutely superlative BluRay collection of all 79 original episodes and some surprising and unexpected extras.<br /><br />The extra I was most anticipating is to be found on disk 6 of Season 3: the original unaired (and very rarely seen) version of Star Trek's second pilot episode, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before.\\" This alone is nearly worth the price of the entire set. CBS was contacted by a German film collector who had the entire pilot in its original form on 35mm film. When CBS realized what he had, they agreed to pay for a complete HD scan, clean-up and re-color-timing of the whole film, which looks amazing, despite some occasional film damage. It's enjoyable to see the more serious tone generated by different theme music and \\"Quinn-Martin\\"-style act breaks, as well as more fight scene footage in the episode's climax.<br /><br />Of course, that's not all Paramount/CBS did in preparing this set. They went back to the original negatives, did a complete clean-up and new color timing of every episode. Each episode is now a visual revelation and practically every frame is sparkling with color and life. This remaster has renewed my respect for the producers and craftsmen involved with this ground-breaking show. Not only does the higher resolution not reveal as many flaws as I suspected it might, it actually makes the sets and costumes used back then look even more impressive than I remember them. There are some early episodes where makeup and costume inconsistencies are more jarring in HD than before (like some zippers showing near the uniform collars, and the seams in Leonard Nimoy's Vulcan ear appliances), but you can see that their execution of their craft got better and better with each subsequent episode. The HD remaster looks so good that you'll soon forget that your first viewing of this incredible series was likely on a fuzzy black-and-white TV with ghosting on the signal reception.<br /><br />It won't be that much of a cliché after you get your first viewing of these on BD, but here it is: it's like watching these episodes for the very first time.<br /><br />There is some visible softness in transitions created on an optical printer, such as dissolves, fade-ins and fade-outs, but that is really fairly unobtrusive as you are watching each episode. However, because of the way the original effects were created, using multiple film elements combined on an optical printer, there was a lot of dust, scratches and damage they could not fix in the new scans on the effects and composite footage (such as Enterprise fly-bys and viewscreen inserts). This was a motivating factor in CBS' decision to have all new digital effects created beginning in 2006 for the newly-remastered original series.<br /><br />Herein lies my only problem with the Original Series BluRay, and seeing as how I can view all of the original visual effects for every episode on this BluRay set (by either selecting the option from the main menu or by using the \\"Angle\\" button), it's not really that much of an irritant.<br /><br />I really wanted to believe that the people who executed the remastered effects had Star Trek's best interests at heart, but after viewing them, I am so far from being sold on them that I will never accept them or watch them as an integrated part of each episode.<br /><br />For one thing, they got certain details of the Enterprise wrong. I checked with some A/B comparisons of certain shots on the BluRay, as well as photos of the original model as it was being restored at the Smithsonian. That's pretty unforgivable, considering the producers could have accessed exactly the same material I did.<br /><br />The remastered effects, more often than not, look overdone and cartoony, creating a feel not even close to the original filmed episodes. They would have been better served to recreate the same camera angles and lighting of the original Enterprise shots instead of making the camera, and the ship, swoop and dive like a spacecraft in modern visual effects. The remastered effects would have been at home on \\"Enterprise,\\" but not on the original series.<br /><br />That said, there were some interesting additions that actually were successful, such as the new archaeological dig establishing shots added to \\"The Man Trap,\\" and the marvelously lifelike and active mattes of Starbase 11 created for \\"The Menagerie\\" and \\"Court Martial,\\" as well as the improved yet faithful cityscape of Eminiar 7 from \\"A Taste of Armageddon.\\"<br /><br />I'm really glad that, unlike Star Wars, we can still view the original versions on BluRay, and are not forced to accept the remasters as the new (and only) standard.<br /><br />The 7.1 DTS-MA audio mix created for the remastered episodes is pretty amazing, even the newly-recorded, and thoroughly bombastic, main title theme. Despite the fact it doesn't quite match the action when accompanying the original visual effects, it's still very impressive, and a lot of fun to listen to. Even the original mono tracks included on the disks sound close to pristine (with a few bits of damage they were never able--or willing--to repair). My only possible gripe is that they should have also included the 5.1 mix they created for the original DVD release as an option, in addition to the original mono audio (and the Spanish and French dubs), but alas, there is only so much room for options on each BluRay disk.<br /><br />If you are a Star Trek fan who really feels most at home with the original series, this BluRay set will satisfy you for years to come, and since Star Trek just passed its 45th anniversary, what a fitting way to renew your acquaintance with this incredible, ground-breaking, well-written and well-produced TV sci-fi gem. It easily is the equal to the other two classic sci-fi shows of the 60s, The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits. Even at its price at this writing of $183, this is, frankly, an amazing bargain.

1451627289|5.0|Thinking about time travel is sort of like thinking about what you'd do if you won the lottery. It's cheap entertainment, but it also reveals a bit about personal priorities. If you COULD go back in time and change something, what would it be?<br /><br />Stephen King's affable protagonist, Jake Epping, has limitations - he has no choice about the place to which he travels or the time in which he finds himself (September 9, 1958, at 11:58 a.m in Lisbon Falls, Maine)- but he does have more choice concerning his actions than many time travel scenarios. Jake knows that whatever happens, he can go back and un-do, re-do, correct mistakes, etc. Each return through the \\"rabbit hole\\" in time is a re-set.<br /><br />Or so he thinks. This is Stephen King, after all. You didn't really think it would be that simple?<br /><br />King has said that the book is like nothing he's written before and certainly that is the case as far as subject matter...but this is King at his best, in terms of crystal clean writing. Every sentence is a pleasure.

0316666343|5.0|Sebold manages to take a very odd path to telling this story from the viewpoint of the dead girl, and make it astoundingly immersing and poetic.  Her description of the moment of death alone is worth the price of this novel.  It seems so true that it is easy to believe that you are reading the words of a dead girl.  I really admired Sebold's rigorous discipline in not allowing the reader the satisfaction of closure on any of the events--the rape and murder, the body, the perpetrator...but she does cave at the end.  If she had excised that finale, this would be very close to a perfect novel, along the lines of [[ASIN:0679723161 Lolita]]or [[ASIN:B000SEGHT6 Slaughterhouse-Five: A Novel]]

Cons: No power switch. The power light (blue led) is annoyingly bright. The eq's are sensitive, but since they are british type and not sliders, not that big of deal to me.  Other thoughts: I would have given 5 stars but the inability to shut it off, especially with the power light being so bright, is a turn off.
B0063IH60K|3.0|easy to use.  ads pop up every few games but can easily skip past them.  challenging and that is what i need
B001UV4XIS|1.0|It is not a real digital copy like companies used to include. I want a digital copy in my iTunes library That way it will play through Apple TV or on any of my iDevices. This will not do that. Will not buy any more UV \\"digital copies\\"
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very minimal setup procedure. It also stays resident so you can quickly access your local weather.<br /><br />No complaints thus far.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Boycott Ultraviolet. Without this being compatible with iTunes, it is not a truly \\"digital copy\\". I will only buy digital copies that come with a iTunes redemption code. That way all my devices can share the movie and I can watch wherever I want, even Apple TV.

B004A8ZWVK|3.0|DVD had no stickers. Obviously used, repackaged with plastic to look new. I would not mind normally, but it was a christmas present. Luckily Grandmas don't know these sort of things so no harm no foul. Seller should be more honest.

0385341008|5.0|I have had this book for quite a few years but had been avoiding it because my mother-in-law recommended it to me.  In my past experiences, her reading tastes just don't match up to mine, so for that reason alone, I avoided it.  As part of a book club that members recommend books from to be read lists, I was asked to read this book.  I can honestly say, I wasn't really looking forward to it.  But as soon as I started reading, I realized what a wonderful book I had missed out on for so many years.  This book was a joy to read.  The format is letters written to and from the \\"author\\" of the book back and forth between newfound friends on Guernsey, a Channel Island off the coast of England during the German occupation of WWII.  The history alone is to be marveled at, the stories of how the islanders survived with no food or rations and the relationships forged with some of the German soldiers were amazing and tear jerking.  There were so many characters that at first I wondered if they all could be fleshed out in such a short book, but the author does an amazing job of letting the reader look into the heart and souls of each character.  As I read, I felt like a friend sitting among them listening to thier stories.  This is a fascinating read and one book that I am truly glad that I have read.  5 stars!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has lots of features and insentives to unlock new games. it will make you not wanna put it down.
0439023513|4.0|After hearing so much about this series and knowing the first movie was coming out in March, I finally decided to start reading The Hunger Games. Fast forward four days later, after I've finished the third book, uncomfortably shaken. My first reaction was disappointment because, like many other readers, I was looking for the fantasy ending. I knew so many had been killed already but I thought that somehow Katniss would win in the end and live happily ever after, but no one actually wins in war. It wasn't until I read the beautiful review by A.R. Bovey that I understood why the author did what she did. This book is raw and real, painful and unexpected...just like war. Granted, some of the writing is choppy and I think the ending was tied up a bit too quickly, but Collins goes into what it's like, what I imagine it's really like, to lose so much and learn how to rebuild. Whether it's making a scrapbook of memories or forcing yourself to think of others' positive actions every day, it's a process that cannot be defined or neatly packed. It's life. I didn't expect all of that going into this series but I'm glad I've been forced to think about it.
B00656C6KK|5.0|It was so overwhelming to be transported back in time by this beautiful voice!  Doris Day is someone of whom you NEVER tire.  We were delighted to add to our collection of her Hits.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|GREAT read.  I saw that Ken Follett, one of my favorite writers, had recommended this book so I knew I had to have it.  I couldn't put it down and read it all night until my battery died on my new IPAD, then I switched to my Kindle and kept reading.  I am currently looking for more of Child's books, picking one out as soon as I finish this.
B003297I1U|5.0|Bruder makes a wide range of construction toys and they didn't miss the target when designing this one.  My son is almost 5 and he just loves playing with this crane.  While he does need assistance at times (like attaching the extension) the design allows him the freedom to play and pretend for hours.  This toy is on the expensive side, but it's made well and will be played with for quite some time.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|This app does what it says, and is easy to use.<br /><br />But a 6 MB app that can't be moved to the sd card slows my phone way down. And the &quot;manual&quot; sync is really a &quot;constant sync when the app is open&quot;.<br /><br />Give us a &quot;sync now&quot; button/option, and allow the app to move to SD storage &amp; this app would be 5 stars. I've tried just about all of 'em (Wunderlist, Checkmark, Catch, yada yada).
0061537969|5.0|I just bought this book a few days after Christmas, and I finished in 3 days. This was an incredibly easy read (even for someone that's not on avid reader such as myself). This story was really incredible even without it being told by a dog....that just made it even better. I originally bought this book because I read reviews other people wrote on Amazon, and so I took a chance, which I have not regreted. Enzo told Denny's story with so much detail that it got me thinking what dogs actually have going through their minds. Denny goes through so many trials in this book and I was so happy with how everything culminated right in the end of the story. Great book.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This was a gift for my wife from her daughters.  Fits great. Looks super and very stylish.  Mom loves it, as well as the Kindle Fire she also received.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Very entertaining and interesting film, if somewhat implausible.  These guys really know how to put together an excellent production.  Actors and production staff made a great effort.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app looks so beautiful on the Fire. very informative. got the seven day forecast. even a satellite feature! get it.now
B004QNN1UI|3.0|I have been a fan for years. However, the band sound lethargic at the beginning and I think the editing of the CD is awful. Why couldn't the audience be faded in and out instead of cut dead and then re-introduced? It's like listening to 16 live cuts rather than one continuous concert. Great songs,4 stars nornally but the CD loses a star for lousy editing.
B0058O84G0|2.0|The ACcidental history review says it all. So for me all I will say is do not bother. Unless you like the history element. It is a huge story but as fiction it is far too contrived. I read 80% and gave up. As a history lesson it probably works - but the fact that all the characters end up close to all the major players in not only the first world war, but also the russian revolution killed the believability for me. And they keep meeting, even in the trenches on opposite sides!
B005KDWUFA|1.0|THEY DO NOT SOUND LIKE THEY HAVE IN THE PAST, WAS EXPECTING MOST IN ENGLISH HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT THE CASE, WOULD NOT RECOMEND TO FRIENDS WHO DONT KNOW OF THE GROUP. I WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE PURCHASING ANOTHER BY THEM.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my son.  He loves this series and even watches the same episodes over.  Kind of a quirky comedy.
1423140591|5.0|I began reading Rick Riordan's books, ( Percy Jackson's books and the Kane's chronicles) almost by chance because I watched the movie about the first book and I loved the funny characters of demigods and Olympian Gods living in the States. The new series about the Heroes of Olympus is as good as the first series and this book especially made me cry, laugh and fall in love with two additional characters (Hazel and Frank) that adds to the constelation of the unforgettable characters created by the author. Additionally, a private joke inside the book, the chapter about the Amazons made me laugh histerically. The funniest chapter in the book, it makes a joke with the Mythological Amazons and the Amazon (yes, here the on-line store)where this review is written. When one of the characters find a magical horse in a jail, ready to be shipped, she asks the Amazon Queen if magical creatures can be bought on line. And the Queen answers very matter of fact, where did she expect that someone that needed a magical thing could buy it? And the signals \\"Buy soon, only three gnomes in stock\\" inside the Amazons building made me laugh even more ( I think Rick Riordan made a little joke with our esteemed Amazon store!)The recounting of the adventures of the three members of Camp Jupiter in their quest to release Thanatos (yes, Death was prisoner to Gaea and nobody died properly, nor even the gorgons or the ogres killed by Celestial Bronze or Imperial Gold) adds flavour to our knowledge of Greek-Roman mithology, adding  spice to a fast-pacing narrative. And finally,  our hero, Percy Jackson, again is in the spotlight of the action. The first book introduced Jason and more demigods and explained a lot about Annabeth, but I missed Percy. With the son of Neptune,  Percy Jackson is again in charge. I am full of expectations about the third book, when all these heroes and demigods will finally meet!
B004ZQRJFO|4.0|Two of the best lyricists around, finally put their years of differences apart and rejoined forces to deliver a very high quality, much needed and long sought after collaboration album, one worthy of 4.5 stars.  Most people heard them together back in late `98/early '99 and for a little period afterwards and doing a few songs together, before they had their falling out, but thankfully they put all that aside.  As expected, you are going to get an album filled with rapid fire, top-notch lyrics and delivery, great punchlines, and story's.  This would be the 11th album I have that Em has been a part of, and the 12th for Royce, all of which are high quality just like this one. Here is my comparison to their other albums:  EMINEM    \\"Slim Shady LP\\" -- (2/99) -- 4.5/4 stars    \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\" -- (5/00) -- 4/4.5 stars   \\"Eminem Show\\" -- (5/02) -- 4.5 stars  \\"Encore\\" -- (11/04) -- low 4 stars  \\"Relapse\\" -- (5/09) -- 5 stars - CLASSIC  \\"Recovery\\" -- (6/10) -- 4.5 stars  \\"Presents... The Re-Up\\" -- (12/06) -- low 4 stars  D12 -- \\"Devils Night\\" -- (6/01) -- 4.5 stars  D12 -- \\"D12 World\\" -- (4/04) -- 4 stars  DJ Green Lantern -- \\"Invasion Part II: Conspiracy Theory\\" -- (4/03) -- 4.5 stars  ROYCE da 5'9\\"  \\"Rock City\\" -- (11/02) -- 4 stars  \\"Build & Destroy\\" -- (7/03) -- 4 stars  \\"Death is Certain\\" -- (2/04) -- 4 stars  \\"M.I.C. - Make it Count\\" -- (10/04) -- 4.5/4 stars  \\"Independents Day\\" -- (6/05) -- 4.5/4 stars  \\"The Bar Exam\\" -- (6/07) -- 4.5/4 stars  \\"The Album\\" -- (11/08) -- 4.5 stars  \\"Street Hop\\" -- (10/09) -- 4.5/5 stars  \\"Success is Certain\\" -- (8/11)   Slaughterhouse -- (8/09) -- 4.5 stars  Slaughterhouse EP -- (2/11) -- 4/4.5 stars  This album isn't the longest, but is well worth it for the 11 songs on here.  Of those 11: 2 are near classics, 2 are ok, the other 7 are good or real good songs.  Guests aren't too heavy really.  Though they are on 6 of the songs, only 1 they are rapping on (featuring Royce's 3 fellow `Slaughterhouse' group mates.  Productions is nice as well.  Kon Artis (a.k.a. Mr. Porter) of D-12 does 4 songs, Havoc of Mobb Deep, DJ Khalil, Supa Dups, Sid Roams, Mr. Bangladesh, Eminem, 56 all do 1 song. A must have album from 2 top-notch lyricists.  #1 - 9 (nice beat)  #2 - 9.5 (f/ Sly Jordan -- tight beat)  #3 - 8.5  #4 - 8.5 (f/ Claret Jai)  #5 - 7.5 (one of their drug related songs)  #6 - 7.5 (a simple beat)  #7 - 9 (f/ Bruno Mars -- nice beat)  #8 - 9.5 (f/ Claret Jai -- tight beat)  #9 - 9 (f/ Crooked I, Joell Ortiz, Joe Budden {Slaughterhouse})  #10 - 8.5  #11 - 8 (f/ Liz Rodrigues)  ROYCE -- Ryan Montgomery -- b. 7/5/77 -- Detroit, MI  EMINEM -- Marshall Mathers -- b. 10/17/72 -- b.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I bought this set as a gift for my Mom, who loves Dr. Quinn, but has never seen every episode. For six seasons and both movies at $50, this was an incredible steal, for even a mediocre series. This isn't what I would call a mediocre series, so I think it was well worth the money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app...love the devotionals that are available and the various versions you can choose from and reference.  I love that you can either read or listen to the lesson/verses and you can also set a reminder alert to go off daily and remind you of your devotional time.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I actually ordered this as a gift for my son. He has enjoyed it so much that he hardly ever puts it down.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|this bag is such a great value for the price. it has so much space and everything. the straps are comfortable, the pockets are big, theres room for my 13 inch macbook in the front zipper pocket, there room for my cell phone on the side, and it even handles my heavy ass tripod when strapped to the side. glad i didnt waste 120 bucks on something else...maybe if i was expecting extreme conditions or something?
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I bought the Kindle Fire and this cover about 2 weeks ago. Its been holding the Kindle for just over a week and I'm sad to say that the outer layer of clear protective layer is pealing off around the edges. I really enjoy the cover itself. Its very lightweight and thin. But there are a few more issues as well.<br />- The front cover bends lengthwise in half to create a stand when folded back. This unfortunately makes a similar mark on the Kindle screen when closed. Its not a permentant mark, but annoying none the less.<br />- There is a small amount of protection with the case. I know with the little weight and thin design obviously allow of little to no protection but there is only a small amount of 'fuzzy' backing to the front cover to protect the Kindle.<br />- The corners on the front cover to no match the back; it is slightly off. I noticed this is a design flaw as when you hold the Kindle, it slides the back where you hold it, this would throw the corners off when you close the cover.<br />- The elastic to hold the cover open and close seems very cheap and will soon wear out I feel.<br /><br />All in all its a good cover for the price.<br />Pros: Very lightweight, thin, cheap<br />Cons: Cheap materials, little protection, feels cheap.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This is the best show on TV. There is something so fantastic about Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic together. The chemistry and mystery solving make this a must watch.
B00000ILDE|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece of intelligent shoot-em-up action.   Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, hero from first film) is retrieved after 57 years from hypersleep adrift in her space shuttle. At an inquest, officials disbelieve her story and suspend her space officer license, because she destroyed the huge valuable Nostromo ship. She is informed that a terraforming colony has been established on LV-426, and no aliens have been detected. She has to get a blue-collar job on a loading dock and has nightmares every night about the aliens. Later, Burke (Paul Reiser), a corporate agent, informs her that contact has been lost with LV-426 and a section of Marines is being sent to investigate. Burke offers to re-instate her license and employ if she will act as an embedded advisor to the Marines.  The Marines and Ripley awake from hypersleep and drop to LV-426. They find the colony empty of colonists and signs of firefight everywhere. Through transponders planted in the colonists, they determine that they are all collected together at the colony' central fusion processing plant, dead or alive. The Marines move in on the plant, and an almost non-stop roller-coaster ride of shoot-em-up action unfolds all the way to end of the film. Expect twists and turns.  This is first and foremost an action film. The Marines are gung-ho and so are the aliens. All the battles are close-quarter, brutal and gorey. The aliens are portrayed much more realistically than in the first film, and there are a lot of them. The Marines' weapons are effective, but they are way outnumbered.  This is also a science fiction film. We get to see the aliens up close and their life-cycle. We get to see powerful weapon gadgets. We get to see the new and improved android. We get to see a cool drop-ship and armored personnel carrier. We get to see an exosuit used to full potential. We get to see how commerce corrupts the future as much as it does the present.  This is also a significant feminist film. Ripley is the hero. She rocks. She shows her leadership skills, her intellgence and her battle skills. We also get to see her establish a relationship with the colony's only survivor, 9-year-old Newt who becomes essentially Ripley's adopted daughter. Weaver in all these aspects displays a supreme range of emotions. She is a hero for the ages. Also, several of the Marines are female and they are just as badass as the men. The all-female showdown at the film's explosive conclusion is a classic. We get to see how a real man (Corporal Hicks) treats women respectfully.  Every aspect of this film is first-class. The sets look real. The aliens look and move realistically. The script, direction, cinematography, music, sound, editing are all virtually perfect. The only detail I found unrealistic is that the explosions in such close quarters in reality would have damaged all parties on both ends of the guns, and seems to me the alien acid blood would do more damage. But who cares about little stuff.  This is one my favorite films of all time. Just to give you an idea of my perspective, I also love Blade Runner, Starship Troopers, District 9, Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, Rome (TV series), Spartacus Blood/Sand/Arena, Serenity, Dune (TV miniseries), Black Hawk Down, ...

B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is addicting and fun even though I seldom win. The screen is very colorful and clear. I play it to unwind and pass the time when my boyfriend is watching the game or I am a passenger on long drives and I am tired of reading. Besides it's free!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|SPOILER ALERT. I read the Hunger Games trilogy in a few days. I could not stop reading. Thank goodness for text to speech on Kindle because it was on while I washed dishes, did laundry, etc. I had to know what happened. I'm disappointed that there are so many negative reviews for this final book. Of course I'm bummed that we didn't have more romance from Katniss and Peeta but the way it was written was so much more realistic. This was never a \\"feel good\\" trilogy. This was a book about war, politics, loss and finally romance. I struggled with the way things happened in the final book but that's what makes it more real, life doesn't happen the way we hope it will and we have to cope. Katniss had to cope, Peeta had to cope, Gale had to cope. We change as life happens as did they. I loved the final book; it made me think, it made my heart race out of my chest, it made my cry, it made me gasp with surprise. It was...beautiful. I was so happy that Katniss chose Peeta in the end, she chose him for his love and compassion, for his dedication. We tend to think that men have to be strong and macho and at first it was kind of odd to be reading about a sensitive young man who was a baker and an artist as a hero but I knew he should be the one for her even during the first book. I understand that at the end of the day, Katniss didn't need a physical protector, she didn't need a warrior, she could take care of herself in those ways, what she needed was a man who solidly loved her, who would die for her even if he wasn't able to fight terribly well physically for her. I love that at the end they made a family for themselves, that they stayed together \\"even though\\". That's what life is all about, that's what solid relationships are made of, commitment and forgiveness for each others flaws and weaknesses. I don't know that I've ever read a better book, than the three of these books as a whole. I'm still blown away. I intend to start again at the beginning and take my time and savorthe words. Fantastic series! Well done to an amazing author.
0385737424|5.0|This book by Rebecca Stead has it all: Great characters, excellent plot, interesting setting. It's well-written in a easy-to-read style and tells a story that will intrigue middle grade readers and even older readers. Along the way, young readers will find themselves reflecting on their own lives, how they treat others, the importance of even the smallest details of life. I highly recommend this book!

B004EPZ03O|5.0|This movie does for Muppets fans what the first Star Trek movie back 1979 did for the original Trek fans: it attempted to bridge generations by giving the old Muppets fans like me a nice warm fuzzy blast-from-the-past and the next generation a reason to become Muppets fans.  I thought it accomplished this splendidly.  I was totally entertained throughout the movie and will likely see it again on DVD with the members of my family who were not with me at the movie theater yesterday.<br /><br />Two nit picks: First, making villians of people who want to profit off of traditional sources of energy (like oil) is sooooo cliche now.  Believe it or not, being from Texas and making money by finding and bringing oil to the surface does not make a person just the sort who would raze a Muppet museum.  Besides, isn't there a lone oil well still being pumped somewhere in the middle of the LA metropolitan area?  I've been there and seen it.  It doesn't take up much space.  If Henry Ford (that evil guy who made it possible for the non-elite to own automobiles, according to Time Magazine's \\"50 Worst Cars of All Time\\") could move buildings from all over the world to his museum in Detroit, then \\"Tex Richguy\\" could probably scoot the little Muppets building a bit to make room for his oil wells, couln't he?  Of course not!  In Hollywood, being from Texas is strike one and making money from burning dinosaurs is strikes two and three.  Why not make the bad guy a developer of those tacky condo complexes that all look the same and have blighted most every once-charming little neighborhood business district in the city where I live?<br /><br />But I digress.  Second, why didn't Rizzo the Rat get a little scene for himself?  I saw rats in the rafters of the old Muppet Theater but I didn't see Rizzo featured in any scene.  What happened?  This is Rizzo who was the lead Muppet for the Muppet Christmas Carol.  (Now there's a classic!)  What if Rizzo had been married for thirty years and had 100 generations of descendants living in that theater, and he got them to clean the place up.  Now that would be funny, and it would not have required so much of the movie's time in the theater-cleaning segment.  Anyone think of that?<br /><br />Nits aside, a beautifully done movie that I'll likely see at least one more time, and hopefully will be accompanied with cool bonus features, like maybe that Toy Story cartoon that was shown before the movie; almost worth the price of admission in and of itself!endants living in that theater, and he got them to clean the place up.

B0058VW36U|3.0|I really want to try this game so please make it the free app of the day thanks. bye bye
1593272839|4.0|This book is available free online, so why buy a hard copy? Haskell takes some getting used to. This book doesn't present the classic Hello World! program until chapter 8. This means reading a lot before writing your own apps (in my opinion). I wanted to quickly refresh my knowledge of previous chapters without completely rereading them. Instead of using the online version as a reference a hard copy is much easier to use. The book approached the subject very well and I believe rewarding the authors/publishers with purchasing this hard copy.

B002PMV9FG|4.0|At this point I don't think there're many people who haven't seen the Harry Potter movies, but I'll throw my two cents in.  It's competently acted, well directed, visually it's frankly stunning, and the book it's based on is one of the better ones in the series.  This movie's fun and contains one of the best twists for the uninitiated of the whole series.    If you're looking for the carefree fun and whimsy of the first few films however, you should know that this movie solidifies the shift to a darker and more somber tone for the series.  It's not all fun and games anymore as secrets are revealed, a beloved character is taken from us and the good guys pretty much lose.  So there you have it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I received my purchase quickly and in good condition. My family enjoyed the Harry Potter movie-thon for New Years thoroughly!

B00127RAJY|2.0|I got this DVD several months ago and did level one.  I put it aside and never touched it again.  The reason is that I viewed it as unhealthy and unnecessarily high impact for a middle aged person, which is what I am.  I'm in decent shape, but I've slacked off this past year.  I've been doing workout tapes off and on for decades.  So I should've been able to tough out level one, right?  Wrong.<br /><br />However, this is the start of a new year, so I'm putting this DVD in the workout tapes lineup to give it another try.  The next time, despite Michaels' repeated instructions not to modify, I will heavily modify.  First, one thing she does is go from floor work in a prone position quickly back to standing-up cardio work, then quickly down to the floor in a prone position, then quickly back up to standing cardio work.  That got me very dizzy.  There was no time for my equilibrium to catch up.  I toughed it out, determined to get through that, but when it got to the point that I thought I'd faint or upchuck, I stopped.<br /><br />Next...the jumping jacks.  She says not to modify, but that is a must for me.  I don't have any particular knee problems.  One reason for that, I believe, is...I don't do repeated high impact movements.  It's unnecessary to do high impact to get healthy and in shape, and it is likely to damage the already worn joints of this middle aged person.  So I will modify that. (Also, I'm a tad buxom, and I find high impact somewhat painful and uncomfortable because of my busom, despite all the sports bras I've tried.  But maybe I haven't tried the right one?)<br /><br />All the rave reviews of the Michaels' workout DVDs are warranted, for those people.  But I wanted to share my review from the perspective of someone who may not be the average Michaels' customer.  Still, I'm going to give this DVD another try, with modifications, and update my review.  For now, though, I'm thinking that if a workout tape needs lots of modifications in order to do it, then that's not the right workout for that person (me).  It's for a younger crowd (and truth is, if I had a young daughter, I'd advise her not to do high impact; she'll pay for it later...ask Jane Fonda who has had a hip replacement and I think knee replacements).t for that person (me).  It's for a younger crowd (and truth is, if I had a young daughter, I'd advise her not to do high impact; she'll pay for it later...ask Jane Fonda who has had a hip replacement and I think knee replacements).
B005I6EU7U|3.0|I am a librarian so I liked the fact that this made my Kindle look like a book you would take off the dusty shelves of an antique shop.  I plan to have my name engraved on the cover to personalize it which I think will be attractive. What I didn't like is that the cover cannot be fastened close.  When I put it in a tote or large purse, I have to be careful that it doesn't open so it won't mar the Kindle surface.

0142419400|5.0|This book Anna and the French Kiss is about a teenager girl named Anna.  Anna is looking forward to senior year in Atlanta with a great job, a loyal best friend, Bridget and crush, Toph that could end up more.  Until Anna's father announce that Anna was going to spend her senior year in France at a boarding school called The School of America.  Anna meets four great friends Meredith, Etienne St. Clair, Josh and  Rashmi. Anna and St. Clair gets really close. Everyone knows St. Clair loves Anna but St. Clair has a longtime girlfriend Ellie that St. Clair is having a hard time breaking up with.  When Anna comes back to Atlana for Christmas break she finds out her best friend Bridget and Toph are dating.  When she arrives to school in January St. Clair breaks up with Ellie and tells Anna he is in love with her. This book is really good. I hope you love this book as much as I did.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This show is great and wholesome. I love that they are continuing the flirty relationship between Beckett and Castle. I'm interested to see where the show continues going for the rest of the season.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is totally gripping and a fitting end to the Percy Jackson and the Olympian series. By far the best in the series.
B005LFA1DK|5.0|This season will give you insight. The show grows up a little with this season. There are many twists and turns, and it has been my absolute favorite season of the show. The show was starting to get dull with the same outcome, until mid season 6, and season 7 continues the greatness. It is fresh and taking a direction that is needed to keep the show going for another season or two.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My daughter bought this app when she was in search for a fantastic free app. after seeing it on cloud, I too downloaded this game and have fallen completely in love.
B000WDZHAI|5.0|If you liked Season 1&2, you will like 3. The show is funny, witty, and always interesting as they wind through life looking for meaning in life. Season 3 provides a pivotal moment that changes the series.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game, it has challenge, variety and excitement. fun to enjoy by yourself or share with a friend.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|I can't really rate this application considering I haven't been able to use it. I downloaded it from the Amazon Appstore on my phone and since then my phone has been nonstop rebooting. I finally took the battery out and then my SD card which fixed the rebooting, but I currently do not have an SD card in my phone. I can't put full blame on the app though, because I only downloaded the app, not installed it. But just writing to put a caution out there to anyone else with the same phone as me. (I'm listing it below the review)I gave the app a three star only cause I have to put something in.  If I'm able to delete the app somehow I'll come back and fix this review.   DROID 2 Global
1451627289|4.0|I saw this same story on the Twilight Zone back in 1985 , called Profile in Silver. Same premise and same results .  It was still a good read with the references to the world in 1958 in comparison to today's world and how little changes in the past could cause large changes  to the future.One of his better efforts and well worth the time .  It was however a bit long , some of the segments seemed unnecessary as they really added nothing to the story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is true to the card game. it works very well and doesn't freeze up. I recommend it highly.
0765326353|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in epic fantasy.  It is well written with enough detail to really bring this world to life.  The world created by Brandon Sanderson is also very unique to this series, it is refreshing to read something different.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app, but for some reason it does not remind me to read like it says it will.  Still, don't know what I would do without it.
B002AKPECW|5.0|Just after I convinced myself Reynolds' writing had peaked around the turn of the century, I could not resist picking up House of Suns - mostly due to the volume and amplitude of acclaim for the book.   By chapter 3 I had to recant my conviction; the force of Reynolds' imagination and ability to share it through words was simply too great to resist. Fortunately, I was able to replace it with a new conviction that this book is his *best work to date* and happily endorse it as a must-read for all fans of hard science fiction, space opera, and creative fiction alike.
B001RIY49C|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present, and my husband was thrilled with it. It was just as described, and just what he wanted. The shipping was fairly fast, and very reasonably priced. Would buy again.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|The Donnie Darko DVD I ordered was exactly the product I ordered, and it was also brand new never opened (which is also how I ordered it.) The only problem I had was with the shipping, coming almost two weeks late. Everyone should see this film, though, it's revolutionary.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, and even though this is a more basic set it's still great. It's very compact and it's nice to have all of the movies in one place. It's also a great deal.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|An amazing show an amazing series. I love the case and all the great extras! The handle broke off pretty quickly, but I still love the packaging.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm always looking for good mahjong games, and this one is by far the best.  Nice variety of game play, plenty of puzzles &amp; hours of fun.
1439152799|4.0|I loved The Forgotten Garden. I was glad to order The Distant Hours. Really, Kate Morton is a terrific writer. The Distant Hours is scarier and darker than The Forgotten Garden, although that also had its share of creepiness, but more limited. This is a very good book. And you can't put down a Kate Morton book. I found it a little too unsettling for my tastes, which are probably more corny and humorous than average.
0896898288|2.0|This is a beautiful book, but I am not a fan of templates and it is incredibly annoying that the author could not provide measurements (as every other high quality quilting book does) for her quilters. The more I shuffled through the templates, the more irritated I became. My take is this is still a beautiful quilt, lovely stories and lazy author.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I have this plugged into an LG 42LH40 LCD and then plugged directly into a Sennheiser RS120 headphone receiver/base (the connectors are RCA on the Sennheiser)...and no headphone preamp.  The volume control on the wireless headphones takes care of the line-level adjusting. Works perfectly for all signals I've thrown at it (Xbox 360, PS 3, HTPC, and DirecTV receiver).  I hear no hiss nor disturbance, nothing but the signal.  Sounds great.  There've been no sync issues between standadard/high def and Dolby 5.1/stereo.  This thing just works (at least for the first night).
B003TJR2HS|3.0|This did work as advertised, but the weight of the iPhone makes this an unstable arrangement. I ended up returning the adapter. I'm going to look for an adapter with an extension cord, so I can lay the iPhone down on a surface as it is connected with my doc/music player.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|This device adds 0000000 value.  easier to download to PC and use Itunes.  IOS is too closed and not being able to use this for file transfers or to move pictures from ipad to another device - is ridiculous..  crap will return later today
B0000AUHPB|3.0|A decent enough heist film with good automobile stuntwork but the humor seldom hits home and the punchline at the end was never set up and so falls flat.

B0034G4P8A|4.0|A good job with a difficult property. Having to establish the villain and set up some plot elements for the Avengers movie besides telling Thor's story made it an even more daunting task. An impressive job, though not a great movie. The obviously post-converted 3-D didn't help any; making the movie dimmer and less sharp that it would have been in a 35mm film presentation and creating odd post-conversion digital 3-D effects. I may try to catch it on film to see if I like it better in a good sharp 35mm presentation than in the degraded digital presentation I saw.   And doesn't Asgard look a whole lot like the Emerald City (but in boring gold)?  Update: I saw Thor again on film and it looked very good. I enjoyed it a lot more.   The end credits, which were obviously created for 3D after the decision to post-convert the rest of the movie to 3D, are the only time 3D was used to good effect and the rest of the movie looks SO MUCH better on film. I hope that the DVD and Blu-Ray presentation looks more like the film than the digital theatrical presentations.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|its am-an-zin-g wow I can stay on this like all day for real its awesome really really awesome people you have to get this app like seriously people.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|Charming, quirky, clever - everything you'd expect from a GOOD Wes Anderson movie. The animation is endearingly retro stop motion, but the detail shows the depth of care and thought that went into this film.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I think uno is very fun and not boring yay! it is great to play with friends and the backgrounds are PRETTY! !!!!!!!!!!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Roger Ebert said in reviewing the film: \\"I'm wearying of movies that are for \\"everybody\\" - which means, nobody in particular.\\" \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is most definitely not for everybody, though it has been quite successful despite that (or maybe because of that?). You must, at the very least, recognize the names of some people who probably died before you were born. There were members of the audience when I saw it who were obviously befuddled through lack of recognition. For those for whom the movie was made, however, it's a lovely confection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was curious about this book because of the great reviews, but hesitant to read this book because of the the idea of fighting to the death.  However, this book is fantastic.  The story is great! Once you read this book you will want to keep ready the entire trilogy. Enjoy!
B001TWT0AE|5.0|One of the greatest John Ford Westerns. Examines in microcosm both the evolution of the Old West into the Modern West and the conflict between forthrightness and expedient acceptance of perceptions.   The all around great performances lend solid support to this parable of a maturing America.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Loads of fun great way to pass the time and helps keep the mind working. Great entertainment and easy to use. Have really enjoyed my kindle fire.
B001QJUX24|4.0|Beautifully filmed, including several iconic Western cinema images and, of course, the always photogenic Monument Valley and Natalie Wood. John Wayne's does a great job playing a character who is unrelentingly racist and, though his violent racism is the dominant theme of the movie and obviously meant to make him an unsympathetic protagonist, one wonders how evident this was to audiences in the mid-Fifties as opposed to how much it may have boosted Wayne's status as an American icon in the eyes of those who didn't realize that the character's hate-filled racism was supposed to be a bad thing.   The stabs at comic relief using the cartoonish Swedish neighbor and the intellectually challenged Mose Harper wear thin after a while. Occasionally the staging, sets, and costuming are anachronistic; more 1950s Western than 1860s Texas - but the only really, truly jarring anachronism was white-girl-living-with-the-Indians Natalie Wood's very well applied lipstick.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|CRAZY STUPID LOVE is a truly heartwarming superb film.  It brings the romantic comedy to a mature and modern age with wit, heartfelt humor and characters that are believable and superbly cast.  Steve Carell and Julianne Moore are excellent as a married couple on the rocks.  Marisa Tomei pops in with a role that makes one remember how talented she really is.  But for me the true strength and heart of the film comes from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.  Ryan Gosling gives a highly entertaining comedic performance that is so multi-dimensional it will certainly take viewers by surprise as his character goes through many changes.  And Emma Stone is also hilarious.  She is proving herself to be an added asset to any film and here her humor is performed with a new intelligence and maturity.  The film is 2 hours and the beauty and heart of the film unfolds slowly from the rather abrupt beginning to the poignant and superb ending.  This is a film for true romantics.  The laughs here come from identifying with the characters and their lives.  Many subplots blend together in perfect harmony.<br /><br />The blu ray presentation is quite remarkable.  The video is spot on with a clarity that truly pops.  Colors are vibrant and bright with flesh tones realistic and true.  The black/white ratio is excellent and the overall crispness of the picture is that one may not expect from a romantic comedy.  And the audio matches it.  Dialogue is strong and present with the surround speakers used perfectly for ambience and club scenes.  The overall presentation is a perfect example of blu ray at its best.<br /><br />I honestly loved this film.  I did not see it in the theater and after purchasing it here at Amazon have watched it 3 times already and each time it makes me laugh more while also touching me more with its heartfelt and realistic message.  And with each viewing I am struck again by how great Ryan Gosling is here.  Who knew he had such great comedic chops.  Add to that his always superb character development and it becomes one of his best roles so far.  Highly recommend this film.  This is a film that will have you in stitches laughing while also shedding some tears for these characters you will truly fall in love with.pment and it becomes one of his best roles so far.  Highly recommend this film.  This is a film that will have you in stitches laughing while also shedding some tears for these characters you will truly fall in love with.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Fun. Some very clever stuff. But just ... \\"not quite\\". There really weren't any character arcs or growth to invest in and thus no real reward. Fun. Definitely fun. But not great.
086571701X|5.0|This is an excellent book for a beginner. Easy to Read with Great Pictures and Diagrams. Very Happy with my Purchase.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Absolutely stunning effects. A brilliantly realized fantasy planet which MUST be seen in 3-D. The CGI aliens move with a believability and weight that makes me think this crew could almost pull off realistic CGI humans. Almost.  The story, on the other hand; hackneyed, trite, derivative. Without the stunning visuals to carry it this would be at best a two star movie. I suspect that the story may even be intended to take a back seat and not distract from the visual wonders. Probably a canny decision for recouping the investment, but this technical prowess in the service of a good story could have taken cinema to a new level.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|if music is what emotion sounds like, this film is what emotion looks like.  Outstanding. Also likely an important film for thinking and talking about film making.
B001HN6918|4.0|A good action/comedy beautifully animated with very well choreographed action. It looks good in 3-D, too. Not everything has a lot of depth, but 3-D is often used to good effect - particularly in the earlier part of the movie (3D is less utilized as the movie progresses).
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I usually don't review a product unless it has failed to meet my expectations, but I've decided to make an exception for this case.  Having only received my Kindle Fire a few days ago, I have not had the longest experience with the case or the device itself, but so far I can't find anything that would sour my view of the items. I have had Marware cases for my iPhone and Kindle 2 before, and they were not only excellent but quite reasonably priced; and this case upholds that with its lightness and overall look.  Whilst many people have complained about the stand not working properly, or the elastic strap not staying connected, I have not encountered these issues. I completely understand why they are angry, but when it comes to this case I am the complete opposite!  The stand is incredibly useful, and the strap is handy to keep the cover back as well as provide a space for my hand to hold on to the Fire, reminiscent of my Kindle 2 case.  I don't treat my devices roughly, nor m I a clumsy person, so the protective factor is less for accidents and more to keep the device looking new. My Marware iPhone case has succeeded in keeping the glass back scratch and crack free for over a year!  I was nervous before it arrived after reading the negative reviews, but as soon as I opened it and popped my Kindle in, I knew it was a great case. I would highly recommend buying this!
B0031OCY2E|4.0|An amusing, understated movie. Matt Damon is completely believable as a self-deluded schlub. He really is an actor, I didn't know that before.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|confusing at first but this app has the look and feel that no other app has and all of it a the touch of your finger you can bring up anything about the weather. if I had to id gladly buy it again. works great on my droid x, motorolla xoom, droid pro, and the bionic.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|An exploration of adolescent and adult awkwardness. A bit self-conscious at times, but then awkwardness is often self-conscious.  \\"Submarine\\" is certainly reminiscent of other dark and quirky indie coming of age movies but, despite its debt to these other films, emerges as a worthy entry into the genre on its own merits.
B002C6K7NA|4.0|I could not wait to open my CD of Lynyrd Skynyrd's GOD&Guns.   Even though it was a bit disapointing with some of the songs.   It really sounded a bit more country than the Skynrd Sound.   But, I still loved a good portion of the CD. They can still rock and roll   Overall, it still rocks in a unique way.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|It is an ok app but it doesn't do anything special over other task apps.  Anyone who says it is the only google sync app obviously hasn't found the official &quot;GTasks&quot; app.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|This Bear Grylls tool was a Christmas gift for my husband and he absolutely loved it! It arrived very quickly and was still in its packaging and shipped with my invoice. Wonderful little tool I'd suggest for all Bear Grylls fans or anyone who loves camping in the wilderness! It's already come in handy several times and we haven't even gone camping yet!

B004LWZW42|5.0|I had bought this as a gift and the person I bought it for loves it. It was nice to not have to search the store for it, found it very easily and at a very resonable price on Amazon.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Ordered this and paired it with the FX-4100. Looks good and runs great with no issues at all. Only problem that I ran into was the position of the SATA ports. The fact that they are located on the side made it very hard to plug in the cables once the board was installed. My case could be to blame for this but if you dont have a large case with a ton of room it may be easier to plug the cables in before installing the board then running them to the drives. But for the price I can't complain too much.
0062082353|5.0|The story told by Chris Kyle makes you realize what sacrafice an American will make to protect the freedom of the citizens of this great country.  The unbelievable recount of various missions without revealing national secrets leaves you wondering about all the stuff Chris did that he did not tell you about.  I was very interested in the chapter on what he wore in combat and what rifles he preferred.  I am so happy we have people in this country like Chris - he is an American hero as are all the men and women who served with him, before him and who are sure to follow him.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun I suppose. but sometimes the instructions are unclear. it does keep me entertained, though. I must admit that.

B005HP2J66|2.0|What a strange movie! It started out as a factual documentary which I found absolutely fascinating especially since I had never heard of the cave before even though it's a relatively recent find. The drawings are wonderful to see! Then it turned very peculiar. It's even hard to describe. It's some kind of French new-age speculation about modern mankind connecting with prehistoric artists through these drawings which are \\"actually\\" dreams. Was interesting but not worth the money.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|This DVD set is great. Beyonce did a fantastic job with this one. I love the way she put the first half of her concert in narrative form going over her Destiny Child days and leading up to the current album. Very entertaining, as Beyonce always is!
B001UREJYK|5.0|In typical Disney fashion we get the great quality film together with the great quality format!  This film shows excellent angles and addresses areas about golf that make this film interesting even for the non-golfer.  The great lesson throughout about rising above man-made restrictions that prevent the achievement of your dreams is very well done and true to form we get another satisfying Disney-esque ending.  What's also very satisfying about this release is the great picture and sound quality.  This film has never looked better in 1080p and never sounded better in DTS HD MA 5.1 Surround.  The special feature documentaries are a real treat as well and especially for me the old black and white interview with Ouimet himself towards the end of his life.  Although I'll still remember Bill Paxton best from his famous role in \\"Aliens\\" I'll have to say that he did an excellent job of direction here.  I'm sure the great casting helped a great deal too.<br /><br />Great film, great acting and excellent picture and sound quality makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|my girl has loved the foo fighters for years  .she is so happy with this cd and  was very happy on getting it for christmas
0142429112|5.0|Think of these elements:  Oxford's Bodleian Library; a powerful yet inexperienced witch who is a respected scholar with a specialty in the history of alchemy; an ancient and handsome vampire who is the leader of an order of knights; a spellbound manuscript; and a compelling cast of other witches, vampires and demons, both good and evil.  If done right, these are the perfect ingredients for cooking up a story that is interesting, compelling, and full of complexities.  And, boy, does Deborah Harkness get it right!  I loved reading A Discovery of Witches on a variety of levels.  First, there are the great settings:  Oxford and its environs, a castle in the French countryside, and an upstate New York farmhouse that interacts in none too subtle ways with its inhabitants.  Add to that some wonderful characters.  I like that protagonist Diana Bishop, accomplished and respected in her chosen field, is not quite so confident in all aspects of her life.  I also like the dashing vampire Matthew, who is justifiably uber rich and accomplished, having lived many centuries.  The characters surrounding Diana and Matthew are all fascinating in their own right and help shape the story.    Then there are the layers of social, scientific (okay, quasi-scientific) and historical detail.  As someone who has sat in libraries researching, I fully enjoyed the attention to detail Harkness shows in describing the Bodleian and the process of doing historical research.  I love the role science plays in this book, from Diana and Matthew's separate but equally interesting research areas, to the contemplation of Darwin's theory of evolution in relationship to the development of the three species of creatures.  By the same token, I appreciate the effort she puts into imagining and describing how humans are able to live alongside witches, vampires and demons and how the three types of creatures developed ways over the centuries to coexist peacefully, at least for the most part.  The idea of the Congregation, which is a sort of federation of the three species, is interesting, as well as a clever way to address social issues we humans face in our world.  In the end, this novel is a love story--albeit a long and complex one--and, to like this type of story, it is necessary to feel some sympathy for Diana and Matthew.  Granted, neither is a perfectly consistent or rational being and can be annoying as all get out, but, in the end, that is what I like about them.  It is their personal discovery that ultimately keeps the story moving along.  I know I, for one, cannot wait to read more about them.
0439023513|5.0|***spoilers***<br /><br />After I finish a book or movie that I truly love or hate, I always go to the reviews to see what other people say. The reviews here absolutely SHOCKED me... people asking Collins to rewrite the book?!?!  This will be kind of a review of Mockingjay, but probably also a review of the reviews surrounding the book.  One of the biggest complaints I've read is that Katniss was weak and depressed and not the hero we've come to know and love... but that's the entire point! It would not be logical or believable if she was still that same \\"hero.\\" She's a 17-year-old girl who has now been taken from her family TWICE and forced to participate in the Hunger Games.  Now, upon finally reaching District 13 and the chances of a better life, she finds that in many ways District 13 is no better than the Capital.  People are still tortured, there are strict schedules, she can barely go outside. The leaders are just as violent, just as immoral.  Could you expect a 17-year-old to be able to handle all of this?  What made the book so believable and so powerful for me was that all of the characters displayed real reactions that and evolved in ways that, while maybe not beneficial or admiral, made SENSE.  A story does not have to be written with a person changing for the better, it can be about a persons life falling apart.<br /><br />I loved this book for so many reasons I didn't love Twilight.  Love is NOT the center of the universe, there are more important things going on, and that is clear in Mockingjay.  One of the reasons I hated Twilight was that in the end Bella made no sacrifices and got EVERYTHING. In Mockingjay Katniss made endless sacrifices and ended up physically and emotionally scarred and mentally unstable.<br /><br />In Mockingjay, you have to find the beauty.  It's hidden,  There is a lot of death and destruction, but that's what war is. And there are wars happening right now, people. There are also \\"districts\\" (china/india/nepal) that supply much of our goods while leading terrible lifestyles, with little pay, terrible governments and sex slave trade.  This is a book about real things that really happy that most people in America want to pretend do not exist.  There was one line - I think it was Katniss remembering Prim and she said \\"Lady licking Prims face\\" and I could see it, could see that moment of happiness in such a terrible place for that one moment, and for the first time in the series I broke down in a fit of teers.<br /><br />It's late, this is jumbled, I've already taken my sleep medication for the evening, but thoughts of this trilogy and specifically Mockingjay won't stop spinning through my head.  And to add, I loved The Hunger Games, thought Catching Fire was retchid with the exception of the last 80 pages, and I thought Mockingjay was totally and completely mindblowing and revolutionary. And it almost feels like a trick - The Hunger Games draws you in, people either liked or dislaked Catching Fire (to me felt like a waste of time, a lot of repetition, boring) and then BAM in Mockingjay you're thrown into a very adult-themed book with the grusome side of war, the impossibility of finding a solution, the death and destruction everywhere, that neither side is necessarily good or bad and both sides are capable of doing terrible things, the mental deterioration of the people left behind... think about Haymitch, with his entire family killed. He's been living it for years.<br /><br />So, to conclude this rambly mess, you will not like or understand this book if you're not ready for it. You need to be the gamemaker and look at the book as a whole and not the separate parts.  We witnessed our beloved herion fall from grace because of all the trauma she experienced (trauma for her, entertainment for the capital and readers alike).  We watched as nations pulled tricks to destroy each other, when it turns out they were not nearly as different as presented.  Not one person came out unscathed.<br /><br/>One last thing. It honestly sickens me for people to be \\"demanding a rerewrite.\\" Just because you don't like or understand a book doesn't mean the author needs to rewrite it! Mockingjay was bigger than Katniss and her silly love triangle - it was what happens in war. When people FIGHT to change something UNJUST.... and The Hunger Games were just that! Think of how messed up all of the Victors were!!! Annie... the morphlings... Haymitch... a change was needed. And, people change. Gale's character has not \\"changed\\" - we barely new him before, but what we did know of him definitely set the precedent for how he acted.  Katniss was a big fish in a small pond.  She was lucky and resourceful in The Hunger Games, but when essentially blackmailed into being the Mockingjay in an attempt to save Peeta and her friends, she completely goes off the deep end. No matter what she does, she's a pawn. She will never be free. In the freedom fight she's not free, and it's not until she's tried and cast as a lunatic and sent back to 12 to live that she begins to rebuild a semblance of a life.<br /><br />This book was real. This book did not only not sugarcoat, it provided an inside look at real pain and loss.  If you threw up in Twilight when Jacob imprinted on Renesme... Rolled your eyes when Bella did that bubble thing and there was so final war... You will love this book. Even if you haven't understood a word of this review.
1932907009|5.0|At the urging of several members of the Nebraska Writers Workshop, this book was selected for review of screenwriting basics for our calendar of topics in 2012.  The late Blake Snyder presented a clear, concise overview of the essential creative tools any writer needs to pen a screenplay. Every guru of the film industry such as Field, McKee, Truby, Seger, Hunter, Hauge and Vogler explains a unique approach to cinematic storytelling, but Blake melded the many approaches in a tidy manner that can give even experienced screenwriters a succinct grasp of fundamentals.  SAVE THE CAT should be the first book any beginning screenwriter reads and the experienced periodically return to for clarification.

Have lost the weight I needed to.  Do the exercises.  Got the results pretty darn fast. Like the author says you only read what pertains to you and let the rest go. simple, no counting, no journaling....life is good! OH and you can have dry red or white wine daily.  If you like.

I used to take 'snapshots'... now I'm taking decent photos that even some of my professional photog friends say are quite good. He explains all the complexity of SLR photography in plain language, while telling readers exactly what settings he chose for each photo in the book and why. Invaluable. I also recommend his book [[ASIN:0817441816 Learning to See Creatively: Design, Color & Composition in Photography (Updated Edition)]]
B0034G4P9E|5.0|My favorite movie ever!!! Loved it more than any Rocky movie. One that is a must see.  The actors are tremendous. It is a story about two brothers, their father and their broken relationships.  The fighting is good, but the story behind the fighting is even better.  I am buying this movie.  It's one to watch again and again.
B002ZG9846|5.0|As most every movie fan can attest to there are times when high levels of anticipation can lead to eventual disappointment. Having read all the great early buzz for Kick-Ass I entered with the concern that this would be the case here. Those high expectations though turned out to be far exceeded. Kick-Ass is a fantastic blend of a comic book vibe with heavy action and explicit violence,  plenty of laughs, and genuine emotional pull.<br /><br />Kick-Ass, based on the Mark Miller comic book series, focuses on a teenager who wants to make a difference by becoming a superhero. This is the real world though, he has no training and there are no super powers involved. Aaron Johnson takes on the role of Dave aka \\"Kick-Ass\\" who gets into crime fighting. He discovers there are more people out there like him but he is in way over his head.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage is the biggest name involved in the film and he is terrific as \\"Big Daddy\\" both in how he delivers his lines and in his relationship with his daughter \\"Hit-Girl\\" played by Chloe Moretz. I really enjoyed her in one of my favorite movies from last year 500 Days of Summer but she is even better here in a much more significant role. Their back story and motivations drive much of the events of the film. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays \\"Red Mist\\" the son of a mob boss and Clark Duke appears in a subdued secondary role as a friend of Dave.<br /><br />Early on in Kick-Ass I was actually feeling a little concerned. It began in a juvenile-like comedic direction in setting up the character as he decided to become \\"Kick-Ass\\". Had it continued down that road it probably would have been enjoyable but nothing special. However it didn't take long until it really took off and I was hooked the rest of the way. The movie was able to remain funny while at the same time adding a gravity that captivated the audience.<br /><br />Much has been made of the extremely violent and very graphic nature of the film. Despite knowing this going in I was actually caught off guard on numerous occasions. Even after the first few instances it kept getting me and based on the crowd reaction it seemed to be the case for everyone. There was often a unique mix of laughter and surprised response at what had actually happened on screen.<br /><br />Throughout there is a very unpredictable nature which is incredibly refreshing. I enjoyed the absence of the usual cliches and in many cases events occured that I immediately noted as things that just don't happen in other movies. It accomplished a very real feel which fit perfectly with the general theme of the film.<br /><br />One of the scenes that culminates in an action sequence in the final third of the movie may be my favorite ever. I tried to temper my reaction to it but it was incredible and given my affection for action movies that will tell you the regard in which I'm holding this. The scene was extremely intense, creative, very well directed and edited. There was a great deal of emotion involved given the situation at the time that I was literally on the edge of my seat. The music during the scene fit perfectly and really added to the tense nature of what was happening. The score throughout film really stood out to me as exceptional.<br /><br />I felt a strong connection to the main character and his desire to do something more with his life. Who hasn't wanted to be a hero in some form or fashion? This emotional attachment to not just the characters but their plights was totally unexpected. In addition to that there was the distinct realization that these were all vulnerable people and that anything could happen at any time. The movie was actually really powerful and had that emotional edge that I had no idea would be present.<br /><br />Rarely would I push anyone to see a movie but with Kick-Ass I've actively campaigned for it. See it! It is gruesome, action packed, funny and powerful.s actually caught off guard on numerous occasions.

0312641893|5.0|As soon as I opened this book I knew it would be an all-time favourite. The main character, Cinder, drew me in immediately with her kind heart, humour and willingness to help others. I never thought this would be my kind of read - androids and space people? - but my goodness did Marissa Meyer blow my mind. Her clever world crafting and fully developed characters will leave you breathless and begging for more. Is it 2013 yet? Surely it can't be a whole year away... *sobs*  Living in New Beijing, Cinder is your futuristic Cinderella. She works as a skilled mechanic and, on her own, supports her family's lavish spending. With her evil step-mother and sisters, her family is unbearable and will make you shudder in anger, nervous fear and frustration. You'll be horrified by how much her mother's cruel and thoughtless actions affect the outcomes of the novel too! Your sympathy levels will be in overdrive as Cinder's thrown into the cruellest of situations and by the end, you'll definitely feel compelled to give this cyborg a metal-crushing hug. The novel comes alive through it's brilliant characters, whether heroic or evil, and is carried effortlessly by Meyer's imaginative writing. Cinder is filled with nerve-wrecking tension and action, making it a very addictive read. If you can put it down for even a second, I'll be very shocked!  Of course, this wouldn't be a Cinderella story without a Prince Charming. On a very typical day at her stall, Prince Kai of the Eastern Commonwealth stops by to drop off his android for repairs. It's through this first meeting that their lives intertwine and they become caught in a forbidden romance neither can walk away from. The world is in a pandemic, the currently incurable plague killing millions of humans and androids alike. Somehow, Cinder unwillingly gets involved with the testing, which guarantees an almost-certain death with countless unsuccessful vaccines. Through this experience, she learns shocking things about her true self andorigins, along with becoming a crucial part in the raging Earth/Lunar war. This brilliant cyberpunk will fascinate you with its intriguing mythology, mystery and thrilling action. Spot-on characters plus a fast-paced, yet intricate storyline? Don't pass out on me now! You have to stay conscious to enjoy the book!  Kai and Cinder have a very heart-warming relationship. Like every other good thing, it blossoms slowly and you can see how things develop between them every step of the way. As secrets about Cinder are revealed, their relationship only gets more dangerous. After Kai's father dies from the plague and he's slated to become the new Emperor, consorting with a non-human is the worst thing he can do. Add on Queen Levana, the brain-washing Lunar leader who's threatening to unleash a fatal war on Earth unless she's made Kai's wife, and Cinder is in for a wild journey. Will she be able to become Kai's beloved Queen at the ball or will Levana's evil plotting leave her dead?  This isn't a novel to read on a sunny afternoon to pass the time. No, Cinder's intense story is gripping and will have you enthralled for long after you've finished. The characters in this novel are at their best and, I promise, you'll feel honoured to have experienced the otherworldly level of amazing that is Cinder. Every element of this novel is just perfect! You'll want to get your hands on the sequel immediately afterwards so maybe you should chain yourself up before you go breaking into Meyer's house for it. Truly stunning and original, Cinder will appeal to every single type of reader and throw you into a imaginative world filled with endless possibilities.
B003PIUC02|5.0|The first season of Spartacus was fascinating it how it stumbled somewhat in its first 2-3 episodes but then really settled in and got better every single episode on through the finale. This is a powerful series - really strong imagery and graphic nature - and a story that takes some unexpected risks. It quickly became one of my favorite shows and then topped expectations with every episode. Highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great survival story through the worst of adversity.  Sure the times are generally tough day to day but they get so much worse without seeming that way to the people in the story.  Yet they never give up and find ways to try and understand each other and try to make things better.  The most compelling part of the book is the action game, which really is non-stop tension.  The way the story flows, discovering more about the players in the game through the action in the game is fascinating and makes the book hard to put down.
B0034G4P9E|3.0|Despite MMA's rising prominence it has generally been treated as an \\"underground\\" sport in films. That changes with Warrior, a movie that takes the familiar inspirational sports story with family conflict and intertwines that with an MMA tournament that carries large significance for the main characters. The fight action is authentic - though obviously some moments and results were played up for dramatic purposes - and in doing so it presents the sport in a legitimate fashion and one that translates well to the big screen.<br /><br />The story focuses on two brothers - one a Marine recently returned to the US (Tom Hardy) and the other a High School physics teacher (Joel Edgerton) - who for their own reasons return to MMA training and eventually find themselves entered in a high profile winner take all tournament pitting 16 of the best middleweights in the world. A family split years ago has left them at odds with each other as well as their father (Nick Nolte).<br /><br />It's somewhat unfortunate that the culmination with the two brothers facing each other in the finals was used to market the film, as that takes away some of the suspense, but most would have assumed it would reach that point anyway. Still it's the emotional journey that will click with audiences rather than discovery of the end result and in that regard it is successful.<br /><br />There will be a few elements that need some suspension of disbelief. The viability of a 16 man tournament over two nights in a world dominated by UFC, the contrivances in how these two relative unknowns make the tournament to begin with, and one of them remaining a crowd favorite despite a late revelation are just a couple of them. The fight announcers are also annoying in how they constantly disparage the two. We get it. They're underdogs.<br /><br />Despite all those things Warrior is quite powerful in its depiction of the family's struggle to reconcile and the circumstances of each individual character. The performances are excellent - don't be surprised to see a few names like Nolte getting nominated this award season. The decision made by the brothers has sent them down completely different paths and that is well portrayed. Kurt Angle even makes an appearance as an imposing Russian presence (seemed to be a take on Fedor Emelianenko) and he pulls off the role quite well despite not having a single word of dialogue.<br /><br />Though it leaves some story threads unresolved Warrior is a satisfying film that is deserving of the accolades it has received. While I didn't find it to be \\"Best Picture\\" worthy I would put it on the same level as last year's The Fighter. The strong performances outweigh the story and the MMA action is refreshing given that boxing-themed films have been the staple of the inspirational sports stories for so long.o see a few names like Nolte getting nominated this award season.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|Dormant since the third entry in the series arrived in 2006 - that one helmed by J.J. Abrams garnered good audience and critical response - Mission: Impossible returns and with rookie live-action director Brad Bird of Pixar fame. What materializes is arguably the best of the franchise delivering some tremendous action sequences coupled with a credible story that elevates it beyond just being a series of incredibly impressive set pieces.<br /><br />When IMF is framed for the bombing of the Kremlin - four agents including Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must go underground to stop a plot to beget nuclear war while also clearing their names. Hunt is joined by the returning Benji (Simon Pegg) and newcomers Jane (Paula Patton) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner).<br /><br />Bird shows incredible skill at framing fight scenes and providing some beautiful shots of locales. Being set in Russia, Dubai, and India allowed for plenty of opportunity to capture some great looking footage. The scenes with Hunt on the outside of the Burj Khalifa building were so anxiety-ridden that I almost got uncomfortable watching. That might be partially due to knowing that Cruise was actually hanging out there doing his own stunts and that it wasn't CGI - regardless it goes to show just how much impact the film had in delivering an intense experience through its action and sense of suspense which carried through to the other scenes as well.<br /><br />Ghost Protocol leans heavily on Cruise who delivers an outstanding performance - an example of his undeniably strong screen presence that shines through more here than maybe ever before. The others do well also in their roles - Patton in particular was subdued in a way that typically isn't reserved for the \\"sexy\\" lead female.<br /><br />If there is any area that falls somewhat flat it is some of the attempts at humor - which are handled in a subtle enough manner that any misses didn't hurt the film. What the lighter dialogue did do was provide some levity and a chance to breathe in what was practically non-stop adrenaline pumping action from start to finish. There is also a human touch to the story and the relationships between the characters. I particularly liked the ending - which wrapped things up in a very satisfying fashion that went beyond what one would expect out of a typical action movie.<br /><br />Several scenes were shot with IMAX cameras - for those who have a (real) IMAX theater nearby it's definitely worth paying extra for. The visceral nature of those scenes are amplified greatly.<br /><br />Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is one of the best action films in recent years.

B004LWZW4W|4.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes may be the first film of the summer that has surpassed reasonable expectations and delivered a completely compelling story along with amazing special effects and credible suspense. Make no mistake this is anything but a cheap capitalization on a known franchise but instead works exceptionally well as a standalone movie that will leave audiences hoping that the journey can continue beyond the satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />The story begins with a geneticist (James Franco) who is working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease with testing being done on chimps. A breakthrough is made when one in particular shows signs of greatly increased intelligence however due to an incident the test subjects are eliminated except for a baby that Franco's character secretly takes home and raises with his Alzheimer's suffering father. They name him Caesar and the relationships built are genuine and provide that connection so critical in order to increase the impact of events later in the film.<br /><br />The drug that was given to the apes in the lab was passed on to Caesar through his mom. Eventually he outgrows the domestic situation and his protective instincts take over which results in him being forced into a sanctuary and amongst other apes - a foreign situation considering he had only lived with humans and never had any interaction with his own species. After a rough start there he begins the revolution by uniting the apes and leading an escape.<br /><br />Caesar is very much the lead character in the movie, and though Franco's character provides an emotional attachment and the presence that ties the developments together and lead Caesar down his path, it's quite possible that not a single human character's name will be remembered. They take a backseat to Caesar and the apes who are fascinating to watch not just in their actions but in the way they can deliver their emotions, thoughts, and communicate without needing dialogue to do so.<br /><br />That is a huge credit to Andy Serkis who once again comes through with amazing performances that were captured and then animated over. There is no understating how fantastic the special effects for the apes are and how important that is - it would be much more difficult to sympathize with their plights otherwise. It's always appreciated when a film can place the audience in a position where they have to question what side they are actually rooting for because all those involved can justify their actions in some form or fashion.<br /><br />Though it works completely on its own there are also some great callbacks to the Planet of the Apes of the past. One in particular is somewhat distracting but is followed by probably the most powerful moment in the film so it can't be faulted for that too much. Fans of the prior installments will appreciate all of those instances otherwise.<br /><br />The movie is most surprising in its sincerity as it provides a compelling character study of Caesar. Beyond that it could leave audiences questioning the morality of testing and the general perception of other species as humans sit atop of the food chain - thankfully it never preaches on any of those subjects however. By challenging the audience and leaving them invested in the outcome, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the most satisfying film this summer has had to offer.once again comes through with amazing performances that were captured and then animated over.

B004A8ZWWE|5.0|Real Steel will likely be described by many as \\"Rocky with robots\\" and that isn't too far off from the central themes that drive the emotions and plot developments. What the film does really well though is balance a family dynamic with the robot boxing action - blending the typical inspirational sports story with a futuristic scenario and relatable characters. It's brilliantly handled and leads to some of the most crowd-pleasing moments I've ever experienced in theater - creating the disctinctly rare desire to see it multiple times.<br /><br />The story takes place in 2020 and centers on Charlie (Hugh Jackman), a down-on-his-luck former boxer turned robot fighter who has to take care of his 11 year old son Max for the summer. The two come across an underdog in a \\"sparring bot\\" named Atom who they fix up, train, and fight as they climb the ranks into the established WRB (World Robot Boxing) league.<br /><br />Though it started a little slow, in establishing the circumstances for Charlie, once Atom is discovered it picks up steam and delivers every step of the way. One of few things taken issue with is how he is handed over his son for the summer even though he never showed any capacity to take care of him despite having custody rights. Overlooking that though it made for the effective element of the two getting to know each other through their shared experiences and how Atom inspired something in them both as well as others. Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) anchors Charlie as a reminder of where he came from and that leads to additional pay-off at the end.<br /><br />Pleasantly surprising is how restrained the futuristic elements are presented - everything was plausible and as though it could have realistically evolved out of today's technology. The robots were certainly advanced but it was interesting to see how they had changed from generation to generation. The top dog in WBR is suitably intimidating as are some of the other foes met along the way. They basically have their own personalities.<br /><br />The fights are exceptionally well choreographed and entertaining and that is probably due in large part to bringing in Sugar Ray Leonard to be a consultant on the boxing scenes. These are of course robots but given that they're controlled by humans and in some circumstances regulated by league rules the fights don't just make for a free-for-all but instead tell a story. That is especially important for how Charlie integrates some of his personality into Atom through the training and in-ring strategy.<br /><br />I was completely invested in what was happening on screen. I can't recall ever reacting in the manner that I did at this film for another - applauding and fist pumping at certain moments and cringing from the abuse dealt out during fight scenes. It was also quite funny throughout and it had an excellent score.<br /><br />Full of genuine moments between characters, fantastic robot fighting sequences, and a good number of laughs - Real Steel will have appeal for all audiences. Far more than just a robot boxing film it generates some real emotion and is completely satisfying in its crowd-pleasing nature. Rarely do I make blanket recommendations but I will do so here. Real Steel is a must-see film. You'll be missing out on a great experience otherwise.ights are exceptionally well choreographed and entertaining and that is probably due in large part to bringing in Sugar Ray Leonard to be a consultant on the boxing scenes.

B0018RKELY|5.0|You got to hand it to Green Day, Billy Joe and company obviously did their homework, both here and on their follow-up 21th Century rock opera, in researching and mining the past and re-inventing it in wonderfully new, inventive ways with the unique Green Day stamp on it.  Even though all of these songs are derivative, and would easily have fit on any Moldie Oldie radio stations without raising any eyebrows, many would also fit on any Green Day album, even the first punked-out Dookie, and no one would recognize they were \\"just\\" an homage to the past.  I think this just shows the universality of music, and the old adage that the more things change, the more they stay the same.  I always felt the Sex Pistols were alot like the Stooges, who were alot like the 13th Floor Elevators, who were alot like Question Mark and the Mysterians, and not THAT different from Gene Vincent (ad infinitum).  That is, rock is evolutionary and revolutionary all at once, and as long as it rocks out, who cares?  Like Duke Ellington's famous quote that there were only two kinds of music: good and bad.  It's a fun game trying to figure out which famous sixties rock songs Green Day, alias Foxboro, re-invents here, both their words and music chime down the dusty corridors of time and reflect all kinds of ancient influences:  the early Rolling Stones, early Who, the Monkees, Paul Revere and the Raiders, the Standells, the Seeds, the Blues Magoos, the McCoys and Question Mark echo throughout these punked-out power pop delights, but also moody, dreamy groups like the Zombies and Beau Brummels in that wonderfully evocative \\"Dark Side of Night\\".  Even the album graphics (STEREO on the cover, the blurb about Stereo playing on mono phonographs on the back, the cover graphics inspired by a 1964 Beatles Vee-Jay album, the psychedelic lettering in their name - this is the definitive Sixties homage creation, although hot tubs weren't real popular in the sixties guys, that came a little later, sorry, you can't get everything perfect, you weren't born yet).  Thanks, Green Day, for making this sixties punk homage so much FUN!  I don't care what anybody says, I love Green Day in all its permutations because these guys love what they do and we are lucky enough to be able to enjoy it all with them.  It will probably never happen (I think they'll take on Lounge Lizard music next, they've threatened to on several tiki hut numbers in the past, maybe they'll call themselves the Surf Astro-Nuts or something), but I'd sure like to see these Foxboro Hot Tubs go back down to that Ruby Room with another sixties punk album as good as this one!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I have always been a fan of Nicholas Sparks, but this book is now one of my favorites! It was so different from what I expected, Sparks is an amazing writer, but a lot of his books have a common theme.  This book had that theme as well, but it was still so completely different, unlike anything he has written before. But in a good way. If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, definitely add this book to your collection!!
B003L77GGK|4.0|I bought this dvd set with the anticipation of not liking it as much as the first 5 seasons, because my expectations were so high. To be fair, it's very hard to top releasing Lucifer from Hell and stopping the end of the world. I remember feeling a bit disappointed, just a little bit, when watching the episodes new on tv. However, when I went back and watched them again on dvd, for some reason, I found it a lot more entertaining than I remember.<br /><br />The problems with this season, in my opinion, are that the characters and plot seem to take a while to catch on. For example, seeing Grandpa Campbell was cool, but all of his other hunter relatives were killed off before we could figure out why we should care about them. The show spent many weeks building up the new villain, Eve, only to kill her off suddenly in a somewhat questionable way by Dean. Supernatural fell into the same trap that Smallville did when they spent all season building up Doomsday, then rapidly got rid of him in an unsatisfying way after a very short confrontation. The biggest problem with this season, really, is that the plot spun its wheels for so long. Too many questions, not enough answers. In season 5, the mission was clear from the start: fight Lucifer, stop the apocolypse. Clear enough. This time around, not so much.<br /><br />So, having said all that, there was a whole lot of good stuff in this season as well. First and foremost is Jensen Ackle's directing in \\"Weekend at Bobby's.\\" That was a very good episode. Seeing Sam and Dean as babysitters was funny, and I am one of the ones who loved \\"The French Mistake.\\" It's great when a show can poke fun at itself like that, and I hope they do another one like this. I also liked Dean as a reaper for 24 hours. And, as for my title quote, when Dean blows up a rock to get at a dragon-slaying sword, he mumbled that line as he was wiring up the explosives, and that just cracked me up.<br /><br />Looking ahead to Season 7, from what we have seen so far, it seems that the show anticipated my gripes, because we have a clear mission from the beginning once again: stop the leviathans from conquering the Earth. It looks very promising so far.w anticipated my gripes, because we have a clear mission from the beginning once again: stop the leviathans from conquering the Earth. It looks very promising so far.

B0060AY6FO|5.0|I ordered the book without reading a synopsis, because it is James and I will read any and all James, whatever she chooses to give us.  I was a little disappointed initially to realize it was not a Dalgliesh novel, but rapidly became immersed in the P&P world.  As someone who has read much of, but not studied, Austen, and who is generally suspicious of modern day attempts to recreate her world and her characters, I found James' version of both to be very satisfying.  The murder felt period-appropriate and while I figured out how the murder was committed (and by whom) fairly early on, she did a fine job of creating suspense, particularly at the trial.  I haven't come across any modern authors who were as capable of skillfully recreating Austen as James, and I will be happy to read this book again.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I have been a fan of the Mission Impossible movies since the first one and I have enjoyed them all. I must say that I liked the third Mission Impossible much better. Ghost Protocol was simply an action film with some cool stunts and scenes and zero story. There was not a point in the movie which I didn't see coming around the next corner. Most of the best scenes were in the trailer and I kept waiting for a twist that never came.<br /><br />I did not see this movie in IMAX, although I'm sure it would have made the movie visually more entertaining, though it still would be lacking in story. It was your basic fun action flick. Tom Cruse did well as usual as well as the rest of the cast. Everyone did a great job and made the movie a lot of fun to watch. But again, story was lacking in my opinion. There was a thing with his wife, which never really materialized into a good twist or story. It was just confusing and we really didn't figure out what really happened until the very very end. Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker) did a great job as well as Paula Patton (D&eacute;j&agrave; vu) and Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead). Michael Nyqvist (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Swedish version) was a nice surprise role, as I didn't know he was in this.<br /><br />I must say that the locations and scenes were well thought out and take us out of the usual locations in many movies. That was one of the most interesting aspects of the film; the locations. Another fun aspect of the film was the team's gadgets and gizmos. There are many times in the film where their gadgets don't work as well as planned and greatly add tension and a bit of thrill to the situation.<br /><br />Over-all it is a very good action flick with a little less of a story than one would have hoped. Yes I love action, however action mixed in with twists and character development is always more fun. In the theater there were times when everyone laughed and other times where everyone cringed as they watched Tom Cruse climb the exterior of at glass building or drive around in a sand storm. It is a fun movie and I do recommend a watch, however don't expect to be blown away by the average nearsighted story or the silly sweet ending. Watch it for the action and suspense and leave your thinking caps at home.round in a sand storm.

B005MYEPXC|4.0|Spending some time overseas and being a fan of Woody Allen, I immediately was attracted to Midnight in Paris. Woody Allen is a master of emotional directing. Every movie of his has warmth that many directors seem to leave out or forget about. His movies are very real and we don't doubt what is happening, no matter what the situation is. He captures the character and finds ways for the viewer to relate and contrast to ourselves and what we've wanted or how we've felt.<br /><br />Midnight in Paris is a very simple movie. As like other Woody Allen films you must be open minded and not get too wrapped up in scientific fact. Simply enjoy the film. This movie is very well designed and simply has a wonderful flow to it which makes it quite pleasing to the audience. I never really reached a slow down-point in this film where I was simply waiting for it to end. I was hooked from the beginning and was very fascinated throughout the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is very nice looking and has a soft warm tone on the spectrum. This greatly complements the movie, as a cold sharp picture would completely have ruined the feel. The audio is clear however not as crisp as it could have been. Most of the movie is dialogue with times of music or simply sounds of the Parisian streets.<br /><br />A very fun, highly recommended film. Art history buffs will love it, however everyday viewers will find it informative and interesting. Worth a rent at the very least. I am quite happy to have this in my collection.
031603441X|5.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Richards' \\"Life\\".  It was very \\"musical\\" in the way that Keith expressed himself, his cadence and phrasing, how he talked about music, and how the story was told.  (And huge props to James Fox for his editing - he kept Keith's voice intact but put things in order, eliminating repetition, and keeping it coherent (sorry, Keith - I don't think you could have done that. ))  Of course it's an autobiography so he wouldn't make himself look bad, but I thought he was very honest and straightforward - his commitment was always to the music and the band.  And despite what a lot of the reviews said, I don't think he trashed Mick that much - he gave Mick his due as many times as he busted his chops over his celebrity ways and LVS tendencies.    If you have any interest in the Stones, this is well worth the read.

B004WJREMW|5.0|This is not the starting place for someone unfamiliar with McCartney's solo work. This is a strange, largely experimental album that McCartney recorded entirely on his own. It is self-indulgent, often aimless, and padded with throwaway tracks. That said, as a diehard McCartney fan I have grown to really love this album for the quirky mess it is.   Don't expect a gigantic leap in sonic quality from the original CD release. The somewhat muddy, dull sound must be inherent in the master tapes because this reissue still sounds basically the same. Luckily this hasn't been made a victim of the 'loudness war' and doesn't seem overcompressed at all. There is a bit richer bass end to the remaster that gives it a nice full sound. But the remaster isn't revelatory.  The bonus disc is a great treasure trove of weirdness for fans.  Again, casual fans will probably be perplexed by this mix of oddities.  The remixed \\"Coming Up\\" Live at Glasgow is fine, but unfortunately the original single mix is curiously absent. The 1986 mix - heavily overdubbed - of \\"Blue Sway\\" is a little too smooth sounding. The real gems are the album outtakes. I was surprised to find four of them grouped together as two medleys, but it really isn't a problem. \\"Mr H Atom\\" and \\"All You Horseriders\\" are two of the most bizarre things McCartney has committed to tape (that the public has heard anyway).  \\"Bogey Wobble\\" is a strangely fascinating intstrumental. The original \\"Blue Sway\\" sports a nice, simple funky groove. \\"Check My Machine\\" and \\"Secret Friend\\" are here - they were originally bonus tracks on the first CD of this album.  If you enjoy McCartney's Fireman albums, particularly the most recent \\"Electric Arguments,\\" I highly recommend \\"McCartney II.\\" If you're already a fan of the album, this two disc version is well worth the upgrade for the official release of the oft-bootlegged outtakes. If you're a superfan of the album, splurge on the deluxe version (which adds a DVD with a fascinating 1980 McCartneyinterview, among other tidbits, and also a third CD with unedited, previously unreleased versions of numerous album cuts).

B005UKJX4E|5.0|I had no notion of what to expect going into this movie when I purchased the blu-ray, at first I found myself slightly confused at the unusual narrative of this film.  However, once things started rolling along what I found was something I can only describe as pure magic.  The moments involving the kids are shot in such a way that it made me feel like I was young again, it filled me with beautiful nostalgia in a way that no movie has ever had the power to do so.  I realize from the reviews that people expected something much more normal, or contemporary, however looking at this film from a different perspective I find that it is a story that forces one to ask questions, such as \\"Why should I be good, when you aren't?\\" Something I find very profound in relation to God and being someone who has struggled with religion throughout my life, very relatable. Overall I found this movie to be very beautiful, and has stuck with me days after watching it.  I could see how it is not going to be for everyone, I'm just glad I found it.

B005FMZWD8|5.0|This Invicta Men's watch is fantastic!! Finally a watch designed with a left handed person in mind!! The dials are on the \\"right\\" side for a change.<br /><br />I really like the design of the Invicta too. The watch face really pops, and is very easy to read. I like too that it comes with a durable cloth strap, as opposed to one of those arm-hair grabbing metal bands. The 1513 I Force is really an eye-catcher. I've gotten so many compliments wearing this out and about. As an added bonus, the purple color fits in perfectly when sporting my Baltimore Ravens jerseys during \\"Purple Fridays\\".<br /><br />The I Force must be a pretty tough watch as well. The UPS driver dropped this off at my house the week before Christmas. For some reason he placed it behind the snow shovels, and a rake I keep by my side door. I didn't even realize the watch had arrived until I was taking down my Christmas decorations on New Year's Day. That means the Invicta was sitting outside in near zero temps with rain and snow for over a week. I popped it out of the box and it was ticking along just fine, and showing the correct time right out of the packaging.<br /><br />A solid, sturdy and beautiful timepiece, highly recommended.

B002JCSWV6|2.0|I really enjoy movies with Morgan Freeman in them and I do enjoy sports films. However, I could not get into this one, the movie did an excellent job showing the power struggle going on in South Africa and how somewhat of a little thing like changing the colors and a name for a rugby team could really make a difference.  However, I've never played rugby before and no little about the sport or the rules that are played so it was a little confusing and while you are trying to take time to figure things out you miss part of what is going on in the movie. I think it would have been better if they somehow incorporated rugby rules into the movie.

B000M341QE|5.0|The acting that is done in this movie is terrific! You have crooked cops in the movie, going close to the top. You have cops trying to infiltrate the mob and yes, even a triangle of love. I enjoyed all the main actors, Baldwin and Wahlberg did an excellent job as cops that were just horrible to everyone in the movie and Di Caprio did excellent as playing a man who kept getting beat down.   This is a movie that is going to keep you entertained. The ending could have been differently but I didn't see that part coming on, not that it was intelligent.

0805047905|2.0|I almost always read reviews before buying, but Santa forgot to get this for my daughter who is almost 3. She has speech delay, and while she can't read yet, I agree that the words should appear with the correct animal (ie. I see a red bird looking at me should appear on the page with the red bird). But I also miss that is does not say \\"Mother, Mother....\\" it instead says, \\"Teacher, Teacher....\\" Okay, so a dad could be reading it, and I know some  kids don't have a Mother, but, if we are talking about keeping it a classic, then it should stay a classic in that respect too. There are lots of books that are about a father and if I were reading to my child (I am a mother) I'd still read it as father. I think I will write in it to fix it. I have done that with many, many books.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|If you're not into history, Christianity or politics, then this film probably isn't for you.<br />If you are, then this film is pretty much definitive of its class in being the story of how one man can, within his lifetime, achieve something noble and leave the world in a far better place than if he'd never existed.<br /><br />Though it is quite a predictable plot - starting with his friendship with [[ASIN:0007147201 William Pitt the Younger]] and ending with his success in banning the slave trade - the film maker has done his best to take slightly different tangents, such as including hymnwriter John Newton and making his lesser known wife and William Pitt into central charactors in the tale.<br />With these charactors, it is also worth mentioning that the actors chosen are generally first rate, and the script they're given doesn't have any special howlers within it.<br /><br />In being a story that is as well-known as this one, it would be easy to get this film totally wrong. Just imagine a story of Martin Luther King to see how wrong it could go (e.g. doing a 'postmodern perspective' or, conversely, sucking up to his legacy).<br />But as I sit here in the aftermath of the film, it feels like the first time I'd seen [[ASIN:B00003CX95 Braveheart]] - the movie may not be perfect, but the bagpipes linger on, as does the spirit of the film.<br /><br />So even if your normal films include [[ASIN:B002ZG999U The Expendables]] or [[ASIN:B0009UC7H0 Sahara]] (i.e big budget and simple), do give this a go as it is truly a rewarding film, and not just some exercise in evangelism or boring politics. As a non-believer and B-movie junky, I can honestly say that this film is well worth watching, even if its only to make you a better person.<br /><br />P.S. I forgot to mention that the reason I watched this film, was because of this pamphlet: [[ASIN:1905887116 Wilberforce: The Challenge for Today]]. Well worth a read, if you want to know more about Wilberforce and have a spare 30 minutes...

Bottom line, if you enjoy Solitaire you can't go wrong with this app.

For 2 out of the last three years when I get to the end a reading plan it doesn't allow me to complete the plan but stops at 99.7 or 99.8 percent even though I read the whole Bible according to the plan.  I say cross platform integration because I've read it on an iPhone, Android phone, Android tablet, and my laptop all three years.  After (many) unsuccessful attempts with their support I gave up and deleted the plan from my account unfinished (according to them).  And now for 2011 it happened again!  Argghh.... I've never heard a word about it from them as far as fixes go and there was no followup.  Other than that one thing I'd sill call this one of the best apps out there.
