B009NY43NY|5.0|This series of books is my favorite that I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I just can't put them down. I felt like this was a good conclusion to the series.
B004026QU2|5.0|I love these! They're perfect for the summer and they go with jut about every outfit! Love them for my 2 year old
1594744475|5.0|Colorful pictures, tips on how to color foods and shape foods, loads of fun to read or just to look at and useful too.  I especially like that they list ideas for substitutions if you aren't especially fond of an ingredient.<br />We really enjoy this book and will use it often.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I feel like I Love the characters but it takes forever for anything to rest happen in this book but something keeps me coming back I already bought the third.
B000E6ET1G|1.0|Received this CD and put in to play.  It sounded like it had been recorded from a dirty 3301/3 LP and faded in an out and that was only the first song. The rest were just static.  I sent the CD back and was immediately refunded my purchase price. While I rated the produce one star,  I RATE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH FIVE STARS.
B005FVNJTS|2.0|First off, let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Nadal.<br /><br />However, that being said, the book did not appeal to me.<br /><br />The writing style was very unfitting for the tennis player and tried to portray him as a humble, down-to-earth person with a great personality but failed!<br /><br />It emphasised greatly on the fact that he is humble and that was repeated from the beginning to the end and this did not teach me anything about his character other than he's a humble human being.<br /><br />So, overall, I would only recommend this passable book to die-hard Nadal fans who have a little cash to spare.
1594481717|5.0|It's a while since I've used this book (as a classroom resource in a communication course), so this will not be a detailed review. But use it I did, not as a textbook for students who were already overloaded with reading, but as a lecture element that provided perspective on thinking about...well, thinking as well as communication &#34;messaging.&#34; As such, I found it quite valuable. I also enjoyed as a general-reader book.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|YOU MADE ME WASTE MT MONEY MAKING ME THINK THEIR WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.SAME AS THE ONLY 1 YOU PUT OUT,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
B007CIQ4B2|4.0|He has an unusual voice.  His song lyrics are expressive and poetic.  This cd is worth listening to.  Take a chance.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Another razon to keep enjoing this great artist. excellent songs performance by a very beautiful voice. Whatever album of Josh Groban is recommend it.
193700788X|1.0|Shocked!! There is a book #13? I'm 100% sure the series ended with book #10... or at least, that's how I'm going to remember it since Ms Harris stopped writing the \\"true\\" Southern Vampire Series when she wrote that one. The last 3 books have been pretty much fluff to meet her contract requirements.<br /><br />Long live Sookie & Eric.
B003KK6GOQ|4.0|Couldn't put it down, what a lovely book.<br />I didn't think I would like reading a book designed in letter form, it was enchanting and a felt connected with all the characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app :D minecraft is the best game I ever bought.<br />I would recommend this app for everyone<br />LOVE THIS APP
B00992CF6W|4.0|Runs pretty smooth, but it sometimes it freezes. It takes up a lot of memory but I think it's well worth it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|intense brain challenging game. great graphics. smooth soothing zen like music. will go back and try to redo some levels. highly recommended to those who love intelligent challenging game.
145162445X|3.0|Certainly an intersting book but the author is obsessed with \\"proving\\" that God does not exist.  Of course, though claiming victory in this endevour, he fails and the very interesting physics is, as usual, quite neutral on the issue.  That the instability of nothing caused there to be something does not prove that the Cosmos needs no other causes anymore than the truth of cosmic and biological evolution proves this negative.  One often wonders why a scientist would so want to prove this anyway.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved the game! free version was short so you have to purchase full version for a few bucks but worth it.
1451695195|5.0|The description of the author's journey was compelling, unusual and vivid, giving me renewed faith in the continuance of one's spirit!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is everything you could want in a light tablet game.  It really takes the fun and imagination of CCGs and brings then to life.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|The protagonist continues to tell the story of his life. The adventures compels the reader to keep turning pages. But, a large portion of the book continues to dwell on his relationship with a broken girlfriend. I found myself just skimming these chapters, rather than reading. Maybe this would appeal to fans of romance novels. It doesn't work for me.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|There's a lot of Michael Jackson in these songs, and I mean that in a good way. Old school R&B sounds are found throughout, making you want to dance or &#34;get it on&#34; Al Green style. Songs like &#34;Natalie&#34; and &#34;Gorilla&#34; show a dirty, aggressive edge to Mars that I hadn't heard in previous CDs. You see him snarling as he drags a woman off by her hair, and it works.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|The protagonist is introduced ans begins to tell his life story. Something has obviously happened to change him. His early adventures are capture the reader and makes the book hard to put down.<br />The story telling and writing is a cut above most Sci-Fi novels.
B000OBYLVO|1.0|You know the script and direction are weak when talented actors like Kate Winslet and Jack Black give performances straight out of a children's TV special. Every possible moment for a decent laugh is written in the most prosaic way. To compensate for the only semi-developed characters and obvious plot, they make it super long, as though a scene can be enhanced by dragging it out.<br /><br />Confession: I've watched it a couple times because the fantasy of meeting Jude Law in an English cottage is sometimes irresistible, no matter how dully portrayed.<br /><br />I recommend this as a generic, safe romantic tale where the sex scenes are rated G and the kids and old people are super cute. Wait, is that not a recommendation?
B008OOYALE|2.0|After playing several other games like this, including Dragonvale, this game is hard to understand and lunky to get around.  I uninstalled it within just a few days.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|There's a slightly unkempt quality about these songs that offset the highly electronic/digital nature of her music. No lyric or melody is too &#34;smooth&#34; or predictable, keeping it interesting and leaving you noticing a new layer every time you listen. As other reviewers have said, you listen again and again. &#34;My Blood&#34; is my favorite track.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I don't think I will ever get sick of this album. I have listened to the whole thing through no less than 20 times, and I'm still going strong.
1451648537|5.0|This was my first time purchasing a used like new book and it was in great condition, it was a book I been wanting<br />to read----and the price was right---Thanks Amazon.<br />Mary
B00847KFDS|5.0|Thank you John for enriching my life with your timeless music.  And thank you Julie for sharing John with his adoring fans.  And I understand this album was your idea.  Thank you thank you thank you!  Your sons are quite talented, I know you are proud.  I was astonished when I played the CD because it is such a great take on your songs, plus I love your 2 new songs too.<br /><br />The best way to listen to this album is to crank the volume all the WAY UP!  Great smokin guitar riffs all through the album!  Now, if I get to see you in concert again this year, I can die happy.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|great family oriented game to play with your children, we had lots of fun playing it.  Child gets to be creative.
B000OVLINI|4.0|The story was dark, which is plus. Well crafted prose and there's a character called Fermin in the book, and he alone pretty much brings the book from 6/10 to 8/10, love that character. Ending felt bit weak IMO but overall it was enjoyable ride.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to play when communiting, my children play it as well.  I have it on my Kindle and cell phone.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I love all the songs on this. They are all different and wonderful. The item came exactly when it was expected.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|This app is great, like I said in the title, since you can tell whats taking the power, but I noticed something. This app takes power to run, not just on the screen, but even if it's off. Sadly I don't want something draining my power, so I removed this app.
B0000C83YJ|5.0|Even after all these years, the guys still sound great. It is amazing how well the songs have held up over the years.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Took me 4 or 5 listens but now I'm really, really liking this album.  I'm not sure there's anything here that touches Children of the Grave or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, but most of it's close and not a bad song on the album (deluxe edition).  After all this time I personally couldn't have asked for anything more.  5 stars.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|i'd give it 5 stars but there's only a few ways i can test this before i cut up my fingers. it works great, shipped fast in perfect condition. price was great, i do think maybe would have been better if the housing was some kind of metal. maybe was made in plastic to help keep weight down for use in feild like camping, hiking though.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Have a mahjong set of tiles and have played for years. This app is every bit as good as the original lacking only the wonderful tactile feel of playing with the cool and silky smooth tiles. The music and sound effects go a long way towards making up for that. If I could give it 6 stars I would.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I did a marathon of all 3 seasons over a 5 day period, so I love them all. If you like drama, this is great.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|really like the game everyone should like it challenge and fun keep your interested and it is hard to come up with more words
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|We initially downloaded the free version then we bought the full version. My 3 yr old loves this app! Great for learning the alphabet
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very fun. You build you own city. It starts out slow but then it gets very fun and addicting. Im always checking on mine. You should definitely download this.
B000EWBKLC|5.0|I had my original Saw stolen and this was my replacement. Product came in on time in new condition, played flawlessly in my player I would recommended sellar to friends.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I needed some great family movies so ordered this as it is one of the best ever made and fun for all ages.
0792162803|5.0|If you like old time Saturday Night Live - this movie is excellent. Molly Shannon and Will Ferrell deliver funny characters. Both characters are warped in some form or another.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|I needed some great family movies so ordered this as it is one of the best ever made and fun for all ages.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|The message in this movie was great! History repeats it's self. absolute power corrupts absolutely! just a great story all around, long but worth it,
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I am so disappointed this is not the end........ The next book I hope is a little more exciting as this story line is getting boring and expensive for those buying out of USA.
B008PZYZH6|5.0|I really liked the Indiana jones style this movie portrayed. And Steve Zahn is super awesome! (But Penelope Cruz isn't)
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved it read it in 3 days!! Couldn't put it down! Almost non stop action just absolutely perfect for me!
B008NR8YXC|5.0|This is pure music, sheer genius. Schiff plays it that way, without frills or augmentation. He is a consummate musician. These exercises for as young musician -who could imagine a fledgling musician playing pieces this difficult today?--are consummate music, like flowing water, melodic and rhythmic, alternating simple starts with complex follow-up. Both the first and the second sets of this collection, written at different times, consist of preludes followed by fugues related by the key in which they are played. Paired pieces progress from one key to the next until the harmonic cycle is done with.  (A modern exercise in the same is Vladimir Ashkenazy's recording of Shostakovich's 24 Preludes and Fugues.)<br /><br />Bach's compositions were written not for piano but for clavichord but adjustments like Schiff's as to instrument were common even in Bach's time.  Bach wrote in a time when no keyboard instrument had damper pedals. Sustaining a note and damping sound were a matter of how adroit the performer was with the pressure of his fingers on the keys. Schiff respects that.  He admits to using pedals discretely in one piece which, he argues, was originally composed for organ, and thus needs the sustained line use of the damping pedal ensures. For the rest, he uses pedals to spread notes but rarely and lightly, relying instead on touch on the keyboard.<br /><br />Schiff is a brilliant pianist, who has shown earlier his affinity with Bach. This album -four CDs--all of both books of Clavier--is exquisite. Listening to it is like entering a new, rarified world.<br /><br />The recording is by ECM so of course it's crystal clear. I know of no other label, not even Deutsche Grammophon, that pays as close attention to the quality of the sound in its recording.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The book was good but it dragged on in some parts and I just wanted to finish just to see what would happen. There was some good parts but I wasn't like dying to read the book. It was an easy read though.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|First off, I'd like to say that I've gone short on sleep  the past few nights mainly due to this game.  This game is perfect for those that have little time to play (despite the allure of &quot;just one more run) but want to achieve something in a game as opposed to simply waste time.  Every run of the dungeon gives you necessary resources for improving your gear or character.  The objective of the game is simply to get 10000000 points, and you achieve this by running through a dungeon and making a match of the type of tiles you need to clear the obstacle your character runs into (ie weapons for monsters or keys for doors).  The longer you run, the more points, exp, gold, rocks, and wood you get via making matches.  Exp improves your character, rocks and wood open up new upgrade rooms in your castle, and gold buys said upgrades for your gear.  While the game lasted only 3.5 hours, it is one of the few I will keep on my phone after completing.  I hate match 3 games, but this is one of the most innovative and fun games I have played on a smartphone.
B00AK57N00|4.0|fun little game. helps pass the time while in a line. I got it on the amazon app of the day for free but totally worth 99 cents.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|This was a good picture and I would recommend it but you do want to see the first and third movies.  Unfortunately, the 3rd is no longer available for rent.  If you can, see the Hobbit first and it makes more sense as you move through the 3 Lord of the Rings.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|i absolutely loved it, and im  totally addicted,cant wait until season 3 is available to buy,follows the brook pretty close
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I like Tom Cruise but I am not that keen on action movies.  But this one has some nice humorous twists.  I don't know why it was not better received.  I also heard that Tom does not fit the physical description of the book version of Jack Reacher, but I thought he fit the character well, considering all the action movies he has done in the past.  Great movie, interesting plot, and good characters.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I LIKE TO PLAY SOME CARD GAMES.DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY ABOUT CARD GAMES.THANK YOU<br />FOR ALL THAT YOU DO
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I adored this book! I really enjoyed the characters, it had some unique twists that were not predictable, and overall, a great read. It definitely left me wanting more!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|GREAT SERIES TO OWN. THANKS WATCHED IT WHEN I WAS A KID THEY DID A GREAT JOB OF REVIVING IT.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is a very handy timer app. I use it all the time, especially when grilling. I think you will like it too
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I have all the games like this on  and they are so fun. Usually I don't like dress up games but these I loved. And it helps you with your fashion since.
B00D6M86RS|1.0|Really not happy with zen studies. I originally gave this apps five star review. I even went in and bought every table for it. Then the update came. I have an original kindle fire. But after the update they made it functional only on kindle fire hd. Really amateur move on their part. After all the  money I spend that's the thanks they gave me. Next time when you release an app just don't realise it for the normal fires if you plan on screwing people who have the the older tablets. Jus  release it for hd so you don't get people's hopes up. Guess my money will stick with pinball arcade. At least they continue to support both kindle and kindle fire hd. Thanks for nothing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The best horse game ever! Very realistic, it`s like I really own this horse!!!! Just wish it was easier to collect diamonds.
B00CCEHX5W|5.0|\\"Black metal for people who don't like black metal.\\" The album thrashes around like mad, but throughout maintains a cinematic scope and strange sense of melody that helps push it into the stratosphere as far as I'm concerned. Get it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Irish brogue woven into the story which made the characters seem very real and also provided great humor throughout the story.
B008I3R2VG|5.0|Was just really introduced (had heard a few of there songs and liked them) to The Killers and had bought their live CD. This CD is great from the first song to the last. Love listening to this on my long commute to work everyday.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If you liked the movie, you have to get the soundtrack.  The folks did an awesome job with the mash-ups and the soundtrack is just well, Pitch Perfect.  Sorry, gotta say it.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I had already seen this movie, but a friend of mine who had not see it mentioned it and I was more than happy to watch it a second time. It's a great movie for parents and kids or adults without kids. Love it.
0393345084|4.0|Kurgman is a world class economist and he knows his dough. I just can't agree with his remedy but it was an insight to wall street.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This is a must have collection. The history of the &#34; Eagles&#34; is fascinating and one that you enjoy sharing with others.
B00AW8VUDG|3.0|WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THIS CD, YOU WOULD THINK BON SCOTT CAME BACK TO LIFE. THESE GUYS KNOW HOW TO WRITE GOOD SONGS, GOOD RIFFS, ENJOYABLE.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was an exceptional read. Very interesting and hard to put down. It is certainly an act of kindness during war not to shoot and kill an unarmed adversary. The reunion of two opposing soldiers later in life was a miracle. Great book!
1400069742|3.0|Kinda interesting book, but her choice of words that almost no one can understand used frequently thruought the book. Sure would help the reader to understand.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I don't like this books, i preffer TV show. Why? The books are hard to understand and they're written in a way i can get used to; also the performance on TV is also good, and that is not on paper
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The update broke  It was great before that.<br />Galaxy note 2. I hope they can fix it as it has become a useless application now.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Both the App Store and the Kindle application are way too large cumbersome and slow. I always use other software.! The previous version was better. This last update: ruined the app.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|My rating is really zero stars, the majority has already said why and they are right on.  Not only do I want to return this, I wish I could return books 1 and 2 as well. I hate leaving a series in the middle but I will resist finishing this series out.  I was very unimpressed with this 3rd installment but this coffin was definitely nailed shut after I learned there will be books 4 or 5 (clearly stretching this out more than it should - the reason why books 4 and 5 are needed because she didn't move their storyline forward at all)).  Shame.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I enjoy reading Jeffrey Archer.  I know there will be additional books coming.  When I finished Best Kept Secret, I know and expressed to my husband that I wanted to read the next book NOW.  This was one of the best endings to a book and I'm looking forward to the next.  The next book can't come soon enough for me.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Should not have bought this game because I've never liked bingo. So, I am glad this game was a free purchase.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I feel like many other readers. Sylvia Day is just milking the story for the money. This book should have been the last. Very disappointed.
B00AOEA22I|5.0|Every now and then, I look for something new to listen to....and usually I like the melodic rock genre being a fan of groups like Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, etc, etc....<br /><br />This is a pretty good album.  My favorite songs are Learn To Live Again, On The Run and What You Want....<br /><br />Honestly though, I think it's a little bit too hyped up from some of the reviews I've read on some melodic rock sites...but it's pretty solid.  Overall, it has solid guitar work and good vocals.  It sorta reminds me a lot of Tyketto's Don't Come Easy album...Jeff Soto reminds me of Danny Vaughn....<br /><br />Good album.....And better than much of what is played on US radio these days.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I had to come back and add to my original review after listening to this album several times.  Had to say it's really grown on me.  It's solid melodic rock album and I'm enjoying it as much as anything I've bought in awhile...right along with HEAT's Address The Nation album.  I also had to say I've went back and listened to everything on WET's first album, and I like this album better by quite a bit.  I think they've found a perfect balance on this album.  Learn to Live Again is a song I've been listening to over and over.<br /><br />Glad I found this album and it's refreshing to listen to.  It's solid from top to bottom and I'll be watching for another album from WET in the future.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|This story is an unsubtle allegory for a karmic destiny type world view. It’s an ok story but it’s really something to read if you’re into books like The Secret or Thoughts are Things. Not bad if you’re into that sort of thing, just know that that’s what you’re getting into.
B00729Z6R4|5.0|Honestly, had never heard of this band before.  However, I started searching around for something new to listen to...I grew up in the 80's as a fan of groups like Def Leppard and Bon Jovi and saw some positive reviews on this album and liked what I heard from some samples....so gave it a try.<br /><br />Really enjoying this album.  Favorite tune is It's All About Tonight....Song has a great vibe.  Also really like Breaking the Silence, Living on the Run and Heartbreaker.<br /><br />It's a pretty short album....I wish it had a couple more songs.  But overall, this is a great melodic rock album that I think fans of 80's type music will like.  If you liked Bon Jovi, Hysteria era Def Leppard, Night Ranger.....I think you might enjoy this album.
B002WJI63A|5.0|We were happy to find Princess Peach.  She is the perfect size for the other Mario toys and the kids love her,
B005PZ85SO|5.0|Criminal Minds is a great series, and season 7 is one of the best!  I have found that no matter what the description of the episode says, I always like most or all of the show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever because I it will not be boring.when u are on a road trip u should play this game
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|What an incredible, uplifting album!!!  I've loved Darlene's voice and her heart for Jesus from day one.  This piece of work really gets your heart in tune with the total worship experience.  If you love Hillsong, you'll love this one.
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|Clearly someone broke Ellie's heart... But we got a great album out of it! Ellie's unique voice is great, and I have really enjoyed this album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This little game is enough of a challenge when you needed a few minutes to recharge your brain. Attractive and only as time consuming as you allow it to be.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie is a great semi light hearted action packed and well choreographed movie. The acting is also great and packed with a fantastic cast. I don't see anything wrong in this movie at all so I give it a top rating.<br /> Pan
B004SEUIXS|5.0|Shipped quickly, great price, great quality, and one of my favorite movies. The music is incredible and the storyline is hilarious and playful. It's stylized and fun!
B007N8RULO|3.0|My only problem with this app is that when the ads come up before each start of new game the ones w/ video cause a not responding thing and then a force close.'m I hate that and it will have one of those video ads at 'll east every 3rd game.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|As usual Clint Eastwood takes real life situations with the conflict of misunderstandings that are resolved by the unspoken love of humanity with characters that are best able to portray those feelings.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Just when you think you have all of the twists figured out another appears. The bad guys are not who you think and I lost track of the body count.
B0083EW97W|3.0|I got the whole album. I like the other songs more than I did this one, but it was ok.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|Great read for anyone but especially for long time Duran fans who can follow John's story as it parallels theirs over the years, especially through the 80's. Very glad to hear that through the hardships his love of music never faltered and that he found his happy. Made me want to revisit the music that so shaped my youth and keep an eye out for possible tour dates!  Still love you John!
B005D0RDKC|5.0|Excellent! Same raw sound as it was when my oldest brother turned on the radio back in the '50s. With 3 older brothers who all were western music-raised, I grew to only play & enjoy the music.
B008X8RSTM|1.0|The offline Map is too slow after I open the Map app. Also the offline Map did not have GPS function.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I need to be a good idea to jesswhite12 today and tomorrow morning to the cage sand dunes and tomorrow as well.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I am a new fan of Earth, Wind and Fire, Kool and the Gang, and many other similar bands and artists, and this product has definitely exceeded my expectations for what I wanted! Every single song is a hit of its own. The sound quality is also amazing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
B008LFY6NI|5.0|In liked this game because of all the artsy stuff. + u can play FoRvEr!<br /><br />You need this also say my thingy helped LOL
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have been playing this game for a couple of days now and I absolutely love it! The first day was playing the &quot;free&quot; version alone. This game has so much to offer, such as ho, interactive, lots of exploring and amazing graphics. I am thoroughly enjoying this game, recommend it to all, and have no problem with the sticker price. Thank you so much for the entertainment!
B00003CXBH|4.0|Love this movie, and have shared it with many friends, especially like the scene of letting go of all the stuff we can not forgive ourselves for.
0316247545|5.0|I had high hopes for this guidebook, and it did not disappoint. The cover of the book is very well-designed; it looks nice on a shelf, on a table, or in your hands as you read it. There are fun quotes from the characters inside the covers. And the book itself is fantastic. There are pages for each of the main characters, and small segments for the side characters, and even little bits about some of our favorite background characters. The descriptions remain very true to the show, while still incorporating little references for fans. There is a summary of every episode, seasons 1-3; great for an overview of the show or remembering friendship reports. But my favorite parts of the book are definitely the words from the creators of the show. There's an awesome interview with Lauren Faust, messages from writers, artists, and more! It really takes you behind the scenes and gives you a good feel for what goes into this show - the secrets to the magic. Anyone who considers him/herself a big fan of MLP:FiM should purchase this book!
B00CW665VI|5.0|A page turner. Love the build up. Drew makes me lol through the entire book. I definitely recommend this book.
B00992CF6W|4.0|In the new update you can't join games any more and my friends and I don't play on it anymore because we can't join games but back the way it was for muiltplayer
1932100660|5.0|This book motivated me to eat the way we are supposed to eat.<br />I am enjoying it (both the book and the new lifestyle)<br />I have lost 30 pounds, dropped my blood sugar count back to normal from pre-diabetic levels, and eliminated my acid reflux. Now if my hair would only grow back....lol.<br /><br />I expect to live a healthy life for many more years.<br />It is no surprise this book has sold more and more copies every year since ti was published.<br /><br />If you love your family and yourself, read this!
B005HSL626|4.0|I mean it can get kinda boring after awhile but I like it and can keep kids occupied for quite some time.
B00005N6KG|5.0|It's really hard to find headphones these days.  These are lightweight, great to run with, great sound quality, and very cheap!
B0086700CM|4.0|I myself like it.nothing is really wrong with it.it's entertaining for friends and family!!! I would change nothing about it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|An interesting premise.  Overall an engaging story but I can't rate it five stars when I personally hated the main character :)  I wasn't sure what the fuss was about...
B00594XOZU|5.0|its an amazing way to keep in touch with friends and family! It will tell you if the other person got the message , if they read the message,and if they have replied back to you!!!! :) I am very satisfied and I recommend it to EVERYONE!!!!

B00144VBBS|5.0|this one has all the great American songs on it sound is great and songs placed good I would recommend it
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Great movie to complement any Avengers fans in your life.  Gives the back story of Steve Rogers set during WW2.  Fun and thrilling. Some great one-liners, too! Very entertaining!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I believe that all the books were intense and kept my interest through the nights and weekends of reading. I loved each one!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Helpfull to my understanding of the subject of Life after Death, something I always wanted to know and could never get into it.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I love the sounds of Black Sabbath, always have and I am very happy with this album so far...btw GOD IS DEAD
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This will make a fabulous movie series!  Couldn't put it down.  This is something I could actually see happening. If you liked Hunger Games, you'll love this.  If you didn't like Hunger Games - you'll still love it!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I.Love.This.Book.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago I signed up to run a 10 mile race that happens in months. The longest I've ever run was a 15k (9.3 miles) ...30+ years ago. The longest I've run since then is 5k's. I've got my training schedule mapped out, but was needing an extra spark to REALLY get me in the mood for this. &#34;Born to Run&#34; is a captivating read, talking of the pure joy of running, but also suggesting he value to be had from &#34;barefoot&#34; running.<br /><br />This was one of those books that I hated to put down. And now I'm a little sad that I've hit the last page. ...I can't wait to run tomorrow morning!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|From what I have read, the series follows historically.  I believe they have edited some of the more gruesome ways of life for their people.  If it's going to be viewed on screen, then you have to edit.  Can't wait for the next season.
B008602KQI|5.0|It was a good exciting book. I only read it because my 12 year old son had to read it for a book report. Once I picked bit up I felt the need to finish it, along with the bother books in the series.
B0056TYT66|5.0|It worked and very well, right out of the box.  Windows 7, 64-Bit (32-Bit should be the same) auto detected the card and immediately showed my mirrored drive set that was connected to the motherboard sata ports originally.  Yes, it's not a hardware mirror but a Windows 7 drive management mirror set.  The ports all worked as expected at the expected speeds.<br /><br />The only troubling issue I saw was during POST when it gave a warning about not being able to install a BIOS or something like that... ran by too quickly to read.  Basically it read like they didn't add a BIOS chip to the card and apparently it wasn't needed.  Should've bought this the first time around instead of the other card at half the price with no USB 3.0 support.<br /><br />Speaking of price, Amazon will now, as usual, raise the price +5 from $33.74 i bought it at now due to my glowing report.  lol<br /><br />In short, no down side to this card I can see.  If you can install a card into your motherboard and attach the drives, you're golden!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app gives all the functionality I expect and more, the documents convert to word almost seamless transition.  This is a great product for the price.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|This recording is a kind of history of electronic music, complete with a perfect tribute to Giorgio Moroder. Fun, filled with disco and great beats for driving fast. The last 4 songs begin to drag a bit, and &#34;Touch&#34; is a dud, but an otherwise sold, entertaining album, well worth downloading in its entirety
B005HSL626|4.0|I've heard a lot about this and wanted to try it myself.  It is lots of fun!  Can be addictive - LOL
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Fowler's prose is direct, and I connected with the characters immediately. I was a little disappointed that the review I heard on NPR gave too much information, so I will be vague. This is a phenomenal family drama, with humor, tragedy, and deft character development woven into a story you can't resist.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Since I watch almost nothing on ABC (worst of the four main networks on TV) I was pleasently surprised to find that this show lives up to the hype.  I bought it only because of the sale, never having seen an episode of the show.  Great writing mixes humor with serious murder cases. All of the actors are good, in every role, with Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic carrying most of the acting and comic load. The Father-daughter relationship between Rick and Alexis Castle is very well played.  It is nice to see a sweet, nice young girl (Molly Quinn as Alexis Castle), instead of the usual bad girls the networks like to present. You can't help but like the episode when Alexis goes to the prom. I like the fact that, through this season at least, there is no overt love relationship between Rick Castle and Kate Beckett, but a slowly growing respect for the detective abilities of each, particularly when they work together. The supporting characters are uniformly excellent.  This is a really good show.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie it was much better than MI-2. I was worried that it would be just like that movie
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love the fact that I can take my music with me where ever I go with the hassle of upload from my computer
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Great video and audio quality for 30 songs. This Eagles DVD is an absolute must have for all Eagles fans!
B0028R3NCU|2.0|I tried keeping this on my keychain, but after not too long it just stopped working. Not sure which part of it doesn't work, but I'm a bit disappointed.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great movie, lots of action and good story line! The whole family loved it! I would definitely watch this again!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Will recommend it to anyone the numbers are easy on the eyes,  especially for someone with poor eye site. The math calculation is also easy to use.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I thought it would be funnier.  Anything with Seth rogan in it is usually hilarious, but it was.not laugh out loud funny.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The Outlander series is the best story I have ever read. You will not be disappointed. Start with Outlander (book 1). Happy reading:)
B000W91RUG|5.0|I recently started watching this show, so I decided to start from the beginning.  I have not stopped laughing since episode one.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This is the best Jack Reacher story I've read so far.  It was not as formulaic as the others.  Obviously, Jack solves a problem and takes a lover, but the nature of this problem is unique.  I really had no idea until very near the end what the twist was.  My favorite story so far!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The information that Dad Brown put in his books make you think, it htat a fact or did he take a fact and expand on it.<br />It was long and detaled, but in did like it!
0425252868|5.0|This is a really amazing true story from WWII that involves two pilots from truly different worlds whose paths cross on a deadly day in the skies over Nazi Germany..
B00846REIS|5.0|Who on earth would'nt want a Gideon Cross in there lives...yummy,hot,mysterious,rich and a guy who always thinks of his love first...sign me up!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got it on my ipod iphone and xbox and I got the update for the ipod-iphone but not on the Kindle when is the update coming out?
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|My husband and I both loved it. From start to finish, it grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. Any Tom  Cruise fan or action fan will love Jack Reacher.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|Love every season. The acting gets better as the seasons progress. You can see the actors melding into and developing their characters. But for me, I am so happy to find all incarnations of  Star Trek  on Amazon!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|i chose it because it was great i would put . it out to my mom  and it was AWW becaudr og g f2f ;) see u xxx vhhfvjhvhhjjhgchjcfhjbvbnlolol I'll loo ppl l opp lo love you I ii tree see were y u yt? jjhffgvcvvvvv
B00AHJL7BK|1.0|After I bought the app., I can't open the app. at all.  Very disappointed.  Never had trouble with apps before.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Facinating to see how power and common sense Works in the first Word.<br />Thats why they are the first world.<br />The sense of patriotism is above the parties. Thats more tan good.<br />I have chosen this valuation
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|I'm not sure if my husband and I enjoyed it more than our three-year-old, but this was a really great movie.  Highly recommend for family movie nights!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game but  it ends before I can check to see if I even have a bingo, would be a 5 star game. Need to add a few seconds to catch up
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book to get older kids reading again just as the Harry Potter books did.  I try to read my books before my younger children and I enjoyed it very much. These books prove you can write a good book worth reading without every other word being a filthy word.  Surprise. They get enough of that from TV and just going out to the store.  Our children in the States are so sheltered from the horror so many children around the world live with every day, that if they can look past the fact that it is a great fiction book and just google 'children and war' they could see this could almost be about kids growing in war torn countries now.  Read this book...it's one of those you'll read more than once.
B004A3KPYY|4.0|Jarre is one of the pioneers of electronic music and one of the greats. Oxygene is a complex and energetic piece full of energy. Each of the cuts tells a story or establishes a mood. Like classical music does I believe a complex set of musical pieces like that found in Oxygene will raise your IQ by 9 to 10 points - well - at least while you're listening to it anyway.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I am so happy with this purchase. I am a current nursing student and was tired of printing power points and carrying pounds of paper with me. I now take all my notes on the iPad with the Cosmonaut. This stylus is really awesome, smooth and can write fine print.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I had seen Celebration Day in theaters so I was already prepared for the fast cuts on the video, but I have to say I was very pleased with the DVD with the rehearsal footage. I am a huge Zeppelin fan so this was a real treat.<br />Shipping was as advertised and the product came in new condition.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This series has officially turned into nothing more than \\"milking\\" the fans. This was supposed to be a trilogy.  Trilogy = three (3).  Now it's going to be five (5)?  WTF?!  \\"Entwined With You\\" was filled with plenty of sex and not much else.  Don't get me wrong - I like erotica books, but I also bought this because I liked the storyline - until now...  There should have been more resolved issues and a true ending and less filler sex.  And that's all it was - filler sex...  Fluff...  Crap to take up pages so we can charge the readers more for another book - and then yet another...  I don't care about Megumi, I don't care about Cary, I don't care about her boss, I don't care about Brett, I don't care about her family, I don't care about his family, I don't care about his ex (who needs to move along and remember she's married), and I don't care about his driver!  This is supposed to be about Eva and Gideon!  She doesn't deserve him - and he's an idiot for not seeing that!  Very disappointed!  Almost angry!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Plugged it into my powered USB port on my laptop and then plugged in two devices (printer and web cam).  My laptop continually alternates between the USB connected sound and the USB disconnected sound.  It happens so often that I have finally disconnected it, which makes the hub kinda useless.  The Anker support site suggests that when this problem occurs that you make sure to plug in the external power supply, which since there is none for this product is not very helpful.  Basically it is useless and I need to start looking for another solution.<br /><br />Update:<br />I wrote the above negative review about 12:30 in the afternoon and at 3 PM the same afternoon received a call from Anker offering to replace it for free.  I have since received the new hub and it works just fine.  I buy a lot of things on line and this is be far the best and most proactive customer support I have ever experienced.  I was totally shocked.  Apparently they do have some quality issues that they are working on, but if there is a problem it is clear that they will make it right as soon as possible.  The review goes from one start to five just of the basis of their customer support.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks and find his books entertaining.  If you haven't read any of his books, try one!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is really cool that you get to take care of a horse and enter competitions and do all that fun stuff; but I think that this app could be better because its very hare to earn gems and things cost too much!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Was ok game when your bored. Great way to pass time. Needs more levels. Was pretty easy game  . Please notify when you add more levels please
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|I saw this in the theater in 2d (wanted to see if it was worth watching in 3D) and was waiting for the 3D release (package) since I thought it would be good to view in 3D, especially the fireworks in the end of the movie.  To have to purchase separately...  doesn't bode well..... ended up with the 2D version becasue Disney sucks and wanted to be able to watch in other rooms in the house (or at friends housesthat do not ahve 3D).  3D disks do not play well on 2D players.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Wonderful voices in each story.  I loved the characters all being in first person.  The author used correspondence interviews and journals which felt old school like Jane Austen.
B003EEMIV8|5.0|My DS loves this truck, he wanted an &#34;orange garbage truck&#34; for awhile, and this was a winner!!! It looks just like the real thing, lots of details, like in a real truck. Build to last! Thank you Bruder for another fantastic toy!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book keeps you on the edge of your seat. It made me laugh, cry, smile, get angry and be scared. My new favorite book, ever! Simply amazing how well he can capture you using only words, creating a vivid picture in your mind. Sparks is a gifted author who is full of surprises!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Loved this book; the story, the beautiful way it is written. Hosseini has a gift with words. Awaiting the next!
0062020897|5.0|And this book is one of his best.  He starts out slowly developing his characters, but you are soon unable to put the book down.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Loved this book; the story, the beautiful way it is written. Hosseini has a gift with words. Awaiting the next!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It took some customizing via zip code/city. But I really like this. And it has those special alerts for those with allergies!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|app works great,  great functionality. very user friendly,  haven't noticed the battery issues other reviews have noticed (kindle fire). like that you can select different ways to turn off the alarm to ensure that you are truly awake. overall would definitely recommend!!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|The only problem is that Tom is not Jack.  If you are a fan of the series you know immediately that this is true.  I will give them credit for following the book when writing the screen play.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Levels self teach, every level changes strategic placement. Fast placement increases score, faster movement scores and changes table with rapid background changes forcing faster and faster responses from player.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild is engaging and well written as it describes an awesome adventure. I admire the courage it took to complete the PCT alone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|One of the best packaged app I've found. Literally hundreds of study plans, topological index, thoroughly setting up various study plans on many favorite and even unusual subject topic study plans. For interesting study can set up to check usage with reminders to keep caught up. Introduced to this by teenage son and quickly became obsessed with use. GREAT RESOURCE.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I wish I had quit watching about ten minutes before the end of the series. Then I could have lived in ignorant bliss until the next season began. I adore this series. My MIL is English and originally we got the DVDs just for her, but I have enjoyed watching them, too.
1449437524|5.0|I love my dog more than just part of the family, he is my little boy. This book accurately and adorably captures what it is to have a best friend and the moral at the end is all too true. I show everyone I know this book, and rave about how much I love my pup.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Too bad USA only shows reality tv.  This is very worth watching and paying for compared to normal network TV which is terrible!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Not a bad light read and the book is better than the movie but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I play this game all the time, it is easy to level up, to gain high scores, and to connect and play your friends. Some people may say differently, but that's why it's called an opinion.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Pretty forgettable read. Not particularly well written but decent. Would not recommend this to a friend. And I don't have four more words to write.
B000SL1Q2C|2.0|It was my error. The listing showed the disc was a district 2 foremat, not useable on US dvd players. I did not read the add thoroughly before I ordered.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome sauce! You get parts one through five of the Wool series in one quick download.<br /><br />Great characters. Great cohesive story. Although each part can be read on its own and in any order, I suggest getting them all because you won't be able to stop with just one, and you'll want to see how they all fit together.<br /><br />Wow-wow-Wool!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00CTCDPMM A Curious Chain of Events]]I
B0042JIL2E|5.0|Great voice, great rhythm, top musicians around her. Almost every song has a great instrument solo. No one can sit still. Two songs are in the score to the movie \\"Wiled Target\\", this is how I found out about her. Some of the best combination of music and action on the screen.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game, not too hard but hard enough<br />Graphics are beautiful, and so far no monsters to run away from. Loved playing it and cant wait for more
B00932A4XE|4.0|This movie was cute. Not something my husband would have cared for, but something fun to fill a lazy sunday afternoon at home.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Seth Rogan you may have just ended your career with this one. Might have been a funny movie if you are a 55 year old Mom, but I doubt it.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I took a star away for the annoying ads.  I realize that this game was free and that is part of the gratis version, next time I'll purchase to circumvent the pop-ups.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Each time I read any of the books in this series I CAN NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!!<br />Love It !!! Highly recommend it!!
0767817478|5.0|Godzilla is an excellent movie.  I just recently purchased the DVD, (I already had the VHS version), for a 2 year old and he loves the movie as well.  He watches it everyday, (sorry parents).
B003V1WTMM|2.0|I'm sorry to say that it was quite a struggle to get through this. I've enjoyed 2 other books by Kate Morton but this one was very boring,
B00CBKLO52|2.0|this is kinda dumb and hard to control on kindle. glad i got it for free. not much fun a tall
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game subway surfers is a really fun games and and person girl or boy any age can play it, so have fun playing on subway surfers.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|did work right on my kindle! the repeteing is cute and fun for about 10 mins other than that this app really dosent do anything if you can get it for free go for it but i would never pay for this
B005JABU82|5.0|I have personal satisfaction problem with this but the product itself is amazing. I would recommend for anybody. It wasn't hard for me to assemble.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is beast .The newest version is 7.something and I love it. U still can't go to the nether but it's awesome anyway.
B004QX07G4|5.0|hey it 's Ellen!! why wouldn't it be funny? couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days... that tells you how good it is.
1452110581|5.0|I should never have read it to my kats.  Now both Claven and Curtis each wants his own.  I'm thinking of just downloading it to their smart-phones.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I love this movie. Great chemistry between Russell and Cate.  Wonderful look. Really good and fun supporting cast. Works as a great prequel to the story most of us are familiar with.  I purchased this for a song --hence the under rated comment-- but I saw this in the theaters and was thrilled to add it to my DVD collection. I've seen it four times and its just as good as the first time.  A perfect Russel Crowe vehicle and well played as always.  As a comedian I once heard said &#34;Russell Crowe is so good he can play two weeks ago&#34;...think about it. If you like compelling, enjoyable costume dramas this one belongs in your collection.
B003K15IF8|5.0|This book isn't about an exciting, adventerous person  but rather a quiet, studious, serious man who feels a great deal about literature but is completely numb to so much in the world around him.  He's like most of us-- we get hepped up over music, a movie, the Kardashians (please, why?), tweeting our every move and thought.  And the big things-- war, poverty, hunger, personal relationships-- eh, why bother?<br /><br />I'm not done reading the book yet.  It's meant to be savored-- the poignancy is heartwrenching.  As I read the description of his life as a college student, I thought about how much we have in today's society and of how little we really appreciate it.  It's never enough, is it?  And yet, Stoner lived in an attic with not heat, a kerosene lamp, and a box that he used as a desk.  He worked on a farm to cover his room and board.  He wore the same overcoat for 4 years-- a castoff from his father.  He didn't have an iPhone, a computer, a car.<br /><br />But he makes a decision as to what is important-- literature and a woman.  He goes after both with determination.  But I get the sense that he does so with no clear vision as to what is going to happen next.  What does he do with an English degree? What does he do if he gets the woman?<br /><br />As I said, I haven't finished the book.  Maybe I'll come back and re-rate it.  But for now, it's a wonderful piece of literature.<br /><br />Update: I completed the book. I was afraid for Stoner, but I needn't have been. He lived his life with honor and dignity, maybe a little passively at times.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book but be somewhere where you won't be disturbed when you read the last 20 pages.  Take note- you won't be able to read the 50 before the last 20 and stop reading before the last 20 so maybe be somewhere safe so you can finish the book. It's absolutely marvelous.

Aldrich says:<br />... I was hesitant to buy this series in audio because of all the characters and plot twists. Is it hard to keep up with all that's going on?

By the time I reached the end of book 5, however, the switch in readers and the inexplicable changes of characters' voices -- many of which not only didn't match the character, but seemed downright weird -- made it more annoying and confusing than entertaining.\\"<br />in conclusion, some say \\"This is a great book, and I've eaten up the series and have been on tenterhooks for George RR to get his finger out and publish A Dance with Dragons for YEARS now.\\" - but i say don't be on tenterhooks.  you don't have to be obsessive or try to eat the series.  if the first three audiobooks get five stars, and the quality degrades from there, then just listen to the first three audiobooks.  there are many other books out there to listen to.  three audiobooks will be sufficient for me; i don't always need more.<br />i'd like to leave you with a quote from the book, reprinted with permission mr. rr martin himself: \\"Ned had known their faces as well as he knew his own once, but the years leech at a man's memories, even those he has vowed never to forget. In the dream they were only shadows, grey wraiths on horses made of mist.\\"
B009NY43NY|2.0|I had read all the less-than-stellar reviews about this final book in the series and I'm not sorry I read it, but it was predictable and disappointing.  I've re-read all the other books a couple of times but I don't see myself doing that with this one.  Too bad.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it for EVERYTHING. It makes things easy to store and easy to organize and EASY TO FIND a month later.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|At first I was like, yeah, it's OK.  But then I was like, this is an AWESOME release.  I've been through it several times, and it's not getting old.  In fact, its growing on me.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome I love it!!!! You should really play it it's amazing it's good to keep kids acupide lol :) but no joke get the game ;) ;) :)
B005H5H3LW|5.0|It is a movie that surpassed my expectations! I was fan of the cartoon, and I knew the series. The movie is in fact a summary of the series, very faithful to the series spirit. The FX are better than I imagined. It portraits some aspects of the japanese culture, thus you must be cautious on understanding all the aspects of it. If you do not understand japanese culture, you may think it is silly or exaggerated, but it is a mistake. I recommend to those who appreciate Japan and its rich culture.
B00CX1TSSO|1.0|If I wouldve known that the production on this was such crap, I wouldve never purchased it.  It might be ok for your 8-10 year old, but I would waste your time, or money!
0765367351|4.0|Enjoyed the book, still had some holes but overall makes you hate Ryan even more, which is the point I assume.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This one was a good read yes but it wasn't as exciting as the last two. I love that Gideon was willingly opening up and giving himself to Eva. She loves him so much. I didn't like the idea of Brett and Corinne being in the picture so much but on the flip side the story was ok. It just needed more plots. Ah yes, the ending could've been better. Gideon Cross!! 2 more books to come. Le sigh.
0062082353|5.0|My husband purchased this book for himself about 6 months ago. He has since purchased it for both of our boys to read as it has many lessons to teach us all. Very well written should be a required read in any house hold.

Within minutes of reading from this boom my sketches went from dull and dis proportioned to lifelike and praiseworthy. This book should be on every artists shelf.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|While decidedly not as faithful to the source material, this movie takes Tolkien's work in new and intriguing directions. Leaves me wondering what surprises will occur in the next 2 movies. Opening sequence is awesome!
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I love this movie. It is so funny and i love channing tatum! It got delivered very fast. I would recommend this product to anyone!
B005OT2YVA|4.0|For some reason, I find the whole concept of the Transformers fascinating.  The movie was typical good guys vs. bad guys, but I love it when those cars morph into fighting machines.  The auxiliary cast members were an esteemed group of well-known performers which also added to the film's success.  I enjoyed this movie and would watch another Transformer movie.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I am reading the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books as part of my Adolescent Psychology course. Book 1 has given a lighthearted look into starting middle school, I would recommend the books for 3-6th graders wanting an insight to friendships and rituals associated with life as a &#34;Middle Schooler&#34;.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book had Tina Fey written all over it. Before starting it I wondered if I would hear her comedic voice in it, and I definitely did. There were many parts where I couldn't stop giggling. The book as a whole is interesting and funny. It's nice to learn about a different side of her while still being funny.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|MIla Kunis killed it. I am still misty over the reason she became evil. Only thing I didn't like was that the intro b/w part was in a small screen, and then the extra wide letter boxing. If I had never seen the original, and had the nostalgia with it I'd give OZ the better movie stamp.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I read &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;, enjoyed them greatly, and  couldn't wait to read Khaled Hosseini's latest book.  I was not disappointed; he is a wonderful storyteller! I have a new perception of Afghan culture and history as a result of Hosseini's novels, and I would definitely recommend the three books to anyone who would like to know more about Afghanistan and its people.
0618918248|5.0|I was amazed on the way that Richard Dawkins writes, i learn more tnah i though now i can say that im a proud atheist with knoledge on the subject.
0425263924|5.0|If you are a fan of the Crossfire series you will love this book for what it is, a CONTINUATION of Gideon & Eva's story. Furthermore if you are a fan you would have known that Sylvia Day announced months ago that this series would not end with this book because she felt she could not adequately complete the story in just one more book. Therefore, needing to add an additional two books to the series. I am outraged by the negative reviews on amazon simply because an author wants to do right by her characters and her readers by not short changing them or rushing the story. Simply because it started as a trilogy and that has now been extended to a five book series!! With that being said here's my review!<br /><br />  \\"There's nothing like a little Gideon therapy to make things look up.\\"<br />  We'll amen to that Eva! I couldn't have said it better myself!<br /><br />Whew this book is Fantastic!! Despite the situation Gideon and Eva find themselves in when this book starts we are gifted with a softer more playful Gideon and wow does it work!!! We are also treated to seeing Eva become possessive and protective of Gideon and I loved every minute of it! Affectionate, tender, still foul mouthed Gideon and stronger (emotionally & physically) badass Eva! This is just what I needed. I needed to see these two grow as a couple and believe it or not as individuals too. To be able to deal with things between them in another way other than with sex! Don't get me wrong the sex is phenomenal but the growth of there relationship outshines even Gideon's sexual prowess! To say that I love Gideon Cross is an understatement!! He is absolutely in love with Eva and even though sometimes it comes across wrong, it is soooo right! So incredibly happy that there are two more books to this series! Will it suck to wait for them? Sure, if there weren't a billion more books out there to occupy our time. Not to mention we now have three books to revisit and revise to make the wait go even faster! Soto those of you who have thrown in the towel because an author decided to give us more (gasp!) well it's your loss because from what I can tell there is no shortage of story left to tell and I'm pretty certain Sylvia Day can pull it off!!!! I would read twenty books about Gideon and Eva and the love they have for one another
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is like 'old time' Rod wonderful rock and roll. There's not a bad song on the CD. I loved the Song Book series, bit this could be his best yet.
B001DJ7PQ4|3.0|This was by far the most difficult season to review. While I love the show and David Tennant's Doctor is my favorite Doctor, this season had one  great big stinking problem. Catherine Tate! I hated her! Every time she spoke I just wanted to tell her to shut up! By far the worst companion the revised series has ever had. That is why this season got only 3 stars. Thank goodness the TARDIS is now totally Tate Free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was very fun i love it better  than Temple Run it is very interesting very nice for a kindle fire i loved it
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I red about this show in an article talking about shows to watch to survive not having new episodes of Sherlock. I thought I would give it a try and the very first episode blew me away. It was so creative and exciting an the show got better from there. Christopher Eccleston's Doctor was great and the one who still strikes me as the most Alien of the Doctors (I am on season 7 now) just a great show for every one
B00BSW29OE|5.0|This book cannot be enjoyed like Harry Potter or The Giver, but it should be read to understand the perspective of the victims of Hiroshima. It reminds me of reading about what happened to the Jews in WWII. Anyone who is interested in that war should read this to understand more fully the cost of ending the war as we chose to.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Read the first book on a paperback,almost went blind with the small print.  Had to reread it on my fire with the bigger print.
B00B7FXZQS|1.0|I looked forward to watching a Paranormal Activity movie, but this one thoroughly disappointed me. The movie rarely exhibited the &#34;shock&#34; or &#34;fear&#34; factor that one looks for in a horror movie.<br /><br />**Spoiler Below: If you intend to watch it, I suggest you stop reading now...**<br /><br />The movie began quite well, and kept me engaged. However, by the half-way mark, I found myself eagerly awaiting some action, or simply the conclusion. It became obvious that nothing was going to happen until the very end. Rather than taking the audience through a revealing story, culminating in a suspenseful conclusion, this movie provides the audience with almost nothing until the last 10-30 minutes.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Spoilers!...<br />Loved all three books, couldnt put them down. Loved this one up until the end, after shevwent back to 12.. just seemed like nothing happened. Wish there would have been more between katniss and peeta after that but it was just kinda like a blur into the end.
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|The Dillinger Escape Plan has always been a band that takes the unexpected road and leaves people with their jaws on the floor. This album is pretty much flawless in my opinion. The Drums are chaotic, yet at the same time have the precision and feel you might find in a fusion band or jazz trio. The Bass has a beefy tone that lays the foundation for the record's bombastic sound. The guitars are frantic, chaotic, and at times very melodic. The vocals are varied between a harsh scream that borders on insanity and phenomenal Clean Vocals. The production is top notch. The album has a very heavy, beefy sound. The songwriting has surprises at every turn and keeps the listener guessing. No filler tracks either, each song is great. Some of my favorite Tracks include Prancer, One of us is the Killer, Hero of the Soviet Union, and Nothing's Funny. This is honestly one of the best albums I've heard this year. Pick it up!!!
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Heads up, this is my thoughts on the whole trilogy, not only this one. Spoilers..<br /><br />I started reading the first book from a library loan, none of the books I wanted were available and I wanted something to read. I loved the first book and read it in less than 48 hours. I told myself I would wait for the second until it was available from the library but couldnt even make it 24 hours begore breaking down and buying it, and the same thing with this one.<br />Delirium was a great love story I thought. It was the perfect start to a trilogy with tons of potential. You got the feeling that alex and lena would be together no matter what.<br />Pandomonium was also a great book but disappointing in a lot of ways. Based off the feelings in the first book I never would have thought lena would fall for another guy, especially not julian. I assumed at the beginning that she would be working her way back to the portland area, looking for her mother, and hoping that alex was still alive. After finding that her mother had been alive that whole time, and the boy thomas was not killed and instead thron in the crypts as well, how could she not think that alex would be there too? And even if he wasnt alive why wouldnt she go back to his home in the wilds to feel closer to him at least? Anyways when the book moved on to a sudden love story with lena and julian I thought I would be mad about it.. she starts going for a new guy only about 6 months after alex was supposedly dead? But in the end it seemed to fit together, and when alex shows up on the last page it made it impossible for me to think anything but that they would get back together.<br />I bought requiem, I read a bunch of reviews first, seeing that alot of people were disappointed, but bought it anyway.<br />It is a really good book. The beginning of the triangle seemed like a good place to start, but as the book moved on and lena kept feeling back and forth with both guys it started getting annoying. Finally there was a good chunck of the book where it wasnt a triangle anymore and it was more focused on the resistance.<br />I like how hanas story was involved, and how you feel sorry for her and the position shes in now. It ties in nicely at the end with hana and lena meeting again.<br />Lenas mother ties in nicely as well, and it was good that they found each other again.<br />Now the ending,.. are you kidding me?<br />Other reviews talked about how you dont know how the love triangle is resolved. I think its clear she choose alex. But nothing was actually resolved. This would be understandable if it was being set up for another book, but its not. The other two had reasons to end abruptly they way they did, they had something to go into. This one just stops, they didnt actually resolve anything between lena and julian, lena and her mother, the resistance, you dont read about the effects of the bombs actually going off, or anything after the wall has come down or what happens to the city or hana or anything. Huge let down. It was a great book until the last page, where I expected to keep reading the actual end and it wasnt there. All I can say is I hope these reviews get back to the author and she decides to write another one, with an actual ending to it.s a good chunck of the book where it wasnt a triangle anymore and it was more focused on the resistance.<br />I like how hanas story was involved, and how you feel sorry for her and the position shes in now.

B006GECE9Y|1.0|I downloaded this app to use on my LePan II tablet, it worked fine for a while but now it crashes all the time,it's very annoying!! Not only does it crash, it stalls all the time too, I get a message saying it's not responding and if I want to wait, it doesn't even give me enough time to click \\"wait\\" before it closes, annoying!!  Most of the time I have to reboot my tablet, I don't know what they did but this thing stinks now!  I've been searching for a new browser that supports flash so I can ditch this thing!!  You don't have to touch a thing, this browser will constantly close making you have to reboot in order to just have it do the same thing again!!<br /><br />This browser may work fine at first but it will start stalling and crashing after a while, download at your own risk!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I just finished this book in record time (record time for me anyway). Before starting this book, I had started another book that I just couldn't get into. Over 3 months I reread the same chapter 3 times. It finally occurred to me that I needed a different book. That's when I picked up this one. Reading is so much more enjoyable when you can't wait to see what's on the next page. The Racketeer was that kind of book.  This story would make a great film.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|DVD was received as described, all items included.  I forgot this Special Edition included the Lunch Box or a scaled down version of a lunch box, a metal box just the same...  If you love this movie then you will love this Special Edition Bonus Package.  Excellent transaction, would do business again.
B000E41MS6|4.0|I liked the show from the Tom Baker days but was sorry to say that Mcoy put me off utterly with his stint as the Doctor and I was unimpressed by the movie.<br />I was hesitant to begin watching this restarted show but am glad now that I did.<br /><br />This Re-Boot felt a little odd at first but the Actors had great synergy and this season just got better and better...<br /><br />GREAT SHOW!!!
075669812X|5.0|My seven year old loves this book. What more can I say? Perfect for anyone who loves the Lego Ninjago line.
B003NTMREM|4.0|I came to this show as a Dr Who fan and think it is wonderful TV- up to ep 5 now and it has been getting better every ep so far from a somewhat slow start.<br /><br />You can watch this show without ever having seen \\"Dr Who\\" but those who know that show will find this much more adult themed with WAY WAY MORE SEX (of various types, pretty graphicly shown) and some pretty strong VIOLENCE too, which is OK for grownup's but you prob do NOT want kids watching this.<br /><br />Worth watching if you like sci-fi mystery, strong drama and good plot.

0670014893|5.0|It's been many years since I last read a John LeCarr&eacute; novel. I'm not sure why. I just seem to have drifted away from complex, morally ambiguous \\"everyman\\" spy stories in favor of James Bond-style fantasies. I remember being mesmerized by \\"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold\\" when it came out in 1963. It was the height of the Cold War, and the daily news often made Americans wonder if Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles would come arcing over the North Pole at any moment. East-West relations were tense, and memories of the Cuban Missile Crisis still lingered in the national psyche. Perhaps Mr. LeCarr&eacute;'s books were not escapist enough for me at the time. For whatever reason, I did not read many of his later works.<br /><br />\\"A Delicate Truth\\" made me realize what I've been missing. It updates the genre Mr. LeCarr&eacute; pioneered, and makes it as current as today's headlines, with Muslim terrorists, privately funded wars, corporate mercenaries, extraordinary renditions, enhanced interrogations, whistleblowers, revolving-door politics and all the rest. \\"A Delicate Truth\\" captures a snapshot of much that's going on in the world today. I'd wager even Mr. LeCarr&eacute; is amazed--and probably appalled--at how closely recent \\"spy scandal\\" truths mimic his fictional story.<br /><br />The novel opens with a covert operation in the British Crown Colony of Gibraltar to capture a terrorist that \\"Intelligence\\" guarantees will be in a certain house at a certain time. Involved in the operation are British and American soldiers, free-lancers, government functionaries and men from powerful multi-national corporations. After the operation ends in a rousing success (to all appearances), the people involved disperse and go back to their other duties--until three years later, when Toby Bell, an official in the British Foreign Office, begins to hear disturbing rumors about the outcome of the operation. As he tries to find out what really happened that dark night on \\"the Rock,\\" Toby is stymied at every turn by hidden, unknown forces that lie, cheat, steal, threaten--and kill--to prevent him from learning the truth. Weaving a complicated web with consummate skill, Mr. LeCarr&eacute; develops fleshed-out characters that we care a lot about, and a story filled with twists, turns, deception and mystery. It finally seems everyone is lying all the time. It took me a lot of dedicated concentration, and some paging back and forth, to follow the tale and keep all the characters and events straight, but the effort rewarded me with a masterful story that held my attention to the last word.<br /><br />One of the reasons I chose \\"A Delicate Truth\\" is because the covert operation takes place in Gibraltar, which I have visited and with which I am endlessly fascinated. That got me started. But the action in Gibraltar only takes up the first 45 pages or so. After that, Mr. LeCarr&eacute;'s sheer storytelling skill kept me engaged to the end. My only minor gripe is that he shifts the narrative voice between present and past tense with seeming randomness (I'm sure there's an underlying logic to it that I simply didn't discern). Other than that, \\"A Delicate Truth\\" is an outstanding novel by a master storyteller. I found one of its most intriguing aspects to be its insights into how other people in the world view U.S. actions in the Iraqi War and the War on Terror. Mr. LeCarr&eacute; has some of his characters believe and say things that many Americans, especially those on the far right end of the political spectrum, will probably not like. But, to me, it was valuable to learn about others' viewpoints on events that have profoundly affected the entire world. \\"A Delicate Truth\\" is well worth reading for that reason alone.ied at every turn by hidden, unknown forces that lie, cheat, steal, threaten--and kill--to prevent him from learning the truth.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|Excellent continuation of the tale with more twists to the plot lines than expected. Now I'm gonna have to read the next one! Beware-the story is an addiction just waiting to be picked up<br /> The story line of season one of the Game of Thrones series stayed fairly true to the first book but the second season has taken a lot of liberties with book two-still the same story but some big differences.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Enjoyed complete movie 3d with passive glasses & great surround sound.<br />Not so with active glasses (different tv),only part of the long movie, eyes got tired, switched batteries, gave up.<br />Recommend passive glasses, no complaints from anyone.<br />New 3D content getting better with every release. Keep total family viewing, something you would watch with your parents and grand parents & best friends. No surprises at the wrong time.

B002JODPSO|4.0|I liked this movie. It was better than the first two .In Die Hard it was good with Bonnie Bedelia and Reginal Veljohnson. The second Die Hard I did not like at all.Now with Live Free Or Die Hard it is the best so far.There was more suspence and it was nail biting till the end.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|but I guess I am suppose to review the bluray and not the movie.  Um... its blue and very discy.  Plays in the dooblie do all good and looks nice with the HD-ness of it all.  There are some extras and stuff, but well we all know the really good s*** is going to come out on the special addition.  If its the movie it's self you are unsure about then well I recommend it.  I love the book and I love this movie even with the changes they made.  Martin Freeman just plays Bilbo so well and I absolutely can not wait for the next movie.  Buy this sucka and rub it on your bod-er... I mean, watch it and love it like I do... well maybe not like I do, that can chafe but you know, love it in your own way. And yes there are changes and all that but just let it go.  Its a movie and its fun.  Its a fun movie.  Side warning: This movie is a huge sausage fest, but you should know that if you ready any of the books hommie wrote.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|Wasn't very impressed by this read. Just because he is a neurosurgeon doesn't prove this happened to him.  I have read several life after death books and this is not one of my favorites.
B000002KE2|5.0|classic hard rock ! the best years of black sabbath. hard to believe it came out in 1972. they invented heavy metal.....
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Given the simplicity of this game I now I have a great time killer plus a very very addicting game
B002CMQS1O|3.0|I found it to be humorous at times but overall it was a bit boring and dated. I can't recommend this movie.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was an excellent book. You could really see inside of the characters and feel as they felt. Wonderfully written.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Great movie. The Queen is totally scary. Kristen Stewart did a wonderful job. Came on time and in perfect condition.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|I have become very engrossed in this cute little game. Very enjoyable but addictive. Runs perfectly - you will enjoy it too.<br />Update:<br />After playing this for awhile, I now find it frustrating. The controls are not very responsive and it's really difficult to jump to the levels and grab things. I'd like to see this updated and improved.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|The extra scenes were really good. Wish there were more. Worth having even if you have the original. The packaging is very pretty
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Beautiful story of the strength of the human spirit and to never judge a book by its cover!!! It is life affirming!
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|The doll is actually more beautiful than I expected and the wedding dress looks like the one in the movie. It came in good time and in good shape, box and all.
B00847KFDS|5.0|John Fogerty is at his best while working with such a wide variety of artists!  I only wish there were 15 more songs added to the CD.  As I was listening, I kept thinking of other songs I'd love to have heard on it.  Great feel good music!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very interesting to read of this brilliant man and sad that he died alone and poor.  My family is moving to CA as the dad works for Tesla, which is why I read this.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Django Unchained is all things Tarantino: great soundtrack, blood and gore and obsessive use of cussing.  But, Christoph Waltz steals the screen in almost each scene.  He's flawless!  Even those who are offended by Tarantino-isms should watch it just to watch his performance!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Hugh Laurie is at least as good a musician as he is an actor.  This is an outstanding New Orleans style blues CD with excellent musicians joining Laurie for this project.  This is one of those CD's that I can listen to time and time again and love it every single time.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is pretty cool, but the animation could be better. I also think that the player should be able to actually go inside the cave and grab the idol by themselves. It should have a little more action than just running....
B005LAII62|3.0|This weekend I watched ParaNorman and the most I have to say about it is eh. It was only OK. So many themes, none of which were fleshed out well enough to make a whole. And the whole curse thing only made marginal sense, and then only about half-way through the finale.<br /><br />Truthfully I found it a lot preachier than I expected. In the heavy-handed, bang me over the head way. There were a couple funny one-liners but they never went anywhere. And the family dynamics were confusing. Whose mother was grandmom? And where did the uncle fit in to that family tree?<br /><br />Overall, an average 3 star movie. Good for a night's entertainment but only when nothing else is on.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|These movies are so well made.  They also have a great theme for young girls. I cannot wait for more Monster High movies to come out!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Great story that weaves the history of the time in a captivating way.  While the history is complex with all the family intermixing, she refers to the lineage often enough to follow.  As always her narration is engaging.
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|My 4 year old loved this movie because it followed along the lines of his video game!!!  Would watch over and over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game. It is very addicting to play I find myself playing for hours. I like the competitions and cleaning the horse and giving her treats
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is always good reading, and I've read all three Chronicles. I found the ending quite disappointing, though.<br /><br />I guess the author is tired of the series. I've read most of Archer's books and always found them very good.
1400069807|3.0|There is a lot of good information in this book, but it is a difficult read.  I have tried to finish it several times, but I just can't get into it.  I think it is a very important subject, and our food system has to change, but not sure this is the book to get that done.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series.  I just love the story line and all of the characters with the mini plots.  It is very well cast.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  My eight year old daughter loves it, and so do I!  We often fight over who gets to play next;)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm not sure why so many hated the book. If they really liked Sylvia Day and were fans they would know and have known for quite awhile that the series was going to be 4 or 5 books! If I were the author I wouldn't even want to finish the series with the way people have behaved and continue to behave over the release. Do we really think the author has control or the publishing company? All that aside, the book was good even though I thought it was on the short side. If you love Sylvia Day and her writing then follow her on FB, she is always giving updates and snippets. I also don't believe anyone deserves a refund after reading it! You got your product and used it. I have read a ton of books that I didn't end up liking, that's my problem not the authors! I feel bad for Sylvia at this point, if you don't like her then don't read the books, its very simple!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is truly an amazing book.  I think even a non believer would believe after reading this! Highly recommend it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved everything about the book. It kept me hanging on and eager to read more about Gideon and Eva's relationship, or lack there of in this book ;)
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Another wonderful series. Only problem now is that I have to WAIT FOR THE 8th SEASON!!!!!! Already going through withdrawals!! (Have it preordered though, so come on AMAZON!!!
B00D2K40WY|3.0|Your download of the Ana and a half hour ago when you take the walking in Michigan is true that I have been holding the walking dead zombies to say about this page bookmark this page is true that got away with a half hour
B003L77GGK|5.0|Just keeps getting better and better. Like a fine wine..... Just gets better with age. Hope series never ends. REALLY
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I just got this game this morning and I absolutely love it! This game reminds me of  the sniffs village.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Wow I am really stunned  by the 3 star average. I saw this movie at<br />the theater and really enjoyed it. I liked it better then some of his<br />older movies. If you like Bruce Willis movies in general by all means see this<br />movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is sooooooo fun its so addicting you have to try it you will fall in love it is awesome it  glitches sometimes though
B00992CF6W|5.0|In the new update, (0.7.1) the new features are awesome. The play includes local multiplayer games and now fire! It keeps getting better and better!<br />Totally worth $7.00
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I like this game it is bot only fun but cute. Lol  it is also at time frustrating but then figure it out.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I loved this one and the analogy of the &#34;the Last Coyote&#34; is very well done.  It made me sad<br />when he losses his home but Harry always pushes on.  I would like to meet this kind of<br />detective in real life.  He finally gets a little romance too, its about time.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I loved it but I had read the book. If I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have understood parts of the movie.
B00BT0ZS52|1.0|I consider myself a movie buff and love period movies but this one is way to difficult and confusing<br />to follow.  I downloaded it for a trip I was taking to London and I was so disappointed that I had<br />to stop watching it mid-flight.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wonderful! Very interesting and well done. I can't wait for the new season. Hope they don't kill off any more characters!
030758836X|4.0|I couldn't believe how great this book was as I was reading it--I found myself scanning pages because I couldn't wait to get to the next one.  But the ending was so disappointing!  Very lackluster.  It did kind of flow with the whole \\"sick\\" aspect of this couple, but it left a lot to be desired.  Unfulfilling after the build-up of the rest of the book.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I watched the first episode when I was sick and couldn't concentrate and I was hooked. I loved it and couldn't stop watching.
B00A04O6PQ|5.0|My son love this book. He read this book a couple of time. I will recommend this book to any teenager....
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|The game just bored me with the graphics and how easily you can die and the vehicles were also boring
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|All four band members sound fantastic, but there is definitely something missing without Ward. 13 is a good rocker. Obviously this isn't 1974. So you don't get those insane early guitar riffs or the more original material from the late 70's. You get straight ahead sludge rock with a hint of pop from Rick Rubin. If you like first five Sabbath, you should like this one.
B004HD61KE|4.0|I have never read any of James Rollins' novels but will after this. I found his characters and locations very real and believable. I enjoyed the action and mystery in the book and I particularly enjoyed the fact that I hadn't figured it out before the end!  Very good read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again! Another great book that keeps you reading! I enjoyed this love story, and look forward to reading more from Nicholas Sparks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and wen I found this I screamed I was so excited. It is the best thing ever it is about the only game I play
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book is written from the view of a young boy born while his mother was held captive. Although it is a disturbing topic I consider this to be well written and interesting.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its pretty fun the controls are pretty simple so pretty great for all ages also good for when your bored hope this helped :)
B0009QBLA8|5.0|I purchased this without having seen it. I should note that I have enjoyed all of David Lynch's work that I've seen to date and Eraserhead was no exception. I would only recommend this film if you are familiar with the director and are not phased by what some may consider \\"weird\\" films. The packaging is partially in Korean but I found the quality of the DVD to be just fine.
B00064ADR0|5.0|Not left out in the cold with this cd. Always a pleasure to play johnny winter on my radio shows.
1439102813|5.0|This book was the first one I bought upon learning that my dearest friend has dementia.  I am glad I did and I would tell anyone to buy it and read it and then get on with life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love my pinterest app!! i dont know what i would do without it! works perfect. i so far have had no problems.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|I bought this as a filler during bi-weekly board game nights. We usually play games that take between 30 mins and 2 hours to complete and this fits in nicely to break up the night while people are getting snacks. You can easily finish a game in 10 mins and it accommodates a large number of players. The premise is fairly simple: be the first zombie to eat 13 brains. You do this by rolling dice that have brain, shotgun, and escaping people symbols on them. Each turn, you roll three dice. Each brain symbol brings you one step closer to satiating your hunger. Roll a shotgun and you're running the risk of being destroyed. Accumulate as many brains as you can during your turn but beware. If you roll a third shotgun, you lose your turn and all brains acquired during that turn. Escaping people are re-rolled. The dice also have three difficulties, green has more brian sides, yellow is even, and red has more shotgun sides.<br /><br />Simple and fun.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is the second excellent book I have read this week. I love a story about a man-ho who falls hard for a worthy femme.  And the fact that it is told from the POV of said man-ho made it even better.  The characters were completely believable, there were no annoying typos to detract from the story, and can you say hilarious!  I'm talking laugh out loud, almost choke on your own snot funny.  I loved that in all their arguments the h gave as good as she got (gotta love a strong female!), and the sex scenes, while graphic were somehow tastefully romantic at the same time - get something to fan yourself with!  Best of all, even though the title says &#34;series&#34; this is a standalone novel with no cliffhanger and you get your HEA.<br />Can't wait for more from this author.
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|The game looks fun but i cant play online i mean like Wtf i rate half because i cant rly play
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|*Warning! Spoilers!*<br /><br />This book was the most amazing, touching, devastating book I have ever read in my life. As soon as you meet Augustus Waters, you fall in love with him. I don't know how John Green does this, but as soon as Gus was introduced, he was already my favorite character. Both Gus and Hazel Grace slowly fall into a sweet relationship, but it's very complicated--at first--for Hazel, since she has lung cancer. However, this book takes the most heartbreaking turn of all books. I sobbed from that turning point until the very end and I literally could not stop crying. Although his comic relief is great, really great, it's not enough to cover up the sadness that this whole book demonstrates. And I never cry at books, so it was saying a lot that I literally sobbed. This review, I've realized, is becoming very repetitive, but maybe that's because this book was too good for words.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Started off a little slow but it sure picked up speed and turned out to be a page turner. You won't be disappointed with this one.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|this movie is one of the best at surprise endings.  For me - it beats so many others - I recommend this ghost story to anyone that is a believer in ghost and for those that don't believe - you may change your mind.  Be prepared to hang on to the edge of your seat, it will take you on more ups and downs, twists and turns than a roller coaster. I give it a two thumbs up.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love this action filled book. It is nerve racking yet hilarious. I highly recommend it to people who love mythology
B000ID37T0|5.0|Outstanding movie, if you haven't heard if it, just ask someone, there are about 200+ quotable lines from the movie! Starts a bit slow, but you can see all along that Chris o'donnel's early character is on a collision course with LIFE, and Col. Slide will be his rescuer!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Love how clear the graphics are. Keeps me waiting for more. Cannot wait to play more like this one! Well done
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Omb!! this game is so much fun!! can't stop playing it!! the game works just fine nothing wrong with it. the only thing is that it's hard to change your starter name on the game. besidest that the game is a lot of fun.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|It's protective. It lets me stand my HD Fire either &#34;portrait&#34; or &#34;landscape&#34; and at 3 different settings. The turning device doesn't turn easily but I'm not bothered by that. It's purple. It has a nice heavy-duty elastic band to keep the case closed. I hope it lasts for a very long time.
B008WCP2KG|2.0|Everyone raved about this movie, but I found it a bit boring and drawn out.  Regret making the purchase.  Oh well.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|There are a lot of surprises in this series. Also learning points of the law is interesting. I can see why this show has won awards.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Obviously amazing. Definitely worth the hype; surpasses the show. Just because you've seen the show doesn't mean you know everything.
0062059963|4.0|The Elite picks up where The Selection leaves off--America is now part of the Final Six young ladies left vying for the attentions of Prince Maxon. She knows she cares for him, but there is still Aspen, her former boyfriend who is now a palace guard, hovering around and making her decisions next to impossible. Throw in the fact that she doesn't care for a couple of the girls also in the Elite and that the Rebels are closing in, and you've got the set up for this novel.<br /><br />What's to like? America is refreshing since she doesn't apologize for who she is and where she comes from. Maxon is charming and it's easy to see he should choose America. It's a light, fun novel filled with a sincere voice and an agonizing love triangle--which is actually more of a love septangle if we include the other Elite. There is some danger and several secrets that keep the pages turning.<br /><br />What's not to like? Well, some of the very things to like are those that make this novel so frustrating. America jumps to conclusions repeatedly and she doubts Maxon so often that I'd like to knock some sense into her. Toward the end, there is a revelation (or two) from Maxon that hits America hard, and she is shocked, though after her actions throughout, she shouldn't be at all. Though the book is about finding a spouse for Maxon, it's easy to see how immature these teens are by what they choose to do and say. And quite honestly, if Rebels could break into the palace so easily, I'm not so sure I'd be trying very hard to become a princess.<br /><br />The Elite is a fast read and an enjoyable one, though definitely not very deep. Still, it kept my interest quite well and I found it fun and light. I'd actually give it 3.5 stars, but my overall enjoyment will boost it 4.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Victoria has been broken by life. The only voice she finds to express herself is through the language of flowers. Flowers reconnect her to the world and are her path to healing. Victoria learns to not only find a way to trust in others but more importantly to trust in herself that she is lovable and worthy of happiness.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Entertaining for sure; not quite as entertaining as season 1.  I'm still a big fan and can't wait to see season 3!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It's a good game with outstanding graphics and a quick play speed...... there's always a catch, for a free game they decided to make their money buy selling you these power crystals which allow you to open or unlock different attributes tied within the game. If it weren't for that this would be a five star game. Freaking Hollywood and the big money machine.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great read. Visual  sevens likeable an  fantastic characters. Can not wait to read book 2 and three.Go get email katniss
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have not got this game but I have heard such great comments I am going to get it and you should to.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|So very well presented with fantastic acting and period setting makes it all the more interesting.  I sure think the whole family will enjoy this DVD and I will revisit it frequently now that it is in my library.  Loved it.  It came on time and was well packed for the ride.  Happy me.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I have this game on my kindlefire and I hats it.I always get killed and I can not get food.I can not Evan get a house.But if you like creating you should get pet story it is aweuosome
B0095GSKDE|5.0|Sent a copy to my graddaughter who is an Asst. Principal in a grade school made up of underprivileged children
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun little addictive game that has changed quite a bit since being released, but has nice, clean graphics and keeps you entertained.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a pretty creative thinking puzzle. I really enjoyed playing. I hope there will be more levels.<br /><br />look toward to playing again.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|My grandson would not play this game.  It totally did not take his interest like the other games I loaded for him.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This app would not download when I first got it. It said there was a connection error. So I deleted it and installed it again and it still would not work! :-(
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I've always liked the Voyage series.  I wish I could afford to purchase the entire set all at one time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|carries the story line very well and the ending had a surprising twist that I realize was already hinted at in the beginning!
B003G4W49C|5.0|What a great story!  A glimpse into the tomorrow imagined by Orson Scott Card.  Sometimes heart-breaking, and sometimes funny, but always brilliant, poignant, and just plain wonderful.  Difficult to put this one down.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is so much fun! Very addicting. I play all of the time.  Quests and growth plays a lot like farmville and is just as much fun!
B00138CSLM|3.0|Nothing wrong with this CD at all, except I don't really see the point of it, except to make $ on avid fans' emotions.  I don't hear any other artist showcased on any song.  I guess I sort of expected Bonnie Raitt to chime in somewhere I could tell it was her.  I couldn't.  Nor could I hear anybody else.  But it is still good to listen to & stayed true to the nuances of the originals with very few exceptions.  I'd just as soon listen to the originals.
0062014536|4.0|I loved and hated this trilogy. I could not put down any of the books. It showed a true struggle and the characters were magnificent.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was the book chosen by the book club I just was invited to join... Simply amazing. Mi could not put the book down.  It takes you to places in your soul you aren't sure you want to know, but you have too...  Xoxo
B001EC2IT4|5.0|Oldy but goody. I loved this movie as a kid and now my kids love it too. My son saw it while he was out and about and wanted a copy to watch. It was really easy and convenient to purchase this for viewing on my Ipad. No need to even leave the house. I think I will watch it again tonight lol. Great buy!
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|The 3D effects were great! But in the recent 3D trend, I could tell Disney created this movie more to show off their design and art as well as their advancements in 3D. The plot was okay, but the scripting was sub par. Basically, use this movie to show off your awesome television, but don't expect to love the plot.
B008220D5K|2.0|The trailer looked funny enough, but the movie is depressing. There is too much dysfunction and bickering throughout the whole thing - a mother load of negative emotions and behavioral disorders.  Not even John Lithgow, Melissa McCarthy or pretty Megan Fox can save this film. There aren't memorable lines, just a constant stream of acerbic yakety-yak.
B00AFEY354|5.0|It came very fast- which made me happy because I watched the redbox one so many times I was starting to think I would end up spending more money on that than on owning it. Thanks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I don't play but every chance my little nephew gets a hold of my Kindle, he can't stop playing it!  I see he loves playing for LONG periods of time.  Recommend if you looking to kill some time.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a coming of age tale of a female protagonist with cancer that will eventually kill her.  Through her \\"cancer kid support group\\" she meets a singularly legged boy who will become her romantic interest.  Without having to make this a spoiler review, I will stop the description here.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars was a very well written book given that it is written for a younger crowd than myself.  The story line keeps moving, it never stalls or drags on, and has its fair share of surprises and twists and turns.  This book is particularly interesting to me in that there is a female protagonist which is unusual and also that she is diagnosed as (what I would call) eventually terminal from the first page.  This is not something we come upon during the book.  So there are lots of very well described situations throughout the book as they could only be told by someone who is coming to accept their mortality and the frailty of their existence.<br /><br />The ending to this book, and by ending I mean probably the last 5 chapters, are horribly sad!  I can't recall a time where I didn't have tears welling up frequently as this book reached its end.  As you start to realize how this story is unfolding the feelings of dread and sadness build into this awesome crescendo and the inevitable revelations after the \\"big event\\" (trying not to give up the spoiler here).<br /><br />This was a very well written, book that I could not stop reading.  I would recommend this book to just about anyone... Just have your tissues handy.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I loved this before story of the original OZ, it shows a wonderful plot of things to come. I loved the comedy in it as well as the drama played out
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great insight on the the enabling side of a psychopath.  Spoiler Alert:  I was delightfully surprised that the wife was the true maniac, but also a little inspired by her response to her husband's affair.  I guess the old &#34;That'll Teach 'Em&#34; lesson is no laughing matter to this Gone Girl.
1476733953|1.0|Buying this upon the almost excellent reviews I delved into it in anticipation. 100 pages in nothing happens, 180 pages in nothing happens other than endlessly going up and down stairs and ridiculous repetition of mechanical superlatives and how dept the protagonist was with her hands. Lo and behold the same rinse & repeat throughout the book with the introduction of everything IT related on top of that.<br /><br />Nothing worse than waiting for something to happen that of course never comes even at the end. Just might be the most disappointing book I have ever read.
B005LJITS0|4.0|It was a fun money; a little romance, a little comedy, and lots of action. I liked it as did my daughter.
0553386697|5.0|I can recommend it. Good style, good lessons especially for somebody who wants to learn how to handle emotions. Just buy it.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This cover fits my Kindle perfectly and holds it securely.  The suede texture is nice and feels secure when holding it.  The stand works by friction, so you can adjust it to pretty much any angle, and you can stand it up the other way like an inverted V as well.  Overall, very pleased especially for getting it on sale!
B007SO31BQ|5.0|I recommend this to all racing fans. Whether it be the boring Moto to closed wheeled. Senna was a beautiful man with the courage that many people should look up too. ENjoy!
B005LAJ212|5.0|Due to my hectic life,  i missed a couple of shows.... I was up to speed and not lost on what happened.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|the best of the Mcqueen in Bluray!!! So just be aware words are limited but wonderful footage of the race itself!
B00000IQV7|5.0|A true classic.... You gotta love Robin Williams!  I wanted. An. Employee to see it, since the original clinic is here in WV!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good. I thought it was gonna be some dumb graffiti game hut its much better and much more than that
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I \\"wonder\\" how does this particular author write such a good book? I love how there's a lesson at the end: Even though they are bullies in the world, there are the people who aren't bystanders and who show there face to the world. You can make people feel that they are allowed instead of talking about them behind there back. I don't think there's any point in the story where I got bored. I loved it and I would recommend this particular book to 3rd or 4th graders and up.
B00CM6ZLG8|4.0|Very catchy album. You can tell she put her heart and soul into the album. Nice mix up of fast/catchy tracks and deep lyrical ones.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cool if you like doing horse work and if you don't you do not want it but try it yourself because it is free
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was a story written in typical Grisham style.  Good storyline, well developed characters and interesting insight into the workings of the courts and law.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love to see what I can create in the ocean for Nemo!! Okay 20 words.... I love creating my own place for the fish life & ocean life!
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|It took me some where I would never have gone on my own.<br />I look forward to reading other books by this author.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|&#34;The Hobbit&#34; was a little disappointing in that they overdid the CGI for the fight scenes and especially the absurd rabbit sled (however, the Goblin King was well done) and over-dramatized things a bit.  Seems like their target audience was children and adults with below-average intelligence but that is par for the course now with movies.  With the laughable rabbit sled and childish guffaws it made me think of Episode I.  The analogy is pretty strong - popular trilogy followed by another trilogy &#34;prequel.&#34; It wasn't that bad but the trend is there.<br /><br />Still, the overall movie was pretty good.
B005DZMODI|5.0|This duo does it right. These amazingly talented performers clearly know how to put together songs that showcase not only their individual talent, but also the talent of other musicians included.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I found the book keeping me in suspense from page one. It gave me an idea of how terrifying it must be experiencing a relationship like the described. Don't read it, if you don't have strong nerves
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I've been enjoying this game to kill time. Havent found the first few &quot;worlds&quot; challenging, but the game does make it easy to go on to the next level. Expect it to get harder. Fun game to just play when you don't want to think much.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  Incredible story telling and character development, with intrigue and suspense throughout.  The books tells so much about conditions in North Korea through a unique narrative.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|One of the best DVDs of Andrea Bocelli! Great artists and songs that will take your breath away! Worth every penny of it.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I think this is the best Daft Punk album so far. I love the disco sound from the 70s and the 80s. This really takes me back in time and I can`t stop listening to it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not put any one of these books down. They all kept me right on the edge of my seat and I was sad when I finished each of them. I am ready for the next one please do not make it to long.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|A very insightful, personal journey written with intense examination. The narrative is terse and  emotive without being excessive.  The story is believable
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was as good as any of the rest of them! If you have read them and like them, this one is worth getting too.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|It has changed my life tremendously! I recommend this book to everyone, it opens your mind to a whole new way of looking at the world, your life, your health, EVERYTHING!!
1449410243|5.0|Obviously for Cat lovers, which I am. It's a series of comics featuring two cats. Includes all the typical and strange things that cats do, like suddenly licking their butts.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is one of the best battery apps I have used. It syncs with the internal battery meter so it never tells me something different. It shows a percentage at the top and when I drag down the task bar. And as farad I've noticed, it has no impact on the battery life.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Mr Fox (George Clooney) is a great movie for the whole family.  It has a theme which transcends to both younger children and older children.  It made the aduls laugh and kept fast pace so the kids never lost interest.  We will watch this over and over.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Some has said this movie was racist but forgot to examine the times of which the movie was geared towards, the movie's focus was based off of that premise and in my opinion it was a really good film
B00006J3WH|5.0|Before Dr Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog.....Joss Whedon created a wonderful muscial on Buffy to express in song what the entrie team was hiding.  Each song has a powerful theme and great to sing a long in the car on a warm summer day.  My kids have never seen the show, but they know all the music by heart from this amazing CD.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|This is a fantastic movie, really, for the first 90 or 100 minutes of the movie. Action packed, but still keeping to the spirt and feel of Star Trek. We see old friends (Klingons), some \\"new\\" characters, with a hint that things aren't quite right. While I was skeptical of how they could possibly use Khan in this story, I think his backstory is credible enough to work. And then the filmmakers decided that they wanted to copy Wrath of Khan in the end. The reactor scene felt copied and unnecessary, and the \\"yell\\" is just painful. Once we push through that and get to Khan crashing the ship, things get a bit better. Fortunately, I don't think it ruins the movie too bad, but probably enough to drop it from a borderline 4/5 to 3 stars in my view.
B00002DE4H|5.0|A great collection of all the 80's club music.  New Order was truly a great group of the whole synthesized era.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie testifies to the true spirit of our people as whole,FAITH conquers ALL trails Please SEE this movie !!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Bravo!!!  Hurry with the next 'Room'  ! Loved the challenge.  If you love puzzles, this will blow your mind!
1932907009|5.0|Read it.  Use it.  It will guide your creative process.  If you are a struggling screenwriter, this may help you clean up your script, and hit the industry &#34;markers&#34; that are required.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Beautifully done. Whimsy with a little dash of physics, good timing, patience, and probably luck. I love playing this game.
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|I really like the variety of cameras and connections that are available... whether IP based or PC based or web based, I have been able to accessmy private and most publicly usable cameras.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I haven't used it much so I cannot comment on it with great certainty.  The number of times I have used it it has charged a single cell phone very quickly, less than 2.5 hours while driving. I have not tried it with two items so I cannot comment on that.  It is however worth a try given the price and also the fact that Anker products are outstanding in quality and performance.  The more expensive stuff out there that I have tried do not come close to this item nor do they it out perform this Anker product.  Recommendation: Get it without hesitation!
B0045JEPXU|5.0|I specifically bought this looking for some upbeat music to rebound to on my new circular trampoline, indoors. It definitely suits the purpose and I like that it's not just Pit Bull, but lots of other artists on the tracks also. Very smart marketing on his part! Supposedly there's explicit lyrics, but ever since American Bandstand live in the 50s I've never listened to lyrics. I go with the rhythm and beat.<br />100 on the rhythm and 95 on the beat, if I was voting w/Dick Clark back then.

B008J34466|5.0|Love everything Pink sings . This is worth every penny. What a beautiful voice and such great lyrics!!!!  Her talent shines through !  Every single song is awesome.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I bought the 12 song deluxe version of the CD. Could have had 13 with the Best Buy special, but easy ripped and right now download outweighed the issue of actually going retail.<br /><br />The band sounds great. Technically tight, lots of familiar patterns from the past, and a long slow energy build thru each song, and thru the album.<br /><br />Musically, it was much better that I had hoped.<br /><br />Audio, not so much. The MP3s were ripped at 256k. Other MP3s I've had from Amazon were ripped at insane. As such, the sound loses a lot, maybe.<br /><br />There are other reviews of the album describing the compression techniques and dynamic range compression the producer used. That's sad.<br /><br />Anyhow, I'm hoping that when the CD shows up, I can rip it to a better sonic quality. We shall see.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. Even though it takes some different directions from the book, it was still very entertaining. Acting, story, music, and setting are just how I imagined when I originally read. Give it a chance. :)
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Suggest you read the synopsis a few times on Wikipedia before watching this movie because otherwise it would be very difficult to follow and understand the plot. Once you understand the plot, it is an unusual and fascinating movie.
B0023SDQB2|4.0|The middle volume of Pat Barker's World War I trilogy.  It is set at Craiglockhart Hospital in Scotland, a facility for threating officers with shell shock.  Prime character is Dr. Rivers, a real historical figure, who treated Seigfreid Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, two of the major British poets of that war.  The novel leaves us with lots of questions.  How do you regenerate the spirit of people traumatized by war?  What is humane treatment.  Some of the questions about trauma trauma treatment are as relevant now as it was then.  A real good read.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|If you don't live near NYC, or aren't going to visit anytime soon, you should take out the \\"Kinky Boots\\" movie from 2005.  It's a pretty spectacular little show.  You'll come away from the video thinking that the lead guy in that movie is pretty spectacular too.  Mind you, it won't blow you away like the Broadway show, but it'll prepare you for this soundtrack disc.<br /><br />There are so many reasons this show won the Tony, Cindi Lauper's score won the Tony, and so did Billy Porter who plays Lola.<br /><br />Well, give Harvey Fierstein high credit for writing the book for the Broadway show, and for the producer's genius to get Cyndi Lauper to do the score.  On so many levels, this is a great thing.  One, Cyndi winning the Tony for the score, and first woman to do so. Two, for showing the multidimensional talent of Cyndi.  How great is it that an 80's star, who's had a pretty great singing career, can totally blow it out with this musical endeavor.  She is so very talented.  When you hear the cast singing her music, those of you who know Cyndi's music can hear her melody lines, in fact, the way she runs her notes, in many of the songs.  Quite challenging for the cast to sing I bet.<br /><br />Kinky Boots, the show, is such a spectacular, uplifting concept.  Shame if you can't see the show--I did in May 2013, and it was one of the most powerful, fun, entertaining, and positive Broadway shows I've seen in 30 years.  It was a great theme in the movie from 2005 and even more meaningful today: all people have worth, to be understanding and accepting of folk's differences, the strength that comes from a team pulling together, that good things can come true (they saved the English old men's shoe factory by retooling and cranking out cross dressers high heeled Kinky Boots).<br /><br />This musical builds and builds until the climax totally knocks you down.  Hats off to the group for singing it all, in the end, while wearing those really high heeled boots.  Billy Porter, who played the amazing Lola, wearing high heeled kinky shoes and boots through the entire show, also won a well deserved Tony.  You can hear his voice clearly through this entire disc.  Notable is Billy's emotion charged solo near the end of the disc.  It was an event to see him do it live, almost, as if, one of the top divas in music who left us recently had returned to the stage and was inhabiting him.  Billy Porter is a force of nature, and you can hear this great star on the disc.<br /><br />I'm not sure what songs we'll be singing together in the future from Kinky Boots.  But this show rocks, promotes positive themes and thoughts, and it's based on a true story.  This is a real fun soundtrack.  Enjoy.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows ever produced.  Why did they have to discontinue it so soon I wonder.  It's rare that a TV show is made this good.  For the most part TV shows are 2nd rate and disappointing.
B00006GO99|5.0|okay well here goes .. I am not a music expert ... I like to listen to different genres of music.  So I decided to taste this American music icon's music.  All I can say is .... Mr. Monk's music flows like ribbon in the wind, water flowin' down a river ... so stimulating intellectually speaking ... it's like he and his ensemble are talking to you in a different language and while a person may not be fluent in jazz, Thelonious Monk makes it beautiful and delicious to the taste!
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My Grandson is a huge minecraft fan and was very happy with these and they look just like the blocks in the game but it is way overpriced for what you get.  Not many pieces and very small.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard such good things about this show so I watched the first two seasons on demand in one weekend and then had to buy Season 3 cause I couldnt wait!  Highly recommended!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Best HBO series since \\"Rome.\\" Loving it! I purchased the first season from Amazon because it is no longer available in demand.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|Well, I have never read a book, but I saw the preview of the movie and it was very interesting. For the first time the preview was more interesting than a movie. It was not an easy to follow movie. All I could understand is that it's about past, future and present lives. But who is whom and what's going on.....no clue! I was confused and, honestly, bored! I gave it 2 stars because the acting was amazing. Other than that, I am so glad I decided to rent a movie. If I bought if, it would be a waste of money!
B0053KWDES|5.0|I really like my first amp, only problem I need a holder for this and my iphone good for traveling but no for walking.

B00BEXB18M|5.0|If you are reading the reviews of this album you need to stop and add it to your cart now. Continue all the way through and choose a shipping address. Now friends you are on the way to a climax of the ears.  No joke here. I am serious. This is the best album i have purchased that i have not skipped a single damn track. Add this to your collection and be prepared to be amazed. Its hard to explain the satisfaction your brain will enjoy. To be frank the sounds coming from this record will provoke an instant smile on your face, some head banging, air guitar, and air drumming.  Anyway i can't type much more as i need to get back to my new album.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|Got for my kids but I play it more than they do.  I guess it was from my childhood that my love for pinball comes from.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Such a good show. I love it. It's interesting and the characters are as well. Different than other law shows.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a fantastic read. Incredible depth, fantastic characters and very difficult to put down. Highly recommend this even if you are not a sci-fi fan.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Another great book, written well with an amazing story.  I'm getting ready to start the next book.  I worked like to see this story turned into a movie, as it could do well.
0307704610|3.0|The diet basically follows a low carb diet (the author calls it \\"Slow Carb,\\" but same difference) six days a week plus one day of \\"Binge Day\\" where you go nuts and eat whatever you want.  If someone has some good understanding of nutrition, exercise, and how the body works, there are a lot of good information in this book that will supplement a person's overall health.  I will say that overall, I do not recommend this book to the next person who wants to loose weight.  Too many over-promises that will easily hurt someone more than it benefits them.<br /><br />What I am a fan of:<br />- Low/Good carb and high protein diet.<br />- \\"Binge Day\\" actually makes medical sense.  Fluctuating and shoking your system once in a while will prevent plateau and your body going into survival mode.<br />- Cold therapy, shower, ice packs.  Being cold burns more calorie, perfectly reasoned.<br /><br />What I am not a fan of:<br />- How easy most people will abuse this program: shrimp wrapped in bacon is allowed on the diet, if not encouraged, anyone can tell you that's bad if you eat it with every meal.<br />- False sense that you don't need to exercise to build muscle.  When you body goes through ketosis, which occurs during a low carb diet, it will tap into your reserve fat.  But fat loss does not equal to muscle gain.  If you don't exercise, you won't gain muscles.<br />- The many contraditions.  Example: (1) don't count calories, like, ever, but remember to eat a 300-500 calorie breakfast on binge day. (2) Go nuts on Binge Day, but really, you shouldn't go too nuts. (3) Dairy is forbitten, but remember to use a full-fat creamer with your coffee every morning... etc etc.<br />- The concept of \\"Binge Day\\" is way too overpromising.  As mentioned, it makes medical sense. However, going nuts to the way the author described (basically go to a buffet and eat everything deep fried or sweet, remember to do 30-50 squats beforehand and you will be fine) it is just unsafe.  I think the authorcould do a better job in putting some context around Binge Day, such as focusing on good sugar (fruits) and practice some sort of moderation/control to establish good eating habits for life.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|A must see! Makes me feel like a kid again! Filled with adventure! My son absolutely loves the movie. The 880's were awesome! They just dont make films like this anymore!

B009CWWFD2|5.0|I had read Cane and Abel years before and so was a little worried if this book would be the same. I needn't have worried; I found I could not put this book down. It was fascinating to read about newspaper moguls and the life they lead. The end starts at the beginning really. So you have a good idea how one of the characters ends up. The book spans the period from before the Second World War to the time when Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister of Great Britain. It deals with the persecution of Jews and the rise to power of one of them after his miraculous escape from capture. He began with nothing, the other character had everything, shades of Cane and Abel? I guess so. Both of the characters had trouble with the unions which could, and did, destroy many business. To say more would spoil the read. Where they lucky in love? Did they end with riches? Read the book, you will not be disappointed.
0979019710|5.0|What an excellent book.  I have recommended it to everyone that has a challenge or wants to improve their lives.  If he can overcome his tragedy, then we should realize we can overcome anything we want.  His recipes for healthier living are outstanding.  It's a fast read & very well worth your time.
B00908DDZM|4.0|i really enjoy the cd.  much of his music is heartfelt and sincere.  the hits are only part of his talents.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|This is one of our favorite CD's.  Can I say it is classic, yet eclectic?  And timeless...this captures the essence of the band without dating them.  You will find this quickly taking a favorite role in your music collection.

B0073LWEXK|2.0|This game has lovely scenes, but the play is a bit clumsy, and after a few days, I quit trying to find my way around.
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|I'm really loving this album, I personally think it's really good. It kind of is almost a renewal of what they did on Masters of Reality and a number of the other albums that came out around the same time. The bits where they're jamming on this album I think are better though than what they were in the past. Would think this is an album that would appeal mostly to those who have been fans a long time, people like myself. It's pretty much the kind of album that I expected to be hearing when I got the download.<br /><br />When Black Sabbath came out they were really different. They were true trend setters. The heavy bass sound, particular drum styling's, guitar romps that were mixed together with Ozzy's voice really captivated my attention. Of course the name of the group helped. My parents absolutely hated them which made me want to listen to their albums even more. It actually added to the allure.<br /><br />These guys are of course now becoming senior citizens, they are all in their sixty's. They're not young anymore but I think this album proves they still mostly got it. I've been a fan of Black Sabbath since the late 1970's. It makes me feel a little old now that I think of how many years that's been.

B009NY43NY|2.0|Not as turn paging as the last couple of books. You can tell she was done writing with book 12. This wasn't much better.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|So after a long delay since 2007's \\"Era Vulgaris\\", and Homme's busy sidetracking with various other bands, here returns one the greats in modern rock and one of my favorite bands, releasing what I call their \\"mature\\" record.  I was initially disappointed on the first listen, but it has certainly grown on me with subsequent spins.  Much about the record has been described here in extremely positive and enthusiastic reviews, so I'll keep it relatively short.  What is wonderful about Homme is that we will never have to fear him submitting to any current sound and trends in music; he has pure and true rock and roll in his veins and loves it too much to ever do such a thing.  And thankfully, due to such perpetual reliability, what we have here is undoubtedly the best rock album of the past five five/six years.  It's a tight, cohesive work; sonically precise and innovative, sexy and adult (Homme has always been mature with his music but this is the pinnacle here).  However, as another reviewer had mentioned, this is the first Queens record where I can blatantly hear the influence of other artists and a pervasive classic rock influence, whereas previous QOTSA albums sounded more like their own unique signature \\"desert, druggy rock\\" (which I really dig). I hear a significant Neil Young sound and style on more than a couple songs.  And it's all good of course, but the lot of it is mid-tempo, and the overall sound is relatively narrow and diminutive to me.  It's hard to describe, but their previous works had more of a wider, fatter, guitar-oriented, and and dare I say, more collectively atmospheric sound.  I could have used one or two extra songs to fill in the lack of thundering rhythm guitar.  I have to say though, \\"Fairweather Friends\\", is one of the best songs Homme has written and is up there with my favorite Queens tracks.  Close runner up is \\"I Appear Missing\\" and \\"If I Had a Tail\\".  These are excellent cuts, but for me, tracks such as \\"Like Clockwork\\" (VERY Neil Young) and \\"Kalopsia\\" don't quite blow my skirt up.  I'm also surprised that no one has mentioned how much \\"Smooth Sailing\\" sounds like it could be on \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\". It has such a similar sound and style that is in line with that album.<br /><br />QOTSA have never put out a bad record, and don't get me wrong, \\"...Like Clockwork\\" is a very good one.  It's just that, the whole time I was waiting for one of those immediately gratifying tracks that would blow me away, like \\"Turning on the Screw\\" and \\"3's & 7's\\" did for me last time.  The only one that kind of did that for me here was \\"Fairweather Friends\\".  And, with only 10 songs, and my only really liking half of them, it makes the record seem much smaller than it is.  And for its all-star rock cast (from Grohl to Reznor to Sir Elton John), their influence on here is so subtle I can't even tell their involvement.  Yet, the CD has managed to stay in my car's player for a while now; it is a delight to listen to and is akin to a fine wine in its ability to grow on you.  All in all, growth and maturity in rock and roll can be great as it is here, but it's somehow lacking the same one-two punch as say, their first three albums with Nick Oliveri, in addition to the heavier guitar riffing.  Though that, along with the predominance of more low key songs, probably makes this the most appealing and accessible Queens to general music lovers.  I still believe their first self-titled album to be the best of them all, with \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" a very close second.  I do like every Queens album, and this one is no exception; a strong breath of fresh air in a bankrupt music world that is completely devoid of true rock and roll.) and \\"Kalopsia\\" don't quite blow my skirt up.

B002KREVE2|4.0|Did not like this album as well as the other one live from England I listen to it over over great music!!!!!!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is a shining example of keeping a creative force such as the original lineup of Black Sabbath dormant for 35 years then pouring that creativity onto 54 minutes of recorded sound. 13 is no less than a masterpiece of music. Producer Rick Rubin,who hasnt made a bad album yet,combines the explosive riffs,chugging bass,and thunderous drums of the Sabs first four albums into what i believe should be album of the year. Key tracks here are End Of The Beginning,God is Dead?,Zeitgeist,and Damaged Soul.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game I've ever played its so better then temple run and other games it is SO awsome and cool funk & entertaining
B004EPYZXU|3.0|Interesting idea I had not thought of so I give it 3 stars. As for the film itself, I just could not connect to the characters. When they were scared, I wasn't scared. It started off interesting but somehow lost me along the way. When I found out what the big deal was, it didn't really seem that big of a deal after all. Not going to give it away but I saw many holes in the script as well that just were too distracting. There is one point when the acting seems over the top as well.. these are good actors by the way, but in this venture it just doesn't gel for me.
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|I am a life-long fan of Paul McCartney, and while I was young enough to catch the tail-end of the Beatles, I really grew up in my teenage years with Paul McCartney & Wings (I was 13 when Band on the Run was released). Despite all that, I had never bought \\"Wings Over America\\" but with the recent re-release and it being available at a very fan-friendly price, I finally gave in.<br /><br />\\"Wings Over America\\" (2CDs, 30 tracks; 116 min.) aims to bring a setlist that copies the actual setlist from a typical night on the 1976 tour in support of \\"Wings At the Speed of Sound\\", released in March of that year. Yet you might be surprised that \\"Wings Over America\\" tilts HEAVILY towards \\"Venus And Mars\\" (released in 1975). It boggles the mind that no less than 10 songs from that album are on here. I mean, I love \\"Venus and Mars\\" but to include 10 songs from it on here? That means: nothing from \\"Ram\\" and only 1 track each from \\"McCartney\\" and \\"Red Rose Speedway\\". On the (major) plus side, the last 6 songs on CD1 form an acoustic mini-set that is, for me anyway, THE highlight of this live recording, and one is each better than the other, starting with \\"Picasso's Last Words\\", and all the way through \\"Yesterday\\". CD2 is tainted by the completely unneccesary inclusion of \\"Go Now\\" (the Moody Blues tune from Denny Laine's days in that band) and \\"Time To Hide\\", the Laine-fronted track from \\"At the Speed of Sound\\". And how in the world can the evening end with a semi-obscure track like \\"Soily\\"? If it rocked the house, it'd be alright I suppose, but it is a mediocre song at best. Wow. (There is also a 3CD version of this release, with the bonus CD giving you 8 more songs, not different songs, mind you. I really don't see the point of it.)<br /><br />Last but not least, I am not impressed with the packaging of this reissue: a flimsy 8 page booklet, that's it. No liner notes, no extensive pictures, no liner credits on where these songs were recorded, etc. Compared to the stellar jpb of some of the other reissues (check out \\"Band On the Run\\", for example), it is truly surprising how this is lacking. \\"Wings Over America\\" nowadays is more important for its historical significance than for its musical merits, as it is the only official live album from McCartney covering the 70s and 80s, and it would be another 14 years after that before we'd see another live recording (1990's \\"Tripping the Live Fantastic\\").<br /><br />Bottom line: music: 3 stars; packaging: 2 stars; historical significance: 4.5 stars; economic value: 5 starse of the other reissues (check out \\"Band On the Run\\", for example), it is truly surprising how this is lacking. \\"Wings Over America\\" nowadays is more important for its historical significance than for its musical merits, as it is the only official live album from McCartney covering the 70s and 80s, and it would be another 14 years after that before we'd see another live recording (1990's \\"Tripping the Live Fantastic\\").<br /><br />Bottom line: music: 3 stars; packaging: 2 stars; historical significance: 4.5 stars; economic value: 5 stars
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Leaves you hanging for more cant wait to see we're the next book will take Gideon, Eva and even Cary
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Amazing lyrics, fascinating story, you must also watch the movie (won't regret it).<br />I had the movie on my DVR for a while but kept pushing it at the bottom of the list - how ironic and close to the story.<br />Even it had an Oscar I was still not giving it a chance - my reaction was the prequel. Brilliantly sad.<br />Same night I bought the album - best purchase in many years.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a great bingo game.  So many games to play, so many chances to win and collect pieces to win more.  And don't forget the free daily tournament.  I never miss a day.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|But season 2 is better.  The actors were more relaxed and not trying too hard.  The music was also better.  Keep in mind that I saw season 2 first.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Its fun and the graphics are great. You can unlock characters and items. You can collect coins and even hook it up to your Facebook  page. I would recommend this game to anyone!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book.  The form it took, the characters and the way the letters brings each and every person into focus.  A must read.
B004CURZFC|4.0|I liked this movie more then my 6 year old. She got bored with it half way thru. I would watch it again.
B00847KFDS|5.0|The booklet contains John's explanation for each featured song being originally written. The most notable among them is for Fortunate son. John includes a picture of himself in Army uniform, and says that that a lot of Americans didn't support their government. I'll add that Vietnam is one conflict that Britain did not support America either.<br /><br />John performs two songs solo, the rest featuring guests that made their names in either country or rock music. This mix of styles will not please everybody, but it pleases me, especially as the differences are not as marked as the genes might suggest.<br /><br />While the songs are mostly re-workings of Creedence hits, there are some less obvious songs here and a few great Creedence hits are absent. Still, this is a great album of its type and may even tempt some into buying the originals.
080701429X|5.0|Dr. Frankl gives a new way to look at any situation you may be in. I have read this book many times and keep giving it away. I would reccomend anyone looking to understand their path in life or any problems/stress they may be facing to read this book. Definatly worth the time.
B00499NHLC|5.0|As a Sherlock Holmes fan (I've read most of the stories, watched all the Downey movies, and the CBS show), I wanted to see the British version.  Needless to say, I was impressed.  Cumberbatch is brilliant as Holme, quirky and deeply interesting.  A must see if you are Sherlock Holmes fan.
B002MX9YJQ|5.0|Great dynamics and mastering here. No nasty compression to be afraid of on this one. This is how music should sound. It really grates on my knowing that so many bands under the tutelage of people like Rubins and Co. push their discs to absurd levels. This disc was made in Germany and it shows. You don't really need to know anything about the album you cannot find elsewhere. The deluxe is perfect and totally worth it in every way. Classic album also gets the deluxe treatment with an extra CD that truly has a nice array of past mixes, remixes from 2009, and other goodies fans will certainly want. CD came in great packaged condition unlike some deluxes that have seemingly been sitting for years and are all beat up. Highest recommendation.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is a simply wonderful romance novel. While most series tend to lessen in quality in the later books, Singh avoids the dip with this book and kicks this series into a new level of goooood.<br /><br />What Singh does so wonderfully in this book is give us a romance focused book while forward the plot arc of the series. This book promises that in the rest of the books of the series we will be living in a new reality. In essence, we get a brand new series with new rules as the Psy come out of Silence. (I don't think this is much of  a spolier as it has been coming for ever) This is going to be so much fun!!<br /><br />The heroine of this book is the one great love of the hero's life. His only love.  He gives her everything she needs even when it isn't what he needs. I am not saying his name in case you don't know.<br /><br />The hero is divine. He is one of those hero's who is dark and dangerous and loves flat out. Love him.<br /><br />The heroine is wise and brave and has awesome superpowers.<br /><br />How they love each other is aching, sweet, and  very sexy.  Psy and Psy love is new to this series and I love it!<br /><br />We get to see favorite characters.<br /><br />However, even if you have never read this series, you would still really adore this book. And if you already read this series, you are going to do a happy dance, it is that good.<br /><br />Engaging, emotional, poetic the writing really brings this world, the characters and this love alive. ']<br /><br />The title for this book is perfect. It is an extended metaphor that connects all the strands of the sereis and embodies the romance in this book.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Good idea, but when I talked to the cat, he didn't always talk back.  What a bummer! Needs some debugging.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|The music is great. I received CD when promised. I saw Fleetwood Mac in concert and they still have it.
B000IDGDPA|5.0|Excellant movie worth renting or buying.  Helen Hunt is Magnificent in the role.  Her acting is sensitive and spectacular as usual.
0385349947|1.0|If you're looking for actual advice at how to be a woman in the work place and deal with the various politics you will have to inevitably deal with - don't bother reading this book. The second she gets onto an interesting topic and starts investigating the psychology behind what's happening in a given situation, is the second she derails, drops a few names followed by a statistic, and gives no actual advice or constructive break down. If you're looking for actual guidance, read \\"PushBack\\" - Sandberg is cited in it for her TEDTalk, and then it gives you something useful to work with. Or \\"Work Happy\\" is fantastic as well - though it pretty much comprises Covey and Carnegie, like most management books do in one way or another...<br /><br />I'm not sure if she's trying to market this book as business management help or not - but it's really not useful for that, like the title suggests. I think the useful advice could be whittled down to about 30 pages. If she actually broke down what was happening systematically in any one of her chapters, then it could be useful for women to work with and start paying attention to what they can do to help themselves out. If I could give this book half a star, I would. If I could get my money back from buying this book in the first place, I would.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Great science fiction movie classic.  Really enjoyed watching this very entertaining movie about the future of society.  Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|very good game some flaws but great overall need nether and a boss monster not like the enderdragon just a really tough monster
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a super cool app, very User friendly, a must have for people who travel, it's nice to have that extra clock/alarm in your hotel room. I really love how you can add your songs, you get the weather right there on the same screen.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|It wasn't nearly as good as the first two books. If I had read it first, I wouldn't have bothered reading the other two.
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|The book intrigues me alot it makes me want to join the opposition against the mean king who enslaved his people
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book was a surprise..never expected the outcome in it. Hated for it to end. Complemented the first book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great multiplayer and single player game. This portrays the computer version well. The only thing I wish they would add is the ability to change your skin and Redstone. Over all this is a 5 out of 5 for great multiplayer action and how much fun it is.
B00992CF6W|4.0|We finally got an update. The app is amazing, but Amazon needs to get the updates faster.Anyway, its worth the seven bucks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I am in the car or wherever it doesn't have wifi, this is a great app  toplay kills time and  is really fun! Great for kids around my age (I'm 12)
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I was not expecting the writing style but I really liked how the stories were told. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|But the servers for mulitiplayer are down so we can't play online with the new update mobjang needs to hurry up but other then that it's good
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Anyway, removable media is going away. Especially DVD. iTunes has this collection for $59.99 this week in HD. So much more convenient on my Apple TV.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|we like this game. it starts slow but once you get your reef going new fish come to visit and others get to live in your reef.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|A bit too violent for me but I like Tommy Lee Jones.  It is worth viewing as a prime customer.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It a game when you have nothing to do and you  get to make and control Avery thing and make it work.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|this is a story/movie that appeals to me so decided to watch.  Liked the story and the people who stared in it.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|So glad to see a frank movie about the role of sex in our lives.  Helen Hunt is incredible.  Bravo.
B008XG1X18|4.0|There are a few things that I cant do in this app vs. the original browser. But overall I like it. It takes awhile to start up but it teaches me patience.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is better than others in so many ways--The collections in all the different cities, the tournaments and even the cities themselves keep this game from ever being a monotonous drone of number calling. It also has the best graphics and sound of all those I've played. I love the little details, such as the \\"Mind the gap!\\" Lady in London.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Like all the options. Could be playing for awhile.... my son and I enjoy playing this game together. Let's see how far we can go.
0525478817|5.0|I purchased this book without any prior knowledge of its plot or who John Green was, so I think I was pretty unbiased going into it. All I knew was that everyone was reading it and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and boy am I glad that I did. This is one of the best books I have ever read, especially in the \\"Teen\\" genre, and I have read A LOT of teen books. Not only is the story really entertaining and never dull, but the characters are FANTASTIC. Seriously, a few chapters in I found myself in awe of how relatable, realistic, hilarious, and lovable the narrator, Hazel, is. She's just amazing. For some reason I'm always hesitant when I see a male author writing from a female perspective, but John Green executes it perfectly. I was literally laughing out loud at what she was saying, which is perfect because, while the novel is hilarious, it also tears out your heart and rips it into a million pieces. This book will make you feel every emotion possible, and it will dig down deep inside your heart to make sure you never forget it. Novels written for the young adult market very rarely capture the voice of that generation as well as this one does. It really is worth the two days it might take you to read it, and I promise you it will make you a John Green fan for life.
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|Another awesome album from Blake Shelton. He is quickly becoming the stuff of country legends. Love him and his beautiful wife!
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|I have to say that I like this effort by the great GB.<br />This musical effort shows his amazing versatility as an artist!<br />The only problem that I have is that so many people have recorded these songs by Nat Cole that I have to put this particular cd in the good but not great range of the GB cannon! While listening to this session on my kindle fire (which by the way sounds great) I kept thinking about \\"Tenderly\\" which GB recorded some years ago and is in my opinion one of his best jazz efforts.<br />Just listen to Tenderly if you own it. You'll see what I mean.<br />I wish that GB's tribute to Nat Cole would have been a two cd offering.<br />It would have been great to hear Benson swing some instrumental tunes that Nat recorded with his trio but in a more modern tense! Overall, I am glad that I have this one.<br />I just think that GB could have developed this a bit more akin to the Tenderly session he recorded for Warner.
0896898288|5.0|I do not have an opinion on this product. It will take two years for me to formulate an opinion.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|There are a few instrumental songs on the album that I am not a huge fan of but the songs with lyrics are great. There is maybe 1 that I don't care for. They a changed their sound drastically, yes, but I still love these guys!
B00008F1MG|5.0|I love this record.  One of my favorite YLT.  Great covers (kinks - oklahoma USA). Tried so hard to leave her, and great originals.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|I love this movie. Great story and well acted! Probably one of the best surf movies I have seen and I have seen ALOT with my son and hubby being surfers. And definitely glad I was able to see it on the big screen. So worth the $9!
B008RZ96RS|5.0|Well, I've probably bought this record 6 or 7 times in various vinyl/Cd releases.<br /><br />But this will be the definitive.<br /><br />Great booklet.  Glad to have the Nico record.<br /><br />The live stuff is just above mediocre.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Feels a little strange from the default controller for maybe about 10 minutes, then you quickly get used to it. Good quality material, everything's been working great for the last couple of weeks.<br /><br />Only downside is that it doesn't come with its own mini-USB connector to the PS3. It didn't prove to be disastrous as I was also getting a charging station at the same time, but just be aware that such a cable is not included.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Cute game, but not entirely user friendly. Some of the achievements require signing into social media like Facebook, which I don't have, or buying &quot;peanuts&quot; to access certain animals.<br /> On the plus side, I like the mythical animals you can create and breed, and the game has quick animal facts, so you're learning as you play.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|true to the Lincoln Lawyer style, this is another great book.  if you are a Connelly fan (as I am) don't miss this one.  riviting
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|The film really gets 3.5 stars but rounded up since it did provide a few laughs based on its b-rated action. This is something that the SF channel might have made except the story gets your attention rather than silly effects. Hansel and Gretel had a childhood trauma and their response is to hunt and kill all the witches. As adults they carry around quite the arsenal- rapid fire crossbows, pre modern shotguns, chainwhips, a taser, even a modular gatling gun! The film has to be watched as an alternate world take on the tale and ignore all the inaccuracies. The movie has RENTAL all over it, and for that the film does so honestly. The trailer shows some good action and the film delivers that along with a few groans. The trend of retelling old tales might be running its course but this film is one of the better ones. Watch it, laugh at it, and don't think about the five bucks you spent. Its still better than whats on tv.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|the Lincoln lawyer goes head to head with some heavy weights and its another page turner for all of us Connelly fans to enjoy
B009E3EWPI|5.0|&#34;Celebration Day&#34; is the concert the surviving members of Led Zeppelin performed back in 2007.  Featuring the late Jon Bonham's son Jason, who in my opinion, is the ONLY one to man those massive percussion riffs.  Sure, the guys are older, a bit slower and Robert's voice can't hit those high notes anymore, but the songs still back a punch even when tuned a whole step lower.  So, do they look like 3 old geezers and a middled-age guy trying to reach their glory days?  I don't think think.  These characters can still turn it up and turn it on.  The occassional blasts of feedback from Jimmy's guitar weren't gated and could be a bit of annoyance to some.  The digital lighting and effects made me long for the analog effects of yesterday but overall, this film is a thumbs up from me.  These guys can STILL crank it up.  Will the mighty Zeppelin ever rise again?  Will we ever hear some new Led Zep?  Time will tell, so I guess for now, this is a another collection of re-fueled tunes from the masters of rock.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I've always enjoyed the different characters in Baldacci's books, and Will Robie is no exception.  He's better than Jack Reacher, not as tough as Mitch Rapp, but I still love all three of these guys.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Fun game...I have sometimes beat the akinator..My grand daughter really likes this. It is amazing sometimes how he guesses correctly.
0525478817|3.0|This is not going to be one of those reviews where I tell you how much this book made me sob like a baby, or how much it tore my heart out. Why? Because this book didn't do that to me. I wanted it to, and it did...to some extent. But honestly? It was kind of a let down from my high expectations. I really don't know what to think. This book was good...but then...and there was this...and GAH. The whole book reading experience was like WHAT AM I FEELING? I just don't know. But I shall attempt to sort these feelings out, so this resembles a review...sorta.<br /><br />For starters, if you know anything about this book, let it be that the characters are brains. Hazel and Gus have some pretty knowledgeable conversations. And there is nothing wrong with that, but maybe I was looking for more depth, but I felt like there were times when it got a little too...info dumpy. Yes, you are smart John, we watch you on YouTube, but maybe cut it back? It wasn't terrible at all, but I wasn't looking to read lots of info. I wanted the emotions. That's one of the things where it started to go wrong for me.<br /><br />Because of instances like this, where we had more talk, I didn't feel all the depth I would expect. As this book progressed, my emotions weren't really on this roller coaster I thought they would be. Sure I was hooked, and intrigued, but it was all flat. In a way I was just reading to see what all the popular fuss was about. I was constantly asking myself, how do I feel about this? But that was the problem. I didn't know, because I WASN'T feeling. I'm probably sticking out like a sore thumb here, because like every other person on the planet felt and bawled and blagh.<br /><br />So just to set you straight, the end did get to me. I didn't bawl, but on a few precise, probably obvious moments, I teared up and sniffled. But I didn't sniffle and ugly cry at all. Only one other book has come close to the ugly-crying I thought I'd experience with this book. So yeah...that was a bummer. I WANTED AN UGLY CRY BOOK. I freely admit this. I went into it with that expectation. Heck, I love cry books and movies. I embrace them when I find the true gems. Those are the ones that make me feel. But this one?<br /><br />Yeah it's kinda sad. But moving on.There were some things I really liked about this book though. For one thing, our characters Hazel and Augustus are incredibly strong. Hazel has a beautiful voice that stands out. She is a totally honest character. So is Gus. They don't waste time, they speak their mind and I loved how they weren't just weak whiny children because of their limitations. They don't let things stop them, and they live life the best they can.<br /><br />Speaking of them. Let's talk romance. This was kinda hilarious actually. Because they hit it off with a boom. They meet. Gus just comes right up to her, they kinda hit it off as if they already know each other and then boom, it's like the beginnings of their friendship/romance. It's not like insta-love or anything. It was just interesting to see how easily they hit it off. But I'm leaving that there, without a negative or positive thought. Because I really don't know what to say. It works, but does it feel legit? SEE MY INTERNAL DILEMMAS?!?!  *sigh* So the romance. I loved them together. I think they worked so well. The friendship that they build worked really well and felt as if they'd known each other for years. So when they get to that awkward in between stage it just worked. I loved them. I LOVED Gus. Okay yeah, I have to say something about Gus. EEEEEEK. I really liked him, despite some of the things that didn't work for me. He is snarky, funny, charming, polite, and just one of those guys you don't want to let go. And that's where it hurts.<br /><br />Which brings me to my thoughts on the issues portrayed and discussed in this book. Obviously, cancer, and the hardships/struggles, whatnot. Hazel obviously knows that her condition is terminal and that life could be as short as the next breath. So she's trying to make the most of the rest of her time.<br /><br />I'm sorry. I had to put this in here.<br />But you know...honestly? I'd heard of so many issues and things being presented..but I must have failed to see them or something. Because I got the nice quotes, but the underlying themes? Not so much. I know I'm so stinking blind. Wow. I don't even know what to say anymore. I appreciated the lessons and courageous things portrayed, but we're back to the lack of emotion.<br /><br />I'm gonna shut up now. I'm sorry for this insanely long brain vomit. But honestly..this was my thought process. I missed some level of connection that would have made this book so much more important to me. This is the the worst case of Black Sheepitis ever. So while I missed that, I'm not going to push it aside, because as mentioned, there were some very redeeming qualities about the book. I enjoyed reading it, and think it told a lovely story that is easy to enjoy. However, in my place, my nit picky brain just got in the way.<br /><br />Content: Moderate<br />[some languange including uses of S word and one of F word.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is just like real solitaire. you can choose to flip cards 3 at a time or one at a time. It is just harder to cheat with this one but you can ask for a winning game so I guess that is like cheating.
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|I bought this item for my 3 year old daughter who LOVES Sofia the first. I was very disappointed with the product. Sofia and Amber's heads fall off all the time. The only one who can stand up on their own is the queen. The Sofia doll's hair has spots where you can tell the plastic pieces were broken apart in production. Not worth the money I spent on them, but it is hard to tear them away from my daughter. I just keep having to put heads back on and continually stand them up to make her happy. This product could have been so much better.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Love this! I haven't truly exercised in about 7 years(back when I was in amazing condition playing soccer and running every day) and since then I've been saying I would get back into exercising but I always use the excuse I don't have time. I just did my first day on the first workout and it was amazing! I'm still getting down from the high of the workout! Pretty much all of the moves are things that I used to do in my strength and conditioning classes but you have to keep up with it and don't let yourself take breaks. By the end I caught myself getting lazy with the moves but hopefully I can stop that!<br /><br />Definitely wear decent shoes when doing this! Right off the bat I noticed my arches getting a little strained.<br /><br />All in all I thought this was a fun workout and I hope I can remember to continue doing this so that I can get back to being in great shape!
B00B84652O|5.0|He should be bigger. He's so brainy and deep not like that drugged out Ozzy. This boxed set gives you just the tunage, which is all you need.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|First book in the series and very entertaining. I enjoyed every page. Nikki and Rook are a delightful pair. Eager to read the next book and already have it. A good mystery and a modern day read. It had me laughing while keeping me intrigued.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child must be a very interesting man because he creates such wonderful characters.  I'm wildly in love with Reacher.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is the best game ever. But the prices are too high. Still a great game though. But the best game ever.
B0019IMVDG|3.0|This movie seemed like it would never end.  But, on the other hand, it is based on a true story.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I love the weather and have many applications to check on it. I use this one consistently. It has a very nice user interface. Every once in a while, it assumes I am a new user requiring me to reenter my locations. If not for that, I'd give it five stars.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|This is seriously the first album I've ever owned and can start it on the first song and just let it play through.  It's extremely dark and very heavy.  Their last albums sounded like every other band out there, but this one puts them in their own category.  They tested the waters with altering their sound a little and it paid off.  This album is very very good.  Don't hesitate to buy it.  The sound is massive and deep in this one.  Good job guys!
1400052181|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone.  It's interesting,well written, and Henrietta Lacks is a person whose life we should all know.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I used to be a movie buff, but have stopped watching as many movies in the last few years. The reason being is that movies these days lack substance and are derivative. I was not familiar with Jennifer Lawrence, since I haven't watched The Hunger Games. After seeing her stellar performance, I want to watch every movie she's ever starred in. This movie is emotionally charged and moved me indescribably. I think everyone has a \\"crazy\\" misunderstood side to them. Love makes us crazy and do crazy things. (I don't like using the term crazy, since I think it's politically incorrect.) What I mean by crazy here is something that makes us tick. I related to Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) and their struggles and perseverance to see the silver lining. I think everyone can relate to these characters, since we are all at one point or another trying to see the silver lining in an adversity. Everything from the script to the plot was beautifully executed. The actors' performance was nothing short of amazing. I was instantly immersed into the story and didn't want it to end. I'm the type who gets restless and can't sit through an hour and a half movie, but with this one, I remained glued to my seat. This movie is worth your time and money. Believe the hype.
0425263924|2.0|This book wasn't what I expected. It should have benn finished in this book to me. The first and second book was awesome but not this book!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Did not play video because it will not open. NOW I CANNOT GET IT OFF MY KINDLE FIRE.  Do not install this app.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Took me awhile to find a platform for this game I could run on my Sony tablet, but this one did! It doesn't have all the bells.and whistles of the full priced pop cap game (tree of wisdom, mini games endless zombies) but it satisfies my zombie cravings!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Weather Live gives all the pertinent facts for 24 in a quick, neat, easy format, plus a beautiful background photo. It's perfect when you're in a hurry.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This is a great movie.  It demonstrates the passion...and sometimes misguided direction of a teenager.  It also shows how the father, mother, and Merida (the teenager) have to change their ways of thinking to better understand and love each other.  I found it to be a powerful movie that takes you through a range of emotions.
193700788X|2.0|Warning, there will be some spoilers in this review.<br /><br />I'm not giving a plot overview, because really, there isn't much of a plot. And that's the main issue with the last few Sookie Stackhouse books. In Dead Ever After the 'plot' is that Arlene is killed and the police think Sookie did it. But in actuality, very little happens in this book. It's like a free-flowing inner monolog interspersed with clothing and meal details.<br /><br />It's also a 'take a bow' book for several characters. Quinn makes a return, doesn't do anything and then vanishes. Amelia and Bob team up with Barry the Bellboy and the demons but they don't really do anything either. They just sit around and eat (and get shot).<br /><br />But here's the main issue. Sookie and Eric have been together, off and on, since book 4. But in Dead Ever After, he appears twice, says three lines and is dismissed. I'm sorry, but you can't have a relationship that lasts that long be wiped clean in three pages (and those pages aren't even together). I don't mind who sookie ends up with (though how that came about lacked details and was just disappointing. And that sex scene? Terrible!), but you have to do justice to Eric. And Harris just throws him away.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this from the library because, honestly, it's not worth the money. This series started out so well and just completely fell flat. I think I'll keep books 1-5 and sell the rest.
B0000C1733|5.0|LOVED getting the free digital copy immediately!  I also got the CD quickly and it was exactly as expected - great quality, still shrink wrapped.

B007N8RULO|5.0|I purchased the Brainium's version of spider solitaire from Amazon after a month of playing another company's game--it was too frustrating in the way it worked.  I found the Brainium game and enjoy the play action so much more.  I particularly like the touch-and-move action, although the cards don't always move to where I had mentally placed them.  My only negative comment is about the pop-up for other games that appear after long play.  In any case, this was a good purchase!
B003M5AXN4|5.0|I love this movie because of the vibrant colors. Acting in the movie was great.  Go Speed Racer was not a cartoon I used to watch as a kid, but was told to watch it, glad that I did.  The special effects were great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is really fun I play the Pc version But I think Minecraft pe needs updates my cousin has buckets in his game.
0670026603|5.0|One word: YES. This book lives up to the hype.<br /><br />Honestly, I only picked this up because there was nothing else that caught my eye, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  Now, I can say that this is one of my all-time favorite books.<br /><br />It takes a lot to get me to laugh out loud or cry like a baby, and this book got me to do both.  This is more than just a love story; it's about family, sacrifices, life and death and so much more.  Jojo Moyes is brilliant at weaving everything together to tell a beautiful, engaging, and powerful story.  My hat goes off to her!<br /><br />Side note: I actually listened to the audio book, which is narrated primarily by Susan Lyons.  I wanted to give her some recognition, because she did a fantastic job!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|1. levels that are easy enough that my 4 year old understands but difficult enough to challenge an adult.<br />2. works great on my tablet no glitches or timing out (problem with other games)<br />3. Love the music & sound effects, makes me smile when I'm having a ruff day.<br />I want more levels please
B00BHAT7LU|5.0|This is an expertly crafted series.  A couple of truncated movies would not have done this saga justice.  Well done.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I love reading from a guy's Point of View, it's always interesting and sometimes better than the females (if done right).I really did enjoy this book! It was entertaining, funny and sexy! It would be a perfect romantic comedy show or movie. Now maybe it was all the hype that kept me from rating it a 5! Other than that Emma Chase did a wonderful job at writing this book, and from a male's POV. One of the best I've read so far! :D AND YES I'LL BE READING TANGLED 2!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|It's nice when everything comes together and an excellent show like this gets made.  This is what great television is all about.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Quell is a simple yet rich and deep puzzle game. Quell Memento takes the previous versions to new places by adding a storyline and more puzzle elements. Well worth it.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|Boo, you haft to buy something when its free, and I seen better than this app that sucked and stinks.
B005QMOZOO|3.0|An okay read for a wet afternoon but neither good Austen nor good James. Austen's liveley characters are made balnd and uninteresting. I'd expected better.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|This was a gift for a relative who absolutely loved this movie.  He still does now that he has another  DVD (he loaned his original to a friend and never got it back).  He's a happy guy!
0307476073|1.0|I really tried to like this book. I gave it several chances. I usually love Oprah's book clubs, but this one was so slow and boring. Nothing ever seems to happen! And this lady is crazy and stupid for having done this hike on her own. I hated the book and am upset I even bought it.
6305428042|5.0|My daughters and I watch this movie around Halloween every year. Sent this to my daughter at college to give her a little bit of home while away. It shipped promptly and we had no issues with the movie skipping.

B008602KQI|4.0|the books are better! In the interest of time, I'm sure, there was a lot of stuff left out of the movie that really would have helped the story a little better. With that being said, I can't wait for the next movie to come out!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|All the cut the ropes are great if ur thinking about not getting it , test drive it and the first round you will already have bought it
B001EC2IV2|5.0|Eraser was suspenseful and full of action.  The alligator scene was very believable. Of course the good guys win...but don't they always in the movies?
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|this game is great but I wish it was free I haven't downloaded it but I surly will when it becomes free!!!!
B0029EDMEG|5.0|All the bits and pieces that make up a good and entertaining light mystery. Selleck does his usual marvelous job and still manages to be a sexy leading man.
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|This score would serve as the perfect memorial tribute to the life and work of Hans Zimmer.  It basically takes every movie score he has ever created and mashes them into one soundtrack.  Inception + Dark Knight + The Rock + Crimson Tide + [Insert Action Movie Title Here] + Electric Guitar Riffs<br /><br />The only thing missing are the haunting vocals of Lisa Gerrard (a la Gladiator) probably because she has been on tour with DCD over the last year (BTW Best live concert I have ever been to).<br /><br />The use of the violin soloist and female vocals are lost against a percussion exhibition and it is a shame because he could have created a nice theme for the score on some of the more emotional parts - like Ottman did for Superman Returns (though he did rip off Horner's Brainstorm for the track \\"How Could You Leave Us\\")<br /><br />Overall it is a good listen but not extraordinary.<br /><br />One thing to note, the CD Packaging of this Deluxe Steel Edition is amazing - one of the best I have seen in a long time.  Great casing, solid, discs well protected, and the liner notes include excellent pictures from the film and the scoring sessions themselves.  Hats off to whomever designed that.<br /><br />Also, what is up with the \\"UH OH\\" sound at :15 of OIL RIG.  Absolutely ruins the setup and pace of that track.  Maybe it works in the film but standalone it is jarring and disruptive.  Would have been much better without it.<br /><br />I gave it plus two stars for the CD Packaging and Minus 3 stars for the music.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Elegantly written, with engaging characters.  The plot is, unfortunately, all too plausible considering recent events.  Certainly a good summer read, or better.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I have been on a &#34;hunt' to collect all of the seasons of Supernatural. This show keeps you on the edge but also keeps you guessing what is going to happen next when the main characters are thrown loophole after loophole. It has a great story-line along with life lessons that every age can learn from. The main characters are hot too so that is a plus!! You will shed a few tears, have a few laughs, have a few scares, and maybe even a few screams.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|For this season at least they've managed to follow the book pretty well! GOT is always a treat! Good price too.

B008GFI4KY|5.0|It took a few listens, but this has really grown on me.  Some great songs on here.  I also had the pleasure of seeing the Darkness perform live... twice... in the last month, and my appreciation for them and their music is now even stronger.  AWESOME group!
0425263991|5.0|Heart of Obsidian is the newest addition to Nalini Singh's Psy/Changling series. This is Kaleb's story. He has always been the enigmatic young council member in the Psy race whom was the protégé of a monster. You always wondered throughout the series, whenever he was brought up, of how much of a protégé he actually was. Would he eventually become the monster his teacher was, was he a wolf in sheeps clothing or was Kaleb his own man? Come to find out, he is his own man and OMG I love him, sorry Judd you've been replaced! If you are a fan of the series or of book series in general, there's always that book that comes out that rocks the series world and this is that book. This book answers soooooo many questions and is just the epitome of the series in general. You will not be disappointed at all. Nalini has hit a home run with this book!<br />So if you don't want spoilers, stop reading now. I'll try to write the synopsis as vague as possible but I still need to do some set up.<br />When Kaleb was a young man, his teacher had a business meeting with someone whom had a little girl visiting. While the men talked business, the little girl, was instructed to give Kaleb a tour of the grounds. While the walked and talked, they bonded. Kaleb already being so ingrained in Silence had never had a friend and being raised with a monster, it was never a possibility, until he met Sahara. Sahara was never good a Silence. She definitely had flaws in her training but when she met Kaleb, she felt an immediate connection. She also knew he was in trouble and needed help. Soon the pair became the best of friends. Kaleb found ways to slip his leash and Sahara loved seeing him. As the years progressed, their friendship started to turn into something more but then Sahara vanished! Kaleb searched years and years for her, never giving up, always knowing he would find her again someday and if she was dead, the world would crumble at his feet.<br />Deep right???? I don't want to give more away, so I'll stop there but I do want to say this..... Sahara is absolutely the only person I could see taming the powerful Kaleb. I know I say this alot but they are absolutely perfectly matched. Personally I also don't think I could rave more about this book. If you want a fabulous PNR series with shapeshifters, Psy and humans, read this series!!!!  Just take my word for it and go buy it, NOW!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wish there were fewer pop ups. For a free game it's a lot of fun. I'll continue to play until I can't take the pop ups any longer.

B00870ZH3U|5.0|The play was amazing! I was not disappointed, most sequels usually suck but this was perfect. The ending was a tear jerker and a surprise. I couldn't believe it. I would recommend this to all Phantom fans!
159102594X|1.0|I found this book to be absolutely terrible. Do yourself a favor and on the main page for this book click the \\"look inside\\" and \\"first pages\\" link and just read how bad this writing is. seriously. after all the good reviews I was beside myself with wonder at how such bad writing could be considered good by anyone over the age of 10. seriously... see for yourself. unfortunately I bought this at B&N so I donated it to a school library. I will NEVER ignore the \\"look inside\\" here or in person i will take the time to read at least the first few pages or some random pages. Just Terrible.

B0049KWAVY|5.0|After I placed the order for this at the price of over 50 dollars, I thought I must have had a major &#34;senior&#34; moment to pay that kind of money for a CD. I got the CD today and am listening to it and the sound quality really is outstanding. I love Karen's voice and this CD does make it sound just like I remembered. I can close my eyes listening to it and pretend I'm a teenager again, listening to the Carpenter songs. If you can swing it, and love the Carpenter's like I do, you won't be sorry you bought this. It will lighten your heart...
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I am not overly fond of drama.  How can that be, being raised in the shadow of Hollywood and all, but the drama of this woman's life was overall an uplifting experience.  I was more attune with the sensuality and pleasure of Italy and the heightened focus on spirit in India than her way of blending the two in Indonesia.  For me, the blending of the material world and the spiritual world was somewhat flat, but I can't say why exactly.  Perhaps it is that her choice for making the blended life did not resonate with me especially.
B00ALKPTFA|5.0|I loved this book.  I would never have read it had it not been on my book club list.  It is full of really practical advice on living a full and happy life and in these tough times we could all do with taking stock of our lives.
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|The delivery is very prompt, faster than UPS. But when I opened the package only to find a yellow clearance label $62.99 instead of $70.23 they charged me.<br /><br />The calculating speed is much faster than the HP 12 C gold, the old version my father in law passed to me.<br />There is one thing that I don't like is the red letters on the calculator, which is very glaring to my eyes. I prefer the orange color on the old version.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very fun! I even like it! I wasn't sure my son could do it, but he sure can and it holds his attention for a long time.

B004MNO0BQ|4.0|Glow hockey is super fun! You can play 2 player or against the kindle fire. Also the kids love changing the pucks and tables. Totally keeps them entertained BUT the pucks either stick together or you can steal the other person's puck, when they are both close to the middle of the board, but the kids love that too
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|This was again a fantastic performance made by Tom Cruise.  Amazing how he could find evidence that the police could not see.<br />Congrats Tom on another great movie.

B00BLF9FOK|5.0|This was a very outstanding movie.  I enjoyed every minute of the action and Arnold Schwarzenegger was just fantastic in his roll as the marshal of a very small town that was going to be used as the escape route to Mexico for a very big drug dealer.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am a latecomer to the series after hearing coworkers and friends talk about it.  I have been using my Amazon Prime membership to get caught up on the past seasons.  Its awesome to watch when I want with no commercials.  My husband is not as into as me - he is more the Game of Thrones type.  Downton Abbey can be a little predictable at times but the acting is good, I love the scenery and time period, the storyline is great. I especially like Maggie Smith, her character is awesome and so is her portrayal of her.  I am on season 3 now and hoping to be ready for season 4.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOVED minecraft. But one day I got on and everything had changed. I can't put it on peaceful mode anymore and all the Graphics are changed. I guess they updated it. WHHHHHHYYYY???!! Can someone please answer my question
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book it was hilarious and entertaining it is a perfect book for ages 10 to 12 loved this book just like the other books
B008CLI4N4|5.0|It is a great series.  Cannot tear myself away from it.  It has every thing.  Drama, love, intrigue, violence, sex, passion, action, politics.  People who started watching during season two will be left with some holes as to who is who and why's.  The first season is definitely a must to tie the pieces together.
B005HSL626|5.0|I have to admit it. My daughter was right when she told me how much fun Fruit Ninja is. Avoiding the bombs is a challenge and catching the fruit combos requires a quick hand. I do like the &#34; fruit frenzy &#34; stage, but wish it was longer or perhaps even a stage all it's own.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love the intrigue, action, the uncertainty of what will happen next.  It keeps the viewer wanting more and more.  No one main character is more important than the other and yet the viewer is almost compelled to pick a favorite and cheer that character on.  Will probably get the full collection containing all seasons just so I can watch the whole story from end to end again.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|I was getting a little tired of his albums covering other people's songs. These songs are more like the ones on &#34;Human&#34; than his earliest work. I like most of the songs and like them more as I listen to it more!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|All the actors and actresses did a great job.  The movie really carries on where the TV showed left off and gives you a much better understanding of River.  Well written, acted and produced.  Highly recommended for the sci-fy'r in you.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was excited to see what JK would have for a mature audience.  Within a few chapters, I found myself disgusted and hard pressed to know why I should care about any of the characters.  They were well drawn - they seemed almost real, but in a nasty, depressing sort of way.  I didn't finish the book.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Once again Philippa Gregory has written a believable historical fiction.  The characters jump right off the page.  Although little was known about Anne Neville, Gregory has been able to paint a sympathetic picture of how she and most women of that ilk were used as pawns in the game of control in &#34;merry old  England&#34;.  The times were not always that merry for these women and at times were down right dangerous.  Kudos, Philippa.  I can't wait for the White Princess to be published.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Dystopia? Science Fiction? Hard to label. But not really necessary. I thought this was a brilliant work, original in it's telling.  I found it hard to put down. Loved the characters, and when I was finished, the concept of living in that world stayed with me, to think about , ponder long after I was done. Now I have to read Shift, it's already on my ipad waiting.

0307744434|5.0|A six year old girl loves her father, of course she does.  Even when that father is a famous magician and bonds her to a contest that will take decades and whose purpose is to prove that she is the best magician alive.  An orphan is grateful to the man who rescues him and more than willing to learn magic if that is what makes his rescuer happy.  He is also bonded to the contest; these two children who will grow into adults whose life will be consumed by the contest.<br /><br /> Imagine a circus more magical than any ever seen.  It shows up outside of towns unannounced.  The tents are all done in black and white as are all the costumes.  The circus is only open at night, but while it is open, those lucky enough to attend see sights that will stay with them forever.<br /><br /> Celia Bowen is the young girl, and she becomes the circus' main illusionist.  Marco Alidair is the boy who is her adversary.  He does not perform at the circus, but works behind the scenes keeping it organized and moving.  Both individuals know that they are bound to the competition, and that the circus is the neutral proving ground.  Each creates more and better acts and wonders as time goes by.  As they meet over the years, they fall violently in love and then discover that they are, in fact, adversaries in the game and that one must utterly defeat the other.  How will they reconcile the game with what they feel?  Is emotion allowed in those who would perform magic?<br /><br /> Erin Morgenstern has written an original tale destined to captivate and enchant the reader.  The details of the fabulous circus and the marvels contained within make the reader crave the experiences visitors have.  The love between the two main characters introduces a conflict that is not readily resolved, and brings up the conflict between obligation and feelings.  This book is recommended for readers ready for a wondrous tale that will leave them satisfied and sure that magic does indeed exist in this world.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Not a bad novel, i just think the author sometimes was over descriptive and left nothing left for the imagination. Plot's ok
0061692034|4.0|\\"First, I'll tell you about the robbery our parents committed.  Then about the murders, which happened later.  The robbery is the more important part, since it served to set my and my sister's lives on the courses they eventually followed.\\"<br /><br /> These are the first three sentences in Richard Ford's novel, Canada.  The book goes back from that point and explains the events that led up to this opening.  Dell Parsons is an average teenager of the 1960's.  He lives in Grand Falls, Montana with his twin sister, Berner, and their parents. Bev Parsons is an ex-military man, a charming rascal who finds himself at odds after his military career.  The mother is a schoolteacher,unimpressed with Montana or with Bev.  Dell and Berner are fifteen the summer the book begins, looking forward to high school and bored with their average lives.<br /><br /> Bev finds himself in a mess when one of his schemes goes awry.  His only solution, he believes, is to rob a bank.  Dell's mother accompanies him when it is clear that he plans to take Dell with him.  As might be suspected, the robbery is soon solved and the police show up and both parents are sent to jail.  There are no relatives to step in.  Berner, disillusioned already with small-town life, runs away.  Dell is picked up by  friend of his mother's.  She takes  him over the border into Canada, where she leaves him with her brother in a remote hunting town.<br /><br /> The brother ignores Dell for weeks.  He is sent to live in a hunting shack with no running water or toilet.  He is to help with the work of hunting guide, as men come from all over to hunt the geese as they migrate.  There is no mention of school.  When the brother starts to notice Dell, he is drawn into a web of deceit and violence.<br /><br /> The book is a bleak coming of age novel.  Dell is thrust from a comfortable, boring life to one where he has no one who cares about him.  He must learn to survive and decide what kind of man he will be.  The unforeseen consequences of a moment's actions are explored, along with how quickly an entire life can change.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I love this kind of mystery novels that make references to other themes, like symbolism, paintings, writers, etc. Perfect for a plane, bus, train ride.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the new game I got when i get bored I can depend on it to make me happy!
B009R659L8|5.0|Irene warsaw<br /><br />Could not stop reading this novel. Never have missed reading a book by Mary Higgins Clark and never will
B0026SCMNM|2.0|This was  a very boring book.  It ended abruptly when there<br />was a perfect opportunity to continue the story.<br /> I was disappointed the characters were under developed.<br /><br />Perhaps another book would be different.
B008JFUP0I|4.0|Over the years since I first watched The Fast and the Furious way back in 2002 I've watched the franchise, actors and characters grow giving birth to one of the best action franchises ever, and along the way I've come to like and even care a little bit about the characters in the films and you would not think with the type of films that Fast and Furious 6 along with their predecessors are, which is astounding because well Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have managed to do it again, in that they have created yet another fun and entertaining film in the long running Fast and Furious franchise. It is truly remarkable in what Original Films and Universal Studios have done with this simple franchise that started back in 2001 with The Fast and the Furious. The Fast and the Furious was a relatively low budget film about street racing, good looking guys, gorgeous women and exceptional action with limited star power in its little known cast. You would not think The Fast and the Furious would be a break out hit grossing over one hundred and forty million domestically and over two hundred million worldwide, the film did. Original and Universal found an untapped niche in the urban crowd and Underground Street racing and brought it mainstream.<br /><br />It is perhaps even more remarkable that it has had the longevity that the franchise has had lasting up to what are now six films and a seventh coming out next year. The Fast and Furious franchise has done what no other franchise has done outside of the horror genre or reboots. Most franchises die or get rebooted after the second or third film, and it did look like the Fast and Furious franchise was going to die after the disappointing 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) and the bad The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006). Those two films were relatively entertaining, but did not have the same feel as the first film, and definitely not the same heart as The Fast and the Furious. How did the franchise manage to survive? Not by rebooting its self like so many film franchises do no, but instead reinventing its self and returning to its roots like the franchise did in 2009's Fast and Furious bringing back the original cast, creating a good yet simple story, returning to Los Angeles and of course revving up the action. Fast and Furious was a huge success revitalizing the franchise, and 2011's Fast Five took the franchise to a whole new level in the scope of the action along with bringing in the Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson and grossing over six hundred million worldwide. Did the Fast franchise continue their remarkable film journey with another quality film with Fast and Furious 6? The answer is an unquestionably yes, but not without a few bumps along the road.<br /><br />The film opens with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) racing down a narrow mountain road on the Canary Islands. They arrive just in time for Brian and Dom's sister Mia Toretto's (Jordana Brewster) child to be born. Yes, racing and action are have a big importance in the franchise, but perhaps the biggest themes in the film are family and friendship, which plays out in all the films and plays an important role in the film. While Dom, Brian, Mia and Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) welcome the newest member of their family Luke Hobbs (Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson) along with his new partner Riley (Gina Carano) arrive in Moscow, Russia after a military transport was hit by a professional crew using cars led by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Hobbs can think of only one team good enough to take down Shaw and his team. Hobbs finds Dom and manages to convince Dom to help him by showing him a picture of Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez). Letty of course was believed to have been killed back in Fast and Furious. This gets Dom to help Hobbs and brings his team back together to take down Shaw and bring Letty home.<br /><br />The plot of Fast and Furious 6 is perhaps the franchises most complicated one and in that it is flawed. One of the biggest weaknesses in the plot is Gina Carano character Riley. I will not give anything away, but once you learn more about the character in the film the reasoning for her character being in the film does not make a whole lot of sense especially dealing with Letty. Then there is the Letty issue. She was supposedly killed off back in Fast and Furious, so did the writers manage to make her return believable and the answer is yes. First they had to answer how she was alive and then why was Letty with Shaw's crew. The writers did a believable job with showing how Letty survived the events of Fast and Furious, and did a decent job explaining how Letty ended up with Shaw's crew. Overall the writing done to bring back Letty was believable, but also a stretch. The other flaw in the film was dealing with Shaw and explaining what he was trying to achieve, which the script did not do a real good job explaining. Besides that the story is good mixing elements of humor, action and drama well. I do wish Universal and Justin Lin brought back Leo Tego and Omar Santos. The two were only minor characters, but I still enjoyed the two characters in the two previous films. In the film, there is also a major character death and a mention of things to come for Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang) and what transpires in Tokyo Drift, which takes place after this film, but I will not go into details for those of you who have not seen this film or Tokyo Drift.<br /><br />All right enough about the story and let's get to what everyone truly comes to these films for is the racing, action and carnage that is the trademark of Fast and Furious films, and those fans will not be disappointed. The action in Fast and Furious 6 is thrilling and non-stop. There is a thrilling car chase scene on the streets of London, England with Shaw and his crew using what looks like armored Indi 500 cars that is extremely well done and orchestrated. Unbelievably there is a fabulous scene at an airport and cargo plane that is stunning.Then of course there is the scene with the tank, but I will not give more about that scene away. The Rock brought his muscled bound body and laid waste to his opponents in awesome fashion as usual. Everything was not perfect with the action. There is one scene during the middle of the film that was not well done, and really did not add up plot wise, and again it involved Riley and Letty, but that was my only real complaint with the otherwise great action in the film.<br /><br />The remarkable journey of the Fast and Furious franchise will come to an end one day soon but until then enjoy the thrilling ride, which Fast and Furious 6 brings us with non-stop action, a pretty good script and decent action. While not on the same level as Fast and Furious or Fast Five, Fast and Furious 6 is only a slight step down. I highly recommend Fast and Furious 6 as 2013 has been lacking in good quality pure action films, which Fast 6 delivers and will go down as one of the best if not the best pure action films of the year, so do not miss the ride.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|2 discs including blu-ray plus the Dig Copy that can be redeemed through Itunes. Great price, definitely well worth it if you like this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the new update for it too. Minecraft is so fun!! I love how the update has buckets and cake. One of my world's is gonna be filled up with cake actually. So when I get on survival if I die I can find a cake and eat it. If you have the money and like Minecraft. This is something to buy. Duh!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Best show on television? It's either Dexter or Breaking Bad. I don't really like the boring, formulaic crime procedurals. This show is still fresh, unusual and compelling.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I found this book to be an entertaining, easy read.  It was far fetched, which for me added to the humor.  The character development was interesting as well as the connections the author formed between them.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|This DVD is a real dissapointment.  It is NOT the movie about The Hobbit and Bilbo Baggins, but a long Trailer with no ending story, only enticing you to buy the film WHEN it actually comes out in December.  The real film is due in December 2013, and I reccomend you wait until the full film is ready.  AMAZON should remove this product as a Rip-Off.  I need at least 20 words about the product or they won't publish this review,  So:<br /><br />The story starts in The Shire with Bilbo Baggins & Frodo Baggins discussing Bilbo's Adventure.  Then it goes to Bilbo joing a party of Dwarves on a quest to go east.  It is exciting and beautifully photographed, but the story stops dead in the middle, leaving you seeing the Dragon just awakening in the Dwarf Stronghold.<br /><br />Don't buy it, Don't Order it, And ask Amazon to discontinue it as a Rip-Off.  What a Waste of Money.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|good game with plenty to unlock. addictive and fun. would recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a simple fun game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun because you are competing on the leader boards with other people<br />and its more challenging all have fun!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I can't give it one star because at least the last 50 pages were somewhat entertaining. Of course that was only to lead up to the FOURTH book. And a one star, well, at least I'm proud of myself for finishing the darn thing. That was debatable for awhile. I'd just like to say that I loved the first two books in this series. Loved them. I was so excited for this book! I did not know going into it that it was going to continue to a fourth and fifth book. I was excited to get answers. But no, toward the end I was saying to myself, how is she going to wrap this up so quickly??? And...she didn't. I was quite ticky, actually. I feel like I've been duped. I read a book where it felt like 3/4 of it was just filler. The sex scenes were so boring and repetitive, I actually found myself skipping through them just to try and get to the meat of the story. Alas, there was no meat to be found. Will be skipping the next two reads. Even though I'd really like to know how the story plays out...I'm not a fan of publishing companies and authors watering down a story just for the purpose of financial gain. I call Booosh*t.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Unlike most reviews I've read, I'm not mad that 3 books has now turned into 5.  My whole problem with these books is the story and characters themselves.  I read book 1, Bared to you and HATED IT! But, I read 2 (Reflected in you) which was better and 3 (Entwined in You) to see where the story was going.  I dislike Gideon.  I think he is crass and too alpha male.  These books are a huge rip-off of Fifty Shades of Grey (Which I LOVED by the way).  Gideon is Christin x 10 except more, pushy, and crass and a turnoff for me.  He is described as having long hair but dresses very business-like.  That right there is an oxy-moron. And log hair went out with metal bands in the 90s.  The similarities and events that happen are too much like Fifty Shades to be coincidental so that is disappointing.  FSOG started the adult-contemporary hot book trend but at least come up with an original story Sylvia.<br />So, for my actual review of the book, you might as well read it if you've read the other two but don't be upset that the story doesn't end.  At least it doesn't end with a cliffhanger!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Good mystery with lots of twists and turns.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Usually, I'm unimpressed with attempts to modernize/update Conan-Doyle.  I make an exception here.  This was so good.  True to the characters, yet set in modern times and using modern technology.  Consistent with what Holmes and Watson would do if they had access to that technology.  Then theres the graphics, the cinematography, the staging,  All top notch.  As is the acting.  Finally, I am delighted that they do not portray Watson and LeStrade as ruddy duddies or imbeciles.<br /><br />Good show
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have been waiting since October of last year for this book. The book was good it kept me entertained. But the ending, WHAT WAS THAT?!?!?! That is NOT how you end a book. I am really hoping there is more to come. If there was a better ending this rating would have been a 5...
0345529057|4.0|I see some reviews how this version is cheaply made.  Yes, that is why it is only $5 a book!  The mass print version is a value if you intend to read it only a few times.  If you want a copy to place on the mantle, you probably should pay for a hard copy.<br /><br />I am half way through the third book and find no missing pages.  The book binding is holding (but I have not taken it outside the house where I read.  The print comes off on my fingers, somewhat similar to newsprint.<br /><br />In any case, an excellent read with many surprising curves.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I really was hoping that this part 3 of the Triology of Crossfire would answer so many questions, but it was a strange book instead. Now there will be 2 more books, according to the author's website, and this book really was just a filler or prelude to the next one.  It seems like the author was just dragging out this now titled series.  The long wait was just hype. Sylvia Day is better than this, WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?  The first book Bared to You was awesome, Reflected in You was interesting, Entwined with You is just blah.  I am hooked so I will have to finish this SERIES  but I am not happy about it!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I liked the book. Lots of sizzle but I agree with the other readers. Sort of feel conned with the extra book. Especially since this was so pricey. When did ebooks become more expensive than hard copies?????
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood never fails to deliver.  And Justin Timberlake and Amy Adams were phenomenal in this movie as well.  Just an all-around good movie.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Not the book; it is well-written by a man who understands the effective use of words, and that understatement and cold description carry more weight than hyperbole when trying to describe unthinkable things. .<br /><br />I have read extensively about WWIi, especially the campaign in the Pacific. No other author managed to convey the utter horror of day-to-day life in those island battles. That anyone survived those days with his mind intact is a tribute to human resilience.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Watched this movie to appease the wife, but it actually was a fairly good movie.  The acting wasn't the greatest, but it was  surprising that it had such a robust storyline.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a cool action game, repetitive, but very easy going and fun to play for me working night shift.  The missions make it more entertaining.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Huge LOTR fan, and this movie was a very good interpretation of the book 'The Hobbit'.  It wasn't as good as the first LOTR trilogy, in my opinion, but it didn't fail to entertain and be a good movie, nonetheless.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Like most people I was looking forward to this move. At long last they were going to have a main villain from the comics. The Mandarin. being a former comic nerd Iron Man was one of my favorites to read as a kid. Whilst i did like the interactions of the characters and it went at a fair pace, was MASSIVELY disappointed as to how The Mandarin was made to look.<br /><br />I dont blame B.Kingsley, i blame the writers who obviously had no clue as how to write the Mandarin. RDJ was excellent as well as others of the cast. It just could have been SO much better if they stuck to the way it should have been for the Mandarin.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is relaxing as you can plan, develop and watch your dragon islands flourish. The game gives you the option to watch and wait for results or spend  money and gems for faster results. You can even visit friends that have the game and help each other out with gifts.
B00CFOXBX2|4.0|the actors did an outstanding job. it's a great thinker movie. it's not a plot that you see all the time just being re-done. i thoroughly enjoyed it.
0439023491|5.0|Good book that followed its predecessor very well. Love it. Looking forward to purchasing the finale to the trilogy. Au Revoir!
B002962RKE|5.0|Since Glee started I had friends trying to get me to watch it and I kept saying no because I had already missed the first season.  I happened to be checking out what shows were available through Prime Instant Video and they had all 4 seasons.  So I watched season one and I am totally hooked.  I love the musical style and the cast does a great job with the songs they cover.  The stories happening between the casts are not as exciting but they are improving as the seasons go by.
1592332803|5.0|I don't know how I would have made the transition from vegetarian to vegan if it wasn't for this book. I mean, there's chocolate cake, cheesecake, strawberry cupcakes, cornbread, chocolate chip cookies, pies and so much more!<br /><br />Everyone who thinks vegan baked goods are not good, needs this book! I have used these recipes for office parties and now my co-workers are constantly asking me what vegan desserts I will make for them next. Colleen's work is great and such an inspiration.<br /><br />The book is filled with great recipes, but also useful tips, fun facts and so much joy!
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I used this on my film set and it was baaad! The static is also unbearable when you're on location! The first time I tried to monitor audio levels was a nightmare! But in post things didn't sound so horrible. Audio should never sound bad on location or post! Save your cash and skip this piece of crap!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|There are many story lines and characters in this book, but all are viewed with clarity and conveyed to the reader with compassion. It is a gift to be able to see cultures across different eras and countries as the author does in this book.
1603580557|5.0|This book should be read in every high school and college. The model of systems thinking in the foundation of all logical and scientific inquiry. I would strongly encourage every person to read this book. It is well written and effective at creating a lens through which we can interpret the world around us.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Hot, sizzling and addictive! I blew through this book like a snow plow clears an interstate. Can't get enough of Gideon, Eva and friends. I need my next Crossfire novel. Sylvia Day, fix me up!
1781162646|5.0|\\"Joyland\\" is Stephen King's latest effort for  Hard Case Crime (see \\"The Colorado Kid\\").  It is not a typical King journey into dark horror or extreme supernatural shenanigans.  It is also not an epic quest or even related to the \\"Dark Tower\\" series.  But it is one of King's more mellow, nostalgic coming-of-age novels surrounding a period (1973) murder mystery.  Seems some reviewers are more concerned with what \\"Joyland\\" is not than with what it is.<br /><br />Devin Jones (Jonesy) is a college student working as a carny for summer employment in a North Carolina seasonal amusement park aptly named, Joyland.  It is a summer in which Devin loses his innocence and his first real love, explores the history of an alleged haunted carny ride and the murder attached to it, finds his inner humanity with a dying boy who may have the gift of second sight, and rediscovers the possibility of new love.  Whew!  King enjoys taking his readers on a nostalgic melancholic tour of the early 1970's and what seemed important to young people in those turbulent years.<br /><br />\\"Joyland\\" is well plotted and moves at a leisurely pace as King takes delight in exploring the mythology and reality of carnival life and the people in them.  King's \\" constant readers\\"  know his skill in writing period pieces that capture the mood and the time of bygone places and eras (\\"The Body\\",  \\"11/22/63\\").  Significantly, these efforts are always evocative of adolescent memories and reflective of his talent for painting word pictures that allow readers to \\"see\\" what he wants them to \\"see\\".  Being nearly the same age as Stephen king,  I have always been amazed at how King can bring a time we both lived in to life in his words.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Joyland\\" is a bittersweet coming-of-age novel that held my interest throughout with just a light touch of the supernatural and a ghost.  It is a quick satisfying read that adds to the breadth and quality that has always been reflected in King's growing legacy.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Time travel, interesting main character, back drop of JFK's assasination.  Unusual premise.  Didn't give it 5 stars - too long, took too long to get to JFK story.  Very different from other S. King stories.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Very funny and silly, I really enjoyed this movie.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase it.  I did not know you could pour PBR on you severed fingers and stop the bleeding?  HA HA to funny

I've tried plugging it in to both my computer and my Canon T2i, with and without a mono to stereo adapter. Nothing works for either mic. This is a complete waste of money from a company I used to respect. Avoid like the plague.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|We saw Episode One of Downton Abbey on Masterpiece Theater, one of the few TV programs we watched religiously.  (We are not going to bore you by listing our other MT favorites.)<br />When Episode One finished, my husband said:  \\"It can't be over...too many knots have been left untied!\\"<br />Then we discovered our Amazon Prime gave us free access to Episode Two.<br />We are enjoying it as much, if not more.  We love BBC:  the humor is subtle, the mysteries logical; no gore, blatant sex, car chases, etc., and...Downton Abbey is the best of the best.  Good enough to make Anglophiles of us all!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, it has answered a lot of questions I had about working out and fitness in general, I have been following the routine on the cutting diet and feel like I am definitely making progress. I also like that the author makes himself available to answer questions you might have. I also purchased his other book The Shredded chefs and and enjoyed it as well!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|The second season of BOARDWALK EMPIRE brings back Nucky Thompson and the whole gang from Atlantic City for another epic of scheming, double dealing and cold blooded murder in Prohibition America.  Like the first season, I watched the second on DVD, taking in three episodes in one sitting and it was like plowing through multiple chapters of a good book at one time.  In the second season, BOARDWALK EMPIRE makes it clear that it is no retro version of THE SOPRANOS, but a superb saga in its own right.<br /><br />At the end of the first season, a group of Nucky's partners in crime, including surrogate son Jimmy Darmody and brother Eli, enter in an alliance with Dabney Coleman's nasty old Commodore in a plan to dethrone the King of Atlantic City.  This scheme becomes a reality in season two as Nucky is indicted on charges of vote fraud and is forced out of his job as Treasurer, allowing his former allies the chance to take over his vast bootlegging network in AC.<br /><br />But Nucky does not go down without a fight and the battle to reclaim and hold onto his empire of crime is the main story arc of the second season.  Nucky will need all of his considerable smarts and cunning to survive; and his enemies would do well to remember the old warning: when you strike at a king, you'd better kill him.  Steve Buscemi is really at the top of his game in this season, dispelling all doubts that he could not handle a lead role; his Nucky is a man who may be down, but who is never desperate, even when the Federal Prosecutor, Esther Randolph, is ready to put his common law wife, Margaret Shroeder, on the stand and implicate him in the murder of Margaret's husband.<br /><br />For me, the moment that defines the season comes in the finale when Nucky tells Margaret that the only thing which might convince him of God's existence is the love he feels for her and her children and the only good thing in his life is the bond of family they give him.  Buscemi delivers these lines with the utmost sincerity, but we are well aware that it is in his interest to convince Margaret to marry him so she can't be compelled to testify against him.<br /><br />There are various other story lines in season two, all driven by such memorable characters as Michael Pitt's Jimmy Darmody, who finds that being the big man in Atlantic City is not all it is cracked up to be; Jack Huston's disfigured WWI vet, Jimmy's loyal trigger man who can't quite leave the battlefield behind; Stephen Graham's Al Capone, Vincent Piazza's Lucky Luciano and Anatol Yusaf's Meyer Lansky: all middlemen itching to get to the top of the heap in their chosen profession.<br /><br />Then there is the great Michael Shannon as Federal Agent Nelson Van Alden, a man whose deep repressions finally burst to the surface, utterly shattering the facade of virtue he presents to the world.<br /><br />I do have some problems with the way Margaret Shroeder's part was written this season and the way Kelly McDonald was directed to portray her as a woman who feels pangs of guilt as she becomes ever more prominent and complicit in Nucky's life and crimes.  At times I just can't see why Nucky could be all head over heels over this gloomy Irish lass. McDonald has some great moments, especially in the finale, but Margaret seems utterly incapable of experiencing joy except for that fleeting moment of coitus with Owen Slater.<br /><br />There are a host of great supporting players, some holdovers from season one like Michael Stuhlbarg's ultra slick Arnold Rothstein; Gretchen Mol as Jimmy's mother, who loves her little boy an awful lot; Paul Sparks's Mickey Doyle and his annoying giggle; Shea Whigham's lackwit Sheriff Eli Thompson, who is no match for his brother; Michael Kenneth Williams's Chalky White, who battles the KKK while always angling to get the best deal for his people from whatever powers that might be.<br /><br />And then there are the new guys (and girls) in town: Charlie Cox as henchman Owen Slater, who provides Nucky with a valuable connection to the rebels in Ireland; William Forsythe as a kosher butcher in Philadelphia with a side business in bootleg whiskey; and Julianne Nicholson's Esther Randolph, the Federal Prosecutor, the one woman with power in her own right.<br /><br />Greg Antonacci and Dominic Chianese (Uncle Junior himself), both alumni of THE SOPRANOS, have small parts and there is a great turn by Christopher McDonald (Shooter McGavin) as Attorney General Harry Daugherty, possibly the most corrupt man to ever sit in a President's Cabinet, and that is saying something.<br /><br />But the great uncredited character in BOARDWALK EMPIRE is the America of 1921, vividly recreated in the clothes, the cars, the music and in the temper of the times when the old America of the 19th Century, with its agrarian values and Victorian morals were giving way to a country that had gone big city.  There were fortunes to be made and the Irish, the Italians, the Jews and the Blacks, all groups who'd long been disdained by the majority of their countrymen, were now damned and determined to get their fair share of the money any way they could. Prohibition may have been the law of the land, but there were millions who still wanted a drink and could have cared less about right or wrong.<br /><br />All in all, season two of BOARDWALK EMPIRE is great entertainment, a thrilling history lesson and good storytelling, all to the credit of a great cast and writer Terrance Winter.  I wouldn't be spoiling anything when I say there is a confrontation at the end of the season that is a stunner and well worth the journey to get there.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This guy writes and sings the best tunes.  This CD is not a disappointment and is on par with his others.
B009B50QOU|4.0|It's a good album by Green Day. The style and sound of the album is pretty similar to that of 21st Century Breakdown.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|This was definitely a let down, i love kung fu movies and like tarantino...but this is worth skipping....save your money and time
B00A12VW86|3.0|Not the best album by Green Day, but also not the worst. The album consists of mostly upbeat modern-punk/pop rock sound.
0143038419|5.0|Just started to read it.  Looks like a  good beach read saw the movie now I want to read the book
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I record a lot of on-camera interviews, and have found that a \\"hard wired\\" mic works best in most cases.  I bought my second mic purely as a back up for my first mic, which is going on four years of service.  I thought the weak link would be the small cord, but it's held up.  Downside: the battery is an unusual size; you won't find it at a gas station or convenience store.  Upside: the sound is really, really good.  A great value!
B008220BLG|5.0|We thought this would be a light-hearted comedy.  It turned out to be a very meaningful movie with a lot of hidden messages that could apply to many people today.  I think we enjoyed the extras as much as the movie!  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
1451695195|5.0|Great witness to God's love and protection.  Thank you for sharing what happened to you.  My daughter died 5 years ago and accounts like yours give me great comfort.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|ive played this app on ipod and stuff like that and im glad it came out for the kindle tablets
B0098460O4|5.0|I absolutely love Jonathan and Charlotte.  Their voices are heavenly.  I listen to the CD almost every day and I continue to be blessed.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|It always makes me laugh. Unfortunately, the case came damaged, and the DVD just had one small flaw. Otherwise it was great. Loved it!
0385535147|5.0|He's another author I love.  His books are always great.  I can't put them down once I start and I love that when I read.
0439023513|5.0|the book was in great condition<br />and it was a great conclusion to the series<br />I really liked that it was very engaging right from the start
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Like the first two games, this one is good puzzle solving fun. However, the worlds are shorter than the last two cut the ropes.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really enjoyed Cheryl's writing. This is the first thing I've read from her and I anticipate that I will seek out some of her other writings (essays etc.) I got a lot out of in personally given where I am in my life (late 20s) and related to much of what she went through. I also found myself inspired to go hiking in the wilderness..... wonder why?
B007SYWFRM|1.0|5 stars for Ice Age Village............<br />I noticed a while ago that in the KFS game you didn't ever win big. I saved up 29 silver coins to play KFS and after each game I won the minimum money and acorns. 1 acorn in one spin and 4 acorns in another spin. I won the very minimum in coins. Why is it that none of the big prizes ever get won on that game. Actually that's how I saved up so many silver coins it's just not worth it to play the game if you can't ever win anything worthwhile.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Always been a big fan of Julia Child so when I saw the movie I knew I would get the DVD.
B00CN8U60Q|5.0|If this was my first Blackmore's Night cd I'd fall in love with their music - but I've been swept away since first finding their music a decade ago.  EVERY album has many songs that I absolutely connect with and listen to over and over again, and Dancer and the Moon is no exception - brilliant playing, beautiful singing, magnificent lyrics... I can't wait to see them in person for the 4th time!  Thank you Ritchie and Candice for this treasure, may the medieval mood last forever -
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|What a great movie from start to finish!  They got it perfectly right, it is a great movie that will be a classic before long.  A great family movie and a must see for all Wizard of Oz fans of all ages...
B000FC1HQY|4.0|The recent crop of childhood memoirs which show how many parents are oblivious to the basic needs of their children are a sad commentary on humanity. When I read these I am amazed at the resilience of the human spirit to overcome such neglect as this showed. It was interesting to be exposed to the upheaval which the breakdown of colonial rule in Africa created. I have more gratitude for parents who sacrificed for my well being and education.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in a while. It has everything you would want in a tv series. Thumbs up, definitely recommend.
B004047XXO|1.0|The color is awful and it is not 3D as you would expect. Wish I had ordered in regular DVD or BluRay
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Got this for my wife and she loves it. She took it to work and said all the ladies really enjoyed it. I have to say I enjoyed it to, just a really well made album with killer songs. Brings back alot of 1970ish memories for me.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Vince Flynn's writing, always fast paced and good action.  I have read them all.  Of course, after so many books there are bound to be similarities to previous scenes and even plots.  But I can overlook these and strike these up to the fact that even in real life similar scenes and events get played out.  Mitch Rapp is superman without the cape and I always enjoy his exploits.  I read Flynn's books while I exercise on the treadmill or elliptical trainer.  I work Mitch Rapp's exploits right there with him, making my one hour training sessions fly by quickly.  I recommend this and all of Flynn's books.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Super addictive. Similar to bejeweled but better in the sense that it's more challenging and has a story line to follow. Fun for entire family!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Why did this book end so abruptly?  It's like Syliva decided she was done writing and then just released it. Terrible, terrible ending.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Fun book, i really enjoyed it!! Anyone who is a book lover will enjoy the comparison to the book and the web products.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Love playing this on the computer, now I can take it with me on the go!  Our whole family loves to play, my 5,8,12 year olds and me too.  Totally worth it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|You had me at the first illustration but you made me president of your fan club with NILF.  My greatest fear was the title and the three words (the tangled series) I feared this book would end in a cliffhanger and then...well......it didn't and I loved that more than you know.  I was just perfection..  Congratulations, you wrote a fabulous book and I hope there are many more to come
B00992CF6W|5.0|Bought this for my 5 year old to play on the fire and was so excited that he could join his brothers on their ipod games.  Great game, hours of fun for all ages
1452110581|4.0|Cat owners (and I use the term lightly, because can anyone truly own a cat?) will immediately understand the snark and quirky humor in these odd little poems. The selections range from free-form to haiku to nothing more than an odd collection of sentences. But everything perfectly reflects the seemingly odd, apparently self-absorbed thought patterns of our feline friends. A good coffee table book, and a nice treat for kids and adults alike.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this movie. I even cried. The movie makes you more aware of dating from a guys perspective as well as dating and online dating.
B002U5HKZ6|2.0|Maybe I just didn't read far enough into it, but the action in this book just didn't move fast enough for me.  It took too long to set up the characters and the story.  When I read a novel, I want it to end each chapter with me begging for more, one that I can't wait to get to when my obligations for the day are over, and I can curl up and read for a couple of hours.  This didn't happen with this book.  I didn't even finish it.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|The movie was very unbelievable and boring. It was way longer then it needed to be. The plot was not not the least bit exciting.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|I love biographies, and this one did not disappoint.  Arnold Schwarzenegger has lived a life so uncommon compared to most people.  He's not just an action hero.  He would have been a success regardless of which vocation he chose.  He's got business  and political savvy.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there were a few parts in the book where I got a little bored, but for the most part, I found the book really interesting.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|I have become a new Tatum fan after watching this movie. His dancing is unbelievable, I only wish there was more of it.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Bought this for my guests to watch while staying at my B+B here in Charlestown, Ma. Gives the tourists a view of the past of one of America's historic neighborhood.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|The lines are bitter but sweet. I almost felt every bit of emotion. A lot of characters were relate able in everyday life.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|History and intrigue in this great backdrop of the abby.  I can't wait for the next season.  The costumes are wonderful.
0738737909|3.0|And it is a beautiful deck.  You can tell the artist really put his soul into it.  Some of the cards are the most lovely I have seen, hands down. Among those would be that incredible High Priestess.  Those colors, the details, amazing.  And I love the five of wands, the colors flow beautifully there, too. But then there are some cards I just can't with, and there is enough of them that I gifted the deck to someone else. (who is madly in love with it and very happy to have received it) The Star card is a major one. Just stiff and odd.  The king and queen of swords, as well. His legs are gigantic and his head does not match his body. Also, the cards are a bit too busy for me.<br /><br />The presentation box is lovely and the book is written very well.  The gilt edges are beautiful, and, unlike some other reviewers, I received a perfect set without a flaw that I can see.<br /><br />I think, as with all things, it is just a matter of personal taste. Though some of these cards are so pretty I would love to get prints of them, and some are just, well, not.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as I'm a big fan of Tom Hanks and really enjoyed the Matrix series.  I also enjoy thought provoking dystopian novels.  So, this one should have been at a minimum enjoyable.  Sadly, it was disjointed and thus difficult to follow. The plot had little depth and was not well developed. I suppose if I watched it several times I'd be able to sort it, but honestly, I just don't want to waste anymore time.<br /><br /> The acting was overall very good which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great free app that's easy to use for everyday computation. I would recommend to anyone that needs a basic calculator.  It's free and it gets the job done!
B005MMZ63C|5.0|&#34;Citizen Kane&#34; achieves the rare accomplishment of entertaining and provoking intellectual thought. The film's performances are superb and the craftsmanship in its making groundbreaking.<br /><br />Seeing this definitely deserves the top item position on anyone's bucket list.
1455508977|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I'm a slow reader and I read it in 2 days. I love how the chapters are separated. It's a must read for sure!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is my favorite book of the series so far.  I love where Ms. Day is taking Eva and Gideon I see them as a power couple working together, owning several businesses together and making Gideon's company grow bigger with many babies and great sex.  The sex scene on the plane made me wiggle in my seat as a read it several times because it was just so damn good.  We all have problems and in the book Ms. Day went there with the characters friends and families and with all the money that Gideon have he is in the same boat as all of us brokes folks with pp problems.  I hope I dont have to wait to long for the fourth book to come out, I never read anywhere that the series was a trilogy, it just that a series which can be as many books as Ms. Day wants to write.  Write on Slyvia Day!!!
B004EAQNO4|1.0|Despite his past mediocre films, I somehow let M. Knight Shymalan's name draw me to this movie. Boy was I disappointed. It is predictable and seems to try to convey a moral lesson. Not going to say everyone will hate it but I sure did.
B005NHQ2NY|5.0|I have learned so many things how my body works and have helped me eat better. It is a good buy.
B001MS7IBS|4.0|Season one starts out kind of slow, but only builds into what becomes an excellent series. This season may turn some viewers away because it tends to be more science and less science fiction. I urge people to push through and you will be greatly rewarded when you finish seasons 2-5. Who knows, you may find yourself liking season 1 more than you first thought...
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Sucked. Complete waste of time. Would have been disappointed if it was free. Painful to watch. Do yourself a favor, pass.
B003L77G38|5.0|This season really showcases Anna Torv's acting talent in the role of Olivia Dunham. The animated episode is really great too.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I picked this up on a Daily Deal. I already had several of the songs but for the deal price it would've cost more to get the individuals I liked separately.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Helps to pass time, great phone game. Like the old time arcade games. Good graphics and good sound.its a buyer.
1607066017|4.0|I loved Brian K Vaughn's Y the Last Man. I won't say this is as good as that but it is an entertaining book. It's a little bit like Romeo and Juliet but if they had lived and had children. It's a good introduction to a series. I'll be picking up the next volume soon.
1878424319|3.0|Hard to read.  Translation by the author isn't very good.  I understand that there are other versions out there to help you understand.  Interesting topic
B00136NUG6|5.0|I picked this up on a Daily Deal. I already had several of the songs but for the deal price it would've cost more to get the individuals I liked separately.
B000I3W1XS|3.0|I haven't watched this movie since I was a kid when it first came out. I was a little disappointing. The plot was okay but the delivery from all the actors fell short.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This was a great deal. I split the cost with a friend who doesn't have a Bluray player. The digital copy through HBO is fantastic. Not only was I able to add it to my VUDU account but I was able to select an additional service such as iTunes or Amazon. I'll be picking up more HBO content like this. I wish other digital copy providers did this.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The Misremembered Man by Christina McKenna was delightful!  There are alternating stories that run the gammit from hilarity to despair.  Ms. McKenna weaves these stories together seamlessly.  She also makes the characters very personable.  I could not put this book down and I'm sure I'll be thinking about it for days.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|the movie for the most part is straight out from the famous author' novel, where nothing is highly expected in terms of plot or denouement.  However, the movie is expected to deliver characters as described in the book, and in this regard, the movie fails to impress; i.e. most acting is subdued by the singing portion assigned to each actor. That is, the musical aspect of the motion drama dominates the viewing yet, IMO, is not high quality to your ears in the same level as that provided by the likes of Andrew Lloyd Weber music.  The singing of the actors can be at most described as mediocre or at best acceptable.  Maybe, this singing is most acceptable in the performing by \\"Cosette\\", which is not much.  The special effect and spectacular (Paris & costumes) part of the motion picture would be commendable to many if the movie is presented at a theather ambiance.  In all, the singing is not making this movie (e.g. streamed into your Home Tv) highly enjoyable when the viewer is not unfamiliar with Victor Hugo's novel.  For someone who'd seen many versions of Les Miserables, any four-star rating would be somewhat unjustified, IMO.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not just zombie fiction, I feel like it harkens back to Grapes Of Wrath.  This is a really important piece of literature.  Powerful and moving.
B00992CF6W|3.0|When I first downloaded this game it was amazing. But now after the update it is flickering and spazzing out. I don't think I paid 6.99 for this. I don't know. If it is fixed I will write a better review. But as of now 3 stars. Oh and I'm 13.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like being able to check how many minutes I have left &amp; so do my kids.  It's also fun to see the device temperature.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|My grandbabies love it and keeps them busy just one thing.  My only problems is they fight over who's turn it is...<br /><br />KC
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Is nice but you can't craft that much<br />As I control it is nice for you. You can build stuff but Olney for 9min
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Everybody run out and get this cd... Wonderful.. I m gng to go to portofino Italy . He is a wonderful singer
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is awesome it lets u pick from great dinosaurs and a good way to pass time by... this game also has an aquatic partnering is amazing and different.. I definitely recommend this app
B004MC0FO8|3.0|And it may just be my phone, by it does take a while to load and run the app. Even so, wonderfully handy!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Loved the Cursed heart game - one of my favorites.  This one is good but can't help comparing the two.  Would really like to see more of these high quality games offered for galaxy tabs instead of so many &#34;commuter&#34; games designed only to kill time.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I just watched the entire first season on DVD and thought it was terrific. The production values are high and the cast is spectacular, including those in minor roles such as English actor Ben Daniels. Robin Wright is extraordinary. I did find the last episode disappointing because its primary purpose seems to be to make viewers want to watch season two. With a production of this quality, I expected more of a sense of resolution and artistic completeness at the end of the season. My expectations may have been influenced by watching season one of the original British series, which had a powerful ending.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Loved the 5 minutes of the game I was able to play.  Got to the little girl's bedroom and the last object is hidden behind the  close bar at the bottom of the screen. Tapping closes the HOS and you can't go any further.  Emailed G5 twice but no response.  I own several G5 games and had a lot of confidence in their products - not so much now.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I've heard for a number of years that this was a good series.  This was compared to The Wire, which we love.  Just about finished the first season and if the next six season are as good as the first, this very well may be better than The Wire.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I'd been looking for the perfect gift for my boyfriend's birthday for weeks with no luck. And then it dawned on me: we both love Batman....we both love watching movies together.......he doesn't have the trilogy. The box is high quality, it comes with 3 discs and a &#34;how the production happened&#34; booklet. Definitely one that could be displayed proudly on a bookshelf. I'm honestly so glad I bought this product.
B000HF702E|5.0|good clean fun, an enjoyable film for family viewing. The mother reminds me of Florence Henderson in the Brady Bunch!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome everyone should get it whoever made this game is so awesome thank you for making this game
B00190N4E4|5.0|Prayer and fasting is very powerful!  If everyone did just a little bit, it would be a much better world.
B000002WPH|5.0|I wanted it on vinyl. Simple as that. We tang is the greatest hip hop group ever, so get a classic grip, with its classic songs, on a classic vinyl. Nuffield said
B003K15IF8|5.0|*Stoner* is an unprepossessing story of an unprepossessing man: a Midwestern accidental academic who lives out a middling career with an unloving wife and an estranged daughter.  The paradox Williams explores is the fullness of Stoner's life, whether in spite of or because of the circumstances that shape him and which he has shaped.  The sheer surefooted quality of the narrative is impressive.  No postmodern worries here over an unreliable narrator or the inadequacy of language to communicate anything at all: Williams clearly believed in the realistic novel. There's a fine introduction too from John McGahern; the imprimatur of the New York Review of Books, an excellent series, is no small recommendation, either.
0307472590|1.0|de los libros mas insipidos que he leido. aburridisimo. me tive que obligar a terminarlo. la trama es tan insipida y aburrida
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Ok, only the second one, but still I love the style and passion the Piano Guys display in their work. Whether it is redoing a bit of classical music or reinterpreting a current pop hit, these guys rock.
0375805613|5.0|This was my favorite book when I was a kid, so I got it to read to my boys, ages 2 and 4.  The 4 year old fought reading it for a long time because I had purchased the board book.  Although it will stand up to the 2 y/o, the 4 y/o felt it was for babies.  The first time I finally convinced him to let me read it, he was grabbing the pages to turn them against Grover's wishes.  Afterwards, we immediately read it 3 more times.  This gives kids a feeling of power--in turning the pages and getting to the monster--and teaches them that some things we might be frightened of aren't really scary at all.  It's still a favorite of mine...maybe a suggestion for book club?!
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|Not much else to say.  Excellent, excellent, excellent film & director.  The cinematography is fantastic as is the soundtrack.  Gibson's finest work.
B005HED11Y|5.0|We showed some of these classic episodes to my sons after taking them to see the latest reboot movie.  The message is still just as relevant today as it was in the 60's.  The image and sound quality is excellent.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|This movie was too slow for me, not to mention I thought it would have more battle scenes in it. Definately would not watch it again, once was enough for me!
B009NY43NY|5.0|The books are so good sad that applies story is over but all things come to and end she ended up where she belonged safe and sure
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Too long and too confusing. I got it in the end, but over all I didn't think it was great.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|The case is pretty worn out and looks like its been enjoyed many, many times.  The DVD itself plays perfectly, so it makes up for the condition of the case
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Love this show, it was a very sad day when the cancellation was announced, thank you Amazon from having it available to watch!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was thinking I was going to read this next book. But after reading the reviews wont even bother. Sylvia Day get your head out of your ass and keep the story of Gideon and Eva.
B00992CF6W|4.0|HOW DO I UPDATE??? Can someone help me with this problem!! I love the game and have played the new updated version buy can't find it on Amazon!!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|This book flew by me so smoothly. I am now officially a devout fan of the John Puller series. I recommend this book to ANY fan of David Baldacci's. Sorry, I'm not the type to give out spoilers, people. Gotta read the book for yourself. Trust me, it's worth every page turn.
159514188X|5.0|I admit i just wanted to know the reasons why the girl killed herself; this book was still great! I did not understand the ending at all because it left you hanging, but great book!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a very fun game thT challenges you and keeps you entertained for sure ...i highly recomend it to anyone who likes game like that.
B00C2U6G7C|1.0|Just finished listening to MOS. I'm so disappointed for so many reasons, I'm currently listening to Williams score just to cleanse.<br /><br />First, I'm a huge fan of both Zimmer and Williams. I have pretty much every sound track that either of them have ever done. Zimmer has written beautifully melodic and emotionally relevant scores that match the material. But I could not connect to MOS on any level. It wasn't pretty, melodic, or engaging....and the themes don't represent the character. The score is dramatic, but that's about it.<br /><br />Secondly, this may be a reboot, but one theme has been associated with Superman since 1978. It was so well done and so iconic that not using it would be *exactly* like doing Star Wars VII without Williams score. Even if Williams isn't involved, the main theme and some of the iconic thematic material will still be there because otherwise it wouldn't be Star Wars.<br /><br />So yes this is a reboot and Zimmer wanted to leave legacy and baggage behind, but honestly, I think the only excuse for not using *THE* iconic theme is that people would recognize it as Williams but it is what it is...or it should have been what it is, but Zimmer didn't let it.<br /><br />Superman Returns had it's issues, but the Ottman's score is not one of them. It was the best part of a mediocre movie.<br /><br />Update. We just got back from seeing MOS. The movie itself wasn't as bad as the reviews make it out to be. There wasn't enough character development which was starved out by action. But that can be fixed in a sequel. It was better than Returns for sure. The music though was just awful. Zimmer repeats the same two pseudo themes throughout the entire film. This is his worst sound track ever. I stand by my original opinion.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I like that this series has retained many of the characters of Martin's books and made them come alive. I would have preferred the emphasis on different characters (more on John Snow and Rob Stark, for example).<br />Peter Dinklage has stolen the film; he is phenomenal!
B005898DDO|5.0|This is a fantastic compilation of old Dylan videos, photos, & stories.  It helps fill in some of the 'Bootleg' voids.<br />Great collection.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I LIKED THE BOOK. Of course I am not  readingit like it was a great work of art. I do not analyze how it was written. I ENJOY THE STORY. I am (reading for fun)not trying to get a grade for a class.<br /><br />A good fun read in keeping with the rest of the series which I hate to see comming to an end. In Oct the volume tell what they are doing now comes out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have Pc and xbox now this Jo's I'm obbssed its son much fun.  I recommend it to all.  Even my little sister loves it (she hates video games).
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Who isn't familiar with Adobe Reader? All of us use it and depend on it. This APP does what it's suppose to do. Simple and unobtrusively.
B000002KHF|5.0|Great to sit back and chill out to Van Morrison. Having hung out with him many years ago I realized I didn't have one album. Good old irishman.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I had high hopes, but while the acting was great many of the voices were not. Hard to do a musical with this much singing with mediocre singers. Visually beautiful, but still did not live up to my expectations.
B001MM28JG|5.0|It's not a serious, important film. It's just fun, and funny. It's *entertainment*<br /><br />It's basically a live-action comic book. The situations and characters are all cartoony and funny. It's a fun romp with special effects and a scifi theme.<br /><br />The cast is hilarious. Weaver and Sheloub earned a new level of respect for their comic timing and delivery.<br /><br />It's a good way to spend the evening with the family and a bowl of popcorn.

B00007LTIA|5.0|Multiple choice test:<br />1. The 1974 release of the album \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" by the British art rock group \\"Yes\\" was:<br />  A) an ambitious and daring attempt to fuse classical and rock musical concepts into a massive rock symphony.<br />  B) a bloated, pretentious, and self-indulgent test of a listener's patience, exploding in dozens of incoherent directions.<br />  C) the musical inspiration for much of the 1984 mocumentary film \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\".<br />  D) All of the above.<br />Answer: D<br />There is really no other album to compare with \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\"  I am not aware of anyone producing an 80-minute long, four-track album that attempts single-handedly to simultaneously unite the energy of rock with the scope and structure of a classical symphony AND contemplate man's place in The Universe.  It is as impossible task, which TFTO ultimately fails to bring off.  Yet in its missing of that mark it still manages to create some beautiful musical moments and grand fusions of words and melody.  Dissecting the title of the album gives a good idea of what's inside.<br /><br />At first glance \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" seems to be a non-sequitur at best, and nonsense most likely.  Oceans don't HAVE topography, right?  Until you think about it.  Sure oceans are topographic, only the topography is hidden under the surface.  Were the members of Yes really thinking that deeply when they entitled their work, or did they just choose words that sounded good and accidentally came up with a title that caught the soul of their concept?  Since most of the lyrics of TFTO read like Vogon poetry I incline toward the latter, but I can't dismiss the possibility of lurking brilliance.<br /><br />Musically \\"Tales\\" resembles a classical symphony composed of four long movements which are thematically linked but contrasting in musical style.  The first movement, \\"The Revealing Science of God / Dance of the Dawn is best described as a rhapsody; a flowing sequence of interlocking melodies.  The second movement \\"The Remembering / High the Memory\\" is most like a sonata, with an opening theme, second theme, development, and the recapitulation of the opening.  The third movement \\"The Ancient / Giants Under the Sun\\" is a scherzo; fast-paced, rambunctious and free-form.  The finale, \\"The Ritual / Nous Sommnes Do Soleil\\" is a gentle love song which unifies the whole piece by incorporating recaps of themes from the other movements into its structure.  This is not music for casual listening.  It must be studied and the melodies must be learned well enough to recognize when they appear again in different contexts to appreciate it fully.  That is not all that difficult because many of these melodies are very memorable.<br /><br />Indeed, several of the themes in the each of the four movements of TFTO are so catchy that they will stay with you for days.  The first movement begins with white noise which resolves into notes, which evolve into melody, which builds to the addition of vocals.  The chanted vocals first add inflection, then harmony, then more instruments joining into a growing wave of sound, which eventually crashes into an explosion of percussion and melody that leads into the first section of the rhapsody.  Without explicitly stating what it is doing, the music takes the listener from the formation of The Earth to The Rise of Spiritual Man.  All done in 3 ½ minutes!  The opening crescendo of TFTO grabbed me when I first listened to it in 1974 and I've never forgotten it.  Other melodies like \\"What happened to this song\\" and \\"Getting over overhanging trees\\" from the first movement, \\"Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays\\" from the second, \\"along without you\\" in the third, and Nous sommnes do soleil\\" in the finale are instantly full of hooks that you'll find yourself humming to yourself long after listening if you're not careful.  I recently introduced TFTO to my 21-year old son and accidentally started with the run-through version of the first movement before switching to the album version.  He remarked at how on one partial listening he realized he was remembering the themes on only the second listening.  OK, so that's answer A from our multiple-choice test.<br /><br />Answer B speaks to the frustrating failures included in TFTO. Many of the downfalls inherent in TFTO come from the ambition of composing such a large work.  While there are unquestionably some great musical concepts that went into TFTO, there just weren't enough to fill four movements and 80-minutes of playing time.  These flaws appear in the auditory whiplash-inducing transitions between musical styles of the various themes.  The first movement alone makes 10 abrupt changes of direction.  The first one at the end of the aforementioned crescendo is a natural progression that the listener can feel coming as the music builds.  The other nine? Not so much.  In the best cases the encroaching theme begins in the background and fades in as its predecessor fades out.  In others, the next idea just jumps in from one measure to the next.  Another big problem is that not all of the ideas in TFTO are equally viable.  Some are simply filler to pad the tracks out 20-minutes.  Others are utter musical failures that don't so much fall flat as fart.  This is especially evident in the third movement when at about the 8 ½ minute mark the band devolves into a meandering jazz improvisation that drags on for four minutes.  The attempt to glue the wheels back on by segueing into a four-minute classical guitar solo doesn't really get the movement back on track.  In fact, the third movement of TFTO is why God gave us the next track button on our playback devices.  The final problem is the nonsense lyrics throughout the album.  While there are several moments where words and music come together in glimpses of brilliance, for the most part trying to parse out the lyrics is like listening to a conversation in a language in which you have incomplete fluency.  The meaning seems to be out there just beyond the point of comprehension, but ultimately just isn't there to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, one cannot leave a discussion of TFTO without recognizing its connection with \\"This is Spinal Tap\\".  Some of the most hilarious scenes in the movie could be directly lifted from \\"Tales\\".  Specifically the \\"Stonehenge\\" section of the film could have been replaced by a performance of parts of \\"Giants Under the Sun\\".  The scene near the end of the film after Nigel has left the band and the remaining members have to sift through the best-forgotten parts of their repertoire also comes to mind.  They end up with psycho-jazz that may actually BE a part of the third movement of TFTO.  The idea of a rock band attempting to play material that is so far over their heads both musically and intellectually is one of the best parts of \\"Spinal Tap\\".  Realizing that these gags are part of a massive in-joke that refers back to \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" enhances my enjoyment of both the movie and the album.  If ever there was a rock album asking to be satirized it is TFTO.  Sure, the album is bloated and pretentious, but that's part of its charm.  Being able to laugh at it ultimately helps me to understand it.<br /><br />So, what's the final grade on our little test?  I first listened to TFTO as a teenager in Southern Kentucky close enough to Nashville to hear the steel guitars twanging from my back yard.  Listening to this record was a revelation.  It was the first piece of music that I consciously studied in order to wrap my mind around it.  I wore out the vinyl years ago, and when it came time to switch to CD my tastes had changed to the point where I never replaced the record.  Recently I stumbled back across \\"Tales\\" in a chat room and wondered if my fond memories of it were more than youthful enthusiasm for something new and different.  In re-acquainting myself with TFTO in 2013, I can say that much of theearly affection for the record was not misplaced.  In listening now with a more educated ear and broader experience I can see a lot of the flaws in the stone that I couldn't have understood then nor legitimately criticized.  What I can say now that despite the flaws, \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" is still a diamond and for that it has once again become one of my favorite recordings nearly 40 years after my first hearing.have incomplete fluency.

B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Not a great movie, not a bad movie, it was just \\"ok\\" all around... Glad I didn't rush out to see this movie in the theater!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I saw the adverts for the third season in the movie theater, searched TNT and found the first two seasons, minus this episode, and DVR'd them.  I am hooked!  It is well made, with great effects, quality actors/acting, well written, and the story line just keeps you wanting for more.  Now that I am hooked, I am expecting they will cancel it mid-season just like Firefly and Jericho.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I loved the author's previous two novels, but was disappointed with this one. Too many disjointed story lines when the most compelling story was the one we finally returned to at the end.
B0033VUH6A|4.0|I thought this movie was interesting as it portrayed war from a different perspective.  It seemed believable and realistic to this 20 year Air Force vet.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|The proper comparison for \\"The Borgias\\" is similar 10 - 12 episode costume dramas, historical or fantastical, such as \\"Rome\\" and \\"Game of Thrones\\", not what we find in history books. There are too many deviations from history to make that comparison worthwhile, with one big exception. The historical interpretation of the Borgias as vile and immoral may be inaccurate. This dramatization seems to err on the side of making the Borgia clan no more vile and immoral than their antagonists.<br /><br />One thing which makes this production (both seasons) more exciting and engaging than \\"Game of Thrones\\" is that there is so much more light, color, and action, in spite of the fact that both lived in a world where the only light was sun and candle. Both involve battles and large armies; except that like \\"Rome\\", \\"Game of Thrones\\" keeps all that action off screen, and when it does appear at the end of season 2, it is at night, and mostly with close-ups of small groups of combatants, or with ships, done with models.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, the Borgias are presented as no worse than their enemies. Some opponents, like the semi-factual Niccolo Machiavelli become their friends and some appear more virtuous, such as Caterina Sforza. Juan Borgia is both dissolute, incompetent, and cowardly, with no honor to speak of. Rodrigo, Pope Alexander, is seriously flawed, but he is true to his faith and its humility, which works to his purposes, as he see's God's guidance being effective in charming his most serious opponents such as the King of France, who is one of the most interesting characters in bot seasons. Juan is so corrupt he disgusts his own ally, a Conquistador captain from Spain. Cesare and Lucrezia fall between the two. Both are willful, but smart and ruthless. Cesare leaves a lot of the dirty work to his bodyguard, Michelotto Corella, but Cesare plans all the dirty deeds, and participates in many of them, with a mask.<br /><br />In my review of the first season, I said it was hard to keep everyone straight, especially all the cast members who are cardinals (except for the distinct face of Derek Jacobi, who does not survive the first season.) It usually takes no more than a second viewing to sort everything out.<br /><br />At the risk of revealing a spoiler, I will say one of the most interesting aspects of the series is the relations between the Borgia family members, which are often no less intense than the relations with lovers and enemies.<br /><br />I suspect the production benefitted from being able to use buildings from the Renaissance in Rome, Milan, Naples, and Florence which are still around. When I walked the streets of Florence in 1964, it seemed as if I were walking them in 1500.

It's nice that it can convert an image to a PDF file but beyond that, it doesn't seem very useful.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Especially for people whose families were in the Americas long before the Revolutionary War, but who were not included in 1787 when citizenship began, I highly recommend this particular cinematic version of President Lincoln. The story is well-known; however, the inclusion of other historic figures, such as Stevens from PA, who played pivotal roles to unify the country was something high school students could later become history majors in college. Inspiration from taking the heat in the Congress while advocating rights to the most repressed groups in America? Read more of Thaddeus Stevens!<br /><br />Native People, African Americans, Hispanic & Franco Americans were all denied, despite the many treaties as America implemented its own form of Nationhood. President Jefferson called his policies of militaristic genocide toward Native people \\"incorporation.\\" Meaning, if you give us your lands, deny your way of life, accept Christianity, and sign this \\"treaty,\\" we will call you citizen with no rights while we march you further west. Keep praying, keep marching? By the time of Abraham Lincoln, black slaves were no longer economical investments: absolute social order and control was necessary to continue separating the North & South divisions.<br /><br />Spain, France, and their own promises to cultural regions were insignificant to America's westward thrust and conquer. Of all the treaties with France & Spain promising full rights as citizens and to hold lands in America with free passage to and from?? Why are we still waiting for the 22d Century to grant such treaty rights? Yet, the movie \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" tells us: it's in the many lifeless bodies. Somehow, we can understand his pain ... Then, to the west with trains: Asians slave & their rights are denied by State laws and eager courts, especially the U.S. Supreme Court.<br /><br />The Congress sits, deliberates, and the ardent elite politicians play every measured angle while the Civil War continues past the Great Signing at Appomattox. While the elite, white men gather their thoughts, America continues in near collapse. The religious minorities, like the racial and ethnic minorities, struggle for acceptance; the whole country struggles to regain a sense of \\"country.\\" The feeling of Country in the 16th - 18th century was something understood by White America. Hence, citizenship was never questioned in 1787.<br /><br />However, by the end of the Civil War, it was no longer clear what citizenship meant. The amendments: the 13th, 14th, and the Civil Rights Acts, with the power to enforce, were the absolute to stop the prevalent violence in America. The War had continued; only, most Americans have never considered hearing it from their \\"minority\\" friends. Hell, the country was barely productive without the enslaving railroads that stole Indian lands, and would later destroy labor unions with military support. Carnegie bought European technology, and without immigrants to supply the intellect, even the trains, electricity, and later the automobiles would have been delayed.<br /><br />Lincoln traveled on a timeless ship: it was powered by his pure mind and devout belief in God. As he sailed in his dream, we saw only a portion, I am positive he envisioned our time. Not much has really changed: the religious, racial, ethnic, cultural, and sexual minorities still strive for acceptance and commerce; the white elite still control the purse strings & companies - now reaching international; and, the Hispanic & Franco populations still wait for the U.S. Congress and their unforgotten promises.<br /><br />As a Black man sits in the White House, a highly educated and talented man and his family, we watch an imprisoned man cautioned by the ruling class and their Press. Warned of great doom by the Banks, Investors on Wall Street, and we all must pay taxes? Including the wealthy? And, all of this because the Black slaves wanted their freedom? It's a most unusual, but rewarding experience to watchhistory unroll into our current dilemmas that trouble the owners of this Country. It is more than Truth: it is our Mirror.

Makes the Wizard of OZ look like a cheap 1 cent gumball. Notice most negatives are from those on laptops. Who watches a work of art on a laptop?  Cheesy! Just because you cannot afford to view the movie the way it was meant to be viewed does not mean it should be downgraded.  Sorry excuse to downgrade a flick that deserves a million Golden Globes and Oscars.  A true classic that will be around forever.  I cannot wait to view it again.

B0036T31YY|4.0|Haven't we learned by now that those three hour tours, whether by land, sea or air always end in tragedy and horror? This one is a gripping tale of physiological and probably supernatural horror for a group of friends who go on that fateful boat ride and end up on a derelict ship and that is where the fun and horror begin. The main protagonist is the potential girlfriend for the boat captain who is mostly unfamiliar and therefore untrustworthy to the rest of the friends. I could explain the plot but that would give away too much and honestly it is better going into the movie blind. The movie itself has aspects of Groundhogs Day and the Twighlight Zone once the scene starts resetting and you start to figure out what is going on it becomes truly intense and a sight to behold. I would highly recommend this if you like this kind of movie.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|This sounds great, brought back memories of when I was a kid ok I was prob 10-13,  I was born in the 70s and used to listen to lp that parents origionally owned in the early 80s on a crapy turntable. Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper.. All I can say is wow. I used to listen to Rubber Soul over and over..  I used to escape in to music to forget the family issues. this is so good, i want to listen to this over and over again.  Yes, even when vinyl was going south due to tapes i loved it on lp in the 80s.  These versions sound so good. Just like I remember when i was a kid. Minus the scratches and pop and zips. I have heard cd and mp3s but they just did not sound the same.. I thought it was just me getting older.. But nope this hit the spot triggering lost good memories.  Enough on memory lane..The clarity is wonderful even things I never heard before. I was realy worried about the review on this and how people got there package and condition. Either i got lucky or they got it fixed.  I think it was fixed, Package was flawless,  correctly packaged.. It s the overpackage like in the pictures,amazon did not goof mine up.  the record was flawless..vinyl looks crisp and clean(sound is crisp and clean also). I actually avoided getting it a little cheaper from non direct amazon, but with the concerns of others I I wanted the best way to return it if there was a issue.. Guess what there is no issue.. So It was a few dollars for peice of mind. I listened to major covers that people had issues first and i have not had a issue.. Looks like the manufacturing issue was resolved.. I work in a manufacuting plant and all i can say was looks like they tried for quanitiy not quality.. But the quality came back after all the reviews.

The detail of his artwork alone is enough to keep anyone looking at this gem over and over again. Great stuff. Get it, love it, support Bernie Wrightson.

B0086213XW|5.0|The love triangle story has been told a million times, of course. But, Sarah Polley's version is searing nevertheless. Seth Rogen is surprisingly powerful in the role of the especially likable wronged husband. Sarah Silverman knocks it out of the park in a supporting role. Michelle Williams is terrific as always. Even though her character is cast as self-absorbed she gives a winning performance - as does her lover in the film (an actor I've never heard of and whose name I can't recall.) Most of all, Polley's story will pierce the heart of anyone who cares about romance.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|While I'm not someone who can say \\"I've listened to Sabbath since '71!\\" I can say that I've listened to them my whole adult life, since I was maybe 12 (I am now 26).<br /><br />When I first heard Sabbath was getting together to do an album with Rick Rubin, I was not optimistic. I have heard this \\"Sabbath is doing a new album\\" song more than that annoying Adele song. \\"I'll believe it when I see/hear it.\\"<br /><br />Then I heard \\"Is God Dead?\\" I thought it was ok. (It's since grown on me.)<br /><br />I was not actually going to buy this album because \\"Is God Dead?\\" did not overly impress me. I decided to give the other songs a chance though, and listened to the clips that are available on iTunes. What made me go out and purchase this CD (the deluxe edition, specifically) was Methademic. Wow! What a jam.<br />I am very happy that I picked this CD up. It's actually VERY good. No, it does not compare to my favorite Sabb album, Vol. 4., but that's ok! It's still chock full of good tunes, with my favorites being Methademic, Damaged Souls, Age of Reason, and Live Forever. In an age where so many bands cater to the .99 cent download crowd, it's nice to know that there are bands out there that still want to write several good songs, if not a solid, complete album. I guess that Sabbs are a dying breed. Ozzy sounds pretty good on here and doesn't sound auto-tuned to death. These songs actually sound like ones he can pull off live, which is cool, because I really hope they DO play these songs live. I imagine they'd sound killer! Geezer's bass and Tony's guitar are unmistakably \\"them.\\" The two sounds go hand in hand, like beer and pretzels. I'm in awe that Tony was able to write and record all of this while receiving treatment for cancer. What a man!<br /><br />Anyway, for those of you who were not overly optimistic about this album, like me, I really think you're missing out by not getting it. It's really quite good and it deserves a chance. No, it's not War Pigs or Snowblind but it's still way better than 90% of the garbage most rock/metal bands are putting out these days. That aside, it is still good on it's own, without the marginal bands to compare it to.

1781162646|4.0|First, let me say that this is not a complaint or a criticism (I loved \\"Joyland\\"). I am just asking this question out of curiosity. As the author of two novels (\\"The Bridge Tender\\" and \\"River of Mist and Light\\") and a soon to be published third, I fully appreciate how difficult it can be for an author to remember every little detail throughout hundreds of pages of a manuscript. On page 67, Dev asks Lane Hardy if he needs a license to operate the ferris wheel. Hardy replies that the state of \\"South Carolina\\" only requires a valid state driver's license. But isn't Joyland in North Carolina? I am only up to page 70 so far so maybe this is explained later on. Just wondering if SK's literary agent and editor erred (I once received a particularly nasty rejection letter from a literary agent because I used two words -- \\"alluvial\\" and \\"discectomy\\" -- in a 63,000 word manuscript that she had never previously heard of.)<br /><br />I am thoroughly enjoying this novel and think it is a perfect summer read. As others have said, it is a bittersweet coming of age story that triggers many memories of the early 1970s (including having one's heart broken by a fickle girlfriend). \\"Joyland\\" not only reminds me of \\"The Body,\\" a.k.a. \\"Stand By Me,\\" but it also calls to mind \\"Water for Elephants.\\" I have always loved SK's remarkable facility for capturing the vernacular of the time and place of his stories, such as the prison lingo of \\"Rita Hayworth and the ShawShank Redemption\\" and the pre-teen lingo of 12-year old boys in \\"Stand By Me.\\" He strikes similar gold in \\"Joyland.\\" And while I also love his horror stories, this novel, like those two novellas (and \\"Misery\\"), also shows that Stephen King's best writing has little or nothing to do with monsters or the supernatural. Hopefully the e-book revolution will free him up to write the kinds of stories HE wants to write rather than just the annual horror story required of him by big name publishers whose golden handcuffs have long boxed himinto a corner. Can you imagine how many more fantastic non-horror stories like \\"Stand By Me\\"/\\"The Body\\" he would have written if ebooks had been around 30 years ago?<br /><br />Again, \\"Joyland\\" is pure summer delight. As you read it, you can almost smell the crackling hot popcorn, the delicious swirls of cotton candy, the tantalizing chili dogs, and the warm salt breezes coming off the adjoining beach. Do yourself a favor and read this book this summer.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Wow what a wonderful talent this girl has. Renee Olstead perfectly captures the essence of the jazz lounge with a sweet emphatic voice that tugs at your heart. Wonderful stuff.
B0091Q82L8|4.0|\\"Live at Hull\\" is the Frankenstein of Who albums--the recording was fraught with issues including John Entwistle's missing bass part for the first six songs on this release (all on disc one) and the first song on disc two--this required some \\"surgery\\" to create a patch work creature (hence the Frankenstein comparison)as the producer and restoring engineer had to \\"fly in\\" Entwistle's bass part from \\"Live at Leeds\\" for these parts. Interestingly, I always thought that Entwistle should have tackled a Frankenstein\\" rock opera as it would have been right up his quirky alley.<br /><br />Is \\"Live at Hull\\" essential for hardcore Who fans? Yep. While the set is largely the same as Leeds, the energy is stronger here (for \\"Leeds\\" the band was exhausted) even though this is an inferior recording. Be aware, though, that this IS a warts and all type of reissue--you can hear (as is described) the sound of Mooney hitting the mic with his sticks as he bashes away among other sonic analog imperfections. I wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />The disc is broken up with \\"Tommy\\" occupying the second disc and the other Who songs that appeared on Leeds appear here with the exception of \\"Magic Bus\\" on the first.<br /><br />I know there are those hate digipaks with plastic CD holders in it but I'd rather have that than a mini-LP style gatefold sleeve where the discs risk being scratched.<br /><br />There's also a booklet that describes the painstaking restoration of the tape for this release.<br /><br />Does this CD set have its sonic shortcomings? Sure. Having said that, the performances are energetic and different enough to make this set essential for hardcore Who fans. Casual fans can pick up [[ASIN:B000002OVJ Live at Leeds]] and be happy satisfied with it.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|If you want to purchase all of the versions (bluray3d/2d/dvd/digital) dont buy the 3d version. IT IS A SCAM. They do not offer a bundle with all versions and I wanted the 3d the most so I bought it at the cheapest price I could find it ($32). After you void the warrenty by opening it you get a coupon to buy the 2d version for an additional $5.99.<br /><br />The reason this is a scam is:<br /><br />If you you bought the 2d/dvd/digital combo you also get the $5.99 deal but for the 3d. However the 2d/dvd/digital pack is only $22.99 so you will only spend $29 and you will have the dvd as well.<br /><br />If you are a cump like me and wanted the 3d version you pay $34 as a base. Then you add $5.99 for just the ability to play a 2d version in bluray but still get no dvd. Instead you have just spent $40 to have less product and an uglier case.<br /><br />It is really a sham that Disney would trick people who want the 3d enough to pay extra for less. Nowhere on Disney's site or any other can you find an add for the ability to purchase the 3d or 2d versions after the fact.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a deep and compelling study of individuals coping wih serious personal and universal problems.

B005JS7W4K|5.0|This box set comes complete with Tim's early works from his self titled debut to Locra. It is a  great value (only 15 dollars plus shipping for five Tim Buckley albums). This collection is a great glimpse into the beginning and middle periods (though sadly Starsailor is not included, thus this does not feature all of Tim's jazz albums but it has most of them). It's perfect for anyone who is just introduced to Tim's music. From Starsailor onward, Tim began to lose a lot of his fan base but nonetheless remained relentlessly innovative. Many new to Tim's music may be put off by his later work without giving it a proper chance. I would recommend starting with this box set and moving though Tim's more approachable material before delving into his deeper cuts (Starsailor, Look At The Fool, even Locra though it is included). Tim's voice was truly extraordinary and his songs allow for an escape. In this world of manufactured pop acts (mostly), this type of music is a gem. Good music exists, you just have to look for it. Sometimes when you're looking you come across something truly extraordinary. Tim Buckley certainly fits that definition. He was on a journey and lucky for us he left a treasure trove of great music for us to enjoy for years to come.
B001TODCII|4.0|As an action flick, it's only pretty good. What makes it special? First, Liam Neeson always brings his movies into a higher range than they would normally be. Such is the case here. Second, this movie is honest enough not to portray the White slavers as either a. Germans b. upper-class English, or  c. American Southerners, which are the three choices you have when casting bad guys in movies. This film courageously identifies the villains as Albanians, who are, in reality- the reigning pimps, fencers, drug smugglers and all-around scum of Europe. Such a plot element is_very_politically incorrect (since the Albanians are predominantly Moslem) but_very_honest.

B00821PCJS|4.0|I like this genre &#34;post apocalyptic / alien invasion&#34;. So far I have gone through the first season and will be starting second. It is not as dark and dreary as others of this type and you see alot of the human relationships going on between the necessary battle scenes.  I recently saw this series advertised and did not realize that it had been around for a few seasons, so I will be playing catch up so I can watch the new ones.

0807014273|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning is a true classic in both Holocaust Studies and psychology, among other fields.  Frankl asks a question that has haunted humanity since the 1940's - how  can we make any sense of the holocaust and the suffering that was engendered by this horrific part of history?  As a survivor of four concentration camps as well as a psychotherapist before the war, Frankl is in a unique position to address this question.  He claims that logotherapy, a form of therapy that relies on the human ability to provide meaning to life, to set goals and work toward achieving these goals.  This was the key to his surviving time in concentration camps.  It also allowed him to help other inmates who lived in utter despair in the camps.  Frankl shows us ways that we can use this same concentration on goals in our own lives today as a way of facing crises and challenges in our lives.  I have seen this work positively in the dying and the terminally ill.  Man's Search for Meaning has given valuable nnew tools for addressing life and facing the future.  It is well worth reading and pondering.

B007BVMVDU|5.0|There are plenty reviews online praising this show, and for good reason. It really is THAT good.<br /><br />Note: for those sensitive towards such material, there are a lot of scenes of women being treating as objects/animals. It is fitting for the world the story is crafted in, but it could make some viewers uncomfortable. I think they handle it well, and that dynamic can server as an important story element at times, but I just thought I'd share.

B000N4SADC|5.0|Don't look for tunes that will make you want to whistle along - this isn't pop music.

B0084FB8OU|4.0|For some time you dont quite realise the narrative flow and then suddenly it becoms apparent. It's a story that touches upon raw emotions but does it with no judegments. very sensitive,
B001DM1VXE|1.0|The premise of the movie was good, but they tried too much to be \\"artsy,\\" and they introduced unnecessary side plots that detracted from the main plot.  The result was failure to provide a coherent story with some sort of interesting ending, as hinted in the description.  The black and white video was extremely poor quality, and the background \\"noise\\" that tried to pass itself off as music was bothersome, to say the least.  I assume that this was all intentional, but it's difficult to understand why.  I would have stopped watching about half way through, but I thought that maybe the story line would come together and reward me for the torture of having to watch and listen to all this blurry video and bothersome background noise.  I was wrong.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This came is awesome I first played it on Facebook now I play on my kindle fire...I can't get enough of it. It synced perfectly to my Facebook
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|Where are all these great reveiws coming from? If they're coming from young people, go listen to every song from the first 15 or so albums and then write a review. This pales in comparison. If they're coming from old people, like myself, you are living in a fantasy world if you think this is a great album. It isn't bad. I like the idea Sabbath wasn't held up by the label to do some shorter songs. But with probably all of the songs, I like a part here or there, but not the whole song. Perhaps Mr. Rubin should have had them listening to the much more melodious 2nd album, Paranoid, than the 1st LP. The first album is great, but Black Sabbath had just learned to crawl that morning. It's like comparing the Wright brothers airplane to a fighter jet; while all new and unseen before, look at the successors. Paranoid seems like it was dropped off in their laps from someone from another planet. It is that good, I put it in the top 5 albums ever with Abbey Road, The White Album, The Wall and Aqualung. Ah well, maybe Rick will have them listen to it for the next release. Better yet, why waste time listening to the 1st album. Maybe they should have brought back their 1st 3 album's producer, Rodger Bain. Unless he's dead, deaf or demented, why not give him a shot, he's only a few years older than them. Most Sabb fans probably don't know; the rain & church bells in \\"Black Sabbath\\" and the sirens in \\"War Pigs\\", 2 of the most iconic intros ever in rock music, were added by Rodger Bain in post production. The band themselves were amazed & delighted upon hearing the final product. Just for that contribution alone, Rodger is worthy; what have they got to lose?<br /><br />There's nothing great here on 13. Just average hard rock for 2013. You have to start with the song or riff first. Then worry about everything else around it. Unfortunately, though sounding totally different than Heaven & Hell's \\"The devil you know\\", it reminds me of that very album with a few brilliant seconds at a time, but nothing sustaining for an entire length of a track.<br /><br />You cannot blame Sabbath for this. There is a large market for them, especially in concert. They're doing 4 out of 16 songs from \\"13\\" at their shows, up from the 1 or 2 they used to play from their latest release. I commend them for trying to put out a great record. Unfortunately, you need TALENT & YOUTH to put out a great rock record. Sabbath had it for years but they simply don't anymore and that's OK. When you have YOUTH & NO TALENT, you get ALL of today's pathetic popular music. Can anyone tell me the last time an all time great rocker put out even one great song after the age of 45, let alone age 65 like they are? The answer is NEVER! It doesn't happen. Take Iommi; last great menacing riff - \\"The Eternal Idol\\" from 1987 when he was 39 years old, last great solo - \\"Feels Good to Me\\" from 1990's \\"TYR\\" when he was 42.<br /><br />Instrumentally, Sabbath in concert doing the old songs, absolutely great, play them better than ever; don't miss a note as I've witnesses 25 times probably. Black Sabbath on this new record, to use a metaphor, reminds me of the great boxer George Foreman during his comeback in the 1980s & 1990s. You're waiting and waiting for him to just pull the trigger once at the right time and knockout his oppenent to the ground. He did do it once (at 47 against Michael Moorer) and became the champion again, but after that fight, it never happened again in all of his remaining fights. But when he was young, he would just bludgeon opponents quickly (down goes Frazier, down goes Frazier) not unlike Black Sabbath in the 70s. With Sabbath on this album, you're waiting & waiting also for that memorable few minutes of joy. That Electric Funeral, Into the Void, Supernaut, Fluff, Sabbra Cadabra, You Won't Change Me, Never say Die, Die Young, Mob Rules, Trashed or Headless Cross you wait for. But, sadly, it never comes on this album. Maybe the next one!<br /><br />One last sentiment! It's wholly ironic to me that after years of great music being basically ignored by the mainstream, a late subpar offering should take off for them. I hope it sells 10 million copies to compensate somewhat. I guess that's called deferred Karma. Still, Sabbath should have been a much bigger band, certainly bigger than that fraud of plagiarists called led zeppelin.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Short review.  First heard BS in 1970 on a reel to reel tape player.  Have been a big fan ever since.  13 is a very good cd and well worth the $16 I paid for the delux version with the 4 extra songs.  Yeh, I know, my review sucks.  But I did like the cd; not so much the first time, but it grew on me fast after I figured out what they were doing.  And that is to give BS fans what they have liked in the past and not try to reinvent themselves at 65 years of age.  I think they did a great job and I hope there's a 14 in the works.

B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|This is not for little kids. They would be bored because they would get confused. Plus there is nudity and sexual content and some violence as well as mildly disturbing content of diet (I can't say what without giving away what happens).<br />I almost gave this movie 4 stars because of the complexity in trying to keep it all straight in the beginning, but I had things pretty well figured out by the end. Because I liked it so much I gave it 5 stars. Is it the greatest movie of all time? No. But I liked it so much I watched it twice in a row. I don't remember doing that for any movie other than Star Wars when it came out in the 1970's. I don't usually like to watch the same thing twice within a few years of first viewing, but this one had me wanting to see it again right away. I wanted to see some of the things I missed the first time while concentrating on what was going on. There was a lot of jumping around in time of different stories (the parts I had trouble keeping straight), but they were all tied together in some way in the end. If I had not liked it, I would not have watched it a second time right away, or at all. I would actually like to purchase this movie for keeps even though we just rented it &watched it twice.<br /><br />It has an all star cast of actors who play different characters throughout the movie. Sometimes it's hard to figure out who the actor is because of make up/costume, but that's what you have to do to help figure out the movie. If you are not sure who played a character, you can see pictures when the credits roll at the end.<br /><br />My 19 yr. son started watching the movie after it had started and played for a while. He was lost. You really have to pay attention because of the jumping around. But I really enjoyed it. It really got my brain going. I enjoyed seeing the actors play different characters and trying to figure out who was who.

B002QE3CTY|3.0|This was one of the options for the One Book selection at our school, and I'm glad that it wasn't selected.<br /><br />This was an OK read.  It had action, but the characters were dull, and as the end of the book approached, the story kind of fell flat.  Usually I'll go on to read #2 and #3 of a trilogy, but this one, I'm not sure that I really want to, unless the characters and story become more interesting.  In other books where kids find themselves in extreme situations, the reader can usually see the context of what and why it's happening.  Not really in this one.... I'm trying not to give a spoiler here.... some vague mention about problems with life in the real world outside of the maze, but not a satisfying enough answer for me to want to continue.<br /><br />Probably OK as a quick summer read.

I read the first book and I had no real desire to continue onwards.

You can read the first book within a few hours and decide for yourself.

B00CISC2DA|3.0|I am a diehard Boards of Canada fan (I have almost all of their back catalogue in one form or another) but I'm not going to jump on the 5 star band wagon simply because Tomorrow's Harvest is a long awaited hugely overdue release from them.  I know that's going to cause a lot of people to give my review an unhelpful vote (and if you do so, I would be curious to know in the comments section why you think my review is unhelpful).<br /><br />With that said, I'm slightly underwhelmed.  I won't get into a song by song analysis of the album because others have.  What dismays me is that there is an overabundance of what seems like atmospheric filler and when the trademark sluggish and dreamy beats finally make an appearance a third of the way into the album they just don't grab me like past releases.  I didn't think it was possible for BoC to get anymore chill than they already are but with Tomorrow's Harvest they have moved into a much more ambient arena with less focus on the beats that have always kept me coming back for more.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is quintessentially a BoC release through and through, and I get that they were going for a darker sound.  I read in an interview that they were influenced by '70s and `80s soundtracks - in particular those by John Carpenter and Fabio Frizzi - and in that regard they succeed in spades.  I suppose that's where all the atmospheric filler comes in.<br /><br />Tomorrow's Harvest is a bleak listen and plays like a lost soundtrack to an imaginary obscure arthouse suspense thirller (I fell asleep listening to this on repeat the first day I got it and boy, did I have some seriously messed up dreams).<br /><br />I will continue to listen to this hoping it \\"clicks\\" for me, but right now nothing really stands out with the exception of Cold Earth, Palace Posy (both much too short which I read was intentional), and Nothing is Real (which sounds like the beginning of an awesome track that never really starts).  Even so these tracks don't stick in my head hours after listening to them.<br /><br />Tomorrow's Harvest is neither a bad album nor is it a 5 star album for me. It's just lackluster in comparison to what I know BoC is capable of doing.  Yet at the end of the day any new BoC is better than none so I'm not complaining.
B00CW665VI|3.0|I had a hard time coming to grips with how the book was written  I.e.  the storyteller or narrator is speaking directly to me throughout the whole book.  It was one of those books that I actually could put down & come back to later.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|This is a great album.  Too bad it took so long for the rest of the world to discover him.
1451695195|5.0|Once again a confirmation in the life hereafter!  It truly was a miracle and Dr Alexander did a wonderful job addressing the scientific community.  As a physician, I know that God or an angel is with me always.  Some days I really feel it in my soul.  Being a Christian first and a Dr second, my beliefs have made me feel sorry for those who can't accept that because they are a scientist first.  How can you witness the birth of a baby and not believe in a higher being!  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this game deserves 5 stars but, as it does not have any REAL ability to customize, I give it 4. Try allowing us to choose different clothes etc.
B008AUGEFC|1.0|EACH OF THE SIX \\"STORIES\\" OR TIMELINES HOLD MERIT, BUT THE READER IS LEFT TO REACH HIS OWN CONLCUSIONS REGARDING HOW THE STORIES RELATE OR INTERACT.  I ASSUME THE WRITER FELT THIS BETTER THAN SPELLING OUT THE ENTIRE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS, BUT FRANKLY I FOUND IT A REAL LET DOWN. IN THE END IT UP TO YOU TO DERTERMINE HOW EACH TIMELINE LEADS (OR DOES NOT LEAD) TO THE NEXT
0670014893|5.0|A Delicate Truth is the most suspenseful book I have ever read. Almost every page is filled with tension. The author has an heroic imagination, a gift for colorful details, and the ability to create an unforgettably dramatic story. I finished reading it a few days ago but am still living with it. If your heart is strong enough, this is the book for you.
B00BJ60LJO|5.0|Well it's not quite like the old Moody Blues but it is a very nice album.  A lot of emotion in the songs.  I thoroughly enjoy listening to the album.  Although this is a two record set the last two songs are club versions of &#34;I know you're out there&#34;  Nothing like the rest of the album and is the whole side 4.  Just filler if you ask me.  I don't listen to those.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I started with the free version and bought the paid version.  It's very a gentle way to wake up in the morning. :)
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not my favorite Sookie Stackhouse novel, but I'm sure I'll keep reading. It just feels as if it was written too fast.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Nice twist on a old story and might be one of the best Trek movies yet. I think over all it's a very well done movie.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|the 3D was terrible it hardly worked i ended up just putting my 3D glasses on during the dogfight scenes even then it was crap i wouldnt buy this so called 3D version its just not worth it the blu ray qaulity was very very good and the best top gun has ever looked.
B000KI6286|3.0|I could have done without the sex and filthy language, the reality of the powerful lobbyist was depicted pretty well . I laughed at a few scenes. but like I said the sex and language were not appreciated.
B00CM7FLZ8|2.0|When I first got this game I would have given it a 5 for how much fun the gameplay is. But the makers of the game give little instruction on how each weapon works in different situations. If you want to skip a hard level you have to buy it. If you want to see a solution you have to buy it. If you want to unlock all levels it will cost you $7.00 and is supposed to work on all devices on your account&hellip;NOT! All solutions&hellip;$12.80. You're going to spend a lot of money to have a fully functioning game to play. It's fun but not worth that much money for 1 game.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Much better than earlier versions for touch pads. Easier to navigate and see things. Like it, like it, like it.
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|The way they ended the series kind of let me down. I'll say no more for anyone who hasn't seen it. But they did a really great job throughout the entire series. Love it.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|What an intricately woven portrayal of a fantastic story of love, loss, and power... Raw emotions, tragedy, and stolen moments of happiness make this a story worth diving into and letting yourself get lost in it, escaping from reality into fantasy.
B00D2K40WY|2.0|This game is the exact same thing as the other makeup games this brand has produced. Mostly. Even all the makeup is the same! At least some creativity would be nice. All in all, its not a bad game but all you do is the exact same thing for the characters in all the salon games. I don't recommend buying it unless you truly want to spend money on it.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I am blown away by this album.  It is QOTSA's Dark Side of the Moon.  A total trip (without the negative side effects afterward)!
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|This was a good flick to watch.  The story is known to most, but the interpretation was good.  If you don't like musicals/opera stay away.  It made my wife cry.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Fun to play.  Highly addictive.  But there were way too many technical issue to make this game real winner.  Work on it and republish it.
B009K72G8I|4.0|I bought this for my grandson who is 5, and he cannot get enough of this series.  If you like animation or Star Wars I think you will like this.
B005MJDJQQ|4.0|Solid Wallander Mystery if you're into the series.  I've read many of them and will end up reading entire series.
1452000247|5.0|Peter a Darkened Fairy Tale was an enchanting story of boy turning ten who falls into a clock that is a portal into the world of his dreams. He meets many magical creatures on his fascinating adventure to save the Shylong and thus the land from an evil trying to tear it apart. This story was very well written, perfect for my thirteen year old but captivated my attention as well. (My 11 year old is reading it now!)<br /><br />With a brilliant plot, charming imaginative characters, and vivid descriptions, this book will capture your attention. I was reminded of Alice in Wonderland but thought my boys would enjoy this tale more because of the non-stop action with witches, fairies, elves, and a dragon. The book was beautifully poetic at times and the poems at the end were one of my favorite parts. All in all this tale was charming yet dark and managed to touch my heart.<br /><br />And now for my son's opinion. My son said it was an interesting story that had him wanting to finish it. (He stayed up late reading this one.) He says it was a twisted tale with a happy ending. His favorite part was learning about all the different creatures in the land of Peter's dreams. In this story you'll meet Fingle, a lightening bug that eats pineapple chunks, a bluebird man, a mouse, a Jester who lost his marbles, a wizard that makes bones for the mushrooms to dance, fairies, elves, Shylongs, the King of the toads, Hally, who rubs himself all over with chicken so the guards won't eat him, an old spirit, friendly ghosts, the dwellers, a warrior, a good and a bad witch and their half dead evil father. Many times he told me about a funny part, something that made him laugh. Other times he would tell me about things like pocket dimensions, this book had him intrigued. He's says the story was fun, silly, odd, creepy, adventurous, and twisted. His favorite characters were Mr. Twindle Twondle, Peter and the Dragon.<br /><br />My son is an avid reader of books like Harry Potter, and Artemis Fowl. He has already recommended this book to his brothers! I would recommend it to anyone that is young at heart!
0439023513|3.0|It is a nice book for kids under 14 years old. It is not a big literature for adults and can be kind of boring.
193700788X|5.0|Im not sure why all these people are saying this book was terrible. My copy was fantastic and i loved the ending. Im sad its over but the end made me smile!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Mads Mikkelsen is perfect. He's calm, manipulative, intimidating, and eerily believable. I watched all of the episodes available in about two days.
0061950726|5.0|If your a lover of history, this is the book for you. They're not many books out there that can make me shed a tear or two (in truth their is not much that can make me cry period), but this one had the tears welling up and spilling out. All I can say is thank goodness I was sitting in my car alone while waiting for my husband to get out of work.<br /><br />The orphan trains that were spoke of in the book existed between 1854-1930. These trains would take orphaned or abandoned children from the east coast to the Midwest. Some of the children would be adopted into loving families. Others were indentured to families to work on the farm as labor or to work in the house helping take care of the children and other household duties. Many were abused, beaten, sexually molested, raped, or thrown out to fend for themselves. The really sad part is that these children really had no rights what so ever and many times were not believed if they complained. These were the castaways that no body really wanted.<br /><br />The story goes back and forth between 2011 Maine and the 1930's and 1940's in Minnesota. We have two main characters, Vivian and Molly.<br />In this story Vivian was one of the orphan train children. She was an Irish immigrant who was orphaned in New York City. She was handed over to what was called the Children's Aid Society for care and was then placed on one of these trains. Molly is a Native American teenager who has been tossed into bad Foster Homes since she was little. Molly tries to steal a book from the library and is given 50 hours of community service. Molly is directed towards Vivian, who is 91 at the time, to help clean out her attic.<br /><br />While Molly is helping Vivian with the attic, Vivian's story about her childhood is being told. Molly comes to find out that she and Vivian are not that much different in how they grew up and an unlikely bond grows between the two ladies.<br /><br />As a mother, reading Vivian's story is quite painful at times to hear. Children did not have many rights during the time Vivian grew up so they could be beaten, made to work long hours with no food, piss poor living conditions, and a host of other things. I think what really ticks me off is that the organizations like the Children's Aid Society ignored what was going on. They knew what kind of life some of these children were going to have and they had no qualms about releasing them into the care of what I would call Monsters. I understand that times were different from now, but how can you look at a child and do what some of these people did. I don't think I will ever understand.<br /><br />The story is not entirely about the abuse. Vivian and Molly both have their share of some happy moments especially between the middle to the ending of the book. It shows you that even under the most dire circumstances that if you want to survive, you can. Your life is what you make it out to be. The actions in your past should not define who you are. Yes they happened, and yes they really sucked, but you can rise above all the hardships and negativity that you have suffered through. That is why I gave this 5 stars and would highly recommend it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is so amazing it always reminds me to get stuff,or do something ,or more .you should get this app if  your really busy and need a to remember stuff
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Its a good little iPhone/HTC One holder.<br />However it hard to put it in. The spring is hard as a rock.<br /><br />Also dont trust the bipod. Your phone will fall with a &#34;flick&#34;
B005MMY9A8|4.0|It was worth watching but I wouldn't say it was a must see movie. At least the script wasn't dumb like so many of this genre. Never bored me.
B001P7HUF0|4.0|Francis Ford Coppola brings a John Grisham story about a young lawyer who's a good guy to the movies.  This was made many years ago and rarely noticed.  But I like good guy stories.  All the cliches bandied about only helps make light of the serious good lawyers do.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|The watch is okay, but seems to lose minutes of time over a period of time.  I wear it most of the time, unless I'm working on the house, at which time I wear another brand that I own.  I bought it because of the self-winding feature, and was surprised to find that if you don't wear it for about a day and a half, it stops working.  In addition, it doesn't automatically calculate the days at the end of a month, for example 5/31 or 2/28.  You need to manually reset it depending on the month involved.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I thought this film was eye-opening to say the least.  Very well thought out and put together.  I found myself shocked at the state of our food system.  A must watch!
B008PE9GSA|4.0|This is my first ZZ Top album and I quite enjoy it! It makes me think of my father, who has always been a ZZ Top fan. This album is worth a chance; it'll grow on you.
145210655X|5.0|My husband has been a star wars fan forever. My son is taking after him as well. This is an adorable graphic novel/comic book type book showing darth vader and son activities. My husband reads this to my son at least 3x or more a week. Or my son reads it to him by discussing the pictures. Jeffrey Brown has a few other star wars books and I plan on getting them all.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I need directions on how to use the game, and what the symbols stand for.  Also explain how to get from one country to another.
B008PHN6F6|5.0|Was so excited when this movie became available on Amazon instant video. The quality is always excellent! My video tape had become all worn out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love him. He is by far my favorite fictional character.  I could read Gideon Cross the rest of my life and die happy.
1416955070|5.0|I was very happy when I got \\" City of Bones\\" new! It was in perfect condition and I paid less money then if I would have purchased the book at the book store! I am very pleased!:)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I started watching the series since episode 1 when it was on TV.  If you are a fan of Alias you will enjoy this series.  Good job all around from writing to set design.  Anna seems to be playing a little 'woody' of a character at first, but then you learn that's just how it was written.  In later series you start to learn about the backside of the main actress' character.  The fringe-science writing catches you off balance at times thinking &#34;this could be real&#34;.  I'd recommend this show to anybody.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My nine years old daugther love it and plays a lot in my tablet !. It is one of her favorites.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very engaging! Provides insight to life in Afghanistan, a culture very foreign to me, as an American. Nicely woven tale.
B0095P31L6|3.0|I liked the theme, water is precious. The story location is a wild wild west setting is nostalgic. The animation is different. At times it scares my granddaughter. It's okay to  watch once in a while.
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|Great movie! Fun for the whole family! Great for baseball fans and fans of the Cleveland Indians. Fun family movie night selection.
B00011D1OA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movie, I wanted to share with my granddaughters.  We enjoyed it and will again soon.  The discs were in great shape with not one bad place at all.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was in a motorcycle accident on a weekend and I have a broken elbow and a broken foot on my left side so I will chair and have real trouble sleeping. This app the best thing since sliced bread.  Have been able to sleep so much better with this app then without it.  Alarm that wakes me up every 3 hours to take new pills very quickly and it has a wonderful timer so I don't just happen to run all night.  I have created a few of my own soundscapes. The trick to it is to increase the volume of the closest sounds and decrease the volume.  I created a soundscape for being a ten for being a tent while the b Beach and raining just like one of my favorite camping trips.  I love the brown noise. I have heard of white noise. what is pin what is pink noise. I must do for your I must do further research.  Voice to text is the best way to write a review when you only have one hand available.  I love the low hertz sounds. If you add enough the low Hertz and the waves with the wind you can large boat  with diesel engines and a and a winter storm but you won't be getting sea sick.  I hope this review helps others distracting themselves from a doll ache, such as broken bones. This is my first review.  I am NOT the first to discover this app. I guess I said not forcefully.  Signing o if your headphones are having trouble with the law sounds download I'm quite sir with a bass boost.  I have had good luck with an app called music equalizer. It is free. Signing out for real this time Thanks
B00000F14B|5.0|I bought this because my 10-year old granddaughter saw it in a play and we decided to watch the movie.  She loved it and took it home with her to watch many more times. The disc was in excellent shape with no scratches or issues at all.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This program does what it says. And is very useful guide.  One of the wisest purchases I have made for my kindle fire hd.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Goerge Clooney is amazing as is the rest of the cast. Wonderful acting. What a fantastic take on Homer's play.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|The author took the reader on Harold's journey with the highs and lows.  I found myself laughing and crying.  One felt obliged to continue reading so as not to let him down while he searched for meaning in his life.  A great read and a great ending.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|i'm usually disappointed by how predictable and boring movies can be, but this one kept my attention the whole time, which is rare to happen with me. i have already recommended it to all my friends.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Graphics good and puzzles quite testing thereby providing enough stimulation to while away the odd spare moment of the day.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this show, this supense is killing me, but i love it!! each character brings so much to the show.
B00847KFDS|4.0|Have enjoyed CCR and John Fogerty for years.  I like the teaming up with others recording artists on established songs I know by heart and the new songs John added.  A good purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is really easy to get the hang of but its SO addictive!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend it to everyone,adults or kids!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|BEST GAME  EVER!I'm so glad that it was free!you get to build help people and all that. Here's the best part you can battle boggins
B00AEBB89C|5.0|I would recommend to anyone and I love it - I was waiting to get it again.  Try it you'll love it.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|It was okay and I did like the Willard in this version better but it was not as good as the original.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love this app.  I am able to go back and forth between my PDF Reader and this app to download and read articles when I am away from home.  Very good one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like this activity as it is calming and  requires some thought and logic.  I have not completed all of the steps and it still helps me focus.
B0054U56B4|4.0|Nice way to wrap up the series...doesn't disappoint. The structure departs from the first three, but it works hearing both perspectives, considering the plot line.
B008XG1X18|1.0|For some reason although I updated this feature, I am unable to access it.  It does not recognize my sign in.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I recommend this family friendly game to kids and adults of all ages. From 5 to 105, everyone will enjoy. The new updated versions also puts you into a new environment so that you have more excitement. If you haven&acute;t played yet, give it a try. You'll probably like it!
B003L77G6A|5.0|This show has quickly become my favorite. The cast is amazing and the story and jokes are well written. Thanks
0141324902|4.0|I bought this book as a replacement for a lost one and I was pleased with the price. This book was in very good condition for a used book and it arrived right on time.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|this movie is so well done and it sticks true to the original characters but makes them even better. can't wait for the next one.
B005HED11Y|2.0|Famous, but not nearly as good as the newer Star Treks.  Just too cheesy with not enough dialog for my liking.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|The father and son aspect of this movie made me think of my father, he to was very strong. Will and his son worked so well together that I hope they do something else. I went to see this movie and it was so good I did something that I have never done before I left the theater before it ended because after the first few minutes, I knew I was going to BUY IT and I am saving this pleasure for my home and my 92in TV, so if I make any noises it will not disturb anyone. I JUST HOPE I CAN WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT ON DVD AND NOT GO BACK AND SEE IT AGAIN.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Just as amazing as the previous seasons.  Simply one of my favorite programs.  Do yourself a favor and don't miss it!!
B0076HNCTQ|4.0|Good series a little dated. Never saw it when it originally aired. Will watch season two after this one is done.
B002SF9YNO|4.0|An unemployed cellist (Masahiro Motoki) takes his wife (Ryoko Hirosue) back to live in his hometown, where it will be cheaper to live in the former coffee shop of his deceased mother.  A misunderstanding leads him to become employed as the assistant of an undertaker (Tsutomu Yamazaki), and his involvement in this largely taboo part of Japanese culture allows him to find a new sense of peace and dignity, a stronger connection with his wife, and a form of reconcilement with the father who abandoned him.<br /><br />This is a very lovely and heartfelt film with a fine musical score.  I felt that the film strained for effect at times, but I was captivated by the characters as embodied by a cast of fine performers.  The result was a moving experience about the unexpected paths that life can sometimes lead us along.
0316056871|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome  I love Tina Fey and I love this book..  Really good read for just a &#34;nothing really&#34; read...I read it on my last cruise adn plan on reading it on my next cruise.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|A return to the Dexter of old, well-scripted, taut story lines and, as is it's hallmark, a shockingly perfect end to the season.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|I love the book, it is well written and well researched.  I think I found a new story line to enjoy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game, it is so fun!! It is epic and very cool .To me  it's like the world. In two words I would describe it great and fun.
B000E1YVZU|2.0|The songs sound like drama students making up lyrics on top of casio beats, and all the twentysomething losers at the end of their rope are a real drag.  Who thought this would be a good idea?  Who made this popular?
B0089LOG02|4.0|I never thought about a world without social services.  I was shocked to learn that orphaned children were essentially given away as slaves to any one who would take them.  I can't imagine being in the world without my family - utterly alone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Yes it was suppose to be 3, and then they turned it to a series. So what.... I still love the characters and I still what to follow through there next adventures. I don't know where I heard this quote but here it is &#34;I buy books to read&#34;. In this case I get to buy 2 more books in the series that lets us extend the beautiful story between Eva & Gideon. We get to learn and laugh with characters we've come to love just a little bit longer. My only request is to please don't wait as long between release dates for the FINAL 2. We're on board with the changes just don't make us wait as long for it Ms. Day.
B003UESJJC|5.0|The Redux version was what I watched first  I had not watched the movie in a long time so it was a real treat to see this.<br />The sound is great and the visuals have been greatly improved.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game rocks! I could play it all day which is saying something. it has crashed my kindle device once though and it took forever to get it back to normal
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is great because it has easy controls, and though pages are close together, it's still challenging when you have a few notes. When you find a building, there's that same 'I'm not going in there' thought as in The Eight Pages at the bathroom. The jump scares are of course very unexpected, as he could teleport in front of you at any moment. The ambiance and voices really add to the game as well. I did, however, come across one bug. I was running away (had just been jump scared) and all of a sudden the game started spazzing out awkwardly. It stopped a minute later, but it was very weird. Other than that one thing, great.
B004RKXNDU|1.0|lots of facts, and no information, what is the point? Once I entered middle age, I have become more and more dissatisfied with fiction.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|Just realized I'd been meaning to double back and review this album since I first purchased it in 2006<br />upon release, hoping Gilmour would perform a belated hat trick of capping a trilogy of fantastic solo<br />albums begun in 1978 with \\"David Gilmour\\" (marked by fantastic classics like \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\"<br />and \\"Short and Sweet\\" with Roy Harper helping out on vocals!) and the even more rockin' About Face in 1984 (even a few bum tracks like the boring, ill-advised and ponderous \\"Let's Get Metaphysical\\" and all couldn't diminish the sheer excitement of tracks like \\"Until We Sleep,\\" \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" and \\"Murder\\").<br /><br />But unfortunately, as for On An Island, I was spectacularly disappointed with it then and still am now.<br />It is too mellow, monotonous, boring, undistinguished, trite, and worst of all, unmoving.<br />I'm not comparing it to David's work with Pink Floyd and would never do so anyway,<br />given that his previous two solo albums, which are both excellent, have little to<br />really do with the sound of Pink Floyd (and certainly nearly nothing to do with concept albums like<br />The Wall) anyway: those two earlier solo efforts were<br />very much their own unique beasts, and in more of a straightforward, unpretentious rock and roll groove<br />than anything the Floyd did. But even the mellower ballads on both of those earlier solo<br />LPs were so much better and more moving than anything on this lame, lackluster dull effort<br />that is On An Island.<br /><br />I felt like I was on an island being dispensed sleeping pills and Thorazine!<br />I listened to it twice, hoping it would grow on me, and it never did so I shelved it forever after. I know David is older and all that, but his various recent live efforts and DVDs have proven he can still rock when he wants to, and I was hoping for something like a sequel to About Face in some sense, with at least a few hard rocking tunes but there are none to be<br />had here.  Which wouldn't be so bad if this were a GOOD mellow album, but it isn't! The songs<br />just didn't grab me, material is weak, performances lacking energy for the most part.  Production<br />and recording was fine but who cares given the material is so boring and unengaging.  Better luck<br />next time, David.  I also confess I was never very much knocked out by the post-1984 Floyd albums<br />myself, finding them uneven at best, but again, I don't think David's solo output really has<br />much to do with Floyd except when he mixes it up in his more recent live shows, perhaps.  C'mon Gilmour,<br />next time let's put some ROCK back in the ROCK MUSICIAN shall we?
B009D5VNLS|4.0|daughter loves it, had to buy the iOS game, the book, and probably more. I think the story is kind of weird: mother turns into a bear? but what do I know.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|this movie is extremely long but it didn't seem like it because the time just flew by.  everyone did a great job looking and acting out all the different characters they played.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so great to have the Bible like this at my fingertips.  I am so glad that something like this is available.  I am looking forward to downloading other books.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Being retired Navy I tend to pick apart movies made about the Navy and this one was no exception.  It was an okay movie but it could have been much much better had they consulted at least ONE person who had been in the Navy so they wouldn't have done so many technical mistakes.  (I.E. it would be Impossible to use a dropped anchor to turn a ship on a dime)  That was plain stupid.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I finished the puzzles within two days. It does allow you to make the puzzle pieces smaller, but it can be difficult to pull the pieces from the narrow window on the screen.
032147404X|5.0|I belong to a Camera Club and I had some questions about digital photography.I was told by my club president to get Scott Kelby`s book Digital Photography.And Amazon had it.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This is a great classic, and I still do not know how to play it well, but I ordered it to keep the little ones busy,
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|love it keeps you on your toes and waiting for whats going to happen next i wish i caught it when it was aired
B00122RFOO|5.0|Very nice I can easly put on cloud for iPhone, computer at work, or sons iPad. Four more words required.
B001QC6QRC|5.0|I love this movie and am glad I can have my kids watch it now. We have watched it a lot now that they have discovered it.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Easy and fun book to read... you'll fine many ways of inspiration and motivation to be creative in here :)
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I've already reviewed this, I thought--but it still stands: good quality audio and video.  I love being able to watch without commercials! And FREE on Amazon Prime membership.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so cool but so easy I love to play every day omg so fun I just wanna kill my self I'm in Miami love itititititit
B000U6BT40|5.0|Really great characters in all the Eureka series.  Super imagination of the story lines, and carried through to the end.  Great!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good app great for price, lol. Only issue I have ever had with it is the way it will pop up when plugged in. Not a real big issue it's just more annoying than anything when your in another app or in the middle of doing something and need to recharge and plug it in and it pops up.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Although the book ends abruptly, it is just as good as the other two Crossfire novels. I can't wait for book #4!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|FIVE STARS for this great free game. Great job at making this game easy and long. I can not wait to see more
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I love this artist.....couldn't find thi in store....came to Amazon....and there she was....Thank you for all the great things that can be found on your site....A SUPER-STORE for sure.......................................:)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is so fun<br />This game is is so fun I love building things and killing ,zombies
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is another page turner. Khaled has this talent of carrying his audience with him right into Afghanstan context. At the end of it all you feel you have lived and experienced the same with his characters.
1452110581|4.0|It's very funny, and reminds me of some of the antics my cat gets in to! I showed my dad this and he laughed and helped me point out which poems best epitomised my cat. The only thing that bugs me is the number of poems there are. When I was in school, I was able to finish it within the hour, along with the work about the lesson (That may be just me, though.). Either way, cute little book!
B005EGXNLS|4.0|Not the best in the Saxon series, but a great book. I can't wait for the next story about Uhtred.
B004SKQAJI|4.0|my wife wanted this so she could drive her roommate crazy because she is in  a rehab center and her roommate is obnoxious
B0089LOKHG|2.0|i have loved every second of reading this triology but The ending was crap!!! im so horribly disappointed with the lack of any closure. i cant believe this author could fail me so badly when everything had been so great.
B007JQLNXG|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Peter and have enjoyed his range much like David Byrne. This is a great variation on his songs and works very well. Highly recommended. The sound is fantastic too. Well recorded and dynamic.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very nice and it covers every detail and piece of information possible.<br /><br />Another important fact is accuracy.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|At 65 I thought I was way past cartoons. However, this was a very cute flick.  I actually stayed awake and enjoyed the whole thing. I may even watch it again.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|This is a well written book. There is enough detail given so that even a novice like me could set up a system once I decided on a design. The book goes into the theory and science of Aquaponics and it delves into several different design options. What I really liked was references to other resources. This allows you to see other design options in detail so you can come up with the best set-up for your particular situation.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie was absorbing and truly amazing.  The HD version was incredible on my TV, it look like it was really coming out of the screen.  Unfortunately there was no CC and that was disappointing.  I was hoping movies all had CC.  Other than that everything was perfect.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I saw this movie in the imax and was very disappointed with it.  I put this movie on par with district 9.  Enough with promoting his boy Will needs to get back making good movies.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Whenever a filmmaker decides to re-invent a previous series or movie, I generally cringe a little (it's rarely as good as the original).  This may be different.  J. J. Abrams brings a freshness and an update to the feeling of what we all know as Star Trek, such that the characters don't need to be compared with the earlier versions because they are different enough that we take them on their own merits.  Great movie!  Can't wait to own the sequel as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Its a fast and enjoyable read for anyone over 10yrs old. If its been a while since ou read the first one (Hunger Games), she'll be sure to remind you of the key information so you don't forget the story. Excellent!
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I have no hidden skills with side scrolling games, but this is so endearingly cute I have no regrets to keeping this app on my (first generation) Kindle Fire. I even have this game set as one of my favorites. I appreciate that I do not require the same degree of speed or skill (at the outset, at least) as Mario games. Cute and fun, it's a no-brainer for me, worth the download.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series. I strongly recommend them. There is a lot of sex but the underlying story is wonderful. Can't wait for more. Get to work E. L. James!!
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|I LOVE the story of Les Miserables, especially the one with Liam Neesom.  I thought I would love this with Anne Hathaway and she does play a good part and actually sang one song that really touched me...BUT the whole thing was singing and singing and singing.  Not that I don't like musicals, I happen to love musicals but maybe I went into it with the wrong thinking.  Didn't even finish watching it.  Opted to watch the version with Liam Neesom and yes... I loved that one MUCH more.  Sorry Ann Hathaway.
