B000FP2Z0S|5.0|To be blunt,  this is not only my favorite Rise Against album, my my favorite album by any band, ever.  I love the high tempo, blistering aggression of tracks like Chamber the Cartridge, Bricks, And Worth Dying for,  The melodic but still heavy ones like Prayer of the Refugee and Ready to Fall, and even the ones that make a departure from Rise Against's usual style,  like The Approaching Curve and Roadside.  If there's any faults in this album, after owning it for several years I am yet to find them.  I'd highly recommend it to any Rise Against fan who is for some reason yet to own it,  or for any Punk fan in general.
B0057GYO9K|1.0|I purchased a remastered version of Nevermind hoping that I would get pristine sound quality that would surpass what I had on a previously purchased version of this CD.  I was wrong.  I remember listening to this CD in a Discman when the original version first came out and thinking how clear and vibrant the sound popped.  I was expecting that this level of quality would reached here with the remaster.  No such luck.  It sounds yucky.  None of the instruments can be distinguished from one another, the volume out is too high, and it sounds like levels of certain instruments arbitrarily jump higher and lower as songs progress.  It sounds like a copy, of a copy, of a copy, that someone made while holding a tape recorder next to a loudspeaker with the treble and bass turned all the way up.  There are no dynamics represented by this remastered recording.  It was very disappointing and I think they should go back to the drawing board, remaster this CD correctly, and then send me another copy for free.  Boo!!!  I love Nirvana and as soon as I find one, I will get a copy of the old original master of this CD.
0385534639|3.0|This book is very imaginative, and the use of language by the author is sumptuous as well as her ability to describe fantastical happenings and sights for the reader to visually 'see' as he/she reads!  I did find the book to drag near the end, and that ending fell flat for me.  That is partly because of an unanswered question which is -- what is the reason the chapters dealing with Bailey (except for the one that discusses his first experience with the circus in 1897) are most all recorded to have occurred in October 1902?  Since those chapters are interspersed with linear time about the circus that begins in 1892 and goes to about 1902, it seemed like an added 'wrinkle in time' that wasn't satisfactorily resolved...unless I missed something.  It just doesn't seem to me that Bailey could have discovered himself and love, and grown up all within a month.  Overall, the hype about the book is more than what it delivered on, in my estimation.
B000IB0ED4|5.0|The CD and DVD are great.  We had this a while back but misplaced it during our recent move.  The DVD has a great selection of the music videos.  My only complaint was that this CD/DVD was formated to the UK... so I can't use it in my DVD player or my husbands computer.  It works on my computer which is good... but it was a present for my husband... so that sucks he can't use it!  I was unable to go back and check the exact listing to see if the region was listed in the description unfortunately.  So my advise is to buy the CD/DVD, it is worth it, but check to make sure it will work on your electronics.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|What a great book!! This book left me feeling so.....HAPPY! I wanted things to work out, but I am glad that it wasn't so easy...becuase sometimes life isn't easy....Stephanie wrote an Amazing story of a super cool girl, living in a strange land, falling in love with someone who she shouldn't bein love with...and he might just be in love with her too.....if not for that pesky Girlfriend he has..(of course). Ellie...just her name pisses me off...hahaha<br /><br />Anna (Banana Elephant) was such a cool girl, I liked her from page one...she was nice, sweet and a good friend...someone I would definately consider a friend. Etienne St. Clair...what can I say about you my love....he was just such a real person, so kind and funny, how could you not see all the wonderful qualities in him that Anna saw.<br /><br />I loved the chemistry between them...all that sexual tension and floating hormones.....and the mistaken words, the accidental touches, the jealous glances and everything else!! I loved it!!<br /><br />The secondary characters were so much fun also. Mer, Rash and Josh made for some entertaining scenes and crazy messes! I just loved it and I am ready for Lola....Stephanie Perkins...you are awesome!!
B004GYY714|5.0|Works better than Aonline radio for me. All the stations I was looking for. Stations load fast and sound quality is good.
0525423281|4.0|If I am being completely honest....I didn't have the same stupid smile pasted across my face after finishing Lola and the Boy Next Door as I did after finishing Anna and the French Kiss, BUT it was two in the morning and I was pretty tired....<br /><br />Another BUT...I did really enjoy the story...the characters, Lola and Cricket, and the realness of the story. I really liked Lola as our heroine. She was cool, creative and someone that I would definitely have been friends with in High School. She dated older bad boys, uh HELLO..we have all made that mistake before and she had fallen for a boy who knew her so well that he was able to break her heart so completely. And Cricket...what a freakn cutie pie.....and when he tells her how he feels about her....I think I swooned right with Ms. Lola.<br /><br />I have to say, I liked Max....but I always fell for the bad boys too....the one's that you don't realize are complete jerks until you finally see that they are COMPLETE JERKS. He wasn't bad for her, but he just wasn't right for her. I loved how Stephanie showed this to us without having to make him into a bad person....sometimes two people just aren't meant to be.<br /><br />I would recommend reading Anna and the French Kiss first, not that you have to, but when Lola and St. Clair have a heart to heart about things...you will understand what he is talking about if you read his book first.<br /><br />Stephanie gives us another YA romance that has real characters, real situations and real emotion. I love her writing style and will continue to pine for her next release over and over. xoxo(less)
B004TL0J5M|5.0|This is the first book that I've read featuring Mickey Haller but absolutely loved it.  The \\"Eureka\\" moment towards the end meritted the 5-star award and all the way through I was compelled to turn the extra page before putting the book down.  The characters are portrayed realistically and the story flows effortlessly.  I would highly recommend this book along with numerous other books by Connelly.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I waited years for this book.  I followed GRRM's personal web site, followed his sporadic updates regarding the delays around this book - and this is the final product ?  I *was* a fan of this series.  I read and enjoyed the previous four books, immensely, but this work was a dog's breakfast.  This book is bloated, it is full of senseless character deaths, not to mention the reams of constant tedium that fill the pages ... my Lord it was a bloody trial to get through it.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I will not read the last two promised books in this series.  Good bye, GRRM.

B002HFJ77S|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read, and my new favorite from Sophie Kinsella (apart from Undomestic Goddess). It is different from Sophie's other books, so I don't know if it will satisfy all of her fans, but it definitely satisfied me! I laughed and cried and couldn't stop reading! I think it would make a really great movie as well. I recommend it, but Sophie fans should keep an open mind.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The 1-star review is not for the movie itself.  The movie is fantastic.  The low rating is for the stupid Ultraviolet digital copy. It makes you sign register a new account with them, but it's not a REAL digital copy.  And you CANNOT upload it to your iTunes.  And for those with iPhones & iPads, forget it.  It's lame.  I wish I had read the other reviews before I went through the Ultraviolet process.  What a rip-off!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I love this game. I love the fact it keeps you thinking ahead! And the sound affects make me laugh everytime!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|There seems to be a trend among people nowadays that states that anything abstract, misunderstood, or strange, must be instantly classified as art. Unfortunately, this trend is the one that accounts for stupidity to be labeled as ''art'' by the ignorant minds, which is how you have 15 year olds with expensive professional cameras taking pictures of whatever they can find and calling them ''artistic''. This is exactly what Lulu is, a 15 year old doing something abstract for the sake of being called ''artistic'', except for the fact that this is much much much worse than that. I seriously can't stress enough how bad this album is and how much you must stay away from it (unless, of course, you're really bored and want to laugh at the ridiculous lyrics spoken by Lou Reed and James Hetfield throughout this nonsense).
0446573019|2.0|As with what seems to be a majority of folks who've read this book, I'm both a Baldacci and a Child fan, having read and enjoyed ALL of both writer's works. The problem here is that for some unknown reason (which I'm sure will be explained some day) this is as pure and explicit a knockoff of a Jack Reacher thriller as it is possible to make.<br /><br />Unfortunately, by deliberately going head to head with another author, Baldacci is begging for a comparison...and what's clear is that there really is none. Simply put, Lee Child is just a better writer than David Baldacci...MUCH better.<br /><br />If you're a Baldacci fan who has not yet discovered Child, then you need to do so immediately. If you're a Child fan who has not discovered Baldacci, then skip this book and start with the author's Camel Club series.  If, like me, you're a fan of both, then I suggest you pass this one up, because I found myself from the first page to the last saying \\"wow, what blatant ripoff...and it's nowhere near as good.\\"  The effect for me was to spoil what would otherwise be a typically decent-but-not-great Baldacci thriller.
0345441184|5.0|Moving. Touching. An Experience. All of this and more can be said about The Mists of Avalon. It is in my opinion the best book ever written. The characters are multidimensional. The story is compelling. You find yourself captivated in the story from the very beginning and simply cannot stop. You find an entirely new depth to all of the characters of the King Arthur legend done from a new and innovative angle. I cannot give this book enough laurels except to say it is the best. Accept no substitutes.

0446547654|2.0|I am a big fan of Nicholas Sparks I have read all of his books and some more than once! I was disappointed in this book and I wish I would not have bought it instead checked it out from the library. I feel like he needs to take a break from writing because his recent books have ended sadly and I really do not care to read a book that will end sadly. So I would suggest to people who read this NOT TO BUY THIS BOOK. Instead check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend.
B005UG53NS|5.0|The photography was incredible.  It stayed true to the book.  Most of the back story was revealed (except for part of Dumbledore's back story, which I think was important).  Maggie Smith and Julie Walters were magnificent.  The movie was as exciting as it needed to be (unlike the Half Blood Prince) and kept you on the edge of your seat all the time, even if you'd read the book.  I love Alexandre Desplat's movie scores and this one suited the movie perfectly.  This really is a must see movie.  Amazon's streaming of it was terrific.  The movie (and it's predecessor) were so good that I'm even contemplating buying the Blu Ray discs!  I was afraid that they were going to leave out the very last part of the story, but they didn't, and the casting for the new Hogwarts 1st year students was perfect.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|First off let me say that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 blu-ray is a beautiful release with top notch picture and sound so my review is not based on the blu-ray, but the horrible digital copy know as Ultraviolet. Once again Warner Brothers screwed up this release with the Ultraviolet Digital Copy crap. When they included ultraviolet on Green Lantern which all ready had bad reviews, any hope of giving that movie a second chance on blu-ray or DVD ended once people saw how bad Ultraviolet was. Just look at the blu-ray reviews half of them are 1 and 2 stars based on the digital copy alone. Im rating this release 1 star to send another clear message to the studio don't fix it if its not broken. Those of us that have iPads and iPhones that have been accustomed to having our digital copies a certain way are getting screwed because of Warner Brothers can't take the fact that Apple and iTunes are the standard for digital copy. Aside from having to set up a flixter and ultraviolet account you have to have some sort of internet access/wifi in order to watch your movie. How is that helpful to the customer? If anything this new ultraviolet is just encouraging people to illegally download their movie to get it to work they way they were accustomed to. HORRIBLE MOVE Warner Brothers, I guarantee in a year if even that this will be gone the way of HD-DVD and betamax.
B004W4N55C|3.0|handy little tab finder. also has a tuner &amp; chord finder... overall pretty nice but don't like all the space it takes. SD support would bump it up to 4.5 maybe solid 5 could also do web video search...
B005LJK3AC|5.0|so funny i laughed so hard i cried alittle definately a movie you can watch over and over again im bummed i could only give it three stars it deserves ten!!!!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I pre-ordered this MONTHS ago. The original description stated \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)\\". It now reads as \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)\\" . This concept is, I think, on the same level as New Coke. Nobody asked for it. Everybody was satisfied with the original. People will take their money elsewhere. I just downloaded the movie from iTunes.
B00466HN86|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to be completed for a long time and I am not disappointed. I saw 'Courageous' on the first screening of the first day it was released in Australia and I was blessed, challenged and entertained. What a timely message for fathers everywhere. With increasing peer pressure on young people, this film has a message, not just for fathers, but for mothers and young people as well.   I love the humour as well as the sincerity of the characters. Their loyalty to each other and their passion to serve God and obey His word. This film will change the direction of relationships between children and their parents, and thank God for the courageous men who dared to hear the message and take a stand to pass it on.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|As Captain America has been my favorite superhero forever, I was really worried about Chris Evans being cast in the role.  Turns out, the guy can flat out act.  He's perfect in this movie.  He has the right levels of apprehension, but the dogged determination to do what is right, not matter what the cost will be to himself.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones is also great, though I do have an issue with his immediate dismissal of Cap after the experiment.  He couldn't think of a use for just one genetically modified ubermensch?<br /><br />Hugo Weaving.  Wow, that guy can play any villain in any movie ever, and I'll be happy.<br /><br />I'm also thrilled that Peggy Carter has skills and can take care of herself.  I was worried about the romance, but it was perfect for Cap.<br /><br />The ending was perfect when Cap says he had a date.  Then he pushes it to the back of his head, and moves on.  Just the way Cap would.<br /><br />Some nice easter eggs with the original Human Torch and Order 13 sure seemed like a reference to Agent 13, Sharon Carter.<br /><br />Very well done.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game very fun.excellent design and levels are challenging.need more varied music though! Give more words needed what gives? Anything else needed?
B004EPZ08E|1.0|This blu-ray combo pack is not like the others; the digital copy cannot be downloaded to iTunes thus you are not able to watch on appleTV.  I, personally will never buy a Warner Bros. Blu-Ray until they return to the digital copy that I know and trust (iTunes compatible).  If people like the UltaViolet copy then they should get the CHOICE to use that service.  I feel ripped off, and WB will not be getting my business (ie. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2)!!!!!

B005M92MJ6|5.0|Man, I really like this album.  LOTS of dark synth work and sequenced drums on some songs.  Chugging bass guitar bottom end and simple, straight-forward rock guitar licks and drums on others.  Hell, sometimes they mix it all.  Haunting acoustic guitar makes its presence heard a few times as well, not to mention the mandolin work on the closing song.  Maynard's voice is more an instrument than narrator.  The female duets are some of the highlights of this CD.  Excellent production.  Solid album.

0446556750|4.0|Book 3, in the Mickey Haller series<br />Book 16, in the Harry Bosch series<br /><br />In The Reversal, Connelly reunites Detective Harry Bosch with his half-brother, defence lawyer Mickey Haller, but this time, Haller plays the part of a prosecutor and together they work as a team with the same goals in mind. The suspense is part legal thriller and part police procedural. We follow Bosch and Haller each an expert in their own field as they process the many ups and downs and twists and turns of a very controversial and demanding case.<br /><br />The author continues to push the boundaries of crime fiction by redefining and joining two exciting protagonists with different backgrounds into a legal quagmire. The story is told with chapters that go back and forth in time and alternate from first to third person, they condense decades of time into a compelling narrative that explores various elements of L.A.'s criminal justice system.<br /><br />The story reopens a twenty four year old case in which little Melissa Landy was abducted from the front yard of her Hancock Park home while playing hide and seek with her sister. At the time, tow truck driver Jason Jessup was convicted of her murder but modern day technology, DNA evidence has led to the reversal of Jessup's conviction. But not everyone is convinced...<br /><br />Haller, a wisecracking cynic and highly competent grizzled veteran of countless courtroom battles switches from defence to prosecution and as readers we shadow him through countless courtroom shenanigans. The author portrays with a passion the grinding process and the emotions of everyone involved. Haller and Bosch share the spotlight with second chair Maggie McPherson and FBI profiler Rachel Walling who makes a cameo appearance. Melissa's sister Sara who witnessed the abduction plays an important part.<br /><br />Both Bosch and Haller are fighting the odds, evidence gathered so far is not in their favour. They must prove without any doubts Jason Jessup is a sadistic killer and must stop him before he can strike again. Bosch is very adept at manipulating emotions and gathering facts, he is the driving force and the one most invested in nailing Jessup.<br /><br />\\"The Reversal\\" is a classic investigative plot with some interesting high points but the pacing bogs down at times with the long tedious court scenes. I enjoyed the teaming of the two protagonists as a change but I prefer seeing them in their own environment.strike again.

0590463799|5.0|This is without a doubt my 3-year-old's favorite bedtime book of all time! He's been having it read to him since he was around 18 months old, and still asks for it regularly.<br /><br />The book is quick - a few words on each page - and maybe a couple dozen pages long. It's set in the room a small bunny is going to sleep in, with a large number of details. The bunny says goodnight to the objects in the room one by one, including pictures and characters in the pictures, \\"and a comb, and a brush, and a bowl full of mush.\\" If you get this to read to your kid, you'll have it memorized in no time! On the bright side, it's pleasant enough that you won't regret that fact :)<br /><br />I've tried to figure out exactly what my son loves about this book, so I can buy other similar books. So far, no luck. Regardless, you can't go wrong with your toddler using 'Goodnight Moon' as bedtime reading!<br /><br />The 'board book' is nice, because it holds up to the grasping hands of toddlers without being destroyed. This is the form factor I'd recommend.<br /><br />I'd buy this again in a heartbeat if I lost it.
0553801473|2.0|At the end of listening to \\"A Feast for Crows\\" one is greeted by the author seemingly responding to the slew of readers that finished the book and were dissapointed.  He acknowledged that he left half of the main characters out in the book and would rectified this in the 5th novel \\"A Dance With Dragons\\".  Although we do get updates on some of our favorites characters (Tyrion and Daenerys) the majority of the novel watches these characters make little to no progress in their story arcs.  Although this tendency for the nobility to sit by and basically do nothing hoping that their problems will go away may be realistic, this is not something that a reader wants to read about for several hundred pages.  He promised to progress the story forward but I feel he is crushed under the weight of the dozens of subplots he has made up.  For the upcoming 6th novel he really needs to concentrate on the main characters (Tyrion and Jaime Lannister, Daenerys Tergaryen, Petyr Baelish, Stannis Baratheon, Bran Stark and John Snow) and move this novel towards some resolution.  After two novels in a row with little progress I hope that he will prove himself worthy of the comparisons to Tolkien and write as strongly as he did in the first novel.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I am so ANGRY at the requirement to use Ultraviolet/Flixster to access my digital copy for this movie!! I love Harry Potter, but I wish I could return this movie due to the Ultraviolet digital copy. I am very upset that I didn't know about this beforehand and opened my movie. Terrible, terrible choice! Will not be redeeming the digital copy. What a waste of money!! NOBODY needs any of my personal information in order for me to view the digital copy I purchased on the device of my choice!! Shame on you Warner Bros. for partnering with this service!! We will not be purchasing any more movies that contain this option!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I enjoyed watching the movie last night (4 star). I bought the 3D version from Best Buy yesterday to complete our Harry Potter collection. As long as WB has this crappy Ultraviolet Digital Copy, I will be thinking twice about purchasing any future titles. I can wait to rent.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|Let me be clear from the beginning. This is a review of the movie itself, not the discs or packaging like other reviews are here. That said, I decided to give this movie 3 stars based on an overall review of the movie. This is coming from someone that is a diehard Harry Potter fan, has the HB & PB of all seven books, all the movies and numerous other HP books. I stand by my overall praising of the whole of the HP world. And this movie is no different, I have seen far worse movies. In my opinion, the only thing that saved this movie from earning a one-star review, were the spectacular special effects and the absolutely amazing acting chops of certain actors. You know those types of actors. The ones who are the only thing saving a movie from being a complete bomb and bloody horror. Those types of actors being: Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis and so on. The special effects were exactly what one would expect in a movie of this magnitude. And taking into account even though the last book WAS split into two seperate movies, massive ammounts of the book could not be included in the movie based on the obvious time issue. But what was included was either done very poorly or was raped and changed so drastically it barely resembled the original. For example: Snape's death and Harry's viewing of Snape's memories in the pensieve in Dumbledore's office. I almost threw up in my mouth it was so disgusting.  Overall, the writing and forming of the movie's contents vs the book = 1.5 stars.  The special effects and acting of most of the cast = 4 stars.  In short, watch or buy the movie, just don't expect it to stand up to the other HP movies.

0380977273|3.0|When a late carnival comes to town on the heels of a storm, two boys find themselves pitted against the ominous Mr. Dark in an ancient battle against the night. Bradbury is one of my favorite authors, but I don't have much fondness for his nostalgia literature--like Something Wicked This Way Comes, or Dandelion Wine. My memories aren't made up of those landscapes or experiences, and so there's no personal fondness. I also begrudge that branch of his work its stylistic redundancy. Bradbury's science fiction has incredible atmosphere, but it's driven by a demanding premise and/or constrained to short form, and so there's less opportunity for the prose to run away with itself--instead, his emotional focus and quietude are atmospheric blessings. Something Wicked has fantastic elements, but they're powered by nostalgia--and so while it offers up some beautiful turns of phrase, those are lost within a mountain road of prose. I've read the book before, some years back, and find I remember some parts well: there's aspects of the book that I love, and Bradbury creates a veritable carnival of horrors which delight me; I see how they could make for a successful book. Bradbury portrays an intensely idealized but vibrant representation of youth and youth's confrontation with age (and with life)--and his themes, despite their lack of personal appeal, are carried through with conviction. But no matter my best intentions and my love of the author, Something Wicked isn't the book for me. I appreciate and can recommend it for what it tries to be, but I don't enjoy it.
0385751060|5.0|In times of our very troubled world,lacking the peace for which we strive,\\"STRIPED PAJAMAS\\" is a reminder of what happened to a society that did nothing wrong,except exist.  An easy read of events that must NEVER be forgotten.
1595828095|5.0|This book collects legendary horror artist's Bernie Wrightson's work featured in Creepy and Eerie in one outstanding, very reasonably-priced volume.  Stories often regarded as classics, including The Black Cat, Jenifer, Clarice, The Pepper Lake Monster, and Cool Air are reproduced here, as is what is arguably one of the finest examples of comic art, the Frankenstein-ish The Muck Monster - a wonderful foreshadowing of Bernie's magnum opus.  There are also 30 or so of Bernie's frontispieces and illustrations of Uncle Creepy and Cousin Eerie.  And to top it off there are other beautifully-illustrated stories (A Martian Saga, The Laughing Man, Nightfall), as well as some lesser-known collaborations with other artists.  I own almost all of the Creepy and Eerie Archives volumes and I still find this book to be essential.  I love having all his Warren horror art in one place - in fact I think this collection was long overdue. For under 20 bucks ($14 or so in my case) you get a collection of stories by Poe, Bruce Jones, HP Lovecraft, and Wrightson himself, all gorgeously illustrated by Wrightson, and you get a gallery of his Warren frontispieces!  If you like horror comics, or love great comic art, you just can't lose.  Dare I say - buy it now, you won't regret it!!!!!!
0062020897|4.0|I am frequently amazed at how many thriller writers, such as Follett and, say, Forsyth, can take a historical incident with a known outcome (the D-Day location was not revealed to the Germans; De Gaulle was not assassinated) and still make a story gripping. I saw \\"The Eye of the Needle\\" as a movie before I read the book. In fact, I decided to read the book with reluctance, because I much prefer reading a book first, then seeing the movie. But in this case, even knowing how everything comes out in the book, I wasn't disappointed. The plot is gripping, the characters are interesting, and the tension doesn't let up. Recommended.
B00338QENI|2.0|The book was informative, but it was more of a book you would read if you had to do research. The Author jumped around too much, it was hard to follow. Several of my co workers read the book too and it was hard for them to keep interested.

B000FC1336|4.0|Just finished this book after reading Kilo Class and enjoying it. Story is a little far-fetched but I enjoyed it. Characters were interesting and I found the story fast moving. Technical details were mostly beyond me and to be honest rushed through text when I got to some of it. I am retired and have a lot of time to read but I am mostly up to latest books by Lee Child, WEB Griffin, Daniel Silva, Tom Clancy, Alex Berenson and Vince Flynn. I am anxious for other authors who write similar fiction.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Works great exactly as advertised with lots of options. The widgets are small and clean. Much better then the stock note app.
B0050KTR36|5.0|good for reviewing and speed. use with a book though for origin and insertion and bigger pictures. this is so far the only app i have ever paid for, and am happy i did.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I bought it for my grandson's second birthday.  He at first didn't care for it because he liked another movie that he had been watching.  Now he is enjoying it.
B004LROUW2|5.0|This is the first book by Haruki Murikami that I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is mysterious, unusual and suspenseful. The intriguing characters drew me in.  Strange things happened. At the same time the story was convincing.  I found it to be difficult to put down from beginning to end.
B005QI4TP8|2.0|This is not singing. This is chronic wailing. Unlike her contemporary Adele, Florence does not know when to slow it down and when to accelerate. To listen to this entire CD in one sitting left me irritated, cranky and wanting to smash the CD on the coffee table after it was finished. I'm sure her music has its audience and I realize I am in the minority here, but I can't stand this kind of alleged \\"singing.\\" Sorry. I call her Adele on Crack.
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|The movie is awesome. I bought it at midnight today. Unfortnatly the ultraviolet digital copy is horrible. Buy it on iTunes. And get the regular blu ray or normal dvd.
B0054N73EY|5.0|This album reminds me of BSSM...okay, maybe it's a lesser version but a very listenable album with a lot of good tracks.  I'm a big fan of Frusciante's but the sound here still feels authentic.  As with most RHCP, don't analyze the lyrics.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|I was very happy with this film. I didn't see it in the theater so having it on DVD has been great. I'm not much into the special features for movies but this movie has some decent special features.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is a bold, meritorious and even epic effort to bring the big screen the genius of Shakespeare for great audiences. And Brannagh managed to capture, express and transmit the tragedy behind the throne without being gimmicky or overloaded of overwhelming technology. He usas it in the accurate proportions.<br /><br />For instance, the sequence in which we watch Ofelia's madness front of the mirror (to my mind, Kate Winslet's major artistic achievement in her lifetime until this date), the impressive dialogue with the skull, the cynical stage of his father's death, the formidable locations within the palace, the irresisitible Julie Christie as her mother, as well as Jack Lemmon or Charlton Heston performances, was an honorable materialization to gather as much garnet of  accomplished actors around this classic tragedy.<br /><br />In despite of its duration (more than four hours), Brannagh built the most dramatic and compelling version that still remains (behind of Kozinstev and Olivier versions) as the greatest adaptations of Hamlet.<br /><br />Don't miss it.
B004EPYZQC|1.0|I was very disappointed with this DVD. I was very excited to watch the Fast Five but when I opened it nothing was on the disc it was blank. So very disappointed!
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Totally AWESOME cd!  I'll admit I wasn't a Kelly Clarkson fan at first...actually I adamantly disliked her, but the last couple releases have been amazing.  The older she gets, the more her voice matures.  I listen to her latest 'Stronger' over and over.  Her voice is so powerful, it's infectious.  I definitely recommend this album to all the Kelly fans.  If you are not, you will be after listening to her latest music.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was using Docs To Go until I had the good fortune to catch OfficeSuite Pro 5 as the FAOTD; it is by far the better app of the two.  Better editing features and multiple Google Doc account support are really what make this app great.
0061906220|5.0|I am a speech therapist and I borrowed this book from one of my co-workers to use during my therapy sessions and I instantly fell in LOVE!!!!  Not only is this great to use at work but it is just a wonderful book with a beautiful ending that both children and adults can learn from.....\\"because it's all good!\\".
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|1.  The movie is a great culmination to a wonderful series.<br />2.  The blu ray disc was produced so it faithfully reproduces the movie.<br />3.  The 3D version is currently available in the US, only from Best Buy.  How Amazon, with its tremendous buying power, couldn't prevent that from happening, is beyond me. Apparently they didn't feel the need to go to bat for their customers.  I am only sorry I didn't learn of this before I opened the package, when I could have returned it and gone and gotten the 3D version which I really wanted.
1600247229|5.0|Well, \\"read\\" is the wrong word since I actually heard this novel superlatively read by Peter Giles (the man's ability to subtly differentiate voices is uncanny). The novel itslef is a true courtroom novel, by which I mean Connelly does not slow down the novel with endless scenes involving the lawyer's personal life.  There are a few such scenes involving Mickey's ex-wife and daughter, but they are quite interesting and relatively short.  Everything else is devoted to a complex and satisfying legal mystery.  I very much enjoyed \\"The LIncoln Lawyer\\" (the novel, not the awful movie), but this one is even better.  If you enjoy a great legal thriller, this one's for you.
B003XQG0JI|5.0|Being a Corr's fan for many years I was excited when Sharon's album appeared on my Amazon recommendations recently. I promptly ordered it and am very pleased that I did. I won't elaborate on a critique as previous reviewers have aptly accomplished this. Suffice it to say that if you are a Corr's fan I'm certain that Sharon's album will appeal to you; it's the next best thing to a brand new Corr's album. As one might expect the mix of tracks blend traditional Celtic charm and flavor with contemporary soft rock nuances that the Corr's are known for. Sharon wrote many of the compositions and her lovely vocals and violin are accompanied by a fine group of musicians and guest artists.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A quick little mind teaser that you can either pick up and put down or immerse yourself in. No stress,very Zen.
1451648537|5.0|An amazing biography that leaves all of us with great hopes for the future of Apple and all it can/will be.  Jony Ives and Tim Cook will help carry on Steve's vision...they lived it and share it.  We're going to see many more great visionary products from this awesome company.  Jobs surrounded himself with people who he believed in.  We can/should too.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady Antebellum have quickly become one of my top favorite country artists,. I love the very first line of \\"We Own the Night\\" and \\"Just A Kiss \\"I want to give to the man I love.There is a song for every mood and \\"Heart of the World\\" is perfect for my best friend and her wonderful guy. This is another great Album thanks Lady Antebellum U rock! I hope I get to see you in concert!
B004YXE438|4.0|I love this game. But one of the updates put a timer and counter on the side of my puzzle that I can't hide or disable. I find this really distracting and I don't enjoy playing it as much now.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|What can I say? It's an XD Memory Card. It was shipped promptly and has worked perfectly for the past several weeks I've used it.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|You should be very careful to put your iPhone in. The part on back  was bent when i put my iPhone 4S without bumper. I think it breaks easily. They shouldn't say it is for iPhone.
B001RCD2DW|2.0|I bought the AKG K702 \\"professional\\" Headphones and then quickly returned them. My reasons are they lack both the intensity and clarify I need when listening and editing classical music. Furthermore, up against the Sennheiser 650 and especially the new Sony MDR 7520 that I have, they pale in comparison.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The DVD cover advertises a digital copy- not a streaming service that will let you \\"own\\" a digital copy on their servers.  When I buy a digital copy, it'd better be on my computer's hard drive and accessible in your iTunes.  Warner Brothers, after releasing the last 2 Harry Potter movies that were actual digital copies, why did you have to change something that would make your customers mad?  Didn't you use a consumer focus group as a part of your marketing strategy?  Didn't think that consumers might view this DVD cover as a bait and switch tactic?    That said, this movie was a good end to the Harry Potter series, although I wished that the movie had followed the book on a couple of points like having Harry using the elder wand to repair his old wand and then saying that the elder wand would return to Dumbledore's grave.
B004PR71JC|4.0|We like the upbeat cheerful music. I would have given in 5 stars but my son's favorite son, \\"Drop It Drop It Low!\\" by Wil I Am is strangely not on this CD although it is in the movie. I wonder why they left it out?
B005SYLKT8|5.0|took me a while to get into this but after a while I really started to enjoy it........if you get a chance to see the band she has now, do it
B0055SWM08|5.0|good puzzles that make you think a bit but not too hard (though I am still in lower levels), nice graphics and relaxing music, runs well.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The digital copy is simply not that. you never download it you get it streamed to your device via the internet. So if you wanted to watch it on your laptop while on a long flight you are out of luck. I though the point of a digital copy was to make viewing it easier to watch. Want to go on a drive and let your wife or whoever watch it off the laptop? Well you cant with out a connection to the internet I am planning a trip to Denver over Thanksgiving, I was hoping to let my wife watch it during the drive. If we want to pack along the DVD that is fine. However I like to pack light and this is just one more thing to pack up. I was hoping for a digital copy that I could put on my iTunes list and well you can't so The movie is great. The \\"Digital copy\\" (yes I just put it in quotes) is a sham.
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|The author did a really good job of introducing the ideas behind HTML5 and why in his opinion you should consider using the technology. This is an easy read and done in under an hour.  It may provide you with enough evidence as to if you should learn HTML5 now or wait until it is fully hatched.
B002N57W9M|5.0|I loved this album in high school and I still love it today!  I've got \\"Joyride\\" singing in my head right now!
B0055SWM08|4.0|simple and elegant, as a puzzler should be.  polished user interface and game interactions are a joy in play.    comments on the music seem exaggerated; it is simple like the game concept, thankfully not annoying.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|One of the rare times where the film is better than the stage play, though Sandy Dennis, and Charles Grodin originated the roles on Broadway, Burstyn and Alda, give poigniant and very natural perfomances in a film that by all rights could be become stale and dull, these are top actors giving A+ performances, nominated for Best Actress, Burstyn, Slade, Screenplay from another medium, and Cinematogrophy, this is truly a flim that has withstood the test of time, a film of love, devotion, and friendship. \\"Same Time Next Year\\", is truly a classic.
B0052ZQMLO|1.0|Sorry, but I have to be counted among those that can not get this dictionary to work. I have a kindle DX. I can select the dictionary as my primary dictionary, but it does not react when I am reading a German book. Reading the other similar negative reviews I tend to think this must be due to a bug in this product.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I could not download my digital copy onto itunes, which prompted me to read the reviews here. I was so frustrated to learn it was not user error, and would not be able to download onto my chiilds itouch. This purchase was made for that specific reason. We immediately contacted Ultraviolet support. At first it did not look good as we were given a \\"ticket #\\" and told we would be contacted via email. Well, much to our surprise we received a response within the hour. They understood the issue and want to rectify the problem and make sure the customer is satisfied. They offered to send us an itunes code to download a digital copy immediately. We did have to first reply with our original redemption code found in the dvd insert. Upon doing so, we received a response back from them within 5 minutes, giving us our itunes code. I am not sure if this will solve everyines issues, but hopefully it will please a majority of those upset by this issue.
1609611543|5.0|I have  been \\"pre-diabetic\\" for the last 25 years, and this is genetic as high blood sugar and diabetes runs rampant in my family. I have deliberately avoided sugar for 25 years, but must admit that I love rice and potatoes, which unfortunately convert to sugar in your body. My last blood test showed a high spike upwards, and the doctor warned me that I needed to lose the good starchy foods and lose 5-10% weight immediately, or face serious complications. So, what should I do?    I am very skeptical about anything having to do with weight loss, especially from someone trying to sell you products or pills or gadgets. However, Dr.Davis in this book says \\"just cut out the wheat\\".....who knows how accurate his data and theories really are, but they \\"sounded reasonable\\". I decided it was easy enough to try it for a while, and it has had an amazing transformation in a short period of time. It has improved my health and dropped my belly-fat rather quickly. I have lost 4.5% in the last 5 weeks (a little less than 1% per week), have more energy during the early afternoon (even without the double espresso), and am sleeping sounder and longer than I have in a long time.    Don't know if it will work for anyone else.....but it does make for an interesting read, is easy enough to try, and best of all it is free!    Many of my friends and family are going to or have already started this experiment for themselves.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|This is a beautiful CD.  The music is moving and their voices are incredible!!  I love it so much that I just purchased one for my parents.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|The AMI MDI MMI/USB Audio MP3 Music Interface Adapter Audi Q5 is an excellent pruchase.  I have USB stick in my glove compartment which I listen to all my recodrded music and audio podcasts. I recommend this item to other Audi owners.

B005JU5JTI|4.0|Luckily I did not read the reviews before renting this. I watched this and actually enjoyed it. Do not expect a deep plot, or Oscar winning acting. Just unplug your mind and laugh at this dirty comedy.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Deathly Hallows pt 2 picks up right where pt 1 left off, and finishes beautifully. We all know the story by now, but this movie is wonderful! As a self-proclaimed Harry Potter nerd, I loved it. No, it's not exactly like the books, but none of them have been, because they have to appeal to a wider audience and also, they have to fit within the time constraints of an average movie! At the film's conclusion, I felt satisfied and like I had gotten the full end of the story. I got the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack, and the Blu-Ray is like watching it in theaters all over again! I'd recommend this, and all, Harry Potter films to anyone!
0525423656|3.0|**Spoilers**  After reading Matched, I expected that Crossed would have a lot of intrigue in it. I guess I must have thought that the word crossed was meant as in double crossed, or crossed swords, or even criss crossed, but it turns out it really means that they crossed the land in a long journey. I've heard more about mountains, & canyons, & dirt, & rivers, & streams than I ever could have imagined. The entire book is basically alternating chapters of Cassia & Ky traveling to find the Outer Provinces & each other. They meet people, people die, & people leave, but it doesn't really mean anything to the story. It's just a travel book.  Crossed has 54 chapters. They finally meet up with the Rising in chapter 50, but there's no interaction with them until chapter 52. That leaves only 2 chapters to tell us what happens to all the characters. We find out that Ky has been assigned to be an air ship pilot, & Cassia, well it's decided she's more useful in Society so after 2 books & all this traveling, she's back to where she was at the beginning of Matched. We don't even find out about how she returned home, or what her parents did, just that she's in Central & now Cassia & Ky are separated again. The ending was way too rushed, after all the detail of what kind of rocks they were hiking on & what the canyons looked like, there was barely any detail about what happens to the people.  There are still a lot of mysteries, more were added in this book, & we didn't get any answers from the last book. The Rising seems a lot like the Society to me, & I'm wondering if it's something that was actually created by the Society for some reason, maybe because they need an enemy? The mysterious enemy that nobody has an information on doesn't seem real, & setting up the aberrations to be killed makes no sense. I'm hoping we'll get a complete explanation of this in the final book. It also seems obvious that the whole Ky/Cassia/Xander thing was set in motion a long time ago. I suspect that there was no Matthew Markham that was killed, & that either it was a story that was planted in everyone so that Ky could be brought in, or possibly Ky really is Matthew & they gave him a made up life. Something else I also hope gets fully explained.   I will read the final book just because I want answers (we seriously have to wait a year?) but I hope we really do get answers & that they make sense. It seems to me that Aly Condie has wasted an entire book in Crossed & now she's going to really have to pack the final book with everything just to catch up.
B005LAIGFA|2.0|There is both good news and bad news in this movie. First the good news: Leonardo diCaprio is a certified master craftsman. If he had not already proven so in \\"Aviator,\\" (which I think he did), now there is simply no remaining doubt that he is the brightest star in our contemporary Hollywood firmament. Whenever an actor can take a crappy script, such as this one was, and turn it into a mini-master piece, that actor has arrived at the gates of superstardom. That is exactly what Mr. diCaprio has done in this movie.<br /><br />He has also done one additional thing, and this is the beginning of the bad news. He has served, wittingly or not, as a slave to the ugly sadistic intents of a director whose goal was always to minimize and to whitewash Hoover's sordid past; and thereby diCaprio is also complicit in trying to humanize America's only certifiable homegrown monster.  I do not believe that they succeeded at this goal. And as a result, in that failed attempt, both diCaprio and the director, Clint Eastwood, have a lot to answer for.<br /><br />Although we have seen this trope before -- of pawning off cheap faux patriotic heroism on an unsuspecting public -- this director knows all too well that when the historical facts of Hoover's past are lined up and are coupled with even a smidgen of Freudian analysis, our nation's ugly past suddenly becomes an open book. It becomes all but transparent that America's closet (occupied by J. Edgar) is opened for inspection. And at center stage of the darkest chapters in our nation's criminal history, sits none other than the prickly, little evil, mean-spirited, cross-dressing, closeted mommie's boy, J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />The fact that we allowed him to remain in the closet so long and to bully us all the while he was there, is itself profound testament to our collective national cowardice. That a movie director would hedge in the direction of making this monster a respectable condensation symbol and a backhanded national hero,is just short of unconscionable. Even Communist Russian came clean about Stalin's crimes, and summarily executed Hoover's equivalent, Laventia Beria.  Eastwood has made Hoover into a wimpy mother's boy G-Man hero, but a hero nonetheless. And he is not even deserving of that. Portraying Hoover as a national hero - even as a limp-wristed whiney one -- is like turning our pedophile uncle into a family hero? It is no longer possible for us as a nation to maintain our collective virginity in the face of 40 years of allowing J. Edgar Hoover to intimidate us and allowing him to trample on our democratic freedoms in the false name of crime-fighting. Because we lacked the courage to challenge his tyranny, we simply wittingly became part of Mr. Hoover's closet.<br /><br />Here in a contorted \\"half outing\\" of Hoover, a minimally honest and confusing script is presented for our evaluation. It is everywhere self-evident that the director of this movie obviously lacked the courage to take the only stand that could be taken with respect to J. Edgar Hoover: Eastwood had to take a full step forward and tell the whole, the complete, unalloyed truth about the embarrassing deeds of the monster, Mr. Hoover evolved into. Allowing it to seep out along the pathway that led only to the sewer did not exactly do the job. That only betrayed the fact that even in death we still fear him. This man had 40 plus years to hold our nation in utter terror.  He is no hero; he is a bona fide villain.<br /><br />This was Eastwood's grand opportunity to finally help us purge the nation of Hoover's ghost. But Eastwood did not do this. Instead, he tried in vain to cover all of Hoover's many failings as FBI Director -- as well as his many personal indiscretions. Mr. Eastwood's rendition of him in this film is little more than an exercise in \\"soft-pedaling\\" around all the landmines left by Hoover's mean-spirited and embarrassing indiscretions. For Eastwood, the only one worthy of display was his obsessive hounding of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- that is, until Dr. King was eventually assassinated -- many believe at the hands of Hoover's own FBI and under Hoover's direction. But sadly, even with DiCaprio's great acting, this did not make the movie add up to anything but a very forgettable squander of a grand opportunity to get our national history correct.<br /><br />Here are some of the other disturbing facts that did not (but should have) come out in the movie about Mr. Hoover:<br /><br />Because the mob had clandestinely photographed him in full flagrante fellatio delecto mode at a party where he was also on display as a female in a \\"Little Bo Pete\\" outfit, this in itself is strong evidence that as a \\"cross-dressing\\" closeted homosexual, Mr. Hoover was probably under the control of the mob during most of his career?  The only hint of this in the movie was the single instance in which RFK, Hoover's boss, called him in to ask why he was not investigating the mob instead of racking up statistics on auto thefts? That, plus a single conversation between Hoover and his live-in boyfriend, Clyde Tolson, about his annual trip to the Del Mar racetrack, near San Diego, Cal.<br /><br />Why make this a muted, nuanced secret reserved only for us insiders? Is it so well known that Hoover vacationed annually, free of charge (and was even staked in the races) with mob money that it could be subtly insinuated instead of having been spelled out in bold letters?  It seemed to me that the truth demanded that the public at large know that our nation's chief law enforcement officer was vacationing at the behest of the very mob that he was supposed to be investigating? How could the casual viewer not be told that Hoover was doing this at the same time that he was claiming that the mob did not exist?<br /><br />Of course no mention was made in the movie of the fact that Hoover was one of the attendees at the pre-JFK assassination party/planning session on 11/21/63 at Clint Murchison's Dallashome. The FBI director was there along with a whole host of others high-level movers and shakers, including Nixon, LBJ, the CIA and other governmental and mob officials -- all eventually implicated in various JFK's assassination plots.<br /><br />Nor was there any mention made in the movie of how much Hoover (like the mob) hated his boss RFK. Of all his many slimy and underhanded Machiavellian capers, the only one that got any attention, in addition to his relentless hounding of MLK, was his subtle blackmailing of Presidents Roosevelt, Kennedy and Nixon in a successful effort to get his tenure extended. In the JFK and LBJ case, it was to get it extended beyond the automatic retirement age of 70.<br /><br />Also, how could the movie not mention that for twenty-five years Hoover and LBJ were virtually next door neighbors, and partners in crime; or that, at the very least, they were both implicated in the cover-up (if not the murder of JFK)?<br /><br />But even more important is that during the Cold War, at the height of the spy wars, Hoover and the FBI as our chief counter espionage agency, caught no spies: that's right zero, nil, zilch, as in none. Even the Nazi spies shown in the movie as being captured during WW-II had actually turned themselves in. Hoover's FBI also caught no Mafioso either, that is, until RFK turned up the heat on him.<br /><br />The upshot of this movie is that by failing to purge the Hoover monster from our collective consciousness, he remains a part of us; a metaphor about the collective monster within. Not having purged Hoover's ghost of course leaves open the possibility that another Hoover could arise from his ashes.<br /><br />This was a disturbing movie, but for all the wrong reasons. I no longer trust Eastwood's courage as a director. Ten stars for DiCaprio's acting, and two stars for Eastwood's directing.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|Do something, anything, else. It was really, really boring. Hats off to you if you can find anything worthwhile in this sucky movie.
B005UT29Z0|2.0|I truly feel the actors did a great job within the limitations given them in this movie.  There IS a real life plot in this movie, but either the writer/director has no idea how to convey a complicated transaction, or they simply don't know the subject matter at all.  I have watched documentaries on Enron more thrilling than this movie.  Again, I feel Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, and Zachary Quinto did a fabulous job with their roles.  Unfortunately, it has the depth of about an inch, so not much more they could do. I like Kevin Spacey period, but given the option again I would have skipped this one.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|this app is a good time waster. not as fun as angry birds but definitely a decent puzzle game. I wouldn't pay for it tho
0811879631|5.0|must have for any pixar fan, animator or film concept artist. This book contains all the colour scripts, all those precious gems from pixar's 25 years of animation. Movies from toy story all the way to the latest cars2. The paper is glossy and nice, the drawings are in large clear print and the book is so THICK.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As a young teen, this book might be the best I've ever read - maybe finishing second behind The Da Vinci Code - and I can't wait for the movie! It's a great ending to the trilogy (although I was sort of upset at parts of the conclusion), and like every book in the Hunger games, will leave your eyes glued to the book! Suspense, thrill, action, sudden turns, cheers and tears (okay, maybe the latter was a bit dramatic, but you get the point!) is all included! And the best part? It's FREE for prime members!!!   As an inspiring author myself ([[ASIN:B004RZJ6DQ The War Donkey]] is a recent title of mine); I truly admire the unique style of Suzanne Collins (actually reminds me a bit of James Patterson's Maximum Ride, but better)!    Still in awe of this book (read it in 5 hours straight, was so exciting); however, I'm sad that now whenever I read a book - I compare it to Mockingjay, and the rest of the Hunger game series - and they never come close to the thrilling ride I experienced =( !!!   Buy this book NOW, if you want an gargantuan thrill for the next couple hours!  Happy reading folks!   - Ryan S
B0038Z5SEW|4.0|I don't really like outdoor adventure movies very much but have to say that The Edge is quite powerful.  A more of a good guy role for Anthony Hopkins to play since he usually plays just the opposite, at least from the movies I have seen him in.  It should keep your attention well from the beginning to the end and maybe even touch you personally or make your emotions run some.  I am not a big Hopkins fan but thought his role here was pretty good.  A must see for anyone who enjoys adventure or survival movies.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The dentist - it's the most petrifying experience a soul can experience, yet while sitting in the waiting room - you would expect one to be anxious/terrified, right? Well, with Angry Birds I actually have FUN in such gloomy of a room! Yup, that's how good this game is! Simple, but addicting - you can't go wrong with getting Angry Birds for your Android device!    BTW - I recommend getting this game from the Market as Amazon is really slow with updates etc!    Xoom User,    Ryan S.
0553801473|1.0|This book series began strongly, and I was definitely hooked. I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks. I love the genre, and the characters really grew on me. I wanted to know where they (and the realm) would end up.<br /><br />What I began noticing, however, was that George Martin's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing. No furtherance of major plot points. No grand character arcs, as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing. It gets to a point where you don't care about any of them anymore, because who knows a)what the overall PLOT of the book is, and b)who will even be around 5 chapters later.<br /><br />Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions. I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff. What else made my eyes roll? All the \\"turning his head and spat\\"s and \\"bit his/her tongue so hard he/she tasted blood\\"s. Talk about repetitive literary tricks. It's the complete opposite of the word 'creative'. Martin's writing is cliche and tired.<br /><br />I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons. Absolutely nothing gets resolved; as it was in A Feast for Crows, only more questions are raised. I was a fan, but now I'm definitely a hater. Heed my review and save your money. That day/week/whatever of your life you spend reading this garbage, you will never be able to get back.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|My god! I loved this book so much that I wanted to marry it or something! I loved how, when I thought it was over, it kept going and surprising me! It was the best books Ive ever read. I mean it was like total heaven!!!! I just don't have words as to how much I loved this book. One of thee greatest! It was interesting and fun and it had you just slamming your head, just to find out what would happen next! You could call it suspenseful, but it was also very sweet! Sometimes you don't know if its real life or just the book! Anyways, I loved it so much! Worth every penny!
B00004SC3M|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Entrapment is a great title. The ending was definitely a major surprise. It is a multiple watch movie.
0312383347|3.0|Not bad, but a little disappointing. Everything was weird in this book, even for the wacky Stephanie Plum. Of course, if you're a fan like me, you have to read them all. But if your on the fence... I'd skip it.
B002WJI63A|5.0|I own her and love her. She's simply adorable. She's very well detailed, right down to her metallic gold crown and blue eyes. And she is made out of a very nice material that is very soft. This is without a doubt the cutest/nicest Peach plushie I've seen. Most of the others make her look... 'overweight'. I'm 19, so I don't 'play' with her, but she looks very cute on my bed. Perfect for Peach fans like me. <3
076115678X|5.0|I have been pleasantly surprised by this book. I thought about buying it last year, but decided to put it off. Lucky for me, they came out with the updated version during that time and I bought, for about $8, the book and a DVD that came with it! I find it wonderful, that for such a small investment you receive so many great recipes (I've already tried 4 of them and have loved them all) and incomparable advice.   I was born with straight hair, but when I hit adolescence, it turned wavy/curly. My hair type is some kind of mixture of both wavy (to about my ears) and botticelli curls according to the book, with a few other curl types thrown in, which is not at all uncommon (made me feel less weird to learn this).  The book encourages you to embrace your natural hair type and shows you how to identify what types of curls you have and how to care for them in a way that won't drive you nuts. I don't feel like I've had a bad hair day since I first followed the advice for my closest hair type (wavy). I make my own flax seed hair gel for dirt cheap and use an inexpensive, cone-free conditioner for my routine.  Ever since adolescence hit I've hated my hair, and on very few days have I actually felt happy with how it looked when I didn't do anything to it (and I like my hair low-maintenance, which meant I was unhappy with it but stuck most of the time). Since I have waist-length hair I gave up straightening a long time ago because the results never lasted long and took me 45 minutes or longer to do it.   Only because of this book have I really started enjoying my hair. I have to admit - the scariest thing for me was \\"getting rid of\\" (I gave them to my husband to use!) my natural bristle hair brushes and combs and just using my fingers and oil to moisturize the length of my hair. But the improvements have been amazing and it is so nice not to need brushes anymore, believe it or not! My husband loves my newly more-pronounced, healthy-looking curls!  My advice: buy the book! I'dbe really surprised if you regretted it. The recipes are inexpensive and easy to try (my favorites are the exfoliating cleanser, lavender spray, and lemon aid) and the method only takes a couple of days to get the hang of (especially if you watch the DVD method a couple of times and then compare it with your hair type in the book)! For the first time my hair is so easy to do and I don't have to worry about it! This is a truly empowering book.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|stuff downloads but wont install til days later... the last update did this.  Droid x.  writing more so I can submit, also stupid.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I enjoyed the litigators, in the same way I might enjoy a good magazine, but it was shallow and like an under-developed photograph.  The concept was ok, but the potential was wasted.  Sad to see after all the great books Grisham wrote in his early days.  This story was the best opportunity to show a retun to form, but, if you are a Grisham fan, then it will leave you disappointed.  It's probably worth the price, but I would have enjoyed reading a few hundred more pages if they added more colour to the characters and plot.  I guess I will have to re-read &#34;The Firm&#34; if I want &#34;great&#34;, maybe I will try thatÂ¿

0553381695|5.0|Great story. Way better than the lord of the rings (although the hbo series is not as good as the movie).
1416972250|4.0|Better than the second book though of course not as good with the witty banter as the first (when it's all drama and action it's hard to fit it in there). Clare toned down her Jace-worship in this one so that was definitely better than the previous. The lead up and execution of the finale was satisfying. I'm curious to see how she continues this since this was the end of the trilogy but she has just come out with a fourth (and I think has two more in the works). I don't think I'll be buying any more of them but I'll keep an eye out on the library.
1423140591|5.0|This is book 2 of the Heroes of Olympus series by Rick Riordan.  If you have read any of this other books and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this.  I read it fairly quickly and have already recommended it, and all of the other books by RR to the lady who cut and permed my hair yesterday!  I will say that once again he leaves you waiting for the next book, but that is to be expected.  The only problem is that we will have to wait until Fall 2012 to get our hands on it...darn it!<br /><br />To get the most out of this book, you should read the whole Percy Jackson series in order first, then book one The Lost Hero before reading this one.  They do happen sequentially.  Keeping track of the gods and goddesses from Greek and Roman mythology might be difficult, but there is a glossary at the end of this book (and I think the others, too) to help you remember.  I think that is part of what I enjoyed the most, learning more Greek and Roman mythology and then seeing how Rick Riordan brings them into the modern world.<br /><br />If you like action and adventure with some magical-type powers thrown in, you will enjoy this book and all the others in these two series, so will many boys and girls.  This is considered a kids book, but many adults will love this, too.  These books are especially nice, as they can draw boys into them with all the action.  As a librarian, I like having books that I can recommend to my boys or girls after they have read Harry Potter.  Even reluctant readers who may have seen the movie would love these books.  Have them try it for the first few chapters, and I bet they will be hooked.  I know I was.  Thanks to Rick Riordan for giving us some great books to recommend to our kids.
1416955070|4.0|Overall I really enjoyed this book. There were parts here and there that didn't feel right, that didn't feel maybe as polished, and the Star Wars-like reveal toward the end (no spoilers but other people who have read this will know what I'm talking about) made me roll my eyes just a little, but for a debut book it was very good and also I just love the characters. What really won me over was how funny and smart and sharp the dialogue was. I found myself laughing out loud at many points.
B005PW3OS8|3.0|its way too long at some scenes.  a comic should be a bit more agile and I almost fall asleep watching this.  overall for $4 bucks its a decent entertainment, but boy i'm happy that I did not pay a movie theater ticket for this...
0446569909|5.0|This book is not for the faint-hearted or anyone offended by profanity and vulgarity, but for even a casual fan of Black Sabbath and Ozzy it's a good read. This is one of those autobiographies written \\"with\\" a writer, but it's written in Ozzy's voice, which is very fun, funny, and engaging. There are some great stories in this, and I found myself laughing aloud the whole way through, even though it gets pretty heavy (especially when talking about his substance abuse). It's made me want to take a look at some other rock n' roller biographies. Definitely an entertaining read.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My four year old daughter loves cats (and that's an understatement), so I thought I'd give this app a try. Was a little skeptical considering the negative reviews but thought with it being free \\"what's the harm?\\". I've had this app for a little over a day and I can barely pry my phone from her. She takes \\"Tom\\" with her everywhere in our house, I've never heard her giggle so much and so loudly.
B005XI91FY|5.0|Some people think that this is not as funny as the first.  Hard to say. Once you've had your mind blown by a band you get a bit desensitized to their style and, in this case, humor. Nonetheless, this album is still laugh out loud for me. The dirty jokes are all there and there are some new themes, like That's What Girls Are For, which has a satirical take on chauvanism.  If you are a \\"politically correct\\" person looking for something serious in the lyrics, this is NOT for you.  Some people have given this album crappy reviews complaining about the lyrical content and that the music is not original.  This is like buying an adult film and complaining that the plot stinks and there is too much sex.  Hello? It is all a parody!  The dirty joke is the whole point! And these guys blow Tenacious D out of the water.  Musically, you can't get much better than these guys.  The guitar solos are amazing and the song composition is better than what you hear on Feel the Steel.  Sure they rip off a lot of 80s metal, but it is on purpose.  However, most of the riffs are original, though they are in the hair metal genre.  If you like 80s metal, but lack a sense of humor you can still dig the music and ignore the jokes, but like I said you would be missing the point. There is one cheesy ballad, but it is call Weenie Ride so...you get the idea.   All in all, this album totally rocks and it is as good (if not better than) the first album. It will make your friends laugh and annoy your significant other (unless she is really cool).
B005VC4FLW|5.0|I love the movie, I saw it when it came out on the theater, and I just bought it. I want to comment on the Amazon instant video. It sucks. The move is great, the streaming of the movie is good, but the quality of the downloaded is not as good as I hoped it would be.
1455510319|5.0|Michael Connelly is, first and foremost, an experienced crime journalist and an expert on police and courtroom procedure. \\"The Fifth Witness\\" focuses on Micky Haller, Connelly's hard-bitten defense attorney, and how his business has evolved in the economic downturn since 2008. With less money around, Haller has shifted to handling foreclosure cases - helping home-owners to delay or frustrate attempts to evict them for failure to pay what they owe. It's akin to a shark feeding on small fry: each case brings in only a small fee, and Haller's small team has to do a Red Queen act - running as fast as they can just to stay in business. So, naturally, it's like a gift from the gods when one of Haller's foreclosure clients is accused of murdering a VP at the bank that owns her mortgage and is seeking to take her house. The publicity alone is manna from heaven, and Haller hopes to arrange some kind of media deal - maybe even a Hollywood contract. Then things start to turn sour, as his neurotic client starts making her own moves and queering his pitch. Add to that the brilliant, ruthless DA who is leading the prosecution (and has already beaten Haller in a number of cases), and his always-fraught private life, and Haller is soon up against it. But things rapidly get worse - much, much worse - in more ways than one.<br /><br />Like all Connelly's novels (and particularly those starring Haller) \\"The Fifth Witness\\" is more gripping than exciting. It gradually shapes up as an intense personal duel between Haller and Andrea Freeman, the prosecuting attorney, in which they both use every possible trick and technique, whether fair and ethical or not. It is here that it seems to me Connelly's fundamental bias shows just a little. Having worked with the police in his career as a journalist, and written so much about them as a novelist, he is inclined to take their side; and that makes Haller a fundamentally less self-assured, confident person than Connelly's detective hero Harry Bosch. Whenever a prosecutor or a cop makes a crack about how Haller defends criminals and scumbags, it sinks right home and he worries about the ethics of his business. When talking to his new associate Jennifer Aronson, he stresses that a defense attorney should never ask whether the client is guilty or innocent: it's better not to know. And that, of course, means that when he wins a case he cannot take satisfaction in having saved an innocent person from prison, because he does not know whether the client really was innocent. The prosecutors, for their part, take exactly the opposite attitude: if the police hand them a suspect, they assume that person's guilt right from the outset. So it becomes clear that the courtroom battle is not really about guilt or innocence, or even about justice as most of us would understand it. Rather, it is a battle or a game played within certain rules, where winning is all that matters. These dark reflections on the state of criminal justice (in California and, no doubt, elsewhere) permeate \\"The Fifth Witness\\" and give it a thought-provoking ethical dimension that most legal thrillers lack. (John Grisham's books, especially \\"The Runaway Jury\\", are obvious exceptions).r a prosecutor or a cop makes a crack about how Haller defends criminals and scumbags, it sinks right home and he worries about the ethics of his business.

B0034G4OUO|4.0|I was getting ready to go to bed last night as I flipped through the channels on my TV.  I happened to get Showtime as Faster, starring Dwayne Johnson, was beginning.  Now, Dwayne Johnson is generally known to most people as The Rock.  That's certainly how I know him from his long years in wrestling to his first acting role in The Mummy Returns.  Anyway, I decided to watch the first few minutes of the movie and then hit the sack.  Instead, I ended up watching the entire film and enjoying it, too.<br /><br />Dwayne plays a character known as the Driver.  He was the driver for his brother during a bank robbery.  Later, the entire crew was killed by others who'd been hired to steal the money from them.  The Driver was shot in the head, but he managed to live.  He then spent ten years in jail for the bank robbery.  When he finally gets out, he goes after the guys who murdered his brother, killing each of them with no emotion and in front of others.  He only cares about revenge and not the final outcome of his bloody mission.<br /><br />The unknown man who originally sent in the killers to wipe out the crew hires a professional assassin to go after Dwayne Johnson, and this guy is damn good.  The thing is the Rock is better and he knows it.  Because of that and his past history, you begin to see the assassin as a human being and to understand where he's coming from.  For some strange reason you don't want to see either him or the Rock die at the end.<br /><br />As the Driver tracks each killer down and administers justice for what they did, he gets more intuned with the hatred that has fueled his life for so long and realizes it's destroying him.  Can he change his need for vengeance before he completes his mission?  You have to see the movie to find out.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton plays the cop who's after the Driver.  This a great performance by Billy Bob, especially when he's dealing with his son and the wife he's separated from.<br /><br />Tom Berringer even has a small role as the warden of the prison.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I really liked the movie.  The stunt driving was excellent, the cold-blooded killing was in your face and totally realistic, the lead character was someone you eventually learned to care about and wanted to see still alive by the end of the film, and the supporting actors were all excellent in their own particular roles.  There were even a few twists I didn't see coming and caught me completely off guard.  I did guess who the head killer was, only because that's how I would have done the script myself.<br /><br />This a nice little gem of a movie that isn't pretentious and caught me by surprise.  I suspect I'll purchase it for my movie collection before Christmas.  Highly recommended!urprisingly, I really liked the movie.

B00015YVD6|5.0|I watched this film in early 1992 in 1st grade and 10 years later in 2002 in 11th grade. Both times, i had a startlingly strong response to the way the government scientists treated Madison--tears, anger, even weeks worth of nightmares. I had a similar response late last month when i watched it with my fiance'.   I love this film, very much so. That being said, I would not recommend it for very young children (under 8), and i would play it with caution for older viewers who are sensitive to issues such as animal cruelty or human rights abuses, as it touches on some things pretty strongly in a similar way to E.T. and Avatar, only with Mermaids instead of aliens--the question of \\"do we treat non-human sentient beings that are incredibly different from humans with the same respect and dignity, or with less, or with more?\\" I find the sexual/nudity themes to be almost non-existent; a few vague mentions of \\"in the elevator and on top of the refrigerator\\", a bathing scene that shows nothing but an enormous fishtail, a naked woman (really Darryl Hannah's gorgeous Mermaid) walking through New York Harbour, but not even enough to merit PG13.

0393064476|4.0|Plot summary: Epicurius was an interesting Greek. Lucretius was a Roman fan of Epicurius and an entertaining poet. Using Epicurian ideas, Lucretius wrote a fine poem about many profoundly important components of modern civilization (atomic theory, scientific method, pointlessness of superstition, humanism, etc.). This was eventually lost to the Dark Ages as the Christian religion repressed such thinking. However in 1380 the hero of this book, Poggio Bracciolini, was born and through an amazing sequence of fortunate coincidences he became exactly the kind of person capable of finding one of the only remaining copies of this poem and reintroduce it to western culture. With that cat out of the bag influencing imporant thinkers, things quickly progressed into full bloom Renaissance.<br /><br />That's about what I knew about the book before I read it. Reading the book is basically getting a couple of orders of magnitude more detail on that story. If you like trivia and details of life in 14th century Europe, then this book is quite interesting. If you're a fan of classical art work or philosophy of the ancients or Italian history, etc, this is definitely worth a read. However, if you're not, then I could see how this book could seem slow and indirect. The book is well-written however sometimes I got the feeling that the author was telling us results of painfully hard research which he couldn't bear to omit even though its contribution to me, the reader, was minimal. On the other hand, sometimes that sort of minutia was actually interesting to me for my own personal reasons.<br /><br />Overall, interesting and worth reading for me but I could see how others might feel differently.

1451648537|1.0|I suppose it's healthy to learn that one's all-time favorite hero has warts and I expected a fair and complete portrayal of Steve Jobs--the good, the bad and the ugly.  But as \\"the only authorized biography\\" of Steve Jobs wore on, it became clear that the author was intent on skipping over the good in favor of focusing almost exclusively on the bad and the ugly. I don't deny that I am among Jobs' biggest fans, and assume that most of us who admired him from afar have long been well aware of his idiosyncrasies. But I believe it was unnecessary to have his failings repeated and reinforced, page after page, ad nauseam. At the beginning of the book, I actually thought Isaacson both liked and respected Jobs. By the end, I became convinced that Isaacson disliked Jobs personally and actually harbored contempt for him as a husband, father, brother, son, entrepreneur, manager and human being in general. Why else would he have included so little insight from those who knew him the longest and loved him the most?  If Jobs was such a monster, why did at least 3 people say he was their very best friend (Jony Ive, Larry Ellison & Mona Simpson)? John Lasseter says Steve was like a brother to him. And countless others, including Al Gore, Bob Iger, Art Levinson and Tim Cook, remained close friends with Steve for decades. Either they are all wrong about Jobs, or Isaacson simply failed to include their unique perspectives in favor of all the old, worn-out stories about what a meanie Steve could be.  I haven't read his biographies of Ben Franklin or Albert Einstein, but unlike these previous subjects, Isaacson was given the exclusive opportunity to interview a live subject and tell us what it actually felt like to be Steve Jobs. Apparently this was not Isaacson's goal. Rather, I believe he fancies himself as a historian who was merely charged with the telling of history. And the result would be no different had Jobs already been gone for 100 years or more--just like Isaacson's previousworks. I don't dispute anything that's contained in this book, but I do question why so many positive personal insights were completely left out in favor of the slow and steady drumbeat that Steve was a jerk--first, last and always. I believe Isaacson's main goal in writing this dry, incomplete, one-sided monstrosity was to persuade readers to dislike Jobs as much as he did. It is biased beyond belief, and therefore, cannot be considered a serious historical accounting.  The book felt disjointed in the way it was broken into chapters according to the development and launch of Jobs' companies and products, such as iMac, Pixar, iPhone, etc., rather than in true chronological order. This caused a great deal of going back and forward in time to the point where I had to stop reading and actually Google certain events, just to keep the timeline straight in my mind. The actual date of one key event in Jobs' life, the acquisition of Pixar by Disney, was missing altogether. Telling the story of Steve Jobs' life according to his creations (which often overlapped), rather than by a more cohesive chronology, is reminiscent of the way mercenary hackers dissect each new iThing the moment it goes on sale, so they can disseminate which supplier's components are inside. Such data may be valuable to Apple's competitors and Wall Street, but says nothing of the essence of the product--or in the case of this biography, the essence of Steve Jobs.  In addition to the lack of a cohesive timeline, there were instances of a lack of context. For example, on one occasion, Steve Jobs gets a call from then-President Bill Clinton, asking Jobs what he should do about the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Jobs tells him that if it's true, he needs to tell the truth to America. No doubt, this is an interesting tidbit, but there was no reference in the book that the two men had ever met one another, let alone built a close relationship that one would expect from this type of interaction. Without any type ofcontext provided for their relationship, either before or after this phone call, its inclusion in the book seems more like name-dropping than anything else. And if Steve Jobs and Bill Clinton were such good friends and confidantes, then wouldn't the next obvious question be to ask Jobs how he balanced his friendships with Clinton and Ross Perot (Jobs' backer in NeXT), when they were running against one another for POTUS--the highest office in the land? Sorry, folks. No mention of any such thing. Just the phone call that seemed to come from out of nowhere. Another question left unanswered is how Al Gore came to serve on Apple's board of directors. There is no mention whatsoever of the two men having any kind of relationship at all.   Of all his amazing accomplishments, Jobs believed his greatest legacy was his family and the company he built. But you'd never know it by reading this biography. The love of his life, Laurene, barely got more mention than his old flames, Chrisann Brennan and Tina Redse. And both of these old flames received far more attention than any of his three children with Laurene. Jobs' entire relationship with Patty, the sister he was raised with and who was also adopted by Clara & Paul Jobs, was relegated to one sentence saying the two had never been close. But if this is an accurate representation of their relationship, why did Patty hold vigil at Steve's bedside in the final days and hours of his passing? Likewise, there was no mention whatsoever of the passing of Steve's beloved dad, Paul.  Jobs told Isaacson that he wanted to live to see his son Reed graduate, and the book briefly mentions that after Reed's graduation, the family had a graduation party at which everyone took turns dancing with Reed. Yet, a neighbor mentioned briefly in a blog post the night Jobs retired from Apple that he was so proud of Reed, he had tears streaming down his face during the graduation ceremony. Mona Simpson said in her brother's eulogy, \\"None of us who attended Reed's graduation party will ever forget the scene of Reed and Steve slow dancing.\\" The distinction to me is that Isaacson's description was almost a non-event. But two other people--in just a single sentence from each--provided enormous insights into the same event and how much Reed meant to Steve. This simple distinction best exemplifies Isaacson's historical textbook style of writing, in which he seems incapable or unwilling to include many of the warm fuzzies that were also true of Steve Jobs.  The final 20 pages of the book appeared to be thrown together in Simon & Schuster's rush to capitalize on Steve Jobs' death after witnessing the worldwide outpouring of love and grief. Originally scheduled for March 2012, the publishers moved up the publication date to October 24--just 19 days after Steve's passing. And it shows.  Almost anyone could have written an historical account of Steve Jobs' amazing achievements. But Jobs gave Isaacson the rare opportunity to share much more than this. Just as Steve Jobs designed the iPad 30 years before it was launched, and always knew what the world would want well before it did, Steve also knew that the world didn't need another book about him that merely dwelt on his creations and character deficiencies. He gave Isaacson two precious gifts that he had never given to any other human being: 1) authorization for the biography and unprecedented access with over 40 interviews and countless emails and phone conversations; and 2) complete trust in the telling of his life's story--a supremely difficult and courageous thing to do for someone who guarded his privacy and knew no other way than to micromanage everything with which he was associated. Wouldn't his life's story be much more precious to him than anything he'd ever accomplished? With these facts in mind, Isaacson clearly whiffed on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in favor of being petty, biased and small.  There's no question in my mind what Steve would have thought ofthis book. While it may be true that the key to Steve's genius was all about \\"what he left out,\\" sadly, the same cannot be said of Walter Isaacson, because the precious pieces he left out of Steve's life's story say more about the author than the subject. In the end, it may well be that Walter Isaacson is just the latest on the long list of people who betrayed Steve Jobs. However, it is worth the read for its interesting tidbits, but only if you put the book down occasionally to bring it to life by watching online videos of Steve's iconic product launches, TV commercials and other interviews in which Steve quite clearly spoke for himself. At least for now, if you want to know Steve Jobs, watch his Stanford commencement speech and read Mona Simpson's eulogy for her brother.
B004SIP7US|4.0|I'm still not quite sure why, but this has been my favorite movie for years now. My 10th grade teacher, Mr. Reyes, once suggested I watch it and when I did. I loved it. There's not much I can say expect, see for yourself the magic of history. But you must buy it in Blu-Ray. The quality and definition is magnificent! It's a wonderful movie, as well. Some great acting. Awesome for history buffs like myself.

It will be on my youtube channel GFWScarface.<br /><br />Table of contents is 4 pages long, the index is something like 20pgs long.<br /><br />If David Hodgson reads this, I am stupified at how much time and effort you took into putting this Tome together.<br /><br />I read that it took you and a team of appx. a dozen+ people OVER 2,000+ hours to make the collector's guide.<br /><br />Assuming you worked 8hrs a day, thats roughly 250 DAYS, give or take how many hours you worked on it per day.<br /><br />Did I mention the Holy Bible style Foot Long Ribbon page makers? And that there's two of them?

B005OK721G|2.0|\\"I used to want to be Xena Warrior Princess, now I want to be a killer. Can you help?\\" After watching her parents get killed in front of her, 9 year old Cataleya makes her way to Chicago to see her uncle. After being trained by him to be an assassin she soon goes off on her own for revenge. This is a difficult movie to review. The first 20 minutes is very exciting, but when Cataleya grows up it slows way way down. The rest of the movie drags a lot and while there is quite a bit of action it does not really hold your attention. Saldana does a good job in this, but the movie did not do a good job of showcasing her style of action. I would compare this to \\"Hanna\\" which was about a young girl looking for revenge on the murderer of her father. These movies had very similar plots but \\"Hanna\\" was a much more fast paced and exciting movie. This movie is also like \\"Salt\\" but a much slower version. This is very OK, nothing exciting. Overall, if given the choice between this one or \\"Hanna\\", I would choose \\"Hanna\\". I give it a C.
B004LWZW88|1.0|This movie was such a great disappointment. Boring and pointless. Stupid story line with lots of double crosses. Save your money.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|\\"I don't know what it is about this city.\\" Gil (Wilson) is a struggling writer who is visiting Paris with his fianc&eacute; Inez (McAdams). After meeting Inez's new friends who he doesn't like he decides to take a walk. When the bell strikes midnight his life is changed. I need to begin by saying that I am not a Woody Allen fan. I have like \\"Match Point\\" and \\"Whatever Works\\" but that's about it. This is, in my opinion his best movie. While not as funny as \\"Whatever Works\\" this one is very enjoyable and is not a typical Woody Allen movie. The time travel aspect in this is very interesting and is used very well and not in a cheesy fashion at all. If I was more into literature I think parts would have been more interesting, but I really enjoyed this movie. Overall, a very light-hearted and enjoyable comedy that is one of, if not the best Woody Allen movie I have ever seen. I give it a A-.<br /><br />*Also try - Somewhere In Time & You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger

B005LZW8FO|3.0|\\"Can I meet me, is that me better then this me?\\" After a car accident changes two lives, Rhoda (Marling) falls into a deep depression. When a chance to win a trip to Earth 2 comes up she finds her chance to start over. Based off the previews I was expecting this to be a sci-fi along the lines of \\"Moon\\". What I found was that this was more of a character study on how a young girl with everything going for her loses it all. The movie's main plot is how Rhoda can tell the man that she killed his wife and daughter. The aspect of finding Another Earth (which is what I was interested in) is glossed over. If you are looking for a different type of sci-fi movie this is not it at all. The movie is not that bad overall, little slow, but the title is deceiving. Overall, little slow and depressing, should have been called and marketed as something else. This is not what I expected at all. I give it a C.<br /><br />*Also try - Moon & Tree Of Life
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I love Tina Fey. My mom gave me Bossypants as a gift and I read it in one afternoon. As always, after exposure to Tina's take on everything from how Pennsylvanians react to Greek yogurt to cheap Manhattan manicures, I can't go anywhere without thinking of a snippet from this book. Also, the section on photoshoots really is \\"the funnnest.\\"
0446547654|5.0|This was an outstanding book.  It came quickly and was in perfect condition.  I would recommend this book to anyone whether or not you like Nicholas Sparks.  The story is wonderful.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I love the way the writers (Director Matthew Vaughn included) boldly adressed a form of discrimination that was not outright touched on in earlier films : Sexism. Having Moira Mctaggert be the main represention of what women experienced in that time period fit very well into the themes of the film. I also loved Mystique's journey into self acceptance and how realistically Charles Xavier was portrayed, as good of a person he naturally is he too is flawed and doesn't always have the answers or say all the rights things, that even he can slip up. Wonderful movie!!.

0385343175|3.0|I was disappointed in the story because of constant repetition. Besides the character weren't very likeable.  Daddy was a whimp, the daughter was self-centered and spoiled. As a second wife I think I would have ran, not walked, away from the relationship. Loving your child is one thing, asking a grown daughter for permission to marry or date is beyond the range of healthy and normal. Normally, I like Danielle Steels books, and have purchased every one she has ever written.  I'm hoping this one was just an \\"ooppps.\\"
B005MP28B2|1.0|I am stunned at the 67 people who gave this five stars!!  I gave it one (which it didn't deserve) so I could make a comment.  That was the stupidest movie I have ever seen.  For it to knock the rest of my worst movies off the list...that's how bad it was.  If you gave it more than one star...you were tripping on acid, smoking crack, went to sleep before it was over.
0030839939|5.0|There is the Landau series, the Cohen QM book, Feynman, Sakurai, and then there's the Mermin classic.  People will tell you they like Kittel, but really they should read, use, and refer to Mermin.  By far an amazing book.  This is like the Oxford Classic, Dynamic Theory of Crystal Lattices by Born, likewise essential to anyone studying solid state.  The exercise problems are so much fun too!

0060723513|1.0|The concept of undertaking a journey in order to learn and listen and immerse yourself in another culture or tradition  is not new. The book is a fictitious account of such a journey, set against a backdrop of Indigenous Australia (an effective marketing concept because many people are interested in old and mysterious cultures).   She has gathered a range of hybrid traditional practices, certainly not from Indigenous Australian peoples and packaged them into her story. The Indigenous people here (Australia) are still experiencing the effects of colonisation, and with so much of the language and traditional practices forbidden by colonisers and missionaries, it is understandable we are curious about what remains, what is lost and what has had to go underground. BUT the right to know is earned, not given. If Ms Morgan really was in the culture the first thing she would have been taught was how to be respectful and ask permissions. There is another woman, Vesna Tenodi, living in Australia who has similar entitlement ideas about what she can appropriate from other cultures. She has also written a book, buyers beware.   If you want suggestions for reading, check out the reconciliation websites for Australia.
1451648537|5.0|Perhaps one of the best things to say about this biography is that my immediate inclination is to write about Jobs rather than about the book about Jobs.  Isaacson's lens in recording Jobs' life is unobtrusive; the focus remains on the story rather than the telling.  This skilled technique also wins the readers' trust: because the reader feels that she is seeing Steve Jobs directly, she trusts the impression that she is getting.  Thus, if Isaacson has presented a slanted or misleading picture in some way. . . well it would be very effectively done.   If Isaacson has misled us (which I doubt) though, it is not by making Steve Jobs likeable.  To the contrary he comes off as a jerk and less of genius than he seemed like going in.  The book places Jobs in the pantheon of Edison and Ford rather than Franklin and Einstein.  No mean company to be sure, but down here with the mortals.   More than anything else, this is a book about leadership. Jobs' leadership turned around a failing company and led it to the status of most valuable company in the world.  The up-close view of his techniques in doing so--his absolute insistence on excellence (\\"A players\\" to work with; great products as the goal), his insistence on endless editing (refining products again and again and again until he could not see any way that they could be better), his insistence that not only every detail but every aspect (e.g., the details of the box the product comes in; the color of the machines in the factory) of the product from end to end is critical, his insistence that the world was as he would have it be rather than as it is (his so-called \\"reality distortion field\\"), and his secure insistence that great products are things people did not yet know that they wanted--is fascinating and highly instructive.  It does leave you with an understanding about what was so extraordinary about this guy.   I found the personal side of the book less interesting.  We learn a great deal about Jobs' life, and for atrained psychologist, perhaps enough to figure out what made him tick.  Not enough for me to do so though.  The picture here is of a guy deeply lacking in empathy and with a bizarre set of compulsions, but, notwithstanding the well-filled out personal story, I finished uncertain where they came from.  Not that I cared terribly much.  Jobs' life was a mildly interesting identity story and personal journey-adopted child, college dropout, life in India etc.-but cast next to his professional life, it necessarily pales into ordinariness.   I should add that the book was an easy, fun and accessible read.  Actually hard to put down, which is pretty good for biography.  I come away from it looking differently at both my Apple products and the world around me (that pizza box is crap!).  No need to be a technology person to enjoy this book.
0786838655|5.0|In a sentence or so: Percy Jackson suspects he might be different from most kids his age. These suspicions are confirmed when he's attacked by a Fury (yeah, from Hades) and whisked away to a camp for half-mortal/half-immortal kids. Is he the hero they've all been waiting for? Or is he just an awkwardly lanky kid with bad luck?<br /><br />Percy has a most amazing mother, and a particularly awful stepfather. His only memory of his true father is a warm smile and pure happiness. Now, Percy's life is bumping from school to school and trying not to get into fights. Which isn't as easy as it sounds when your horrible sub tries to murder you during a school field trip to the history museum. What's worse is that no one seemed to notice! Either Percy is certifiably insane, or there is something very suspicious going down. Possibly both.<br /><br />Soon, Percy discovers that these attempted homicides are due to his being a half-blood. You know, half mortal and half immortal Greek god. Yeah, he is skeptical too. Until he meets a centaur, a dryad or two, and the slew of other half-bloods at a camp for people just like him. Well, not just like him. Percy continues to be set apart, for better or worse, and must complete a hero's quest in order to be part of the community. Pending he doesn't die in his efforts, of course.<br /><br />A confession: you all were right. ALL of you. I have heard so many people rave about the glories of Percy Jackson. I was thrilled to discover that it was totally worth the hype. Thank you, internet, for telling me true!<br /><br />Percy is a bit rough around the edges, which I loved. He has obvious daddy issues which were explored just enough to give you substance without weighing it down. We meet SO MANY creatures and gods and demi-gods from greek mythology that I thought my heart was going to beat right out of my chest. Thankfully, it all makes sense to the flow of the story, not just to show off Riordan's research for the book. He has two faithful friends on his hero's quest who provide balance and depth to this read.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fantasy middle-grade read soaked in Greek mythology with solid characters and fantastic writing, give this a shot. I'm SO glad I did.<br /><br />Fave quote: \\"Just your typical summer-camp send-off by your typical centaur.\\" (156)<br /><br />Fix er up: As this is the first in the series, I'm not sure how he's going to follow up with additional elements of Greek myth.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I heard Rush of Blood to the Head, X&Y, and Viva La Vida in the order they came out.  I like Rush of Blood, but find it a little uneven and lower energy than X&Y.  Viva La Vida I find of lower quality than either of the others.  I think it is too pop-y and less inspired.  I love X&Y and with the exception of Fix You, (which I can take or leave-the lyrics are a little hard to take) I love all of the songs.  Standouts include: Square One, White Shadows, Talk, Speed of Sound, Low, and The Hardest Part.  They maintain a hard driving sound on many of the songs, even if some start out soft and mellow.  The sound is full, but not over-produced, a refined rock sound with a melodic, sometimes melancholic, lyric.  I really like Chris's voice.  It reminds me (for some reason) of a higher version of Jim Morrison on the early Door's albums. This album held up well to multiple listens over many months. If you like up-tempo soft rock, check it out.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The last thing we need is another digital format and specialized application to watch it. Why on earth would anyone want to start using another movie service? Completely misleading as previous versions came with the expected iTunes downloadable digital copy. Booooooooo!
B0036WHM1E|4.0|I really like this album by a duo from Australia.  It held up to multiple listens well. I like Angus's songs and voice better, but I like the way Angus and Julia trade off songs and complement each other, backing each other up as a brother and sister team, which is an unusual duo. It is mood music reminiscent of a simpler time and the innocence of youth.  Angus gives a tip of the hat to Neil Young and Heart of Gold.  I believe he took some inspiration from Young's early work, both the lyrical side and the guitar jams.  Julia's voice reminds me of Anais Mitchell.  It takes a little getting used to, but it's good.  I like all of the songs.  Standouts for me are Yellow Brick Road, Draw Your Swords, the Devil's Tears, Hold On, and I'm Not Yours.  Jet Plane was the one that caught my attention initially on a youtube video, but that one did wear out due to its minimalist structure and theme.  I classify this as folk rock. You don't hear much of that coming out these days.  I hear the sixties influence and it works in the current day context. It sounds new and fresh.
B005O30Y5Y|1.0|This is NOT a review on the movie, rather a review of the actual packaged product you are about to buy!   I love this movie and was very excited to get a copy with the blu-ray/dvd/digital copy combo. However, what is not disclosed until you open the package are the requirements to claim your digital copy. You need to open a flixster and ultraviolet account to redeem the movie. Once you enter your redemption code, it opens up options that include downloads to your computer, android device (phone or tablet), iphone, and ipad. But in order to download to your computer, you need to install Adobe AIR. Yes, it's a free download but I seriously I don't need another program on my computer. There is a maximum of five downloads per movie.   I tried to load the movie into my ipad but you need the flixster app installed onto your ipad in order to view the movie. Needless to say, a majority of the reviews regarding the flixster app were all negative. This would mean that I need to always be around wifi connection to view the movie! The point of loading a movie onto an ipad is to get around needing wifi to view it! I decided I was better off buying the movie from itunes.   Needless to say I am returning the product I bought and purchsing the stand-alone blu-ray and buying the movie from itunes for my ipad.

B005I3PAUO|2.0|I am a fan of Baldacci, but this must rate as his worst book ever . I got the feeling he is running out of ideas. You could skip several chapters and read as if the story continued.

0446585025|3.0|I'm a fan of Ellen Degeneres, I enjoy her show and her sense of humor.  Looking for a light book after reading a rather dark one I felt this would fit the bill.  While it was a good antidote it wasn't as entertaining as I had hoped.<br /><br />A mix of stand up bits and random musings it was often silly rather than funny. The structure of the book was nonexistent. I laughed out loud a few times but I think I was expecting more depth since, as she mentions in her intro to the book, a lot has happened in her life over the past few years; yet much of that is barely touched on.  The chapters I enjoyed the most were those that did have more substance to them. I liked her discussion of why she did American Idol and why she left.  I liked the chapter about why she and Portia are not going to have children.  These chapters were funny but also really interesting.  The chapter about sounds - not funny at all.<br /><br />I listened to this book, read by Ellen and I'm glad I did listen to the audio because I don't think I would have liked this book if I'd read it.  Having Ellen read her own words gave it a little more pizzazz, but overall it was a disappointment.
B0053VKP8S|1.0|At first use, it was working like a 5 star products with my Apple TV (small puck size). But when I had to use it again. The lid that covers the optical connection on this device broke off. Not only does this cover protect the optical link from dust and dirt. It holds the optical cable and locks it in place. Once its broken off, there is no connection or hold what so ever. It was possible for me to put the grey cover back in place, but once you remove the optical cable. That grey cover will fly off with it. Permanently gluing this to the open position won't work since the cover works in a lever action that when you pull the optical cable out, the cover is also pulled to close the connection. I will have to return this item.   As for functionality: works 100% with my Apple TV  Quality and build: meh...30%    If by chance I was just unlucky to get a defective product, I won't mind buying this again from the same seller.
B000002O1P|3.0|Legend has it that Tom like the sound of Don't Come 'Round Here so much that he had to smack the wall. Breaking his hand. The whole album is like that. The songs are great songs but the mix seems thin and over produced. I got this so I could learn Rebels and I have to say I like DBT's version better. All and all anything Tom Petty does is good and well worth a listen. I was a little disappointed with this one.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|After two years using a pair of quality Sony MDR-XB500's I decided it was time to do some research into a new pair of high quality headphones.  After testing out many products I decided on these 7506's. They have significantly better and purer sound than any of the higher priced alternatives. They may not have the flash of a pair of beats by dre or the prestige of a pair of bose but for half the price you get much better sound, a much more comfortable fit and feel on your ear and you don't have to use batteries.
1594744769|2.0|I love the way that photographs were used to illistrate ideas and that was really the main reason I wanted to read the book. It was very interesting up until about mid-ways through. Then it just started getting silly. The book was just too out there even for me. . . and I like a good stephen king as much as the next person! The last several chapters of this book were nothing but a total flop and I really wouldn't reccomend that anyone waste their money on this book. If you want to read it, I suggest getting it from the library. The way the book left you hanging, I'm sure there will be a 'part 2' to the story, but I won't be reading it.
B005974CNA|5.0|This is the first and only  album of Dreamtheater that I have bought and I am very satisfied with it. Mike Mangini is the new drummer for the group and his style is passionate as well as technically correct for this progressive rock genre. I can only compare notes with an online radio that I listen to (which is where I discovered Dreamtheater). Frankly, I like this new album. It rocks and weaves musically from hard to harder then mild, etc. The lyrics at first look dismal but as you read the liner notes you see eventual sunshine. It is hope in spite of the loss. I was delighted to hear this album.

B005KDJCE2|4.0|All Rights Removed finds Airbag standing proud as a successor to the prog rock sound first played by the mighty Floyd oh so many years ago! This album is more diverse and creative than Airbags last outing-Identity. I felt the last album to be beautiful in sound, with lots of Gilmour-esque guitar-scapes, but overall was a bit boring and monotonous to me. This one is not at all! I love it and as soon as it finishes, I am ready to take the trip again. What more can you say in praise than that? So, if you like Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, or Frost, I think you will find lots to love here.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|I really thought this was going to be dumb. I'm starting to feel like Steve carrell plays the same part in every film he is in, except for 40 year old virgin.<br /><br />This was a pretty good movie, nice twist for a romantic comedy, some more updated dialog than many of the films in this genre. It may also be comfortable watching as a couple or a first date, as there is a sub-plot that seems tailor made for guys. It had its issues with the script after the surprise toward the late middle. But it gets back on its feet and gives us a pretty good ending. It's also a bit cross-generational. I'm turning 40 soon and I'd be comfortable watching this with my younger cousins in their 20s.

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Erik Brynjolfsson & Andrew McAfee's new book, Race Against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy is a macro focus on the changing nature of work. Both Brynjolfsson and McAfee have highly acclaimed prior books (with MIT Press and Harvard Business School Press respectively), yet they self-published Race Against the Machine as an ebook so they could get it to as many people as soon after writing it as possible. This is a shift in the organizational design and team process around writing a book. Their publication decision is part of the dynamic that is the focus of their book:<br /><br />\\"The root of our problems is not that we're in a Great Recession, or a Great<br />Stagnation, rather that we are in the early throes of a Great Restructuring. Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind. So it's urgent that we understand these phenomena, discuss their implications, and come up with strategies that allow human workers to race ahead with machines instead of racing against them. (Kindle Locations 170-173).\\"<br /><br />They understand and are active participants in this process.

1439192812|5.0|I've been a fan of Richard Dawkins ever since a co-worker handed me a copy of Climbing Mount Improbable 10 years ago.  Not only does he appeal to one's sense of logic and reason, but he has a unique writing style that combines humor and sustains reader interest.  Dawkins does a brilliant job of carrying the torch of reason and skepticism carried by other great writers like Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Michael Shermer and James Randi.  The following distinguishes this book from the other Dawkins books:<br /><br />1. It is written in a style that would appeal to both adults and teens.<br />2. The color illustrations by Dave McKean are superb!  This is one gorgeous book.<br />3. Summarizing the ideas presented in various other Dawkins books, this book would serve as a great \\"Intro to Dawkins\\".<br /><br />I feel that the following paragraph from The Magic of Reality summarizes the spirit of the book:<br /><br />\\"... I want to show you that the real world, as understood scientifically, has magic of its own- the kind I call poetic magic: an inspiring beauty which is all the more magical because it is real and because we can understand how it works.  Next to the true beauty and magic of the real world, supernatural spells and stage tricks seem cheap and tawdry by comparison.  The magic of reality is neither supernatural nor a trick, but- quite simply - wonderful.  Wonderful, and real.  Wonderful because real.\\"

B004LROUNG|5.0|I've read most of his books, and until now, his first two remained my favorites. This one reminded me of them because it goes deeper into the characters than some of his more recent ones. This was a page-turner for sure, with a very likeable hero, interesting and quite flawed supporting characters and a fascinating peek into the legal world....plus, a good amount of humor. It felt like he had a little fun writing this one, and that feeling came through. Great ending, highly recommended!

1400052181|4.0|When I first read the back of the book, I thought the topic was very interesting, but I worried that an entire book might be a little too much.  BUT, I was pleasantly surprised. The book focuses more on the human story of HeLa, than the scientific importance.  The science is definitely there, but it is explained in a way everyone can understand and relate too.<br /><br />Henrietta was a poor black woman who grew up working on a tobacco farm with her extended family.  Shortly after the birth of her fifth child, she found out she had cervical cancer.  This was in 1951, she was treated, but the cancer spread and she died.  Samples of both her healthy cells and cancer cells were taken by scientists at John Hopkins when she was treated, and the cancer cells were the first human cells to survive and keep reproducing outside the body.  This was revolutionary, and the cell line called HeLa changed the world in many different ways.  Everytime Rebecca Skloot lists off scientific advances that have used HeLa, it is impressive.<br /><br />Even though they were responsible for taking the cells without asking or informing Henrietta and her family, I really enjoyed reading about George Gey and his wife Margaret.  I liked that Gey built his labs out of scrap metal and  invented amazing things for scientific research without patenting them.  He sent the HeLa cells to anyone who was using them for scientific research.  I feel like his motives were good, he wasn't looking for fame, he was just a really smart guy that was obsessed with science.  I enjoyed the simplified explanations of how cells were used, and how specifically HeLa's cells allowed scientists to study so many different things.<br /><br />Henrietta's family really suffered after she died.  Her children were mistreated and abused by the cousin who came into take care of them. Three of her kids were still really young when she died, and an other one had been institutionalized for epilepsy and other illnesses.  Luckily, the oldest brother married a woman, Bobette, that figured out what was going on and rescued the kids.  Sadly, the damage had already been done.  Add to that poverty, un-diagnosed hearing problems and struggles with the law, and her children had really hard lives.  When they were asked for blood samples years later, bits and pieces of the history of their mother's cells were explained to them.  But not explained well.  They each struggled with it in different ways.  I think their reactions are well-justified, and as they slowly confide in the author and explain their experiences, you can really understand why they each reacted they way they did.  Some of the descendants wanted financial retribution, which is also understandable since they are all struggling with different illnesses, and many don't have health insurance.  Ultimately, they just want people to know who their mother was, and better understand themselves.<br /><br />Much of the story comes from Deborah, who was only 2 or 3 when her mom died.  She has a lot of spunk, and definetly grows on you as she searches for information about her mom.  I think the biggest tragedy in the book is not that the cells were taken, but that those 5 kids lost their mom when they were so young.  I'm sure they would have still had struggles, but if they had had Henrietta to love them and teach them, I think things would have worked out better.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot explains different advances in patient privacy and disclosure.  She outlines different agencies' attempts to prevent what happened to the Lacks family from happening again.  But doctors can still store and use your cells without you knowing.  As I read the different issues and concerns, I wondered how I would feel if I found out 20 years later that my cells had been used.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  It will be different than anything else you've read.  It is very interesting, educational and thought-provoking.a woman, Bobette, that figured out what was going on and rescued the kids.

B005P89F1C|2.0|This mediocre CD has a couple songs that will probably get played over and over on the radio for the next few holiday seasons, but little else to recommend it. It sounds like he ran into the studio for a couple days and they just took one of the first takes of each, instead of taking the time to put together a really great Christmas album. His \\"guests\\" that sing along with him don't do anything other than make you realize how weak the album is (the Drummer Boy rap is pretty bad if not borderline sacrilegious). The Mariah Carey song is pretty much all her and almost none of him--hard to say why it's even on this CD.   Pretty disappointing and not worth buying the whole thing--pick the cuts you like and download those alone. And don't waste extra money on the \\"deluxe\\" version--it merely has an a capella version of a song already on the CD, \\"Pray\\" which he put out earlier and a terrible rendition of \\"Someday at Christmastime.\\" (The last song was actually recorded in 2009 and he sang it live on the White House Christmas TV special, so his pitch is much higher and he can't hit all the notes.) This is not the worst Christmas CD ever made but it should have been much better.

B005PW3OS8|3.0|While I didn't expect much based on what has come out of Hollywood calling itself superhero movies in the last 10 years, I was still disappointed in how flat Captain America was.  Chris Evans made an excellent Captain America (IMHO), but the supporting cast came up too short.  I expected more from Tommy Lee Jones and way more from Hugo Weaving.  I love just about every character Hugo Weaving has ever played in his career, but his portrayal of the villain bored me to tears.  Maybe it was the directing?  Even the feel of the portrayal of the Nazis were off.  They got the look right, but that's about it.  I kept thinking that someone like Steven Spielberg or George Lucas would have done a much better job at making this movie pop.<br /><br />Captain America had potential, but it seemed like the powers that be were so intent on just getting it out in theatres to start working on an Avenger movie, that they kind of just threw it together and got lucky with choosing Chris Evans as the lead.  It's not the worst superhero movie I've seen (Punisher would be that), but like the majority of the other superhero movies that have come out in the past decade, it had nowhere near the depth and intensity that the new Batman movies (with Christian Bale) had nor did it have the fresh, fun, thrill and charm of the Superman movies (with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman) that came out in the late 70s.  Chris Evans was a great choice for Captain America.... everyone else?  Not so much.  I thought the movie was a bit boring and for a superhero movie that is not good!
0807014273|5.0|This is a famous book. 10 million+ copies worldwide. Well, that doesn't always guarantee its A. Going to be a good book and B. That it can remain relevant. I got ahold of the audible.com version of this and thought it was really great, and also very relevant. The portion about life in Auschwitz is right to the point and is not long and dragged out. Then the more philosophical portion of the book is about the right length too. Though I doubt any of us will experience something as brutal as spending a couple of years in a concentration camp, this book shows you how to relate things you may have felt in your own life, and it offers options for persevering through them. I also highly recommend 'Night,' and 'Every Man Dies Alone,' to give a rounded fictional edge of WWII Germany to go along with this book, the non-fictional portion.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I saw this at the $1 movies one evening when I was alone & childless.  It was the only thing playing that sounded interesting at all.  LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT!  I am not an \\"X-Men\\" fan, per se, but I don't think that really mattered.  It's a great movie nevertheless.<br />There are, however, some scenes of strippers that I wouldn't want my 13 y/o to see, but other than a few moments, it's relatively clean.<br />I can't give you a full movie review like some of the other comments.  I just wanted to share that I REALLY liked this movie & plan to see it many, many more times.
0385342055|1.0|I can sum up this book using an example...<br /><br />You know how your cringe when you are in a store and you see a little kid throwing a temper-tantrum because they can't have the toy they want, and finally they mom or dad just gives in and wonders why their kid behaves so badly?<br /><br />Yeah, that's the whole book.<br /><br />Not only is Becky ruining her own life at every turn, but now she is ruining her daughters life not too. I thought that maybe this book would be better because of the introduction of the kid, but the author went the total wrong way with it and it is just obnoxious. I would say that maybe in the next book the kid will do some growing, but neither Becky or Luke has grown or developed at all thus far in the series, so why should their kid.<br /><br />Sophie needs to come up with a new series because this one is long past dead.

B000002LE6|5.0|Back in 1988 when I purchased this album on cassette I was not a Prince fan.  I was familiar with his music but at 13 years old and peer influenced, Prince was not the type of music young black girls should've been listening too.  Anyhow, enthralled by the delicious \\"I Wish U Heaven\\" which was released as a single and also the electo-funk \\"Alphabet St\\" my hard saved pocket money was not wasted when I bought this album.  From start to finish I was mesmerised and taken into the 'Purple Planet' and became an avid fan of Mr Nelson, right to this very day.  If your a fan and wondering whether you should add this to your collection, the answer is Yes. This album is a trip of spiritual awakening (Eye No, Anna Steisa), getting funked (Dance On, Lovesexy, Glam Slam) and a musical education of how tapped and crafted this musical genius was way back in the 80's amongst his musical peers.  I lurve it. A classic, timeless, invigorating cd.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|WB had a good thing going with me... sell me the Bluray/DVD combo pack with the digital copy and I will gladly purchase it. Way of the future, right? But now, rather than simply being able to download the file as before and add it to your iTunes library or manage it however you see fit you have to jump through all these hoops, create new accounts, avoid being linked to Facebook, install new client apps on your computer and mobile devices outside of your library management process and on and on... terrible.  So, sadly, I will be returning my copy as this is utterly worthless for the way I want to manage my already substantial digital movie library. Do they honestly expect people to manage multiple libraries just to satisfy their marketing needs?  And since this is effectively one of the few platforms we have to complain about the lunacy of this process, let me just say to Ultraviolet, Rotten Tomatoes, Flixster and WB (the unholy alliance of marketing death eaters) that you are clearly creating such ill will amongst folks that are clearly WILLING TO PAY FOR YOUR MOVIES in the face of \\"the other option\\", then you really deserve all the terrible things you claim are happening to your industry. Shame on all parties involved in this utter sham product offering.

Whether they need advice on how to self publish or need the truth from the self publishing myths, this is the guide for them. The best part of this book is in the last section: Success Stories. These stories give hope to the self publishers that you don't have to be JA Konrath to be successful. All in all, this is a great starter book to a future successful self-publisher.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|First, know that I'm giving this 1 star because of the horrible issues with the digital copy. It would have been better to not even include this in the package than to include this stupid convoluted ordeal with flixster and ultraviolet. Know that the digital copy that comes with this is not a copy available through iTunes. You have to register with flixster and ultraviolet to view the digital copy and only after you install their programs or apps on your computer or device. And to make matters worse, the default method flixster uses to have you login is by connecting your facebook account. Do you really want a business having access to something personal of yours that they have nothing to do with (of course, facebook is a business and they have access to your personal account, but that's different)? Plus, the flixster/ultraviolet duo does not allow the digital copy to be downloaded on older, but still functional devices, like my 2nd generation iPod. So long, flixster and ultraviolet. I don't think there is another option to buy this with a different digital copy, so this is to help those future buyers have the right expectation - the digital copy with this is not like previous digital copies that have come with other blu-ray combos - next time I see \\"ultraviolet digital copy\\" I will know what that means and not expect it to deliver results, nor plan on letting \\"digital copy\\" be a selling point for a movie.  Oh, by the way, the blu-ray is awesome and the special features are nice.

B005GP7F8Y|3.0|This review pertains to the blu-ray edition 2011.  I agree with the other reviews that this is far from a great transfer. Getting the English to play was difficult and I don't remember how I did it! However, I played with the picture setup and adjusted the color options. I warmed it up and turned on the black corrector. This helped a lot. For $12 it's worth it, but no more than that. There's a whole lot of us OEJ fans so let's keep pushing for a restoration and a great blu-ray.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This was another really solid movie from Marvel.  I thought Thor was fine, but the first half of the movie was a bit slow.  Capt. doesn't suffer the same fate.  The beginning had plenty of character intro, but more drama.  The cinematography was great, the colors, set design etc was done very well, it felt like watching a Norman Rockwell painting.  It was patriotic without being sarcastic or ironic, and the acting was really good overall, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving,Stanley Tucci, can't beat them. And Haley Atwell...wow, just beautiful. The small Capt. CGI was flawless as well, they spend plenty of time with him so his transformation is that much more jarring.  There's a propeller scene ala Indianna Jones that might not be for the little ones but overall, definitely recommended.

Thanks, Epix, for streaming the show last night!
B00005LB50|2.0|This box set is a blatant commercial release by the record company and an embarrasment to the Buffalo Springfield.  Yes, the set contains some great songs, but any casual fan who already has the Springfield's \\"Retrospective\\" album, would be wasting money on this mess.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|What a stunner! King hits it out of the park with this one. This is king at his best. I read this one in 24 hours and could not put it down. Not only was it a great story with a cast of fascinating characters but it was also historically interesting. Many times I had to stop reading and google different things that caught my interest. This was not only fun to read but educational as well about a time and a place that many of us never experienced. I am the same age as the main character and I  grew up in Dallas. I grew up in the shadow of JR and the Kennedy assassination. I have been to the grassy knoll however it never was as real as it was in king's world. One thing I must say, King's judgement of Dallas is very typical to those whose visit to Dallas is brief. Having grown up there and lived in many other cities like New York and Los Angeles I can tell you that the people are a great deal warmer and kinder than he gives them credit for and many of us Southern democrats are under represented in his book but most New Englanders with a perfunctory knowledge of Dallas would be influenced more by what people think they know about the city and it's inhabitants than what it truly is. Despite this I truly enjoyed this one and you should immediately stop what you are doing, buy this book and don't expect to do anything else for the next few days.

B004CLYKLI|2.0|The bottom line message of this book is, \\"in parenting, the end justifies the means.\\"  You can insult, berate, threaten, bribe, bully, and manipulate children because in the end they will be skilled at what they do and will be proud of their prowess.<br /><br />I read all the way to the end of this book, so points must be awarded to Ms. Chua for engaging writing. Or was it that slightly macabre attraction to a well-meaning villain and our hope against hope that she will see the error of her ways?<br /><br />Here is what I thought at about the 1/2 way mark, \\"Ok, I think maybe she will see the light and realize that she should treat her kids more like her dogs.\\" But no, the only concession she makes is that the \\"Chinese style of parenting\\" only works for most kids, but not for the ones like her father and her daughter.<br /><br />Nowhere does she mention studying parenting techniques, child psychology, learning theory, or even motivational methods other than the plainly coercive.  I fear this book will embolden other tough-minded parents to come out of the closet and declare their tyrannical pride.<br /><br />This is my 50th review for Amazon.com and only my second 2 star rating. Usually when I read a book or watch a movie that is below par I don't have the motivation to tell the world about how bad it is. But in this case I felt compelled to do so, primarily to let the author and publisher know that I found the book to be irresponsible.  For someone supposedly so educated to spend so much time justifying a style of parenting that has the potential to do real harm to children is unconscionable. And calling it a memoir is no excuse, either.<br /><br />I will say that the opposite extreme from the one Ms. Chua promotes is also dangerous -- the \\"let the kids do what they want and don't challenge them because they won't like you,\\" approach. Responsible parents, in my opinion, challenge their children to be the best they can be, while at the same time encouraging a generosity of spirit and the development of compassion, empathy, and thoughtfulness.  Ms. Chua may have made these later characteristics a goal of her parenting, but she does not say so in this book, so I must assume they are not qualities she values.ssion, empathy, and thoughtfulness.

B004LWZW8S|5.0|\\"Immortals\\" is great! This is how the story goes: The brutal and bloodthirsty King Hyperion and his murderous Heraklion army are rampaging across Greece in search of the long lost Bow of Epirus. With the invincible Bow, the king will be able to overthrow the Gods of Olympus and become the undisputed master of his world. With ruthless efficiency, Hyperion and his legions destroy everything in their wake, and it seems nothing will stop the evil king's mission. As village after village is obliterated, a stonemason named Theseus vows to avenge the death of his mother in one of Hyperion's raids. When Theseus meets the Sybelline Oracle, Phaedra, her disturbing visions of the young man's future convince her that he is the key to stopping the destruction. With her help, Theseus assembles a small band of followers and embraces his destiny in a final desperate battle for the future of humanity.  The cast led by Henry Cavill (as Theseus) & Mickey Rourke (as King Hyperion) is great. The directing by Tarsem Singh is great. The story & screenplay by Charles Parlapanides & Vlas Parlapanides is great.  The music by Trevor Morris is great. The cinematography by Brendan Galvin is great. The film editing by Wyatt Jones & Stuart Levy is great. The casting by Joseph Middleton, Andrea Kenyon & Randi Wells is great. The production design by Tom Foden is great. The art direction by Jean Kazemirchuk, Michelle Laliberte & Michael Manson is great. The set decoration by Jille Azis, Eve Boulonne, Elise de Blois, Marie-Soleli Denomme is great. The costume design by Eiko Ishioka is great. The make-up & visual effects are great.  This is a great action movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing. This is a fun and fast-paced ride, that is a beautifully designed movie. This is a movie that is in the vein of \\"300\\".
1451648537|1.0|As a technologist and Investor interested in the company of Apple, I am less interested in the peculiarities of Steve Jobs personality, and more interested in the way he thought and how he invented and made decisions.  In this respect the book is lacking and left me wishing and waiting for a better book that provides more of THAT type of information. The author spent a tremendous amount of time with Jobs and seemingly lost an amazing opportunity (granted to no one else) to help business people and technologists understand how one of the greatest inventors of our time invented. Hence the rating of 1 Star... if that is what your looking for, go elsewhere. PLEASE will someone write THAT book! Consequently I do not recommend this book to anyone... in fact I tell my friends not to waste time reading it.  If you do read it, then know why you are reading it. At times it almost feels like a hit piece and one wonders what Jobs did to tick off the Author? The impression it left me with was of Job's life as a series of hissy fits punctuated by some useful business insight. Unfortunately it is very light on insight and focusses extensively on the emotional side of things, with little time given to Jobs mental and intellectual approach to invention and product. I might distill the insight down to a few salient points: a) Be a perfectionist, b) Hold a high standard and push people to achieve it. c) People DO judge a Product by its appearance!  How do you take vast chunks of time between products, or with companies ... in many cases years... and boil it down to a few vignettes illustrating where and how he ticked someone off in that phase of product development... who cares!! I 'm more interested in the fact the product exists, why it exists, how it came into existence, what WAS done vs. what WAS NOT done, and why.  There is simply not enough of that in this book and I found myself as I read constantly bemoaning the lost opportunity.  There ARE few interesting vignettes about histime with Ives and their creative process. That subject alone will likely make a tremendously useful and interesting book some day. But unfortunately THIS book always comes back to a vignette of some lesser persons emotional reaction to Jobs or a product at one of those creative times. Hey... they rioted in the streets of Paris when Stravinsky released Rite of Spring! Do we care?!  Typical example of what I increasingly found annoying:  I lost count of the times the book made mention of Jobs \\"Reality distortion field\\" as if this was a flaw in his character?! Wut?! Is that not the sign of a great leader or inventor?! Most people are trapped in their mediocrity and conventionality and limited capacity for vision and then a Steve Jobs comes along and says we CAN do THIS. Lesser people say NO it's not possible, but he goes ahead and does it anyway by pushing people beyond whatever limitation they suffer from (something often requiring a size 12 boot properly applied) and drives them to do it. So I ask: who had the reality distortion field?! I would suggest it was not Jobs. Also I might point out something the Author does not seem to understand and only mentioned in passing - Jobs studied and spent a LOT of time in and around Zen Monasteries and with a Zen master. If you know anything about Zen then you know one of the meditation practices is that the Roshi will whack you with a stick whilst meditating and attempting to reach enlightenment. The reason being two-fold a) primarily trying to get you to forget your petty little ego and its pissing and moaning about this and that, and b) trying to get you to forget your body. Both for the same reason: so that you can focus on the real task at hand and gain enlightenment. NOTE: it is well understand in such circles that the petty little ego is what obstructs realization. And it is somewhat akin to the ego busting that takes place in the Army. In both cases the end result is universally recognized as better... but for some reason not in the work world. I wonder what percentage of the ass whup'n jobs handed out was a Zen Boot camp thing.... I bet more of it than some might like to think. Anyway, the author seems to have entirely missed that angle, although Jobs did hint at it numerous times. I often wondered why the Author never explored that angle? That also would be interesting to know and he could have asked anything?  Anyway, Jobs was a great inventor, who had the ability to be so in touch with the state of the technology and the materials and medium and environment in which he worked that he saw possibilities where others didn't. Yet mostly this book is harping on emotional drama and side notes (often repetitively) and it really did start to annoy.  In closing I guess what I will say about this book is: if you are looking for a lot of business insight into a great technology inventor and company go elsewhere, if you want to read about some of the drama in the life of a great technology inventor and his company, read this.
0316056863|5.0|I couldnt put this book down!!! I was expecting a lot of tina fey i know from TV, but there is a lot of personal stuff in here as well. She doesnt talk about her scar per se, but does tell what happend, kind of... This book makes me feel like me and tina could totally hang out together, lol. There is some (unexpected) language that i never thought i would hear my \\"What the What\\" liz lemon say, but it was refreshing to think of her as a REAL person, not just...liz lemon. There are also some (kind of uncomfortable to imagine) things that went down during her story of life.. like in climbing old rag mountain. All in all great read, and not just for the SNL, or 30 Rock fan. BTW Tina, your dad had a point the book cover kind of scares people, my husband was concerned with the materials i was reading when he saw the half woman, half man...but i get it. YOUR THE MAN, LADY!!

B0012GMW0C|5.0|Ok....I'm right there with the folks here who think the first three Journey releases are the favorites. When this first one was put out I was lucky enough to be near a college that had an amazing radio station that played anything and everything....that would be Northern Michigan University in Marquette. That station seriously influenced me in many ways for sure! I would eagerly listen to hear bands I never heard of and liked so I could go out and buy the vinyl to record to Cassette and play in the car...why ever be without great music right?! Well they played Of A Lifetime and being blown away I waited for the DJ to say who it was...which they always did back then..after a group of songs were played. I had a decent Marantz amp and Marantz tuner, Pioneer turntable, Pioneer cassette deck and headphones...with some larger Advent speakers...the beginning of a hobby that got seriously out of hand in the years after... so I would CRANK the headphones to just before the distortion started and went to some other place where it's always a let down to come back from. This first Journey with everyone in the band playing the urine out of thier instruments and the next two Journeys have always been something I could  put on to go to that other place to this day. Back then there were many bands that did that for me but these days it's way more difficult to get access to bands that have that same greatness ...they are out there and being able to sample helps somewhat but like TV there just seems to be FAR more crap that anything truely impressive like this band was on the first three LPs they put out....I'm really thankful to have discovered them and others back then and to be able to reflect on those days and still enjoy the music from that time so you can keep all the horse droppings they are calling music for the most part now a days and excuse me while I go back to \\"that place \\"....
B005LJK3AC|4.0|Dark in the sense that these guys want to murder their horrible bosses and with good reason, although you will be surprised.  The cast is great, with Kevin Spacey as a total ayhole, Jennifer Aniston as a harassing dentist, and Colin Farrell as a doper who takes over after his dad dies.  The employees who suffer under them both professionally and personally are well played too, with the scene-stealing Charlie Day getting most of my attention.  The dialogue is fast, furious, and deftly delivered.  It is a bit raunchy for some, hence the R rating, but most others will find it entertaining.
1451627289|4.0|I understand from Amazon's page that this novel is 849 pages long in paper, but I read an electronic version. Though a couple of reviewers have called this novel bloated, I would have prefered that it be longer: the episode just before the ending and coda could have used fleshing.  Another disappointing aspect is that King's conceit allows sometimes overly convenient plot turns that, while not quite deus ex machina, did leave me thinking in passing \\"oh, that's kind of cheap.\\"  That said, this is an enjoyable read that I would recommend to anyone wanting a pleasant way to pass the time.  (As an aside, King ends the story proper with a note on where and when he wrote it. It's odd that he writes the novel was finished in 2010 when it contains references to events that took place in 2011.)

B004EPZ07K|2.0|Martin Campbell knows how to deliver the action-adventure goods, but 2011's &#34;Green Lantern&#34; remains among his lesser efforts. Simply put, it's hard to get worked up about a B-list superhero. Apart from some impressive visuals, the filmmakers display little enthusiasm for the uninspired material. Several fine actors and millions of dollars go to waste. Perhaps Warner Bros. can spend its money on a stronger DC character such as The Spectre.
1451648537|4.0|What Steve Jobs showed with the iPod, the iPhone, and then the iPad was a preternatural sense of not only what consumers what they wanted but what they needed and the unique design sense to build an end-to-end integrated vehicle to deliver exactly what they needed. What author Walter Isaacson shows with his detailed treatment of his eponymous subject is a laser-sharp focus on the events and beliefs that constituted a tempestuous life singularly committed to what he saw. Where this voluminous biography falls short is a depth of reflection and distance on Jobs' legacy that feels less like an oral history and more like considered judgment on a life whose destiny feels otherwise fulfilled. The book is essential reading for anyone fascinated by Steve Jobs' success, but it also reflects how difficult it is to uncover genuine insight from a deeply enigmatic visionary.<br /><br />The one inarguable insight Isaacson provides is that Jobs didn't invent many things outright. He was a master at putting together ideas, art, and technology in ways deliberate in his mind, invented the future. His significant breakthrough was designing the Mac after appreciating the power of graphical interfaces in a way that an established computing giant like Xerox was unable to do. He later replicated this mindset with the iPod after recognizing how having access to a thousand songs in your pocket could bring joy in a way that Sony could never even aspire much less accomplish. Isaacson points out that most company leaders can push innovations by being dexterous at the big picture and delegating others to master details. Jobs did both with unfettered dedication and knew like very few could the most fruitful intersection between technology and art. Producing technology requires intuition and creativity, while making art requires rigorous scientific discipline. Isaacson tells us Jobs' innate gift was to marry science and art and then market what he created with unparalleled acumen.<br /><br />The facts of Jobs' short life are clearly presented here. He grew up in Palo Alto with an adopted father he genuinely loved and shared his love for all things mechanical and electronic. Becoming your typical high school geek, he saw college was not for him and eventually worked for Atari as a technician. While at Atari, he took seven months off, traveled to India, and experimented with LSD. Jobs came back to Atari and through a computer-geek club, met his eventual partner Steve Wozniak, who built the first Apple computer. Together, they started Apple Computer, and Jobs makes $100 million before he turns 25. Due primarily to a power struggle with CEO John Sculley and a penchant to launch expensive forays into untested products, he lost control of Apple, a life-changing event that provided the impetus for his subsequent success. In 1985, he bought Pixar from George Lucas in a bargain deal and with director John Lasseter, turns it into a wildly successful animation brand. In an amazing comeback, Jobs returned to Apple in 1996 and saw the advent of the web as the conduit along which to build a vertically integrated consumer electronics company with computers at the hub and a succession of revolutionary new devices as the spokes.<br /><br />What is considered here is impressive to say the least. Having died with a personal fortune of more than $8 billion, Jobs achieved what only Bill Gates has done as one of only two pioneers of the PC age, having created and built arguably the world's most famous and valuable company, Apple. In the process, he managed to touch all our lives. A visionary as ruthless and driven as any of the great first-generation American capitalists, Jobs has led a life that comes across almost like a modern-day fable with a multitude of strange and coincidental details. He infamously drove his collaborators to distraction with his perfectionism and at the same time, he empowered them to do their best. You are left to believe that Jobs had a level of self-awareness that far outweighed the scarifying temperament. Isaacson's portrait is revealing considering that Jobs waived his right to read the book before he died, but there is no getting around the inevitable deification that this level of intimacy evokes.e scarifying temperament.

I was expecting a DVD, instead I got the one disc of special features which the kids liked, but the third disc was a gathering of interviews with pats on the backs by the directors saying how great they were with all the special effects etc, It also had repeats of disc two. Like I said a terrible waste of money. This will teach me to read the descriptions not just the titles.

0812550706|2.0|As a book for adolescents this might be okay. If one is to take it seriously as a novel a couple of issues crop up:<br /><br />- The characters. Are we really to believe that six year olds would behave like that? No matter that they were somehow genetically engineered, maturity of emotions  is not susceptible to that and all the children in the book behave like adults.<br />- The military strategy aspect. By all accounts the buggers are technically at least evenly matched with the humans, if not actually superior, plus they have the home turf and massively more forces. You can be the mostest brilliantest super military genius evar! - It wouldn't matter one bit. Bugs will win.<br />- We are to believe that earth military throws the space equivalent of a hail mary pass in the hope that once earth forces reach the bugs' home world they can come up with a dude that that can execute their as-yet-nonexistent strategy. Seriously?<br />- The misogynism. Early on the dearth of girls in the program is explained by hand-waving genetics and evolution. That might make sense if your task is to wield a two-hand sword but Ender and troops are manning consoles.<br />- `Dr. Device' - Deus ex machina. Yawn.<br /><br />If you are twelve and have been bullied and this book somehow ties into your revenge fantasies, fine. As a piece of science fiction let alone literature it falls flat on numerous counts.

They made a 180 shift here and I can't understand why.  They should have stuck to the toddler market.  I think they betrayed and ruined this franchise.  Spy movie?  Why?  WHO CARES!

B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie displayed a good portrayal of what the Jews went through during the Holocaust and what one man did to try to save as many as he could without jeopardizing himself.  Oscar Schindler was a very intelligent man to have come up with the idea to befriend so many officials for the German army and German government.  With his friends in high places that left him a lot of room to bend the rules and save 1100 Jews from death.    He created a business to make items from metal for the German army and needed \\"skilled labor\\" which he trains Jews with no skills in metal.  He also has a artillery factory that he refuses to allow make ammunition that will fire.  These companies keep the Jews working and from being shot or being placed in the gas chamber because they are \\"Schindler's Jews\\".  Even when a named was for some reason placed on a \\"kill\\" list Schindler would go to the rescue of this individual.  He would not allow his highly skilled work force to be taken from him.  Even though he had a heart of gold he had to keep up the front of being part of the Nazi party.  The Jewish people had very few friends in Germany, Poland or anywhere in Europe.  People were afraid to be caught helping the Jews, due to it was certain and instant death.    This movie did give an extraordinary sense of what it might have been like for the Jewish people during World War II.  I'm sure a lot was missing due to you can show all of the horrors they experienced on television or movies, yet it gives you a better idea than what you read in a text book.  As a mother it was hard to watch certain parts and I wasn't sure I would be able to make it through the entire movie and didn't in one viewing.  The thought of leaving my child to hide while I went off knowing I may never see my child again was horrifying.  Yet they did what they felt like they had to do at the time to try to insure their child would survive.    I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn more about the Jewish people and what they had to experience during the Holocaust.  These people lived through hell on earth from a man who could be considered the devil himself just because of their religious beliefs.  It is atrocious to think that any human could have thought of this torture let alone actually have it applied to living humans.

A litte pompous, self indulgent, but OK.

Not only action is superb, the acting is good too. A movie with equal amount of action and heart. Paul Walker adds to the mix with his great acting as well.   The thing I like about his movie is there is virtually no gimmick. Just an excellent chemistry between a whole bunch of actors, mindblowing action and great storyline.

Ultraviolet is more like digital streaming than a digital copy.

B0041TM3LK|4.0|In this value-package European import from Real Gone Jazz, you get eight classic albums from the legendary innovative pianist-composer Thelonious Monk on four disks, so financially it's a real bargain.<br /><br />This is what you get:<br /><br />Disk 1<br />1. Monk (1954)<br />2. Monk's Music (1957)<br /><br />Disk 2<br />1. Thelonious Monk plays the music of Duke Ellington (1955)<br />2. The Unique Thelonious Monk (1956)<br /><br />Disk 3<br />1. Mulligan Meets Monk (1957)<br />2. Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins (1954)<br /><br />Disk 4<br />1. Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers with Thelonious Monk (1957)<br />2. Thelonious Monk Trio (1957)<br /><br />Monk's performances are full of dissonant harmonies, hesitant pauses, and long sections where the melody is only just detectable through his characteristically percussive playing style. Through the 1950s, though respected, Monk's music was often considered \\"too eccentric and complex\\" for listening audiences. However he has gradually been acknowledged as one of the greatest-ever jazz composers/innovators: he wrote more than 70 unique individual pieces in addition to recording and extensively reworking those of other jazzmen. Monk's wife Nellie Smith, by whom he had two children, usually referred to him in public as \\"Melodious Funk.\\"<br /><br />The sound quality of the Real Gone re-issues has been occasionally criticised by keen-eared audiophiles, and there is some small merit in this criticism. If you are very fussy about tonal separation and want absolutely faultless sound resolution, you can buy all these albums separately - some of the recent releases, like the Fantasy label re-master of `Monk's Music', are excellent. However if you're relatively new to  Monk's unique and distinctive music and just want to experience a broad selection of his output, then with this 4-disk package you can't go wrong. Granted I'm no audiophile obsessive, but to me the sound quality on this set is fine.

B003Y5H574|2.0|I confess that I'm not much of a Steve Carell fan, but I approached this film with higher expectations because of the overall cast and the generally upbeat reviews. A romantic comedy that is virtually laugh-free,  about a dull, straight-laced man (Carell) who, faced with divorce from his neglected wife (Juianne Moore) hooks up with a successful swinger (Ryan Gosling) who teaches him how to pick up women in a local bar. And that is the sum and substance of the film, which after over an hour of tedium and unconvincing situations, we suddenly have a deeply felt scene between the amazing Ryan Gosling and the equally interesting Emma Stone that seems to have wandered in from another film. Sadly, the feeling doesn't last, and the film loses its footing very quickly. There are several other subplots, and they all collide during the very frantic, not very funny penultimate scene, followed by a finale that features Carell and is squirm-inducing.   For the record I had rented this film, and was so depressed when it was over, I watched \\"The Americanization of Emily,\\" the 1964 satire with the wonderful pairing of James Garner and Julie Andrews, written by the brilliant Paddy Chayefsky, and once again found it funny, touching and altogether brilliant...in other words, all the things that \\"Crazy, Stupid, Love\\" is not.

B00002Z88D|5.0|It's an interesting combination.<br />.....<br />No, no, it's the PERFECT combination! Metallica, Michael Kamen, and the San Francisco Symphony have created a marvel in the form of a 2-CD set. Selected songs from previous Metallica albums are performed with an orchestra, and every single one of them sound amazing. \\"Nothing Else Matters,\\" \\"Fuel,\\" \\"One,\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" can be best described as terrific. But truly, the highlight of this albums is \\"No Leaf Clover.\\" This song was created solely for this live album. The melodies (as well as the classical/metal style) really deliver. It's my second favorite Metallica song, right behind \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" All in all, this is a superb live album.

B004EPYZQC|4.0|Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film.  Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.<br /><br />Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.  Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.<br /><br />Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of \\"Desperado\\" fame.  The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.<br /><br />What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film.  Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts.  Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow.  Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.<br /><br />Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise.  The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil.  International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious \\"Danza Kuduro\\" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico.  Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.<br /><br />There are two elements of the film that stand out.  The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs.  The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.<br /><br />The other element is the final car chase of the film.  Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving.  The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.<br /><br />That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course.  To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption.  While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up averageacting at best.  I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much.  While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them.  Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.<br /><br />Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene.  But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.<br /><br />Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours.  While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.<br /><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general.  If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series.  Definitely give this one a rent, or get the Blu-Ray/DVD combo to own one of the better movies in the series.fan of heist flicks or action movies in general.

B002XZL0OA|5.0|I have searched art websites in vain looking for something that could hold sticks of vine or willow charcoal. Other holders either proved to have a wobbly grasp or were priced in the $20+ range which made me hesitate to purchase (I'm not on a big budget). I was made aware of the existence of Koh-i-noor holders not through art outlets but through my brother, who had inherited his holder from a fellow construction worker who left his tools at work one day and never came back. The inherited holder was a red Koh-i-noor and it held charcoal so nicely. I went web-combing again, this time for a specific item, and landed at Amazon. I purchased two different holders, the 5353 Versatil Black All Metal Lead Holders with Sharpener Soft Surface and this.<br /><br />This holder is shorter and lighter than the all metal holder. At first I liked the extra length of the all metal; however, it's also a couple ounces heavier. I already have pain in my right hand from RSI, and the extra weight bothered me. I gave the metal holder to my brother (now he has a spare) and kept this plastic one for myself for drawing. While shorter than the metal holder, it is long enough, and the price is right! I was able to throw in an extra for a friend.<br /><br />I love being able to use charcoal without getting my hands dirty... now if I can just find some compressed charcoal that will also fit in my new holders. The standard square sticks are too big.
B0046IGOIO|3.0|A testament to a great live band. Probably the very early struggles where they could not get signed to a label was a good thing since it forced them to rehearse and become a great rhythm section. Unfortunately as a friend once reminded me about Led Zeppelin, periodically you find yourself wishing (in this case, Jim Morrison) the singer wasn't ruining the song. This is especially prevalent during the blues covers, like \\"back door man,\\" \\"who do you love,\\" \\"money,\\" \\"little red rooster.\\" During these moments The Doors become just another half-rate blues bar band and Morrison comes across like a poor David Johanson imitator. Maybe this wasn't the case live, but it's how it comes across on vinyl.<br />  The great blues singers stemming from Howlin' Wolf, Elmore James up to worthy rock inheritors like Mick Jagger and John Fogerty fails to include Jim Morrison. Call Morrison whatever you want but he's not a great singer, a shaman, and was an average lyricist at best.<br />The improvised and inspirational lyric for Bo Diddley's \\"Who Do You Love,\\"  includes \\"the night was black and the sky was blue, down the alley the ice wagon flew...\\"--so we're not talking about Patti Smith here.<br />  However, on Doors' cuts like \\"When the Music's Over,\\" \\"Roadhouse Blues,  and \\"Five to One,\\" the band rocks heavily thanks to Robby Krieger guitar work (you can hear his influence in later guitarists like Glenn Mercer of the Feelies), Ray Manzarek on keyboards, and Jim Densmore on drums. Add to your mp3 collection selectively.<br />  Less jamming and psychedelic than \\"Live in Detroit\\" which is preferable since it includes many extended jam sessions and Morrison comes across less annoying and more searching. Listen to the versions of \\"Mystery Train,\\" and \\"Crossroads\\" on Detroit where Morrison sings as if he's discovered the secret of each song and then along with Ray Manzarek transforms it into something altogether undefinable--if not free jazz-like.

The characters were vastly different which made the book even more enjoyable. Mikeal Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander will be two characters that I will always remember. The genius of the author shows throughout the book and especially when the mystery start to unfold. The book ended rather abruptly, but I hope that book two will be just as, if not more, enjoyable.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|I'm absolutely shocked to report that this Megadeth album is actually bursting with HOOKS.  I honestly haven't liked a thing they've done since \\"Youthanasia,\\" so I naturally expected this to be awful.  But such was not the case!  If you liked \\"Countdown to Extinction,\\" you should like this.  It's that sort of hard yet very commercial and hooky metal that the band was playing at that time.  My grade = 3.5.  I realize that doesn't seem all that high, but considering all the garbage this band has released over the past 15 years, it's VERY high.

0451228375|5.0|We all know that this is a sequel to Follett's previous work, Pillars of the Earth, that dealt primarily with building cathedrals. World Without End also concerns itself about builders and building, and while at it, about the way of life in Kingsbridge and peoples' blind beliefs about religion, that was preached by some incompetent clergy.   Pillars of the Erath was an outstanding effort and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I noticed some reviewers have considered World Without End as a slightly inferior novel compared to its prequel, but I must disagree; in fact the sequel was stronger and more inviting than the prequel. Some reviewers also commented about the abundance of sex in it, however, you must consider the era the book depicts in; and according to independent history such behavior was the norm. Each page of the over-1000-page book was well worth the ink which it was written in.   It was a joy to read it.

B005HV6Y84|1.0|Let me begin by saying that *all* of the previous Twilight soundtracks are among my favorite albums of the last few years. I could listen to them all again and again -- and they introduced me to some great new artists. Even their worst songs were still pretty good. So I had high hopes for the Breaking Dawn part 1 soundtrack. I was worried though after listening to audio clips online before the album was released and not feeling hooked by any of the songs. I love Christina Perri, and her song \\"A Thousand Years\\" is lovely. But after listening to the soundtrack as a whole a few times over, I feel that the rest of the album is boring and forgettable. Some of the songs are kinda pretty, but totally forgettable as soon as you are done listening to them. I can always tell right away when an album just isn't working for me. I listen to a lot of music. And this one just isn't working for me. I had no desire to re-listen to any track except Perri's. And the only other redeeming track is the last track on the album -- which is from the musical score. I say save your money on this one and just download Perri's track and the musical score album when it comes out. I guess after such a good run of soundtracks, one was bound to suck...

B004RFYEEC|5.0|This needs to be said,so I guess I'll be the one to do it...in 67 I was a teenager in a small town in Kentucky,not everyone liked the Beach Boys and all that doo-wop stuff..it seemed dated in 1967...I didn't care for Pet Sounds that much,but as I got older.BW's genius shown through.SMiLE may have bombed if it had been released.The Sgt Pepper issue is,at best,frivilous as it does not relate to the reality of record sales in that time period.If the SMiLE sessions seem like an anti-climax.and a little short of a masterpiece,it's because in 2011,the complexity of BW's project does not sound that complex at all...but in 67 SMiLE would have blown the music world to peices,Capitol got upset with BW because they knew SMiLE was not for teeny-boppers(the market the BB's had dominated)The complexity of SMiLE made it much better suited for the 20's and 30's aged folks which was indeed a small market compared to \\"THE KIDS\\"(Capitol wanted the boomer market).Yes SMiLE was ahead of it's time,and it is great,but SMiLE is Brian Wilson's 1967 musical vision. SMiLE is strange and beautiful,but SMiLE is somewhat contorted if not facinating,it expresses artistic freedom,artistic danger, and the evolution and revolution of BW, whereas, Sgt Pepper',with G.Martin at the helm and the Beatles in top form,is a bit revolutionary but remains main line and very controlled and safe.In 1967 I do not know if AM radio'ers were ready to be pushed  into a new musical abyss,we were having too much fun...SMiLE may have bombed....
B005NKIQ26|1.0|Out of sheer curiosity, I listened to all the sample clips, 5 1/2 minutes' worth,and Ohmigod, it was sheer agony.  Now for a Christmas Album, wouldn't you expect a few songs, even some new songs if you will, that make reference to Jesus?  But no!  This kid sounds like any prepubescent teenager given a microphone and amplified several hundred megawatts.  By this standard, my cat sounds like a lion.  Bieber's voice is so flat-line on the oscilloscope that I started yawning in the first 30-second clip.  Talk about the \\"dumbing down of America!\\" (please reference that title on Amazon's Books, and order a copy[[ASIN:0312148232 Dumbing Down Our Kids: Why American Children Feel Good About Themselves But Can't Read, Write, or Add]]).

B0054NQZ9S|5.0|The sobering tale about a group of company people at a big manufacturing firm who lose their jobs during the Great Recession. The focus is mostly on Ben Affleck's character who thinks he can find another job but soon finds himself struggling to secure a job at half his salary and failing that he finds he has to work for his brother-in-law fixing houses. Over time he loses his house and car and many other things but especially his dignity. In the meantime there are some subplots as an older higher up exec finds himself in trouble because he's pushing 60 and one of the owners finds himself torn between his broken duty to his ex employees and the fact that his stock has shot up. It's a tale about how a lot of us were let down by the Big Whigs and we're the ones mostly suffering for it. It's also about how we as a culture put a lot of our identity into our jobs and toys and find ourselves sinking into depression when we lose those things. It's also about the humiliating process for some who have to take whatever job they can find but on a brighter note it's about the American Spirit and how we spring back up when we're supported by our loved ones. The cast is overly impressive: Tommy Lee Jones, Chris Cooper, Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner, Rosemarie DeWitt, Craig T. Nelson, Maria Bello and some other great supporting actors. It cost $15M to make but has yielded only a bit under $5M at the box office. Why did it yield so little if it's a great film? It had a limited exposure at theaters to begin with and it's a topic Americans don't want to encounter at the movies. That said, it's mirror of our times for many and it's also well done. Directed by John Wells in his feature film debut. I suspect a lot of the actors and actresses were moved by the script and offered to do it for far less. That says something about the picture even if it didn't yield bling bling at the box office.  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TIMES: Bplus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early November 2011.
B000002H97|3.0|Up till this point Metallica had been one of the pioneers of thrash metal.  they released 2 absolutely phenomenal albums, Lightning and Puppets, 1 really good album, Justice, and a decent debut in Kill.  They not only helped define a new style of music, but they also developed a consistent knack for quality.  Instrumentals aside, which they aren't bad either, there isn't one song on Lighting, Puppets, nor Justice I don't like.  the same can semi be said for their debut, but with a few exceptions, the quality on that one just hadn't quite arrived yet.  I guess that wasn't good enough.  With their self titled album Metallica began the first in a string of albums to feature the musical devil Bob Rock, the band killer.  What we end up with this album is a much more simplistic release than their previous work.  The songs don't really vary much in tempo, with pretty much the whole album ranging from slow to slightly upper mid tempo, Holier Than Thou being an exception.  Still there are no thrashers, and only slight traces of the Metallica of old to be found here.  Well there was enough to keep most old school fans, although they did lose a lot of them.  However what they lost in old fans, they gained in new fans and then some.  The album is much more slickly produced.  I honestly can't stand the drums on this album, both the playing and the sound.  They sound too hollow.  There's no attitude in them.  the songs are much more repetitive.  Metallica try some experimentation on here, in moving in a more pop direction.  Overall this one's a tough one to rate.  If you'd asked me to rate this back in 95, when I first got into music I'd have given it a perfect score.  I loved every minute of this thing.  But times change.  One time listening to this and Master Of Puppets, back in college, I really noticed it.  Puppets was such an amazing album, that originally didn't do much for me, and I really began to love and appreciate that album.  Whereas this one...  It just felt hollow,like the drums.  The gems on here, for me, are the non singles.  I don't know if it's hearing them over and over again, but they're far and away my least favorite songs on here, except for God That Failed, which I'd rate down there with those.  Enter Sandman 5/10 oh the humanity, when I hear the opening notes.  Yes, we've all heard this one.  And, boy how I use to LOVE this song.  This song is the definition of this album for me, in terms of what I use to think and how I feel now about it.  Very simple riffs, vocals everything.  It's extremely catchy.  It's probably not that bad of a song, but I've just heard it so much over the years.  Heck I haven't heard it much in the past 7 years, and I'm still sick of it.  Lars sounds bored on the drums.  Not good for a first song.  Sad But True 5/10 is a slower song than the last.  It's still heavy, for this album.  Again, I've heard this song so many times now, I could not hear it again and be perfectly fine.  I don't know what it is, but something always bothered me about this song to begin with, and now I nearly can't stand it.  But it's really not that terrible.  I just get this feeling of revulsion when I hear it.  Holier Than Thou 9/10 one of my 2 favorite songs on the album.  It's one of the fastest songs on the album.  Even when I loved this album, this was one of my favorite songs.  I probably loved it more because it wasn't played on the radio.  Overall it has a nice riff, and great verses.  The chorus is a little weak, but it serves its purpose just fine.  Great song, a definite highlight of the album.  The Unforgiven 7/10 has some of the same feelings as the first 2 songs.  I've heard it a lot.  And, I use to love this song.  But, it's still fairly good.  It starts with an acoustic intro with some electric guitar notes in there.  The verses have melodic helectric guitars, with a softer chorus.  They tried something different here, and with my feelings for this album the way they are, the fact I can still look positively on this song, says a lot.  Wherever I May Rome 7/10 is probably my favorite of the singles.  It seemed to get less play than the 2 ballads, or the other singles.  It starts with an Arabian sounding intro.  I can't really call this a heavier nor a softer song.  It just is what it is.  It's pretty good, with some decent vocals.  Don't Tread On Me 7/10 is definitely a groove laden song.  This one's pretty decent.  I'd probably give it a similar rating back in the day too.  It's really not that special, but still a decent song.  Through The Never 7/10 starts with a fster guitar riff.  It varies from a little faster to mid tempo.  Overall it's an enjoyable song, but nothing really special.  Nothing Else Matters 7/10 James tries a different clean style of vocals.  At this point this was the softest Metallica song ever, and still ranks amonst the softest of them.  I still kind of like this one.  Sure it's different, but not bad either.  Of  Wolf And Man 8/10 is a pretty good song.  It's not incredibly fast, but it moves really well none the leas.  This one has really good vocal hooks, and a nice opening guitar riff, simple but effective.  Overall a personal favorite of mine, third overall on the album.  God That Failed 5/10 doesn't have getting overly played out on the radio to bug me.  it's just not that great of a song.  It's a slower one, and it's not terrible, but I definitely don't look forward to it.  Definitely the weakest song on the second half.  My Friend Of Misery 8/10 starts with a bass nice line.  It's fairly melodic, not quite a ballad.  This was definitely, amongst the singles, another of the reasons I loved this album back then.  And, I still really like this song now.    Struggle Within 9/10 only recently has grown to be one of my favorite songs on here.  It starts with a drum beat that reminds me of, I think it's fox, music that use to play showing their logo before some of their movies.  The song itself is faster.  The chorus, while simple, is pretty solid.  Overall a great way to end the album.  But, like it or not this is a classic.  It doesn't matter if you love this album, hate this album, are indifferent, or like me, find it tough to rate.  This is a true classic, that does bring back fond memories, but overall the whole thing now I've just soured on.  It tends to remind me of their demise.  Also as we get older times change, and I've grown much more of a metal fan than I was when I first got into this one.  Still if you're looking for a place to start with the band, this will probably be the safest album, if you like a more hard rock album.  If you're looking for a more metal album, get Ride the lighting, or Master of puppets, their 2 crowning achievements.    In closing I'd like to say that EVERYTHING Megadeth has done, except for Risk, is better than this album.

B000002HRE|2.0|I can't believe they passed this off as a studio album. If this is a studio album, then Disturbed's Lost Children, and Megadeth's Hidden Treasures, are studio albums. This is an album of songs recorded during the sessions for their previous album Load. Of course the title suggests this. I can't help but feel, if they had to release every one of these songs, Load included, they should've just made it a true double album, and sold them together. Either that or they should have just combined them into 1 album, but then the debate of which songs would make it would start, and probably has in the past.  Everyone knows where Metallica was at this point in history. I'm not sure what people were expecting from this album, I expected another Load. Those expecting a return to form would be disappointed, to date every time. Although Death Magnetic was close. Still that album was more than 10 years away. Either way I was pretty much right. Several of these songs sound just like songs from Load, as you'd expect, given that they were recorded during the same sessions. Overall the album is probably filled with more heavier songs, and fewer ballads. It's less experimental. What you have here is a collection of songs where the good songs aren't as good as the good songs on Load, and the bad songs aren't nearly as bad as the bad songs on Load. Honestly, and there are songs until the last day or so, I hadn't listened to in over a decade, there isn't really an absolutely awful, worst song ever contender song on here. There are plenty of bad songs, but Load had some far worse material, hence they should have just combined them. The lyrics are just as bad as they were on Load, and they continue the blues rock metal style with much more simplistic song compositions. Even with the songs being more simple, they still manage to drag these songs out longer than they should be. A lot of these songs are 6 minutes or more which can be fine when done right, but as I said, these songs are more simplistic. Most shouldn't have been longer than 4 minutes.  Fuel 7/10 starts with James yelling his probably famous \\"Give me fuel\\" etc. Not a fan of that part. I don't know why, but it just bugs me. This one's an up tempo rocker, but I really don't understand why people like it so much. Granted on this album it's clearly one of the stand outs, but still. It's very simple, to the point, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it just, eh it's missing something. Plus it has a cheesiness facot as well.  The Memory Remains 6/10 gets points off for adding that female singer. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to them having a woman do some vocals, but as has been the case for this band ever since they hired the music equivalent of the devil Bob Rock, every decision they make, they screw up. This woman sounds like some old woman moaning, and that's pretty much what you get. Just nonsensical moaning. Otherwise the song isn't bad. It's a mid tempo song, rocker I guess. It'd be one of the better songs if not for that woman moaning.  Devil's Dance 2/10 is pretty bad. It's a slower song, and I listened to it twice and I still don't remember it, not counting however many times I tried back when I got this album. It's a slower tempo rocker with drum beats you've heard on Load. This one truly does have a b side feel to it.  The Unforgiven II 7/10 could've been higher rated if not for the obvious rip off of the original. I'm guessing they came up with this one and realized that it ripped off Unforgiven, so they just decided to change the name and some lyrics to make it a sequel. Still it's not a bad song. I don't like the use of the intro from the original in this one. I use to love the original, and on the radio, when they'd play the intro, you never knew which song they were going to play. And when it was this one, I felt a huge sense of disappointment. The chorus while much heavier than the original's, uses similar melodies and lyrics to the original too. Another thing I'd liketo have seen changed. Otherwise it's not bad. I like the verses for the most part. They do experiment on here a little, but it works fine. If this song were its own and not a sequel I'd probably give it an 8. Still the gimmick adds to the b side feel of this b side album.  Better Than You 2/10 has to have one of the worst choruses, worst for Metallica, ever. I think even St Anger had better choruses, and that album didn't really have much in the way of memorable hooks. This one starts kind of slow, but the verses are more up tempo. The drums, in this one and others, just sound off somehow. They just don't fit. This is truly a song that should never have been recorded. The only reason I don't give it a 1 is the verses are ok.  Slither 5/10 is ok, another mid tempo rocker of sorts. I don't really have much to say on this one. It's just sort of there. I use to listen to it. It's definitely better than some songs on here, but it's just there. Boring b side they could have thrown on Untill It Sleeps single or something instead.  Carpe Diem Baby 2/10 is another boring track. It's a slower paced song, and it's just boring, with an extremely weak chorus. The only positive thing I can say is I've heard worse, but it's still a crappy song.  Bad Seed 4/10 meh another b side. It's better than most of the songs on here. I use to listen to it as well. The drums are seriously starting to annoy me at this point. Lyrics aren't very good, and this is also another forgettable song.  Where The Wild Things Are 8/10 easily my favorite song on the album.. It's a mix of heavier and softer, mostly mid tempo. The chorus isn't as obvious, but flows well with the song. It's pretty long, probably still longer than it should be, but overall I really like this one, which I didn't so much at first, so it's a nice surprise to make the tops on the list, for this album.  Prince Charming 6/10 there's absolutely no reason this song should have reached 6 minutes, 4 1/2 at most. This might be the fastest song on the album. It's another heavier one. I like the vocals during the chorus, where it gets a lot of its attention from me. Musically it's ok, as is vocally, except for being too long. The lyrics drag this one down, or I'd give it a 7, possibly an 8. But for an 8 it'd have had to be shorter. It's fairly basic, and needed to be shorter. Still a decent listen.  Low Man's Lyric 4/10 I really want to like this one, but I don't. It's easily the softest song on here. It's also the most experimental. They use some different instruments, heard it once recently but already forgot it. Overall though, it doesn't do anything, thus it's boring. Also I'm not sure James's voice was right for this type of music. Overall there were some nice ideas, but it just didn't pan out very well.  Attitude 4/10 should've covered the Misfits's song of the same name instead. This is another rock song, but again, it's not very good. Some vocal parts as well as lyrics, rip off Fuel, which is a much better song.  Fixxer 4/10 is another extremely long song, given the simplicity of it. It's ok I guesss, but again, way too long. The chorus doesn't really do much for me either, and it's a very luke warm way to end an already blah album.  Overall this album is what it is, a b side collection from the Load sessions. Fans will find their hidden gems here, and those may vary. Fans of only the 80's stuff will hate this one. I definitely don't like the direction they took, but my tastes vary, despite what some would say, enough for me to find something to appreciate on here. Overall I'd say this album should only be for fans of the Load album who just want more of that. It's not for anyone else. They ripped people off by passing it off as a new album, when it's a b side collection, and the songs show. There are definitely songs that should've made Load. I wish they'd combined them into 1 album, taking Fuel, The memory remains, Unforgiven II, Where the wild things are, and maybe Prince charming and putthose songs on Load, and replaced that stupid country song amongst other bad songs on that album.  So I'm amazed at how bad this album is, but not unexpected given what it is. If you loved Load and want more of that, love everything Metallica does, or just have to have every album Metallica puts out, then feel free to get this. Just don't expect anything more than Load leftovers, and a couple songs that should've been on there.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Watched the \\"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2\\" Blu Ray (Blu Ray + DVD + \\"Digital Copy\\" release) on my Sony BDP-S570 and noticed a host of glitches with the video- there were numerous split-second skips that seem to be evenly spaced time-wise throughout the movie's run-time. I stopped and reloaded it a few times- the errors occurred at exactly the same moments each time...  The disc surface is immaculate- I don't have another BD player to give it a whirl in but have watched \\"Captain America: First Avenger\\", \\"X-Men: First Class\\" and \\"Bridesmaids\\" since then and had ZERO issues.  It appears some players are having trouble with the underlying \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\"- you don't have to actually be playing the movie in MMM to be experiencing problems. I selected MMM and realized that the issues I had with the film/video coincided with the exact points in which the MMM features kick into gear under that app. In short- they've crammed too much \\"junk\\" onto one disc without proper QC.  This is NOT a player issue- I'm not updating firmware (and possibly junking up the player for good) for one Blu Ray title out of the last 30 it's played. I'm returning my multidisc release for a movie-only disc to check out results. It was enough to get returned with the blatant false advertising concerning the \\"Digital COPY\\" that is NOT present.
0802473156|5.0|A good friend of mine recommended the 5 Languages of Love to me, after I'd lamented not understanding my husband. In my defense, who can really claim to understand the opposite sex?  After reading Gary Chapman's book, I can say that while I might not get all of reasons men do what they do, but at least now I can understand a little more of what makes them happy because I understand a little of their language.<br /><br />Love is what you do, not an emotion, which is why we're so confused by the whole thing. We think that once we say \\"I love You\\" with words than our partner should be good to go.  Added to that fact, is that men and women think differently, and then we have different men/women thinking differently from the even that norm.  What's to do? Why does love fade after the excitement of the chase, and subsequent catch?<br /><br />Gary Chapman does a wonderful job of identify the 5 languages we use to express our love, and then gives us a questionnaire so we can find what language our partner speaks so we can answer in the right way.  He then gives suggestions on how to fulfill those needs so our significant other can feel the love we have for them.<br /><br />What's so hard about expressing our love, is that we express love in a way that would make us feel loved, and it might not be what our partner needs to feel loved.  So, here you are doing what you think is the best thing a person could want, while your partner might be thinking you aren't feeling the love any more.  How crazy is that?  Well, love is crazy for the most part, but at least Chapman's book can help get us communicating in the way we want to be heard.<br /><br />I have to say that I was amazed at what speaking the 'right language' can make in a relationship.  What would never work for me, works like a charm for my partner.  Thank you Mr. Chapman.  Here I was knocking myself out to do what I would want done for me, when I could have saved myself so much time, and trouble by doing what worked for my partner instead.  It also helps to know what you want yourself, (after doing the quiz) so you can just tell your partner what you want.  I maybe clueless most of the time, but I do know that men like it when they know exactly what they have to do to make a woman happy.<br /><br />Short, easy-to-understand book that can help a couple sail a little easier through the rough seas of relationships.my partner instead.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really LOVED this book.  The way the author writes and describes everything is unique because unlike other books I don't seem to get tire with the describing since it's not boring nor force. It catch me from the start and I felt like I was seen a movie.  I couldn't put the book down.  I usually read romantic novels but I can say this is by far my favorite book. I saw that some people compare it to twilight but honestly I really don't see the resemblance and this book is way better!  I loved the story and most of all I love the way the author tells it.  I really recommend this to anyone looking for a great book!

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I just finished reading \\"11/22/63\\" and could not put it down! I was a big fan of King 20 years ago and read almost all of his books published in the 80's and 90's. However, in my opinion, after awhile reading his books became a chore and I had to stop reading him. After I saw him on the \\"Today\\" show last week, I was intrigued. So, I bought the Kindle edition and started reading. I was captivated by his main character, Jake, who is a very cerebral guy. He finds it so hard to believe in the ability to go back in time. When he finally agrees to go back to 1958 and try to prevent the Kennedy assasination, we follow along with all Jake's misgivings about what he's trying to do and why. When he falls in love with Sadie, I really hoped that they would be able to return to 2011 together. Although King did not end the book with a classical love story ending, I felt King's ending was very satisfying. I would implore any former King fans to BUY THIS BOOK. It's fantastic!!
0786955716|2.0|Ok,this will be short but I hope it helps. This tileset includes the sewer(which is ok) and the town tiles. I say town and not city because it's more like the insides of cottages, country inns, and similar small town interior settings. The interior floor tiles are pretty much all wood, no interior stone or marble. A couple of carts(see box)and some vendor stalls I liked. The exterior tiles could be used for cities and be enjoyable. There is a large one with a fountain decorated with 3 mermaid statues that I am pleased with. There are also some exterior tiles that have water borders(only one square, but would be good for a small harbor or fishing town off the sea coast). The sewer is just green canals of sludge with a few areas for unhindered combat. I think they would be better when combined with other sets like a dungeon tileset. So if you're looking for small town encounters this is ok otherwise you're not missing anything special.

0062112430|4.0|**Spoiler alert!**  When I first picked up this book (after I read her first book, Before I Fall,) I was excited for something new. It reminded me of the series Uglies, Pretties, and Specials. I loved that series, so this book gave me a sense of familiarity to that. However, is Oliver only capable of crappy endings? Both books resulted in an unfinished feeling for me. After such an amazing book, the last chapter really let me down. In both books, she ends them similarly, and it leaves me with the Dumbledore really died?! kind of feeling. Love the books, but hate the endings. Make some of your books have happier endings please, or else I'll know in the future how every one will end before I open the cover.

This book is obviously essential reading but I'm glad it wasn't even a [age longer.  I enjoyed hearing Keith spin his take on life and there were lots of great anecdotes, but once I was done I felt like I never had to read another book about the Stones again.  Maybe that was the point.
0307938905|5.0|This audiobook totally AWED me. The descriptive writing and the narrative reading made this book like a dreamy adventure for me. The first part of it I kind of got lost a little bit but once i caught up it was a magical and dreamy romance that i became engrossed in. The romance in this is a romance that every little girl dreams of. Marco is just a dreamy and swoony guy who could take my breath away. I truely felt as though he was romancing ME. Celia is a strong character who stands up for herself against her father for the love that she desires with all her heart. I am truely an admirer of that. The story is set in a time when things were simple and magic was known as trickery. It makes for a great story.<br />The love story between Marco and Celia is magical and true. They would sacrifice everything about themselves to save the other and that is the type of stories we dream about as children.  I felt as I was the one falling in love!<br />The scenes are told with such vivid description that i felt as though i was actually there. I felt like i was in a dream.<br />I LOVED this book. I'm not sure i would have loved it so much without the narrator Jim Dale. He reads it with such in depth tones that i was swooped away with his voice. I became so comfortable with his voice that once i settled down into the story that i didn't want to turn it off. I even fell asleep listening to it last night and i haven't done that with any other audio book. He has that kind of soothing voice. Well done Jim SO WELL DONE! I'm not sure someone else could have pulled this book off. He was the perfect choice for this book!<br />Erin Morgenstern is an author to watch. Her story telling is phenomenal. It is so appropriately told for that time era. The dialogue is breathtaking as are the dreams that the story unfolds. I will be watching for other books by her and hope that her magic continues in other books. I hope to someday revisit Marco,Celia. Widget and Poppins and all the other characters of the circus. If the next book that revisits this circus, I would stand in the rain to get it.

I have to be honest about this last book \\"Forever\\". I waited for many months to get my hands on this final book. I must say, it was not what I was expecting. Don't get me wrong.It is a good book. The characters are the same ones that hold my heart captive. With a good strong storyline. I was just completely at the breaking point by the end of the book. I do not feel the ending is up to par with the rest of the series. Being the last book, I thought there would be more closure. In my opinion it just leaves you hanging with unanswered questions.

0670022411|3.0|I'll admit, I haven't finished the book.  I'm around halfway through, and just not sure if I'm interested enough to keep going.  I don't think the author is a horrible writer - she has some beautiful turns of phrases and some really good ideas.  The history she imbues into the novel is wonderful, as is the science.  But the exposition!  The story is humming along when we're dropped into a paragraphs long descriptions of how so-and-so met someone or how someone grew up.  Oftentimes the descriptions have no discernible relevance to the story at hand.  It drags down the story and weakens the characters.  I'd much rather see their backgrounds through dialogue or action.  Our pasts are what make us who we are, and a skilled writer shows the reader this instead of telling them.    The main character states at one point that she's no damsel in distress, but she doesn't take a lot into her own hands.  I'd be interested to see how she acts when she learns to control her power - is she more assertive, or does she still fade into the background?  I think the page said something about this being the author's debut novel.  I'll bet the next one is better, but I'm not finding myself engaged enough to finish this one.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|I'm not really writing about the movie.  I found it enjoyable and a good ending to the series.  I typically rent, but bought this after seeing it in the theaters.  Buyer beware.  Though I bought the movie because I like it, I typically only buy DVDs now with digital copies for my iphone or ipad.  If that is not available, then I rent it from wherever.    I would not have bought this knowing the \\"ultraviolet\\" digital copy process.  For some reason I assumed when I ordered that \\"ultraviolet\\" meant something else (why do I have to research an hour to find out about every media company's private, ham-handed attempt at protecting their copyright).  You will have to install Flixter Ultraviolet (Warner) software on your computer and watch the movie from a Flixter app on your iPhone.  Had I known this, I would only have rented this.  I will not buy an ultraviolet product no matter how much I like the movie.  I'm not telling you not to buy this, but be aware of the hoops you have to jump through to watch your \\"digital copy\\".  Personally, I support copyright and to some extent commiserate with the troubles piracy gives the industry and I am sympathetic to a point.  But I will not sacrifice privacy, bandwidth and convenience where only persons who are ripping off the industry can easily obtain a freely-distributable (illegal) copy of this movie and I have to sacrifice to get what I thought I bought.

(2) Now I have another place to search when I want to watch a movie  (3) In theory, the movie is downloading.  It is down to 1 hour, and lots of minutes, which appear to be wavering    up and down.  But it still says 0.0/2.0GB  (4) I doubt I will be able to watch this on my nice HDTV the way I can watch my other movies using my AppleTV.

B002JH3TW8|4.0|My newest Macbook Pro has the latest Firewire 800 inputs, rather than the old Firewire 400 inputs.  That's a good thing, because Firewire 800 is a lot faster.  It also means, however, that my old external hard drives and an older miniDV camera can't plug in directly.  This solves that problem.  I also like that it's flexible, putting some distance between the larger Firewire 400 input end and the smaller Firewire 800 input end.  That means a bit more space for the Ethernet cable I sometimes use, and doesn't crowd out the USB 2.0 inputs that I usually have an external hard drive or other accessory plugged into.  Nice and simple design makes this a convenient and esssential accessory for anyone who still has equipment that used to be compatible with the older Firewire inputs.

(Mister Class and Quality?), so you have to forget about the information on the screen comming from your cd player and enjoy as in the old vinyl times. So ferget about the time and soar yourserlf with this short but NEVER-ENDING IMAGINATIVE GREAT music.  Absolutely a MUST-HAVE for any prog lover.
0525423656|3.0|Overall, Crossed was a disappointment.  I found myself reading and at times being bored to tears.  The location of the heart of the story, Carvings, was just so boring...wish it could have taken place somewhere a little more exciting...I even thought that when I first opened the book and reviewed over the drawing/map. With that said it definitely kept my interest up enough to read the 3rd book in the series...but COME ON Fall of next year is FOREVER away....It better be better than Crossed and answer TONS of questions!!!

She finds herself on a plan from a business meeting that did not go so well, sitting next to a complete stranger when turbulence causes the passengers to believe that the plane will crash and she begins to spill all of her secrets to the handsome stranger in a desperate attempt to right all of her wrongs because she feels pretending is no longer an option if she is dying!!! She admits she doesn't love her boyfriend, the \\"Ken\\" to her Barbie, she complains about their sex life, his inability to make her sexually satisfied, her dislike in her coworkers, her dislike in some office procedures, etc. absoutely hysterical. Just her luck, they live and part ways to never see eachother again. The next day she discovers the handsome stranger is her handsome CEO of her company Jack Harper, and her whole world is turned upside down!!!

B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I can see how this novel was inspired by The Notebook, two teens experiencing a first love so strong that when reunited later in life it resurfaces, but I was just so disappointed in the outcome I was really just surprised that the author was Nicholas Sparks!! Maybe because I am just used to all of his best works having the happy ending, but I could not help it, I strongly disliked Amanda, the heroine in this story. I felt that Dawson deserved so much more and when I read the ending I was so unhappy!!! I can't really go into details without giving anything else away but I have to say, my strong dislike for Amanda just seemed to escalate as the story continued and I felt that in the end she walked away with more than she deserved!!! I do like Sparks' insight on long term relationships and his views on the spouse effected by addicted loved ones, it was very insightful and very emotional, but overall the book was just not that great!
B0009ELZAG|5.0|Brian Wilson once said of this album he wanted to write songs on \\"more than one level\\". And since the term \\"classic album\\" is often overdone and often used without care,Brian's own terms seem to define this album very much. And there are very few full lengh albums over the years that I can say exist on more than one level. The works of Marvin Gaye,Stevie Wonder and The Beatles come to mind. This is one of those records I can put on with absolutely no urge to skip over any songs. The key to the entire success of this album was arrangement. Inspired by the vocal harmonies of pop and doo-wop groups along with the wall of sound production of Phil Spector Wilson created this,which basically amounts to his debut solo album co-staring The Beach Boys on vocals and harmonizes. Aside from that Carl,Dennis,Mike and Al had precious little to do with the music on this album. That's where the name comes from. These were,in fact Brian's \\"pet sounds\\". Based on musical influences that impacted on him personally.<br /><br />  This album is home to some truly wonderful songs. Much heard and well known hits such as \\"Would'nt It Be Nice\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\" being among them. And interestingly enough if those songs excite and amaze you,than the rest of this album will be right up your alley. Much as The Beatles [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] was supposed to be (but which even John Lennon admitted it actually wasn't) this album is completely musically and thematically unified. This is not the work of an adolescent celebrating California surf culture. This is the work of a reflective and yearning 20 something who'd by this point already experienced physical abuse,mental illness and was now married with a baby on the way. Speaking for a generation obsessed with the eternal youth,this sets the record straight on that. On \\"I Know There's An Answer\\",\\"Caroline No\\",\\"Here Today\\" and beautifully chorded pieces such as \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\",\\"Don't Talk\\" and \\"That's Not Me\\" there's this prevailing sense that the singer-songwriter who once mused about the delights of being \\"in my room\\" now saw the music world as forcing him to pay a big price for non conformity.<br /><br />  Musically? Well on this you here an album that goes for redefining what rock and roll was. Rather than having a lot of distorted guitars in the mix,playing three noisy chords you have elaborate organ/piano/horn/rhythm based songs that are more about melody,harmonic and chordal invention that making noise and \\"rocking out\\". On the instrumental title track for example you realize this album has a lot more in common with types of Northern soul recordings from Dusty Springfield or Georgie Fame for example. It's not by any means a guitar rock album. Bands such as the High Llama's would later make music very much based on this sound. But it definitely extends off the Beach Boys surf sound into something that comes very directly from Brian Wilson's soul. He would in fact suffer something of an emotional breakdown whilst attempting to outdo himself with the follow up album to this. That also mixed with the fact the blood and sweat perfectionism Brian put into this product wasn't fully appreciated by every member of the Beach Boys. But that's another story.s Not Me\\" there's this prevailing sense that the singer-songwriter who once mused about the delights of being \\"in my room\\" now saw the music world as forcing him to pay a big price for non conformity.

B005J29HCQ|4.0|Most of us aware of Beach Boys history understand this album's recording in many ways represented the emotional undoing of Brian Wilson. This album has seen the light of day in different ways over the years in more ways than one. A lot of it ended up on a patch work re-cutting titled [[ASIN:B000002TR9 Smiley Smile]] and on other Beach Boys albums from the late 60's. It's also been the subject of some of the earliest pop music bootlegs up into the CD age and a live presentation released by Brian alone several years back. Obviously The Beatles monumental [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] kind of stole some wind from Brian while contemplating the release of this album,with it's rich tapestry of sound. But this as with his previous album Brian was focusing on something more unified. That tied with the fact the other members of The Beach Boys,Mike Love in particular were making their dissatisfaction over this new musical direction more vocal made for a maddening experience and Brian laid on this officially for years. Well he's finally come to some peace about it. So here it is-the legendary unfinished Brian Wilson/Beach Boys album. As much as there is to here.<br /><br />  There actually is a tad bit of false advertising here. In reality,the 'Smile' album never came even close to being completed in the same manner as [[ASIN:B00005ASHM Pet Sounds]]. The only songs that really were fully realized were numbers such as the more rocking \\"Heroes And Villians\\",\\"Cabin Essence\\"the epic \\"Surf's Up\\",\\"Vega-Tables\\" and the surprisingly bluesy \\"Do You Like Worms (Roll Plymouth Rock)\\". These lyrics are far more stream of consciousness and philosophical than anything on the previous album. Also the tapestry of sound is far darker. It's similar to the previous album but taken in of course a more psychedelic direction. \\"Our Prayer\\" is very beautiful-pure acapella vocal harmony with some of the most intelligent chords I've ever heard. \\"Wind Chimes\\" and \\"The Elements: Fire\\" are very brooding,cinematic psychedelic soul with absolutely no identification with surf music or The Beach Boys in any way. Of course there's \\"Good Vibrations\\",one of the most inventive,rhythmic pop/rock songs ever and one that hints at what this completed album could've been.<br /><br />  While you can here on some of the dialog and numbers such as \\"Child Is Father Of The Man\\",\\"Wonderful\\" and \\"Holidays\\" that some of these \\"pieces\\" had great potential beyond what they already are. The liner notes are also very informative as they showcase Brian not only coming to terms but knocking down some of the mythology surrounding this period of his career-that is the mid/late 60's. The brilliantly ideosyncratic music of Van Dyke Parks is also important to note here. As Wilson's musical collaborator for this project Park's bought in that personal and broad minded element that was just up Brian's alley. But he had no intention of being thought of as the man who broke up The Beach Boys,none of whom were lacking anything by way of talent I'll tell you. They just were very surprised by Brian's rather sudden shift in musical priorities. If things have gone down just a little differently. If the transition had been more gradual this might've been completed in it's day. In 1966-1967 MONTHS,not just years made a big differences. Changes,both cultural and creative were occurring almost too fast for the average human brain to comprehend. Even Brian,a man with an IQ beyond room temperature shows here there was some awkwardness for him keeping up with it all.

Viewers need to approach the film as its own entity, disregarding what they know about the \\"true\\" story, and instead accept the film as it should be, inspired by those true events. The highlight of the film is Jesse Eisenberg, the lynchpin in a weave of betrayals and successes, wrapped in a smart package by Fincher himself. The DVD will easily make the top 10 releases lists of 2011, with its quality approach to supplements and stellar A/V quality.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|Mark Romanek's long-awaited second feature is a bleak, overwhelming tragedy, but also rich and artful. Never Let Me Go combines the director's elegant visuals and a host of excellent performances to fully realize a trio of characters living in a beautiful, expansive world they're unable to fully embrace. I picked it as my number one film of 2010, and for the strengths of the movie alone, I wholeheartedly award it 5 stars.
0446573019|4.0|David Baldacci, an accomplished writer, has delivered another fast-moving, entertaining novel. Yes, there is an undeniable similarity to the Lee Child \\"Reacher\\" series - and Mr. Baldacci pulls it off quite well. I could not help but wonder if he had engaged in some collusion with Mr. Child before writing this book in preparation for a joint venture somewhere down the road - an exciting prospect: Jack Reacher meets John Puller in the alley behind a Chinese restaurant in Trail, British Columbia. But I digress.   My only problem with the book was the gratuitous, somewhat unrealistic, only partially believable pot shots taken at coal mining and coal mining executives. There may be some justification for that kind of propaganda in order to further the plot, but I don't see it. In any case, this propaganda attempts to make a case where accuracy and documentation are suspect, thus the missing fifth star. Still, this is fiction and remains a worthy read.

0553805371|4.0|As a non-scientist, one of the joys of reading Stephen Hawking, indeed the principal joy, is his unique ablity to write on complicated scientific subjects in laymen's terms which anyone of intelligence can understand. In this respect he reminds me of Bertrand Russell. Like Russell he elevates my intellect and makes me feel like I am much more intelligent than I really am.  In \\"The Grand Design\\" he does it again and I feel greatly edified by his treatment of both \\"determinism,\\" and the age of our universe. I feel like I have learned something new or, at least something I did not fully appreciate before.  He believes that human behavior is indeed determined by the laws of nature - i.e. determinism - but that the outcome is determined in such a complicated way and with so many variables, as to make it impossible in practice to predict. Since we cannot solve the questions that determine our behavior,  we use what is called an \\"effective theory\\" that people have free will. The study of our will and the behavior that arises from it, is the science of psychology. Economics is also an effective theory, based on the notion of free will plus the assumption that people evaluate their possible alternative course of action and choose the best. That effective theory is only moderately succcessful in predicting behavior because, as we all know, decisions are often not rational, or are based on a defective analysis of the consequences of the choice. That is why the world is in such a mess (and why there are Republicans.)  On the question of the age of the universe, it is obvious that for us to exist the universe must contain elements such as carbon which are produced by cooking lighter elements inside stars. The carbon must then be scattered through space in a supernova explosion, and eventually condense as part of a planet in a new-generation solar system. In 1961 physicist Robert Dicke argued that this process takes about 10 billion years. According to current data, the big bangoccurred 13.7 billion years ago.  In this book the authors quite clearly give us the latest cosmological thinking on the beginning and age of our universe, the Big Bang, General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and the ultimate theory of everything (if indeed one exists.) Their \\"candidate\\" for the latter is M-theory. I am not a physicist but I do not find their arguments for M-theory compelling. First of all they admit that M-theory \\"is not a theory in the usual sense but a whole family of different theories, each of which is a good description of observations only in some range a physical situations\\"; \\"No one seems to know what the M stands for\\"; and they conclude their book by stating: \\"if M-theory is confirmed, we will have found the grand design.\\" To me this seems too speculative and suggests that the only thing missing from their title was a question mark.
0307887898|3.0|\\"Now Moses wrote down the starting points of their journeys at the command of the LORD.\\" - Numbers 33:2 (NKJV)<br /><br />Having taught entrepreneurs for many years and studied many of the most successful ones, I am always struck by how differences in focus on learning seem to correlate with achieving more or less success. Those who believe that they just need to implement their business plan usually flop. Those, by contrast, who assume they don't know the \\"right\\" answer . . .but desperately want to find out . . . seem to do quite well.<br /><br />My favorite saying about entrepreneurs is that their first business model is their worst one. Fail quickly, often, and inexpensively in seeking a better business model, and you will eventually find a profitable business model and offerings.<br /><br />While this book covers lean operations as well as business model and offering development, I thought that its main value comes in the example of how a Web-based business should measure its performance and monitor how well potential improvements work out. If you have such a business, the book's contents are directly applicable by you.<br /><br />If you want to apply the book's lessons to a different kind of business, you'll find the information here to be more difficult to apply.<br /><br />I believe that this book will be most helpful to those who haven't tried to start a business before and are accustomed to making incremental improvements in existing, successful businesses.<br /><br />If you already understand the importance of measuring performance in creating trial, turning trial into regular purchases, and regular purchases into loyalty to a product or service, you will probably wonder what all the fuss is about. In that regard, pay attention to Mr. Ries' ideas about how minimal an offering you can put together to test.<br /><br />The book's biggest drawback is that Mr. Ries doesn't give very many clues about what to test if the current program isn't working. As such, his approach lacks enough depth to totally guide a startup to success.

0439023521|5.0|I avoided reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" for so long because I had no desire to get all wrapped up in another popular mainstream trilogy. However, I finally caved in to peer pressure from my friends, and also figured I'd better read the book now before the film adaptation that's due out next year spoils the story for me. Well, I started reading the book last night and I just finished it today. It was one of those fabulous books that captivated me from page one all the way to the end...and I cannot wait to start reading the second book in the trilogy as soon as I am done writing this review!<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is set in what used to be North America. The world has gone to total hell, and the country of Panem consists of a wealthy Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts, many of which are in extreme poverty. This is not a democracy by any sense of the imagination. People struggle for food and the barest of necessities, and worry about getting in trouble (or killed) by the government over the stupidest things. District 12 is an especially poor area, and sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen risks her life every day illegally hunting for food to feed her mother and her younger sister. However, nothing Katniss has ever faced prepares her for the horrors that the Hunger Games have in store for her. Each year, the Capitol draws two childrens' names from each of the twelve districts. These young people, ranging in age from twelve to eighteen, are forced to participate in the Hunger Games...an event billed as a sort of Olympics by the Capitol but really just consists of two dozen kids being thrown into a horrible set of circumstances and forced to kill each other. Unfortunately, Katniss gets to experience all of this firsthand, and this book tells her story.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down. It is absolutely fabulous...very suspenseful and exciting. I haven't been this wrapped up in a book in a long time, and now all I can think about are these characters and what's going to happen to them in the next installment of the series.<br /><br />One thing I will say is that although this is marketed as a book for young adults, it is SUPER intense and violent, so parents should definitely read it beforehand to see if it's suitable for their children. But, if your kid can handle the darker books in the Harry Potter series, they should have no problem with this.<br /><br />Bottom line: get this book! Immediately! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start reading \\"Catching Fire.\\"appen to them in the next installment of the series.

B004HO6I2E|1.0|Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds are perhaps two of the most enjoyable actors around. However, I could not have been more disappointed in a movie had I tried. I don't find the F bomb offensive if used for emphasis, however, in this movie, it is used constantly and in the presence of small children. In fact, it is the first word spoken in the movie. This is not funny and not humor. The porno scene with Reynolds was simply foul. One of the reasons why I was so offended is that these two actors don't carry off this behavior. I truly enjoy when an actor tasks a risk but this was the wrong risk for these two actors. The film stinks.

0307878937|4.0|The Language of Flowers tells the story of  Victoria Jones, who by the age of nine had lived in over thirty different foster homes.  She's described as \\"detached and quick-tempered\\", but because of her experiences within the foster care system, she is just mistrustful of everyone she meets and thus prefers to be alone.  At the age of eighteen she is \\"emancipated\\", (pushed out) of the foster care system to fend for herself.  With no place to go, she sleeps in parks at night and even plants a small garden for herself there. By day she lives, lives on the streets and finishes the leftover food left by people in restaurants.<br /><br />She manages to find a job in a local flower shop where her talent quickly really shines through. She is perfect selected just the right flower for the customers depending on various situations, and her ability has the capacity of changing lives for some. One vendor of the flower shop, gets Victoria to confront the painful experiences of her past. The Victorian language of flowers is used to convey meaning of various flowers, and through flowers Victoria is able to communicate her feelings and what others are feeling as well.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers was a very good debut novel. Victoria was one of those characters that you couldn't help rooting for. I found myself hoping her adult life would make up for her lousy childhood. I liked the short chapters which alternated from the past to the present.  It was easy to get wrapped up in her story, and it was easy to see why she was so afraid to trust and experience love for the fear of being abandoned or hurt once again.  I did find parts of the story to be a bit contrived and after a while all on the constant references to flowers and their meanings became a bit much for me.<br /><br />Readers who enjoy stories with the power to transform lives and stories of second chances will most likely enjoy this novel. I read both the eBook and the audio version, which was read by Tara Sands who did a great job.

Things changed when I went to Sting's concert and they were selling these CDs signed by maestro himself. Being a very long time fan I could not resist and bought a copy. On my way home I popped it in the CD player and I could not believe my ears. \\"If You Love Somebody\\" alone is worth the price of admission, with or without the signature. Every single song on this collection is remixed to the point it sounds fresh but still trustful to the original. I loved the new sound so much I bought the 31 song double edition of this album - [[ASIN:B005NFHPAK Best of 25 Years the]]. Can't wait for the original albums to be re-released with the new mixed sounds - guess will have to buy them all again. Oh, by the way, I own Mobile Fidelity copies (CDs) of the \\"Dream of..\\" and \\"Nothing Like..\\" - new remixes beat the MoFi versions any time. Highly recommended even if you have the songs. P.S. Message In The Bottle live sounds absolutely gorgeous on that CD.

B0059R5Q08|5.0|Most of us know the story of Jane Eyre, know of the characters. This adaptation presented them in a new way through the great use of incredibly gorgeous and poetic (art)direction, not to mention exquisite acting. Mia W excellently portrays through inspired facial expression, body language, and chemistry, the strength and resolve of Jane including all Jane has overcome; in every scene. Michael F is an unusually electric Rochester and brings an energy and charisma often overlooked in the screen experience. In other adaptations I often struggled to identify precisely that thing which made Jane and Rochester click in terms of that kind of chemistry which is undeniable and that they would be powerless to. Mia and Michael have it: their Jane and Rochester convince in a beautifully aching way. Beautiful to look at, hard to ignore, this adaptation would make a worthy gift for a Bronte fan. I'm going to buy it on DVD which I rarely do anymore. Worth it.
0062011847|5.0|Vime's is by far one of my favorite characters of the books - his character is so rich! (And I'm not talking about money!) But in this story Vimes realizes just how RICH he is - in more ways than just shiney gold. A real page turner! Great action, great story - Pratchett is always a winner!
1451627289|5.0|Years ago when I worked the night shift, as tired as I was when I got home I always took the time to read at least 50 pages of the Stephen King book I was currently reading.  Then, for some reason I lost interest in the books.  Well, I do believe that this is what I have been looking for.  The \\"old\\" Stephen King.  I can not put it down and I am lovin every minute of reading it.  LT
0767802470|5.0|Well Done!<br /><br />This film is about the moment of change in the Battle  of the Atlantic, from easy kills for U-Boats to heavily guarded convoys. This is a journey into the madness of war.<br /><br />The movie opens with the crew of U-97 on shore liberty in occupied France. While the drinking is at a height, we get to know the crew members and notice that the captain is only thirty years old. The others look like children.<br /><br />A war correspondent joins the patrol and is told not to photograph the crew until time has allowed them to grow beards. \\"We don't want Churchill to know that he is being beaten by children,\\" says the captain. But the moment of truth is at hand.<br /><br />This work is well done. After the time of shore liberty, the filming is entirely in or on the submarine. The sounds and odors become real; the close living quarters are everywhere.<br /><br />Well worth the price.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|>>> This review is for the Extended Edition on DVD >>><br /><br />King Kong has long been a favourite. We've seen quite a few films (at various degrees of acclaim), novels, cartoons, toys, et al. Peter Jackson's epic manages not only to show Kong's sheer power, but a wide range of emotion as well. Anyone out there a fan of Beauty and the Beast stories? Well, they don't get much better than this.<br /><br />This cut of the film is 201 minutes long, worthy of the mighty Kong himself. At over six hours, there's a mighty serving of behind the scenes and audio commentary, nearly forty minutes of deleted scenes, outtakes (my favourite), and a great deal more. The picture is amazing on DVD even when played on a PS3 and 47\\" Vizio. The list of subtitles are pretty weak, and the soundtrack is a 5.1; here's hoping the BD version is better off.<br /><br />If you are fence sitting about switching to BD, you might want to hold off before taking the plunge, especially if you are interested in special features. The film quality stand on its own.
1416550550|5.0|Dear future Forgotten Garden lovers,  Many of the reviews posted include the summary, and for that reason I will not.    Instead, I'll promote this book by things that I found contradicted its wonderful content.  1. Don't be daunted by the books size.  Although it is a massive novel, I assure you that you'll be through it quickly.  It reminded me of those wonderful, magical fairly tales I'd read as a child, and after reading The Forgotten Garden I felt that I hadn't read a book as fulfilling in a long time.  2. Don't be turned off by its cover.  Despite its less than appealing cover, this is not a terrible romance novel.  As I read it I learned to ignore the strangely fake graphics, and believe me, the contents of the book far outweigh them.  3. Don't be put off by the title.  The Forgotten Garden?  Really?  Very unoriginal, I know.  As a wonderful book, it most definitely deserves an equally perfect name.  And finally:  Don't not read The Forgotten Garden.

B0051OZ564|2.0|It's a cross between 'Girl Interrupted' and a graphic video game, with altered layers of reality and hyper-sexed versions of the costumes from 'Chicago.' In short, it's a mess. There is an undercurrent of entertainment running through it, but it doesn't quite add up to an entertaining movie. Zach Snyder has an immense talent for creating stylized and gorgeous films; it's just a shame he put his talent to use making a movie like this. Hollywood needs to cancel his blank check and reel him in.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|The movie is great.  What isn't great is having to jump through hoops for a digital copy that supposedly can be downloaded and will work on devices such as my iPad.  If Ultraviolet is the future of digital copy, then I hope I can live in the past.  Streaming does me no good on a plane.  Having to create TWO accounts (one for flixster and one for ultraviolet) that I don't want to create when I've never had to have them in the past to get my digital copies stinks.  Having to download a crap Adobe Air app to my computer that doesn't even show me the movie I just bought because I can't download a copy until December 20th is garbage.   In short, forget the digital copy.  It's worthless.  There might as well not be one for this movie.  Do yourself a favor and just get the standard blu-ray.
B003SI605K|5.0|The Joy Luck Club is haunting in its fearlessness. I got angry, disgusted, appalled, and hurt along with each and every twist and turn of each grandmother, mother, and daughter.

I don't know what happened to real rock and roll like Creedence and Skynnrd.  This guy sounds like he passed out under a drunk piano.  Real musicians like Keith Richards and Rod Stewart would be rolling in their graves.

B005H9B2CE|3.0|While it's not a Marvel property I find particularly interesting, it made for a decent summer flick. The real story here is the emergence of Chris Hemsworth, who has joined the ranks of the stars who can carry a big summer blockbuster, a fairly exclusive club.
B005SV9X22|3.0|I saw The Monster Ball live and was disappointed I didn't have HBO to watch it again, but thankfully someone recorded it for me. I was disappointed it didn't fully capture the opening sequence, which I felt was one of the better concert openings I'd ever seen. I liked the below stage cuts but felt they took away from the onstage spectacle. I'd have preferred they'd been kept as a bonus feature. Maybe the DVD/Blu-Ray will be different. And I enjoy Gaga's music and her passion but sometimes she gets too \\"preachy\\" for her causes. I wasn't paying to listen to a sermon, I wanted to see her perform. She can be an activist all she wants on her own time, and I'd wholeheartedly support her there. Bottom line, the DVD/Blu-Ray will be well worth it, I don't doubt, but I'd probably skip over her speeches.
0262731541|1.0|This book has unusual provenance.  According to its author it originated in the work of a colleague, Frank R. Whitt.  Wilson claims that Whitt abandoned the manuscript and charged him to see it through to publication.  The first edition was credited to Whitt and Wilson, so we must accept Wilson's word for this.<br /><br />This edition, the third, was, again according to Wilson, originally to have been produced with another author, Jim Papadopoulos, who allegedly withdrew by reason of other interests.  He has been recognized, however, for \\"contributions.\\"  (See the review above by Papadopoulos for further information.)<br /><br />I find these representations about Whitt and Papadopoulos troubling.  I have read an authoritative technical article on the subject of steering, handling, stability of bicycles by Papadopoulos; his work is the best part of the third edition of Bicycling Science.<br /><br />More troubling is appellation of the word \\"science:\\" Wilson is an engineer; I am a physicist; I see little that is scientific.  It is a review or a tutorial, recapitulation of the work of others, with extensive bibliographic references.  Such is ethically permissible, so long as the originators of the content are acknowledged, and Wilson cannot be faulted on that score.<br /><br />But there is a plethora of inadequacies and outright mistakes too.  For example, Wilson deals with frames as if they were triangulated trusses with pinned joints, when in fact they are exactly the opposite, rigid frames, with maximal forces at the joints.  Butted tubing and lugs recognize this by placing most material at the joints; greater cross-sections there compensate for larger forces and so keep stresses within elastic limits.  This is why carbon-fiber frames also have bulky joints; design and size of joints is indicative of the properties of frame materials.  Almost everything in this chapter is misleading or wrong, typical of nearly the entire book.<br /><br />I suspect that most of whatis right in \\"Bicycling Science\\" is the work of Whitt and Papadopoulos.  In short, \\"Bicycling Science,\\" with David Gordon Wilson as author, is tendentious, sophistic, superficial, spurious, ephemeral.  It contains precious little engineering and no useful science.<br /><br />Do not buy it.  Buy \\"Bicycle Design\\" by Mike Burrows instead; it contains ten times the useful information in one-third the pages without errors.  Burrows has designed and built ingenious bicycles that actually work, many of which have been proven competitively, technically, commercially, so he knows what is right and what is wrong, what works and what does not.<br /><br />Also the title is ungrammatical: \\"Science\\" does not engage in \\"Bicycling.\\"  Sloppy usage.  Typical and indicative.
0984380213|5.0|This book is *not* about selling snow to eskimos, and not particularly for the sales person on the ground.  It's about systematically getting your company's awesome product/service in front of the right people who should buy it, in a way that makes them feel like an empowered buyer, not someone being sold to.  Aaron talks about how to get them using your product/service so they dont have buyers regret.  This book is personable, and a pleasure to read.  It's for CEOs and VP Sales types, or for people who want to take that much higher paying job (not just meet their quota).   For me personally, it's already paid for itself many times over, helping me design my next outreach campaign with less mistakes (I'm the CEO of an enterprise software startup).  Buy this book now, for yourself, and for your VP Sales.  - Ken Lynch  CEO of reciprocitynow.com
B005KCGIUY|5.0|I think Conditions of My Parole was my most anticipated release this year. It was a curious album that was in the back of my mind constantly. After hearing Man Overboard, I was a little concerned because I felt that it was a little to straight forward. I really like that song and like many people here are saying all the songs on here are favorites they just change based on your mood. But, yeah I wasn't quite sold. Then I heard the teases they released here on amazon and thought, WOW, it is so layered and deep and varied! I couldn't contain my excitement! Then they streamed the whole album on Spin and I couldn't stop listening to the album. I had to keep listening to every track, from start to finish over and over. It had it's hooks in me.<br /><br />Conditions of My Parole is much like Maynard James Keenan has said it is, like Twin Peaks, in the desert. Anyone who has every seen Twin Peaks will get the refference instantly. The OST to that series is deep and moody, slow blues and mystery. Murder, occultism, and shameless affairs abound. I think that this new album does retain some of that feel, only with a sort of backwards Jerome hill billy sort of way. Tracks flow seamlessly between eachother, and there are huge peaks and gaping valleys to be discovered here. I love all the tracks here but the major standout tracks would be: Tiny Monsters, The Valley, Man Overboard, Horizons, Monsoons, Conditions of My Parole, and Oceans. But there really isn't a bad track on the album. Also, Carina Round is amazing, simply amazing on this album, her duets are beautiful and perfect. If I had to site one criticism it would have to be The Weaver, it just feels thrown together, and lacking any sort of direction. I know a lot of people who consider that their favorite track, but I just don't get it, and it grates on my after a bit. But, that is it, the album is a perfect album for a autumn drive through the mountains, or road tripping across the desert. If you're a fan of independant music, a fan of anything MJK, you'll probably love this. For the doubters, give it time. I believe this one is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Also, I saw them live last Wednesday Nov 9th in SLC, and they put on a fantastic show, most of the set was from Conditions of My Parole, but they did throw in Queen B, Rev 22:20 (sung alone by Carina Round I should add, it was fantastic!!)Polar Bear, V*g*na Mine, Sour Grapes, and a handfull of other classic tracks, sadly no The Mission though, I was really hoping for that one live. :( Something I found interesting, you know how on the track Conditions of My Parole where he says \\"Sweet jesus don't let the judge release me, what if she's a zombie or a dracula and tries to bleepin' eat me..\\" Well he edits himself in concert too, what is up with that? I'm really curious as to why he did that. Anyways, it was my second time seeing Puscifer and just as good if not better than the first time. Carina Round was an amazing opener, she pretty much stole the show, seriously, if you dig her vox, please do yourself a favor and pick up her Things You Should Know EP here on Amazon.<br /><br />That's about it, keep supporting indie music!<br /><br />Peace,<br />Dal.music, a fan of anything MJK, you'll probably love this.

B0053ZOQMK|3.0|Marketing aside, 'Rango' is not a movie for kids.  But that doesn't mean it's not a good movie.  It's an original and clever take on the western with some serious craziness along the way.  Along with a great score, the visuals are stunning.  I found myself thinking that this was one of the best new westerns I've seen in a while.  Sometimes it falls a little short of its intended goal, but it comes close enough to be very entertaining.
0062112430|5.0|5 out of 5 gnomes<br /><br />Oh Delerium how I love thee, let me count the ways.  I thought I knew the twists and turns that you would take but I was so very wrong.  You're quotably quotable and have lines of real beauty.  Your concept really makes one think about what they would do in that situation.  And your ending, wow it surely went down a path that I did not foresee.<br /><br />As you can no doubt see, I really love this book and cannot wait until I get to read the next book in this series.  I can't believe that it took me this long to read it, that'll teach me to actually read books in my To Be Read pile more often.<br /><br />Lena lives in a world that has deemed love a disease and love is like the worst kind of curse word.  In this place Romeo and Juliet is seen as a cautionary tale.  At the age of eighteen you are given the cure, which sounds like a lobotomy of some kind.  Everything is orderly and safe in this world, at least that's how it appears at first.  You are tested which determines if you'll go to college and matched with 4 potential mates.  So you pick one of the four and they take that into mind and try to match whoever would work best together.  After the cure you just kind of glide through life always happy, just looking ahead and barely remembering the past.<br /><br />Lena is a great character because of how much she learns and changes through the story.  She's the kind of character that you'll find yourself eagerly following her path and wondering what could happen to her next.  Since her family has been known in the past to have contracted the delira aka the disease of love she is happy to be cured and thinks that once she has the cure that it'll fix all of her problems.  She's the kind of character that yearns to be normal.  Then she finds out just how not normal her everyday life is.<br /><br />The story goes in many interesting directions.  It shows an example of extreme isolationism in a county that sounds scary yet oddly feasible.  It shows the effects that rebelling against the norm can have and how far people are willing to go to fight back.<br /><br />There are some fantastic relationships shown in the book.  There's the cold relationship between her and her aunt and uncle.  The relationship between her and her best friend Hana shows how much a friendship and people can change yet remain the same (good qualities and all).  There's also her cousin Gracie who has never spoken to anyone but Lena but seems to watch everything.  Gracie is one of those characters that I think could be very important in future books.  Then of course there's Alex who becomes an extremely important person to Lena and literally changes the course of her life.<br /><br />At the end, which I read while working, I totally had a wow don't mind the teary-eyed librarian moment.  Not a lot of books get me emotional but WAM this book just takes aim and skews all the expectations you may have.

0062101897|5.0|I snapped this book up hungrily, and I have yet to put it down. It's s a unique look inside the process of making the most imaginative and fantastic movies that have ever graced the silver screen. I loved how easily accessible the sections were, the different sketches, the pictures, the words from the entire creative team, it's a fabulous journey inside the creative process of all departments involved in the making of the films. It's an all-around amazing book, very proudly sitting on my coffee table now, right next to my special edition Tales of Beedle the Bard!

B002ZG99N6|3.0|Solid heist flick from Ben Affleck with a number of good performances, not the least of which is Affleck himself. There's some good action here, but the focus is on the relationships and characters. That's not to say it's slow; far from it. It's worth checking out for its uniquely Bostonian take on the genre. Affleck as director is no gimmick, this guy is pretty good.

0312330537|5.0|This book is more than a well written and captivating story. Shantaram so impressed me that I found myself frequently pausing to contemplate the poetic descriptions and associations which resulted with a smile at the eloquent writing style used by the author. Without straying from the story the author fills this book with his thoughtful perspective and helps us to understand many of the cultural complexities of life in India.  Shantaram will lead you through a full gamut of emotions again and again. It will cause you to contemplate various concepts of philosophy, logic and compassion, and inspires you to compare your own reasoning to that which is found in India with its incredible cultural diversity. The author, Gregory David Roberts, in my opinion is a truly great writer and I highly recommend this book.
0525423656|2.0|I loved Matched for it's engaging characters, it's tender romance and the fact that it didn't rely so much on the violence that is so prevalent in other dystopian novels.  Unfortunately, the very things that made me love Matched were delivered two fold in Crossed and so overwhelmed the story that it was simply not enjoyable.  The plot is what suffered in this middle book of the trilogy, with entirely too much time spent on philosophical, overly dramatic musings on past events, with little attention paid to actually moving the story along.<br /><br />The author makes some efforts to continue to inject some romantic tension into the story, but it seems token at best.  In Matched, this generated most of the suspense of the novel, and without it here, the plot seems to meander along aimlessly.  This was not a compelling read, and I find myself not caring very much about what happens to Cassia and Ky. The book is told in alternating perspectives between the two, and their voices were so without character or depth that I often had a hard time remembering who was speaking.  There's not much world building going on in this installment, and few surprises.  A bit more action was needed and a bit less \\"navel gazing\\".  I hope the author is able to produce a story line that is a bit more dynamic to wrap up this trilogy.  It certainly has potential.

B000GPIPSS|4.0|Dracula(released Feb/31)stars now legendary Bela Lugosi as The Count himself.At the time Lugosi,a hit on the Great White Way with the show of the same name,was not even in the running for the part of Dracula as far as director Browning was concerned.Lon Chaney was originally pegged as the lead but he succumbed to throat cancer long before they could even think of putting the film into the can.They started auditioning many other stars at the time but through happenstance Lugosi and company happened to be on tour with the show in tinseltown and he auditioned for the part,eventually getting it.And the rest is show biz history.<br />The well known plot is loosely based on the Bram Stoker novel Nosferatu.The original silent version by Murnau was an unauthorized version and the Stoker estate successfully sued him and had all existing prints destroyed(thank goodness for collectors even then!).Universal obtained the rights to the novel legally to avoid a nasty lawsuit.Browning was not a happy camper during this shoot,speculation being that he didn't get the leading man and good friend he wanted and missed.The lead cameraman Freund was apparently the one who shot a good portion of the film in Brownings frequent absences;though the credits do not give that impression.<br />The story here is part Stoker,part Broadway play and part made up.A lawyer has come from Britain to get the good Count Dracula to sign a lease to stay at an old Abbey in London.Renfield(Dwight Frye)travelling in stagecoach has to make a forced stop at a local tavern.The locals upon learning of his destination implore him not to go at night,but instead during the day,but he rebuffs all offers.As he leaves a woman gives him a crucifix,and as the coach leaves for the Count's castle,the people can be seen crossing themselves and feeling much sorrow for someone they probably will never see again.<br />At castle Renfield is greeted cordially by the Count but something is definitely not kosher here.You can see the inner conflict the lawyer has as he is nervous on the one hand,but does not want the Count to see it on the other.After a dinner it is off to bed.During the night the Count flies into Renfields room as a bat,changes back to human and proceeds to bite his neck.Renfield is now a slave to the Count.<br />It`s a long and stormy voyage back to England and the Count gets the munchies.He kills the entire crew and upon arrival the only one seemingly alive is Renfield who,appearing quite mad,is taken and institutionalized.Dracula sets up shop in the Abbey he leased and some nights later he runs into a Dr Seward(at an opera)who runs the sanitarium Renfield is in, and who happens to live next door to the Count.One of the lady guests there that night gets bitten by the count as she lay in bed and dies the next day.<br />Professor Van Helsing,who also works at the Sanitarium,takes a great interest in Renfields increasingly strange behavior.During one of Renfields rants Van Helsing pulls out some wolf bane and Renfield withdraws away.Increasing Van Helsings suspicions as to what is taking place,during a meeting with the Count he pulls out a cigarette case with a mirror and happens to notice the Count has no reflection.When he shows the count the mirror the Count smashes it,makes some apologies and leaves for the night.<br />The Count by now has Sewards daughter in his power and every precaution that Van Helsing takes to protect her fails.There is a brief confrontation between Dracula and Van Helsing and the professor doesn`t mince his words.Dracula tries unsuccessfully to hypnotize Van Helsing eventually flees.<br />The professor and Sewards daughters boyfriend both converge on the Abbey loaded for bear.Renfield appears and Dracula kills him thinking he has betrayed him.Dracula withdraws to his coffin and while the boyfriend looks for his girl,Van Helsing,having found the coffin,drives a stake into Draculas heart.This breaks the spell and the girl comes back to her boyfriend.<br/>The film does show its age both film-wise and in exection.This was 1931 and sound was barely three years in the mainstream at this time.In fact many theaters were yet to be wired for sound pictures and it shows its`silent film roots in this film with the intertitles,the soundtrack(or lack thereof),the sometimes stiff acting and those big closeups for dramatic effect.But this was still common in this period of time and it could either work for you or against you.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp but it does show many film defects,quite normal for a film of this age.There are two discs here,one with the original film and the other with the still existing Spanish version.You will find commentary on the film,three nice featurettes,optional interactive pop up factoids and also an optional but beautiful score by Phillip Glass,commissioned in 1999.It fits fantastically with the film and I recommend you turning on this option at least once to see for yourself.The only glitch I can tell you about is in regards to the packaging itself.The two discs sit in two plastic holders.You open this set up like a book and each holder is on either``page``.However the holder for the first disc,in my set,has come away from the underlining already!The only thing stopping the holders from dropping out of the set box completely

B005LJK3AC|1.0|I love a good comedy, unfortunely this was not one of them.  I'm mad that I kept watching after the first 30 minutes when my instinct told me to turn it off.  Save yourself, you'd be better off taking a nap for a few hours.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Great Item and exactly as described, my only issue with this item is that it was not produced with DVD copies of the movies as well or at least a digital copy.  Not once has the entire set been released on DVD, shame on Lucas Films...

B0052REUW0|4.0|\\"Violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence.\\" (Location 128)<br /><br />This is, perhaps, the primary sentiment of this latest work by Prof. Steven Pinker.  And for all my reservations with his ideology (progressivism) and his lack of critique surrounding statistical analyses I cannot help but feel this is a brilliant, insightful, and profoundly optimistic book.  Optimism is something which has been, intellectually, in short supply for a great many decades. Though this seems odd because between the Long Peace (since the end of the second world war) and the New Peace (the end of the cold war) this is something we should all be feeling about our collective future.  However, pessimism seems to be the general sentiment: from Climate Change to the geopolitics of China and India.<br /><br />Back to The Better Angels of Our Nature.  The book is not without its faults<br /><br />-An out of control Progressivist ideology<br />-Feminization theories which are deeply suspicious<br />-Left Wing political agenda...as read by Americans<br />-A mostly uncritical attitude to statistical analyses (some is suggested but mostly as a sop)<br />-The inherent `squishiness' of the Social Sciences<br />-An aggressive atheism which discounts all the positives attributes of Religion in favour of Old Testament blood thirsty hyperbole (and some from the New Testament). Personal note: I'm an atheist.<br />-A rather hostile discounting of conservatives and conservatism (again, American in perspective): see page 662 and following for a sample of this.  Note: I read the Kindle Edition on my iPad.<br /><br />For all of the above weaknesses and others, this is still a timely, important, concise, and articulate piece of optimism...with provisos (Pinker's not mine).<br /><br />Perhaps some of Prof. Pinker's most interesting observations are why he believes the world remains pessimistic about violence.  One of my favourites is why the world, generally, feels violence is getting worse when it is actually declining:<br /><br />\\"The decline of violent behaviour has been paralleled by a decline in the attitudes that tolerate or glorify violence, and often the attitudes are in the lead.\\"  p. 155<br /><br />Our tolerance for violence appears to have fallen faster than violence actually has.  This, perhaps, could force a greater decline in violence or it could have unforeseen negative consequences.  At the moment this remains uncertain...to my way of thinking.<br /><br />This is a book which deserves several book length reviews and much closer analysis than I have given it here but it is brilliant and articulate while occasionally slipping into arrogance and ideological myopia (see progressivism and atheism amongst others).<br /><br />I did not give this book a full 5 stars because of the problems I have cited above, but it is a brilliant and important work that is both accessible and comprehensive (if the reader is willing to put in a little time).<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br />Addendum<br /><br />There are two other reasons I only gave this book 4 stars and that has to do with the book's formatting.  1) References/End-notes are not activated 2)The index is not activated either.  These are two very serious problems for readers of the e-Editions of this book.  Some may feel this is not the place for this criticism but I would, respectfully, disagree because it makes looking up sources, so that I may engage more fully with the text, laborious, time consuming and uncertain.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I especially appreciated that the little boy in this movie is portrayed as such a responsible, kind, good kid.  The movie and its music are beautiful.
B003L20ICE|5.0|The Kids Are All Right is a brilliant film. The acting is all Oscar worthy, the story is well told, engaging and interesting, and the music is also is really good. It's a very entertaining movie, and it has a little bit of comedy, romance and drama, all of which feel genuine. The Kids Are All Right is definitely worth a watch, I've seen it twice already and own it on DVD. This is a film that is mandatory, check it out.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|I was born too late for The Beach Boys. My early impressions were of those poppy songs recycled into commercials and movies. This was , ultimately, to my advantage. Because when I \\"discovered\\" their best music I was already in my 20's. I played Pet Sounds until the writing was erased from the tape and worked my through Friends, 20/20, and Sunflower. In the meantime, I had found a great many contemporary bands, of my own generation, that I fell for and listened to for a while. Always, though, I returned to The Beach Boys. As I got older ( I am in my 30's now) I began to realize the scope of their influence and appreciate their music on a deeper level. I have had a loose way of defining what is genius over the years. I think it is a term that has been tossed around with far too much generosity and, ultimately, only ever applies to a few people. It goes like this : if the work appeals to children on a gut level and can also satisfy the most knowledgable critic on an intellectual level it is probably brilliant. That is what this album pulls off. Beyond that- it is sad, funny, beautiful, and complex all at different moments and the same time. It is, like other classical works, a musical composition that demands your attention and rewards the person who is willing to engage with it. It is, in short, one of the best rock albums I have ever heard. If you grew up in the 80's like me and love music give this one a chance. Forget everything you think you have ever known about this band and just push play.
B005AUWY90|3.0|From reading some of the reviews here, there is almost joy in condemning Cars 2 as not up to the impressive standard of previous Pixar films.  I think it is troubling to see the trend for people to take some much joy in seeing something fail.  Well Cars 2 isn't really a failure.  If anything, it is as good a sequel as could be expected.  The original Cars was arguably the weakest Pixar film before this one.  There is something about the concept itself not as sustainable for a full length story as talking ants, furry monsters or old toys.  Despite an incredible attention to detail and excellent work by animators, anthropomorphic automobiles for some reason just aren't that interesting to me.  This coming from a former career BMW mechanic. The in-jokes are all quite clever, but we're talking more smirk clever than laugh out loud. (Though David Hobbs popping up as a race announcer is a really nice touch.)  What Pixar has tried to do with this sequel is tap into the \\"Incredibles\\" style James Bond atmosphere and blend it with a \\"vehicle\\" for Mater.  The problems are multi-fold.  Michael Caine can only do so much and just isn't enough because there isn't enough jokes to keep Mater rolling. The Japanese toilet jokes are, however, hilarious and quite accurate if you have ever been there.  When you look at the plot, there is enough to go around for at least three movies and none of the ideas are completely developed.  That said, Cars 2 is not a failure or a bomb - it made $550 million dollars at the box office - but it is just a bit more episodic than the more thoughtful stories in other Pixar movies.  In the end, I think it is a more ambitious movie than the first Cars, but not any more entertaining.    It is a tall task to compete with aliens, robots, monsters, insects, toys or superheroes.  Cars 2 is entertaining, but when you start with a flat note, it's tough to really make it sing.
B0057O6IDW|5.0|Most people who would be interested in this blu-ray have probably already seen this movie and have their own opinion about it, so this review is going to be strictly about the quality of the blu-ray remaster.  I was skeptical about spending any money on another Blue Underground blu-ray after I got burned on their City of the Living Dead disc - For all of the rave reviews it got, I thought that was one of the worst transfers I have seen.    This disc though, is probably one of the best remasters I have seen yet.  If you have ever seen this movie on VHS or DVD, you will not believe the quality of the image on this disc - The picture is near perfect throughout the entire film!  It probably never looked this good at the theater.  I could not believe the level of detail, the color and the sharpness of the image.  The sound is excellent too.   To really push this one over the edge,  there are also a number of great extras including several cast interviews, and a talk with the effects guys.  Blue Underground has done an incredible job on this one, and restored my faith in their product - I can't wait to see what they have done with Fulci's Zombie..  I completely recommend this purchase to anyone who is a fan of this movie - you can pretty much throw away any previous version once you get this.
B000AGTPUK|1.0|This movie is terrible. I hate it with a great passion. There is no film that will ever rival the awfulness of this horrendous and twisted piece of crap.

The Polar Express is a product of the devil.

B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park is nothing short of genius. Everything about this movie is phenomenal. The acting, effects, story, suspense, everything. It's just a perfect film in EVERY sense. It's a very underrated film, but in truth it's six-hundred times better than the overrated Jaws. Also the score by the maestro John Williams is one of the best every composed. Nothing I say can do this masterpiece justice, so i'll just say this: Jurassic Park is definitely one of the top 5 best movies ever made, a true masterpiece of cinema.

B005MSD75U|3.0|I watched this movie from one of the reviews listed. They said it was clean and fun, for the whole family.  If you are a conservative Christian you may not enjoy this movie. The summary of the movie is a man that works at a zoo and the animals talk to him and coach him on how to win a woman's heart.  A wolf teaches him to urinate on his territory, a bear teaches him to show his \\"pudding cup\\", his groin.  The gorilla seem to be the only animal who had wisdom.  I didn't enjoy this film because I'm tired of this generation that thinks the only premise of a movie is sexual undertones in a rated PG or PG-13 and sadly some G rated.  I feel the movie industry has truly lost their ability to produce family films. They forgot what righteousness is.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|The story has so many wonderful elements. The characters are well developed, the leading man is a character you'll wish were real (I'm still hoping he is), and there are breathtaking, beautiful scenes that will have you soaring in the sky...at least literally for the characters.  Don't be put off by the elements of bondage or S&M because it's not what the book (or trilogy) is about.  It's in there more for shock and awe, but it's not truly in that genre.  It's so much...\\"More\\" (and you'll know what I'm referring to after you read it.)   My advice: Start with the first book, Fifty Shades of Grey, and just keep reading and you'll find that it will not disappoint.  On the contrary, if you love a great layered story with intriguing hot intimate scenes, secret pasts, ex-lovers, blackmail, masquerade balls, and let's not forget extravagant billionaires, you'll love the Fifty Shades trilogy.  I read the first two books in 3 days and almost shed a tear to know the third installment is not expected until 01.19.12...I want more Grey NOW!!!

B00536OCZA|1.0|When one plunks down 30+ dollars for an audiophile 180g pressing of an album, one expects to get a really good product. I opened mine, took it out of the sleeve and came to a screeching halt. The disc looked like it had been used as a door stop. There were scratches, imperfections and generally unbuffable blemishes on the surface of the disc. I wish I could find someone to complain to about this. I notice that some people haven't had any problems with their copies, but I couldn't even bring myself to attempt playing it on my turntable, because that would have just angered me even more. EMI (or whoever pressed this garbage), you are the suck.
B004EPYZT4|3.0|Now we all remember the old Conan series with Arnold as Conan. But thankfully hollywood picked out and ACTOR to play Conan instead of just having a super buff guy ripping people in half.  The story was great,although it seemed a little fast paced, and had alot of actiony goodness.  The only downfall tothis movie was the ,clearly visible, anti-climactic ending.  I was so syked about being able to see this movie in theaters right up until that last scene were everything just fell apart. To be honest the main reason I originally wanted to see this moviee was for Ron Perlman. He didnt get as much screen time as i hoped but i was glad he was there nonetheless.  This movie is for fans of all genres.  Just try to ignore the ending and you have yourself a blockbuster hit.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I am bias...love Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and director.<br /><br />Gran Torino touches on the sensitive subject of prejudice.  The movie is so well done I got the feeling I was a fly on the wall watching real-life change happen in a neighborhood in transition...from working blue collar white america to mixed races with a growing gang violence influence.<br /><br />I have grown up in a very safe protective community...and is hard to imagine hoods like the one shown in this movie, but I know they exist.  The ending of this movie is realistic and a bit shocking.<br /><br />I really enjoy this movie.  The pace is perfect...allowing enough time to really get to know Clints character.<br /><br />Hope this review helps.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|If I'd known this was going to be another  \\"Romance Novel\\" I would never have ordered this book.  It is not a love story it's a Harlequin Romance Novel written by an author who can do so much better.  In the questions and answers sections Sparks notes that Warner bought his book for a movie before he'd written a word.  Since he was paid before he wrote this book, he could fill the pages with fluffed up nonsense--- and he did!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|...but well worth it. Each CD just gets better and you can see the improvement in the way the voices interact. Seb especially just blew me away.<br /><br />While I like most of the songs on this CD, I'm torn between Crying and Come What May as my favorites. Crying always belonged to Roy Orbison, but dueting with Rebekah del Rio really put the Il Divo version over the top. Just beautiful.<br /><br />I might wish for more tracks, but this CD is well worth the money. I highly recommend it.

0525423656|2.0|If I could do a one word review it would consist of the word: boring.<br /><br />I've never been so disappointed in a sequel (if you don't count that atrocious book called Breaking Dawn). Crossed was boring. Cassia might have been trying to find Ky, but throughout her whole search, I just wasn't feeling it. Boring also means nothing exciting happened. There were a few parts that I liked, but most of the time it was so monotone. How can there be 364 pages and there not be any type of movement in the storyline? If you don't count the last 15 pages.<br /><br />Chapters are switched to Ky or Cassia's viewpoint. When I first started reading, I thought I was reading about Cassia, until I read something that didn't make sense and backtracked. I did this so many times until I looked at \\"Chapter 5\\" and right under it it says, \\"KY\\". There was nothing to tell me that he was speaking, that it was his time, and it bothered me that he didn't have his own 'voice'. I really dislike how the chapters were divided up between characters, it was very irritating and most of the time, I felt Ky really didn't bring anything great to the plot during his POV. In fact, since reading things in his POV, I've found I don't like him as much as I thought I did.<br />Some chapters were also just one page long and then it'd switch back to Cassia or Ky, when it was completely unnecessary for that one little chapter.<br /><br />My main disappoint is with the amount of plot fillers. With the chapters POVs changing, there's really a lot of stuff that just doesn't fit. I'd get confused, and go back and reread and still not quite get it. I think most of this book I didn't quite understand and I think it wasn't explained properly.<br /><br />I found myself thinking, \\"Why is Cassia even in love with Ky? Why is he even in love with her?\\" Honestly, I just can't with their romance. It doesn't make sense anymore and I just don't believe it. With Xander, don't let the summary fool you. He makes a very small appearance in Crossed and I really, really missed him.<br /><br />We get a few questions that aren't answered and I'm assuming they'll be answered with the next book. One of them in particular is probably the only reason I'll continue into Matched #3.sed him.   We get a few questions that aren't answered and I'm assuming they'll be answered with the next book.

0385342039|3.0|I could have loved Twenties Girl. It had amazing potential and I'm really disappointed that it didn't give me any feel good feelings.<br /><br />I hated most of the characters. I really hated Natalie, Lara's headhunting partner. I have an intense dislike for Sadie, her great aunt, she was always yelling if she didn't get her way, and she did some infuriating things. I've never met a character that I just wished would shut up and be killed off, oh wait, this character is already dead. Sadie was just awful. She hurt Lara so many times by `yelling' at someone who was alive. Sadie could make anyone into a puppet by `yelling' in their ear, excluding Lara, and it got old fast. There really aren't enough ways to say how much I disliked Sadie.<br />Lara has an evil sister, parents who never quite believe her, an uncle who didn't play his part well enough to be called a villain, and lest I forget Lara who is pining after a guy who dumped her.<br /><br />Of course, there are some things I liked. The search for the necklace had a few great moments. Our Mr. American Frown (Ed Harrison), who doesn't come in until the story is about halfway done, starts off as a really good love interest, until the end when he just seems bleh and I thought, \\"Why is he here again?\\" He made the story bearable, he had a personality that wasn't dreadful, and his interaction with Lara was cute.<br />Basically all the parts without Sadie were good, or the parts where she wasn't acting like a spoiled child.<br /><br />I'm battling with the rating. I'm not sure if I want it to be two stars or three, but I think I'll leave it at three because of Mr. American Frown.
B0065FFMR0|5.0|I love this show.  It's so sick and disturbing, and I find myself wanting to turn it off, but I just can't.  It's like a train wreck, you want to turn away, but you have to watch.  Anyway, this episode sealed it for me.  I am hooked now and I have to know what will happen next.  In this episode we get to learn more about Tate's crime and how he died.  It confirmed for me what I knew from the beginning that he was definately a ghost.  Tate scares me, but I find him to be the most interesting character in the show.  He is a whole lot of f'd up and I think we have only scratched the surface of what he is capable of.  I love his relationship with Violet.  It's disturbing, but also darkly romantic.  You have a deeply depressed suicidal girl in love with a psychotic murderous ghost.  It's weird but it works and I am dying to find out what will happen next for these two.  Also, I was proud of Vivian in this episode.  She finally gave that nasty adulterous husband the boot.  Ben is definiately losing it.  Vivian is becoming hot for the security guy, so we'll see how long it is before Rubber Man kills him.  I don't think he wants anyone near his baby mama.  Lastly, of course, we have the incredible talented Jessica Lange as Constance.  She tries to help Violet deal with what Tate is and hopes for her to help him cross over.  Also, there was a very touching scene between Constance and her Medium, Billie, where she told Addy how she really felt about her.  In closing, it was a great episode.  Anyway, this show is crazy, but I love it.  I find I can't wait a whole week for the next episode.
0486650677|5.0|Lanczos' \\"Variational Principles of Mechanics\\" is an erudite piece of work that basically reconstructs the science of analytical mechanics bottom up, from the principle of virtual work to Einstein's equivalence principle and the origin of the gravitational redshift of spectral lines. The book contains very little material on the Newtonian, vector mechanics, being entirely devoted to the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches to mechanics.<br /><br />The book provides a perfect introduction to the foundations of the all important principle of least action that pervades all of modern physics. In this regard, a nice companion to Lanczos' book is the treatise by W. Yourgrau and S. Mandelstam, \\"[[ASIN:0486458881 Variational Principles in Dynamics and Quantum Theory]].\\"<br /><br />One major \\"functionality\\" of Lanczos' book is to bridge the gap between our modern way of thinking and that of the classics. Anyone who has already tried to read the 1762 papers by Lagrange on Miscellanea Taurinensia or the 1834-1835 papers by Hamilton on the Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. knows that the classical literature is difficult to follow, part because of old-fashioned notation, part because we lack (well, at least I lack) the spirit of the times, making it difficult to understand some seemingly byzantine questions that the authors pose and ponder on in some of their (sometimes rather lenghty) writings. The book by Lanczos helps a lot both in terms of notation and ideas.<br /><br />I totally disagree with those that try to compare Lanczos' and Feynman's styles. Lanczos is seriously concerned with the history of the ideas, their evolution, and interpretations. There is nothing like that in Feynman's \\"The strange theory of light and matter,\\" or in his \\"The character of physical law,\\" and very little of it in his lectures on physics. Actually, Feynman pays very little credit to the historical development of the subjects. I am not saying that he personally does not recognize the credits, only that he does not communicate it. He admittedly has a \\"do it yourself\\" (or \\"did it myself\\") attitude towards physics, while Lanczos has a visible admiration for the greatness of his subject (without being cheesy) and is sensitive to its philosophical nuances and implications. I feel the difference between the two is like the difference between getting trained and getting educated.<br /><br />In summary: a must have in anyone's scientific library (unless you are an undergrad student cramming for your finals).he does not communicate it.

B004N6369Y|1.0|I started reading Danielle Steel a few years ago and really liked how interesting her stories were.  The last few have been really dumbed down and not too intriguing.

And then she has a tantrum for WEEKS when she finds out he is marrying?  I am not surprised to come onto to Amazon and see a 2/5 rating.

There haven't been many zombies so far, but if I wanted mindless zombie entertainment I'd watch Resident Evil. I love how everyone is saying the series has changed. There were only 6 episodes in the first season. That's barely enough to establish anything for a change to take place. I predict that the series is going to pick up in the next episode or so. Anyway, I wish the show luck.
B000P0J09M|1.0|This movie plays like an incredibly well made, overly long, TV re-enactment.  It is based upon the imagination of a moron, filled with exageration, cliche, and caricature.  Why anyone would waste their time with this is beyond me.

B005LB1MY6|4.0|Being that their last album was filled with absolutely amazing songs and some filler, I was happily surprised that this album sounded more like a true album. Although there isn't as many stand out songs, there also isn't as many fillers. Overall there is a theme of dance music mixed with big 70's big arena guitars which I love, although sometimes it doesn't work. Sometimes the songs need to be bigger and more thematic and sometimes they need to be more dance oriented, but over it's a good merry-meant of genres. There's something to be said about 70's arena rock and Dance put together. 70's arena rock was meant to be big, loud and cocky much like some dance that is big, loud and cocky, and that's why it works so well together. Standout songs for me are Civilization, Canon, On'n'On, Parade, News Lands, Helix and the albums title track.   But...I do have to say there are some problems with this album. First off the version of Civilization on the album is by far the lesser version of the song. Look for the 4:11 version which sounds better, better mix and is longer. In the 4:11 version when song is about to cut out it comes back for one more big chorus which I love. The other big problem with this album is that it's a product of the loudness war. Most dance or electronica albums usually don't suffer from clipping and over compression and usually leave the sound intact, but some of the bigger bands of this genre tend to try to make their albums compete with popular music. If you're not familiar with the loudness war, it just means that record companies try to make the cd sound as loud as possible thinking that listeners will respond better to that. The problem with that there is a a limit of how loud an album can be on cd before it clips off the music and distorts. This will cause the album to be distorted, lose clarity, and actually make the songs sounds very small and thin at louder levels. Believe me when I say that it may be one of the reasons people will like the album less then they should. Being that this music is supposed to be big large 70s arena rock dance music it greatly suffers from sounding too compressed.  Overall there is some amazing songs on here. The sounds of retro rock with contemporary music is absolutely amazing at times and you would be doing yourselves a disfavor by not buying this album.

B0052CK5PQ|5.0|I read an interview with Caitlin Moran, and went in search of her book not long afterwards. Not only does she answer the questions that I've been thinking, but never actually asked, she does it in a funny, striking and honest way. I found myself laughing hysterically at some of her antics, and for me, that doesn't happen often with a book. I would recommend this book to anyone, of any gender, I feel I have learnt so much from this book! Even though it only took me about a day to read, $10 very well spent (I purchased the Kindle version).
B004A7QOUE|1.0|I'm 36 weeks pregnant have been exercising my entire pregnancy.  In the past 8 weeks or so I've found I finally had to modify my workout routine to support my expanding belly.  I've been taking group exercises classes designed for pregnant women and always feel great after the classes.  But I wanted to find something I could do at home on days I can't make it to the gym.  After completing the 40 minute workout yesterday, I had extreme round ligament pain and lower back pain.  I followed the instructions pretty precisely, so I don't think it's anything I did incorrectly.  Perhaps it wouldn't be so severe for someone not quite as far along, but I won't be downloading it again.  PROS:  -a really good cardio workout - definitely got my heart pumping  -variety - she does a good job of changing up the exercises - definitely not boring  CONS:  -for me, this workout caused significant discomfort after the fact and I ended up feeling worse - vs better - after the workout. I've been hobbling around all day today (one day following the workout)  -as others have noted, very cheesy production values - lighting, music, effects/direction
0385534639|2.0|I chose this book for my book club because it was getting so much buzz.  The circus theme was attractive and the description sounded fascinating.  Let's just say that I feel bad that my book club had to read this - in fact I know some of them didn't even finish it.  To credit the author, she has an impressive imagination.  However, her words didn't resonate with the reader.  There was no character development and I didn't feel any sort of connection between them, whether it was love or hate.  Additionally, I didn't connect with one character in the book - there was no one to route for or to dislike.  Therefore, it just made for a long, slow read.  I didn't know if I would get through pages 50-100.  The second half was more engaging than the first half, yet this book was unexciting.  When I finished the book I didn't feel like a mesmerizing story was told.  I thought - I wasted several hours reading it.

1594203059|4.0|I bought this book on the spur of a moment, expecting some rather bland cultural comparison. How wrong I was. this is a remarkably readable book. Fergusons basic premise is that the West did win the 'War of Civilizations' and that this overall was a good thing. He marshals numerous examples as proof for western victory: Western clothing has become the universal clothing pattern, christianity is truly widely represented also in the indigenous population of all continents, western models of doing business, of organizing the military etc. etc. are being used all over the world.   The reason why the West did win he boils down to 7 'killer apps': competition, science, property rights, medicine, the consumer society, work ethics. He convincingly argues that these 'apps', as he calls them, were key to western superiority. He is not the first one to argue along these lines, for most of them others have argued along similar lines but most have done so in only one dimension, explaining western success only with one 'killer app'. Furthermore he boldly claims that overall western superiority and progress was a good thing. Yet he does not stop there. Basically he then goes on to ask: Now that others are successfully copying the western model, where will that lead us? On this front he sees a rudderless West blindly tumbling towards decline and oblivion, without showing a convincing scenario of 'what after'.  Overall I agree to his message. Western success has been much maligned by cultural relativists and yet the near universal acceptance of western culture points to something more than mere imperialsm. Yet there are a few caveats, which stopped me from giving him five stars. First of all, western domination is, according to him, Anglo-Saxon and more specificaly British. This means that he actually does not refer to the 'West' but to Britain. This he does with a jarring jingoistic undercurrent. Just to quote an example. Fergusan claims that on in 5 African soldiers in the Frencharmy in WWI perished, while French soldiers only had a mortality rate of 17%. Well, 1 in 5 is 20%, which does not seem to be awfully different from 17% and does not indicate racism to me - I can accpet that less experienced soldiers from tropical countries might suffer a slightly higher mortatlity rate in the cold fields of Flanders. He then goes on to point out that the mortality rate among British Indian troops was half that of British soldiers. Does he seriously try and suggest that the British were behaving more nicely towards their colonial subjects than towards native Britons?   He also dwells (rightly) on the horrors of colonialization, yet he prefers to specifically dwell on the horrors of French and German colonialization, which strikes one as ironic given the fact that Britain ran the largest empire of them all.  Thus one is left with a challenging, interesting polemic, which unfortunately relies to much a British perspective.
B005EHNEDO|5.0|Wilco is a band that has yet to not fulfill their fan's expectations. They are a band that, despite kicking around for a considerable time (in excess of 15 years I believe), they keep on beautifully balancing artistry, experimentalism and accessibility.<br /><br />As a devoted fan of the band, I have no problem with unequivically stressing that this is Jeff Tweedy's band. However, with their most stable and best lineup, the other bandmates' roles have now really flourished. While it may be Tweedy's band, he really needs these specific bandmates.<br /><br />Wilco is not easily digestible music. Usually, the bulk of their material does not immediately win you over. \\"The Whole Love\\" is no exception. When I first started to listen to this, it didn't do much for me. I actually enjoyed the more commercial Wilco material from the last two albums so this more daring and challenging music took me for a loop. This is challenging music yet in a different manner from masterpieces \\"A Ghost in You\\" and \\"YHF\\".<br /><br />After repeated listenings, the high quality started to sink in and I started to understand what makes this great.<br /><br />I feel that what sets \\"The Whole Love\\" apart from the other works is that great aspects of the band (particularly Nels Cline's killer avante garde guitar, Glen Koche's innovative percussion and John Stiratt's melodic yet restrained bass lines) are no longer so apparent, rather they are still there but more subtle. I know it sounds weird but Nels Cline's critical guitar is there, but it's not there! Everything that is great about Wilco is still there but now, you must be a more astute listener to find it. The majestry of the virtuosity is intertwined with the songs rather than being showcased as solos. What this does is give the songs a wonderful depth that mandates repeated listenings where you can discover new things with each listening.<br /><br />Highlights include;<br /><br />\\"Art of Almost\\", an experimental, poly-rhythmic prog song that takes unexpected turns and then ends in a guitar freakout. Wilco does Radiohead better than Radiohead!<br /><br />\\"Born Alone\\" a perfect slice of power pop with the usual Wilco experimental flourishes<br /><br />\\"One Sunday Morning\\" an achingly, beautiful 12 minute folk opus, done in a Nick Drake/John Fahey mode, that has Tweedy expressing very personal, reflective lyrics.<br /><br />Wilco is not for everybody, they are a band for the serious music lover. If you have been a fan, then this work is an execellent and neccessary addition to your collection.Wilco does Radiohead better than Radiohead!    \\"Born Alone\\" a perfect slice of power pop with the usual Wilco experimental flourishes  \\"One Sunday Morning\\" an achingly, beautiful 12 minute folk opus, done in a Nick Drake/John Fahey mode, that has Tweedy expressing very personal, reflective lyrics.

034552554X|4.0|I was hesitant to pick up this book because the book description didn't sound appealing to me.  However, after reading great reviews in People magazine and other publications I decided to give it a chance.  I am so happy I did because I enjoyed reading it and finished it in 3 days.  The author's writing style draws you in and you truly get to know the characters.  I didn't like the main character as she was difficult to be with for the entire book - she was so lost, stubborn, and neglected.  However, I did sympathize with her as I cannot imagine having her life.  I suppose the negative aspects of her personality display the reality of how difficult some people's lives are and that truth is difficult to understand and acknowledge.  I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the meaning of flowers and thought it was such an interesting topic to write about!    I attended a book fair in Boston and was fortunate enough to hear the author speak about her book.  She is extremely likable, honest (she spoke about her experience with foster children), and interesting!  I am looking forward to Vanessa Diffenbaugh's second novel.  Cheers to a victorious debut!
B00003CX95|5.0|What is there to say about Braveheart that has not been said. This is one of the best movies ever created.

B004LWZW7Y|4.0|This story has nothing in particular to do with Charles Perrault's classic fairy tale, but it makes funny, good-natured use of the Shrek character. Its beautiful fake Mexican desert landscape, and its shadowy dens of iniquity, make a gorgeous screen picture. And its characters require few jokes, as such, to hit on a lot of gut-busting humor. High art this ain't, but it sure is fun.  Long on the run, but looking for redemption, Puss takes on the one job he hoped would never come his way. But on the way to the big payoff, he runs across Kitty Softpaws, the craftiest pickpocket in the land, and his old friend, Humpty Dumpty. Puss and Humpty have a history going way back. They reluctantly join forces in the hopes of completing a childhood goal, but not everyone is sharing all their secrets.  Like the Shrek films this character comes from, this movie blends several different fairy tales and nursery rhymes, upending your expectations and juxtaposing real life with magical logic. Its combination of childhood playfulness and sly grown-up humor will attract a broad, smart audience. While nobody will mistake it for sly, transcendent art, it makes for good laughs and an evening well spent.
0062060554|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book so much that I saved it for vacation.  To say that I was disappointed is an understatement.  Simply said, the book was boring.  I understand that the nature of the main character's condition (Amnesia) is difficult to write about since the author is forced to repeat several situations, however, I felt as if I reading the same pages throughout the book.  Every chapter I was just waiting for something to happen - eventually it did, but it was too late.  On the whole, this book just fell flat.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Great movie. Inspirational. Once in a great while Hollywood gets one right and this is one of those times. Pretty hard to screw up a true story. Looking for sex, drugs, guns, explosions, fast cars, vulgar language? Then this movie is definitely not for you.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr delivers a new twist on the classic Sherlock Holmes and the result is a socially inept, very clever, confident, skilled problem solver. Jude Law's Wilson makes an excellent foil against Holmes and helps the movie keep its sense of reality by reminding the audience that Holmes is still, clearly, a flawed character who has his own problems, so we don't have to accept his eccentricities outright.  In short, it's fun and cleverly done. I'll watch it again and again. I look forward to getting a copy on bluray this holiday season.
0142419400|5.0|Anna's parents ship her off to boarding school in Paris, France for her senior year of high school.  She's pissed that she has to leave her best friend and Toph, her crush - who she kissed once.  In Paris, she feels completely overwhelmed and lost until she meets Meredith - who sort of takes her under her wing and introduces her to her small group of friends.  St. Clair - one of the guys in the group, immediately forms a bond with Anna.  But it's all wrong - he has a girlfriend, she knows Meredith has a crush on him, and she likes Toph back at home, etc. etc.<br /><br />St. Clair and Anna go through months of back and forth flirting and then avoiding each other.  As the school year draws to a close, she's left to wonder what will happen to the relationship - one of the closest she's formed in her life.<br /><br />I rank this somewhere around 4.5 stars.  It's a young adult \\"romance\\" novel - but it just feels so warm and inviting.  It was fun to read and I found the characters pretty believable and realistic.  The characters deal with real problems that high school aged kids deal with, and they use real language (a few F-bombs are dropped).  I look forward to reading more from this author.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|Ok, so as the other 140+ some 1 star reviews here...I'm adding my own. :) Obviously I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan - or else I wouldn't be here writing this review! So I got the movie from a retailer here (not off amazon) but it had the \\"new ultra-violet 'digital' copy\\" as well! I didn't read the reviews here on amazon BEFORE I downloaded flixster and the movie...but as soon as I realized that the \\".mp4\\" that downloaded would NOT play in iTunes I came here and found the information i was looking for! Now, I am here to tell everyone - there is an AWESOME and FREE program you can download called \\"HandBrake\\" which I've used for YEARS to make my own digital copy and place on my iPod (I have all 7 HP movies on my iPod thanks to handbrake).  Of course, as soon as I realized what this flixster crap was - I immediately removed it from my computer.  So if you've already purchased the DVD, do NOT download flixster and use the ultra-violet crap - but instead google \\"hand brake\\" and download it for your computer. Create your own \\"digital copy\\". :)

1573225517|3.0|This is one of those modern classics on everyone's \\"to read\\" list and while it wasn't my first Nick Hornby book it is the one that everyone talks about so of course I went into this expecting to be awed. I guess I should mention that I haven't seen the movie (what! I know) so I knew nothing about the storyline, not that that would have influenced me I just went into this blind.<br /><br />And, well I wish I could say I loved this (since that would make me one of the cool kids) but honestly the best I can come up with is under whelmed. Of course the writing is wonderful and it really is laugh-out-loud funny in places but I also found myself alternating between skim reading because the story wasn't going anywhere and all the 80's pop music references and top 5 lists got to be a bit much and rereading and marking numerous passages because they were just genius, describing exactly how I felt/feel. I should tell you that the music references are somewhat dated now and anyone under the age of 40 will be scratching their heads especially if you live in America as this involves British pop music and Indie bands.<br /><br />I think one of the main problems for me is that our protagonist Rob isn't a very likable character. It was hard to have any sort of compassion for him or for that matter even want to read about him. I actually found myself preferring any of the sections that placed him with other people because when we were alone in his head being all introspective I got bored. Rob is immature, selfish, self-absorbed and depressed, stuck in a job, apartment and relationship that have all gone stale. He has zero self confidence yet at the same time is so full of himself that he expects everything to revolve around him, which of course it doesn't and this in turn makes him lash out at his friends, parents and girlfriend to feel better about the state of his life.<br /><br />Rob is a bit of a loser; a thirty-something music junkie he spends his days running a near failing record shop and reminiscing about the 80's when he was semi successful DJ. Rob's life has stalled and he can't see a way out so he compiles top 5 lists of his favourite bands, songs, episodes of Cheers etc, insults his equally lost friends and plots ways to kill the guy who lives in the flat upstairs and stole his girlfriend.

B001IBIHQ4|1.0|to say that the story line was incoherent would imply that there was a story involved...  the casting was horrible. everyone looked alike, i couldn't tell who was who. the fact that everyone is covered in mud and blood and is wearing the exact same thing MIGHT tell the casting director \\"gee, maybe we really need some easily recognizable faces in this one.\\" casting: FAIL.  story? what story? were any of the individual episodes related? FAIL.  i couldn't even get into the action scenes, which were more confusing than anything. this was not a live shoot. sure, battle is confusing. but the director's job is to portray the sense of confusion through the actors and skillful filming. not to just confuse the hell out of the viewer.  this was such a letdown after band of brothers. it's like one of those crappy sequels that should never have been made. like the new star wars movies. capitalizing on past achievements while simultaneously destroying them.   good thing this had NOTHING to do with BoB. that would have been a true FAIL.  i'm still waiting for speilberg to reedit BoB and replace everyone's guns with walkie talkies...  if you want to see a very good pacific theater movie, check out 'thin red line'. now THAT is a movie worth watching.

0307946711|4.0|The length of the book put me off, but I finished it in three days. Nicholls accurately conveys the atmosphere of the late eighties and nineties with some nicely-put descriptions that took me back. The emotionally charged chemistry between the 2 main characters were engrossing and I kept wondering where they were going to go from here. My only gripe is that I wished Dexter would sober up or learn from his past mistakes. I kept wondering why 15 July, the day the author chose to describe the situation between the characters with each passing year, but all will become clear at the end, which I didn't see coming.

B001AQT0RC|5.0|My only criticism of this film is that there is zero chemistry in the few \\"romantic\\" scenes. However, the storyline, overall acting and thought provoking issues that are brought up more than make up for it. This is hands down in my top 5 films of all time.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I bought this new release with some concern regarging the negative reviews (by some) of the blu-ray transfer quality.  I viewed this on a new panasonic LCD TV and a new panasonic disc player. The quality of the image was not a problem. I'm a very critical viewer who has sensitive eyes and has to turn off the back light function for all viewing during day and evening.  This lack of back light can be compensated for by turning up the brightness. That being said, I was impressed with my viewing of disc 1 \\"Jurassic Park.\\"  The image was sharp and clear.  I've noticed that scenes in dark, low contrast conditions tend to be less so with Blu-ray, in general. Using the back light function will compensate for this, but I choose not do so to avoid the eyestrain that will result.  Jurasic park was better than the other movies I've seen in this regard. In fact it was almost not noticable in comparison to other Blu-ray films I have seen. Overall I was very impressed with the quality of the viewing image. I suspect that those who had problems with the quality may have had a disc player that needed some updating.  My only complaint with the film is after a few minutes on pause, the image is lost to a Universal screen logo, and you can't get back into the film by pressing \\"play.\\"  This is a result of  the \\"timeline\\" bookmark feature that comes up whenever you press the pause button.  Just press the green button on the remote and the feature will resume where you left off (whether you originally chose to bookmark the pause or not).  If you don't do this you will find yourself in the main menu starting the film from the beginning if you press other buttons trying to get back into the film.  Overall, the image is quite good and anyone who is a fan of this film will enjoy it immensly in this format and will probably not even notice or care about what some of the negative reviewers have chosen to focus (no pun intended) on.
0451232577|5.0|I finished reading Pillars of the Earth and World Without End and was anxious for what came next. As much as I enjoyed the first two books mentioned, I liked Fall of the Giants that much better. I think it was because my knowledge of World War I and that time period is so poor that it was fascinating to be introduced to that world in such an interesting and engaging fashion. Although a work of fiction, it was my kind of history book! I have not stopped thinking about it and am anxious for the next book to be published so I can find out how the characters are doing. As an added bonus for me, my hometown (Buffalo) was one of the settings for the book. The characters were rich, the politics interesting, and the movement from one place and character to the next made for a quick read.

The media is somewhat responsible for giving this impression, as is Nicki herself with her many (excellent) contributions to other rap tracks. But instead of rap we have here a stunning successfully club/pop platter full of incredibly catchy tunes, anchored by Nicki's exceptional lyrical skills. It's really quite unique, almost a masterpiece.

B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|R.E.M. has bored me to tears for years. Go download the first 4 records. After that they just got rich and happy making music that sounds like it was made for yuppies or Christian Rock stations. There are moments on this new record that remind me of the way R.E.M. used to be - alternative. But those moments are few.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|I have all 3 toy stories from prior blu ray releases   This is exactly what I needed to make those still relevant   The 3d is awesome !!   Great set if 3d is all u need
B004LROUNG|5.0|The \\"old\\" Grisham is back. Like his earlier works, this is a book you can't put down. But this novel is truly entertaining, with many elements of subtle humor. I look forward to more Grisham novels with these features.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|i have not written any movie reviews but after attempting to watch this for over 40 minutes, and thankfully finally giving up, i must suggest that you don't waste your time.  i am SO glad we didn't pay to see this in a theater!  hated the story, hated the music, hated the disjointedness.  a senseless movie with no redeeming qualities -- at least the 40 minutes we watched...!  if i could give it less than 1 star i absolutley would do so...
B000BU2DC2|5.0|Reviews are irrelevant - If you don't know this band already you are not ready. You should go away and play with something soft and safe.
1451627289|5.0|Old-fashioned horror tale with monsters?  No.  But does that mean that \\"11/22/63\\" isn't a scary book? No.  Just the subject matter alone - if you grew up in the 60s and were alive when JFK was assassinated is enough to scare and traumatize you again.<br /><br />How many of us at one time or another haven't toyed with the \\"what ifs\\" of time travel?  Not many, I am betting.  What would I do if I was given the chance to go back in time and not only work at preventing Kennedy's untimely death but make other changes, too, some personal.  Very tempting.<br /><br />King gives us another look at the dark side of human nature.  And that is mostly what this book is - a look at a common man, a teacher, put in extraordinary circumstances.  Yes, there is a bit of politics.  It would be difficult to write about Kennedy without bringing some politics in.  But there was less politics than I expected and more story about a simple man's difficult choices.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"11/22/63.\\" I liked the way the time travel issues were handled by King.  I enjoyed the side story that had shades of [[ASIN:0451169514 It]] (one of my favorite King novels) interwoven throughout.  I liked Jake a lot and loved so many of the side characters, including Sadie, Miz Mimi, Deke.  And I was enthralled by the backstory of Oswald.<br /><br />This reminded me of King's writing in [[ASIN:1416552960 Duma Key]]; [[ASIN:3404143434 The Green Mile]]; and [[ASIN:0671042858 The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon]] - all books of King's I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this book for my personal library and I also sent one to my son - another King fan.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|it keeps deleting my history randomly and i have to start over...also..where are the updates like they have on angry birds
0312360266|5.0|I love the whole series and highly recommand this books for adults also. Keeps you guess and when you think you know what is going to happen... find out it was not what you expect to happen. This series deals with different kind of people and openly talks about all kinds of people. I love that about this books.
B00004RF83|1.0|Seven Days in May which does not stay true to the book is a great movie,Good acting and tense moments.However,once you go to the audio commentary on the DVD you realize sadly the Filmmakers Bias,which is no surprise given the General MacArthur, General LeMay,and Senator McCarthy are slandered in a little speech towards the end which ruins an otherwise great movie,Of course the film makers failed to realize if there was any danger then as now it is a takeover by a bunch of leftistmoonbats and that ironically the new left hijacked their movement right after this movie was made,Hollywood should do a Remake and not with Douglas' activist son but A RightWing Version(or balanced and True version) where indeed a Weak President(and not Frederic March who was Blacklisted along with another nobodyactory in the movie)policies are very unpopular,It is very unlikely something like this would happen and no one would want it(I would not want it),and there is no such thing as the Military-industrial complex as said by the Ike who threw mccarthy under the bus,Pros and cons in the movie: Pro:Fine Acting,good scenery,Cons:the overall message and AntiRightWing hysteria of then making one of the most if not Weakest Leaders then a Cold War Hero(JFK-as mentioned by the filmmaker,because \\"Today the office of the presidency is not The same\\")Good thing I rented it at the library and not purchased hollywood's usual version of events,At Least we know Who won The Cold War(The Right).
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Recently purchased this copy with the Digital copy included. They now have something called Ultraviolet Digital copy. This will ONLY work with Flixster and you have to download Adobe apps to run this!! What a joke! It will only work with a WiFi connection and not in itunes! What is the point??? The main reason I purchase these digital downloads is so that I can watch movies on plane flights. This is now not possible! Flixster is aware of this, will do nothing, and there is no itunes option. STAY AWAY FROM ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL DOWNLOADS!
B005KDWUFA|1.0|Very amatureish album.  Was disappointed in the lack of quality.  Was looking forward to \\"Time to say goodbye\\" there was no feeling or emotion in it.  They need Simon to critique their works before they put them out. I have been a fan from the beginning but won't be unless they put out quality work in the future
B00509CRG6|4.0|This was the first book I have read by Seth Godin. His style is great, and his words have strong impact. In this book he is imploring people to take charge of themselves and create impact in the new economy, and to avoid being a cog in someone else's wheel. There are many practical ideas of how to do this more effectively. I especially liked the description of the lizard brain and \\"Shenpa\\", a tendency to scratch the itch and do stupid things in critical situations. Godin offers advise and examples of better ways to react, and I've already been able to put those to good use.  There is one thing I wish had been addressed more directly in this book is the way that your own activities impact others. So much of who we are and what we do is focused on helping each other and striving to improve the world we live in. I found Godin's perspectives to be self-centered and \\"all-about-me\\", with more focus on how our actions and behavior make things work out well for me. I wanted to hear more about how my own self-improvement would help me make others more successful or have greater positive impact on my family or community. It certainly seems plausible that more effective and successful people will by definition lift up the society in general. In fact, Godin pleads with his readers to excel because \\"we need you\\", which I assume means that the world needs more impact players everywhere. I just wish that he had explored this external impact more in-depth and had used it more in the examples.  That said, I strongly recommend this book. It is compelling and enjoyable to read, while at the same time it was a motivating and refreshing slap in the face.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|When you buy this album, do yourself a favor and listen to it about 5-6 times before reviewing it. It will grow on you. Although it is without the commercial gloss of \\"The Open Door\\" and \\"Fallen,\\" it makes up for it with the musical muscle that demands you keep it on repeat in your Mp3, CD, whatever the case.    True album rock...I dont hear any top 40 on this album, but that makes it more appealing!  You have to listen to the album to enjoy it's ambience. Skipping any songs only cripples the listening experience.  It is a ride from beginning to end. Do not be quick to discern it because it might not offer the instant gratification that modern entertainment is damning the current generation with. Let the band fire you up with \\"What you want\\", carry you through on that high, then bring you down gently in the end with \\"Swimming home.\\" Surrender to it, you wont be disappointed.   Rob
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|pensé que era útil, pero el micrófono incorporado en la grabadora es suficiente...  I thought it was useful, but the microphone on the recorder is enough ...
B0059XTTSM|5.0|but I'll try not to play the spoiler. Suffice it to say, the full meaning of Take Shelter rests perilously upon the final scene, where the primary issue of the film--the sanity of the protagonist--is seemingly resolved. A straight-forward reading of that scene yields a richness of social implication; allegorical or ironic readings yield nothing but the fruit of a well-acted psycho-suspense thriller.<br /><br />Appearances aside, this is not a film about the private affairs of a married couple, and this is not a film that ends on a note of discontinuity. The whole point of the film is that the line between private anguish and public life is an illusion; the whole point of the ending is that it is the logical outcome of a psychological process that has been building up for two hours on screen.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, Take Shelter is about the challenge of people coming together in the face of an impending political catastrophe, about forging a meeting-of-minds that requires nothing less than extraordinary courage and empathy from all of us, as we strive to overcome the all-but-unbridgeable gaps between our various subjective experiences of the world. In this sense, the super-natural elements in Take Shelter appear only superficially in the sky; the real miracle is in what happens between two human beings--married or unmarried, it makes no difference--by the end of the film.<br /><br /> In my view, Take Shelter is far and away the most important meta-political film of this young century.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I usually don't give 5 stars, but if there is a game that deserves is this one. It has it all, awesome art style, great music and a responsive controls. I just can't praise this game enough. I've finished all levels with a 3 star rating. Download it NOW!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Pros: plays DRM-free mp3 files with few hitches. Nice integration with the Amazon mp3 store. Cons: long, frequent lags occur with automatic refreshes of a large (18K song) music library; sometimes these result in corrupt data and I have to clear data and download the whole library metadata again. No gapless playback. Uploader and service won't allow uploading of edited tags or direct tag edits. Uploader is slow to scan files and doesn't handle changes to playlists well.
B00005QBUK|4.0|I have several Sony headphones over the years.  I really like the little fold up plastic ones.  This headphone does not fold; it does adjust to head size.  It works well.  The material it is made of seems like it will last longer than most since the plastic is flexible and not brittle.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|I grew up on Dr. Who, and love the long story line, however they need to change the season numbering, as this is NOT season 1 at all, the show started in the 60s. Watch it all from the originals to now, just make sure whatever you do you avoid any of the shows or films that American producers had anything to do with, every one of them couldn't stick to the story line and were honestly just horrible. I hope the Dr keeps at it for many many many more life times... :)
B0002HYC8C|5.0|I bought this for my two-year old (he doesn't really put things in his mouth so I wasn't overly concerned, but there ARE a lot of small pieces... wouldn't have worked with my older one).  He LOVES it.  So does his 4 year-old brother.  Even my 11-year old nephew couldn't leave it alone when he came over.  I love the way the animals move and look so realistic instead of being cartoonish or flat wood like other sets.  One of our giraffe's has had its leg come off a couple times, but it snaps back on easily.  So versatile; it's provided many hours of entertainment!

B0034EEE2E|5.0|i love beach house. this band makes me feel so lovely and this album is great. i listened to it on a road trip, this fall, and it made for a beautiful drive. the leaves were changing color and i was the only one on the road. so perfect.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|This a sad, funny, romantic, lovable movie.  It is one of Patrick's best.  Also, it is one that I would have allowed my children to watch when they were young.  If you love Patrick Swayze, this is a \\"must have\\" movie.
B004LROMSO|5.0|Ya know what?  Every now and then I like a different twist on an age old story.  \\"Let's try something different for a change\\", say I.  Well, this series does not disappoint along this line of thinking for these very reasons:  King Arthur is NOT the manly Richard Burton we knew on the Broadway stage or the Richard Harris of the movie...he is an awkward teenager barely aware of his own existence on this earth who has to learn everything about being a king from the ground up as he goes along...he's a boy king who grows up to be a man and a leader of men.  Guenevere is NOT a virtuous Julie Andrews or Vanessa Redgrave...she's a young woman betrothed to another who has a failing for young lads like the teenaged king!  Sir Lancelot is NOT Robert Goulet or Franco Nero with a deep baritone voice...in fact, I don't think I've heard him sing even once in this series!  Merlin is NOT the spritely Roddy McDowell or clever Laurence Naismith...he is a believable \\"magician\\" of curious and questionable background who successfully uses his magic only to serve and protect the new king, yet he is shown to have vulnerabilities and human frailties at certain points in the story...he is NOT the omnipotent creature we have come to know in past versions.  Camelot is NOT the utopian \\"Emerald City\\" of modern Arthurian legend...it is an old, moss-covered, overgrown, rundown heap of stones that the new King Arthur and his knights decide to make their own because nobody else wants it!  And Morgan is just plain.......Morgan!  This version of the story is refreshingly different than the stories we've previously encountered.  My wife and I find ourselves sitting together on the couch, bowl of popcorn precariously balanced between us, saying, \\"Oh, that was clever!\\" and \\"I didn't see THAT coming!\\"  In short, we have found this version of the Arthurian legend to be very entertaining, and we like it a lot.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|This movie has great songs and dances.  I had to have this one to compare the new version to - this one is much, much better.  The language alone makes it better.  I wouldn't worry if a child 8 and up was to watch it.
0553582038|3.0|About halfway through this book, I wondered why it was taking me so long to read it.  At first, I figured it was just because I was getting a little burnt out on the series, having come to it straight from reading the previous three.  As I finished it, though, I realized it was because this is in fact a real step down from the earlier books.  Sure, it's great in the ways we've come to love Martin's books, for his world-building rigorousness, moral complexity, and surprising characters.  However, this work utterly lacks the thrust of its predecessors; Martin calls it half of a whole, and boy, does it feel like it.  As noble as Brienne is, she's too flat to be worthy of the chapters dedicated to her, while by the end of the book I hated Cersei less for her character than for her being jammed down my throat.  Jaime, Sam, and Arya are the bright spots in the text, and are brushed aside accordingly.  The characters so important earlier are for the most part absent, others show up and are never heard of again for some obscure purpose, leaving the prose rudderless and dull; by the end of it I was wondering if it shouldn't have an alternate title, like \\"Frommer's Guide to Westeros\\".    In short, if this were a stand-alone book, it would be superb; unfortunately, it suffers by comparison to its betters.  Someone *please* tell me \\"A Dance of Dragons\\" is an improvement.
B005K17RU0|4.0|There's quite a lot to like about this app- particular favorites of mine are the fact that it puts a widget at the top of my screen so I can see the weather at a glance and how it has a radar function.  it gets a star knocked off for a couple of things:  I can't set it to automatically run on startup and I have to manually refresh the gps when I change cities, as I discovered on a recent roadtrip.  it doesn't always update the temp in the taskbar every 30 minutes, but is always accurate when I open the app.  I just wish I didn't have to open it to see current weather!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great app. Was really shocked to see it with 3 1/2 stars. Now if I can find more time to read I would. Doesn't drain phone. Never errors gallaxy s 2

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|To say that this has a didget copy is a LIE.  MISADVERTISNG. FRUAD.  I recently purchased 3 WB movies and all 3 have the same issue.  UltaViolet is an online cloud that allows you watch your moveis streaming.  it is NO GOOD it is not a didget copy and it does NOT work with Itunes.  i am returning all 3 movies with UV i have purchased and cancelling all preorders that have it.  Boycott this new format.  it is terrible.

B004RCUJ9E|5.0|My 5 yr old insisted on playing checkers with me using this app for a good portion of a lengthy plane ride.  It works well, it also has a setting you can turn on where touching a piece shows you where it can move (helpful for kids).  Overall, we have enjoyed the app.  Wish the squares were a little bigger, but that's all
B005974CNA|5.0|Dream Theater may be the most underrated, underappreciated rock band of all time! These guys are brilliant! Despite the absence of Mike Portnoy, the band meets or exceeds my expectations with Mike Mangini, who is simply an amazing drummer and performer! Let's not forget Rudess, LaBrie, Myung, and Petrucci. They are absolutely incredible!! If you're a fan of progressive rock, this is a \\"must\\" album!!! P.S. If you have the opportunity to see them in concert, it will be the best money you've ever spent! Mangini's drum solo was the perhaps the greatest I've ever seen (and heard) and I've seen Neil Peart live three times!!
B004SBX112|5.0|The game play is simple and straightforward but a lot of fun.  I've spent far too much of my life on this app, but have to give it props for making it hard to put the phone down.  I like the different seasonal settings - mixes it up a bit
B004EPZ02A|3.0|Though I have mixed feeling about this film, I can't say I wasn't warned by watching the first two films. The film settles into the same tone as the first two releases and creates the same sort of atmosphere. You can expect the same results from this movie as the others, speaking of an increase in activity near the end of the film. I have to admit there were some good \\"make you jump\\" segments which I did just that.<br /><br />I did watch this film in the theater, which I feel takes some of the scary feeling away with other people sitting a few rows away. I recommend watching it, at home, alone, in the dark for a better atmosphere and then, it could be possible that you will be looking in all the dark areas of the house before going to bed. That's to say you can.<br /><br />Another watch once scary film.
B005LJITS0|2.0|Good movie overall, to be honest there are very few Ryan Reynolds movies that I don't end up liking.  My major problem with this movie was as a lot of other people have commented on, the Digital Copy.  To download it I had to sign up for 2 seperate accounts (Flixster and Ultraviolet).  After finally installing new applications for downloading I got the movie, only to find out it's incompatable with Windows Media Player...it must be played inside of the Flixster application.  Just seems like one more way they are making it harder for me to watch movies when I'm traveling.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|The colormunki display was simply to use, took about 10 minutes the first time and the color matches my prints.  I still have a tad difference in lightness but just a tad and I believe that is normal for looking at a screen vs a print.  Very impressed!
B004HO6I2E|5.0|ryan reynolds and jasn bateman are hillarious. these two are going to be a great comic duo. this is really funny. it is hillarious and entertaining. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie was well executed, followed the story line of the books and wrapped up the series with a bang. The acting and directing and digital effects are leaps and bounds above where it began with the Sorcerers Stone. That being said, I'm giving the studio a big F for distributing the \\"digital copy\\" they way they did. Rather than go with the industry standard iTunes download, they are going with a new scheme that someone in Hollywood has come up with. Since I couldn't easily send the movie back(opened shrinkwrap), I thought I'd give the Ultraviolet system a shot, and found it lacking.   The first problem I see is privacy issues that go along with yet another system for managing media. I have a large distrust for companies ability to keep the data safe, not that I think that they have much interest in my entertainment preferences, beyond selling me more. I have rather serious reservations about being forced to sign an agreement that allows them to make changes to it without my knowledge(which most of these license agreements state). As the current market leader, Apple's business is big enough, and they are smart enough to realize that they would loose millions if they were breached. That fact makes me believe they will stop at nothing to protect that information. A startup competitor might cut corners in order to get a new system up and running.  The next issue is how long it took to wade through the setup process. In my case, with a new laptop, wideband internet and a fairly well developed technical ability, it was over an hour from start to finish. Granted, much of that time would not be an issue if I were predisposed to utilizing the system again. What follows is the process...  Setup Flixster account with password  Agree to Flixster's terms of service, privacy rules  Setup Ultraviolet account with password  Agree to Ultraviolet terms of service and privacy rules  Download and install Flixster Collections application  Download and install Adobe Air  Agree to AdobeAir Licensing agreement  Agree to Flixter's End User Agreement(which couldn't be completely viewed or printed!)  Enter in the code in the BluRay box.  Download the movie  The deal breaker for me was the lack of iPod transfer. I like to have the movies available for the kids to watch in the car, and there is no way that I could find to transfer this type of digital copy to an iPod. Any sort of digital copy has to have this option for me, or else it looses significant value.  All in all, I understand that the movie studios want to keep the profits of distribution, instead of giving them to Apple, but in order to get me to switch, they are going to need to make the process easier and provide iPod access as well. I will be avoiding all digital downloads that use the UltraViolet system. Maybe they can fix the issues, but I'm dubious that will happen.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|In the light of so many negative customer reviews of this set, I decided, before writing this review to do a direct comparison between the DVD version of Jurassic Park vs. the Blu-ray.  I made it a point to set my BD player audio compression to wide range and set the volume levels for each version to be approximately at the same level for the spoken dialog to give each version a fair comparison.<br /><br />I chose four sections to compare:<br /><br />1. The scene at Sam Neill's dig beginning with the brushing away of sand from a fossil.<br />2. The helicopter ride into Jurassic Park.<br />3. The first encounter with the brachiosaurus beginning when the jeeps come to a stop and Sam Neill and Laura Dern first see the creature.<br />4. The night storm scene with the T-Rex encounter.<br /><br />All of the above begin at a chapter change of both disc versions, making them quick to locate.<br /><br />The video:  In no instance can the DVD version compare with the Blu-ray.<br /><br />In scene 1, the sand particles are fully defined in the Blu-ray and are a blur with the DVD.  When Sam Neill rises into the frame the landscape is richly defined in the Blu-ray until the camera refocuses onto Neill's face.  Later we see the sheen of sweat on Neill's face with the Blu-ray which is not noticeable at all with the DVD.  The improvement in facial definition of the people standing behind Neill when he is lecturing them.<br /><br />In scene 2,  the improvement in the definition of the sea water below the helicopter, the facial definition of the passengers, the clear definition of the weave in Sam Neill's hat.  Later the foliage clarity as the helicopter (a miniature, I believe) flies through the canyon.<br /><br />In scene 3, the improved definition of the tree foliage which is a blur with the DVD and outstandingly defined in the Blu-ray.  The definition of the details of the creatures they are observing.<br /><br />In scene 4, the improved details in the night scene, objects really look wet from the rain.  The amazing definition of the wet scales of the T-Rex.<br /><br />The audio:  When I first heard the audio of the DVD, I knew that it was shamefully compressed compared with the LD (Laser Disc) issue that I still have.  Also missing were the fundamentals in bass sounds which also have been fully restored with the DTS sound track of the Blu-ray.<br /><br />In scene 1. When the seismic charge in detonated, you can feel it in the floor with the BD.  Not there at all with the DVD.<br /><br />In scene 3. When the brachiosaur rises on its hind legs and howls, it is really loud with the BD, terribly compressed with the DVD.<br />When it falls back down onto its forelegs, you feel it in your chest.  No such thing with the DVD.<br /><br />In scene 4. The sound of the thunder, the bass elements of the T-Rex growls, the thumps of its footsteps are all very powerful with the BD and missing in the DVD.  When the T-Rex howls at the children and they clap their hands over their ears you hear why they are doing it with the Blu-ray.<br />The DVD doesn't capture this at all.<br /><br />The above noted audio differences will not be noticeable at all when using standard TV speakers.  A decent home audio system is required with the Blu-ray player set to wide range audio (least compression).  I recommend monitoring your volume setting carefully at first to safe-guard your speakers.<br /><br />I can say without reservation that all three of the films in this collection benefit immeasurably with the Blu-ray format in picture and sound.<br /><br />The films themselves:<br /><br />Jurassic Park:  Of course the film most people will remember because it made the greatest initial impression.  It deserves to be remembered because nothing quite like it had been previously accomplished from a technical standpoint.  It's an enormously entertaining and absorbing picture with a fine cast and somehow  manages to convince you of the possibilities implied, at least for a while.<br /><br />The Lost World -- Jurassic Park:  The most disappointing of the three, especially considering that it was directed  by Spielberg.  It more resembles a \\"monster movie\\" in the class of \\"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\\" or some such -- one highly improbable crisis after another.  There are a few CG errors noticeable even in the DVD version.

B004NSULHM|3.0|Radiohead can not be labeled as anything other than a band that takes a left turn just when you think they are turning right. This is not \\"OK Computer\\" or \\"Kid A\\" but it is fair to say it's somewhere in the \\"Kid A\\" vicinity. I thought \\"The Reckoner\\" from the last release to be the top of the scale when it came to great Radiohead songs. If you feel the same, then \\"Codex\\" and \\"Give Up The Ghost\\" from TKOL will make you happy. If you like 2+2=5 then you will like \\"Bloom\\". The eight songs on this release can be mistakened for outtakes if you are familiar with their other releases. It might sound like something is missing. The more you listen to TKOL, the more you begin to like and understand the unique sound that Mr. Yorke is looking for. This record sounds more like Thom's solo release than a Radiohead release. Each song on TKOL has a very unique sound to itself. Thom's voice is the driver on most of the eight songs. A little guitar, some computer-repetitious drumming, and a lot of bass. Make no mistake about it, if you heard it out anywhere, you'd know it's Radiohead.
B005LJITS0|4.0|Truely enjoyed the movie. Actors did a good job.  The story dragged in some areas, thus the 4 stars. Very much recommend it.
B0059IVV9M|4.0|Beirut, the one-time one man band of Zach Condon that arrived on the scene in 2006, is now a fully fleshed-out ensemble, but still very much the brainchild of Condon. This is the band's third studio album.<br /><br />\\"The Rip Tide\\" (9 tracks; 33 min.) starts off with a blazing \\"A Candle's Fire\\", featuring plenty of horns/brass. It is followed by the instantly likeable \\"Santa Fe\\" (UK single), which is a homage to Condon's home town. The tracks follow quickly one after another, making their musical point and moving on. \\"East Harlem\\" is a slower, pensive track, but still the wind instruments are featured prominently, as they are throughout the album. The title track is another highlight on here. In all, this is a great album, period, possibly better even than \\"Gulag Orkestar\\" (but that's just me). This album is delightfully quirky even though at just 33 min. it feels a little short but that is a minor quibble.<br /><br />I had the good fortune of finally catching these guys live for the first time just this past weekend here in Cincinnati, where they played Bogart's, a 1,500 capacity venue. First of all, I was quite surprised how packed the venue was. When did Beirut become so popular? That aside, they played a a very entertaining set, featuring about 4 or so of these songs live (I was surprised they didn't play more from the new album--Gulag Orkestar remains the focal point of their live shows), and if anything it sounded even better live than on the CD. Meanwhile, \\"The Rip Tide\\" is highly recommended!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|The soft velvety voice of Michael Bublé makes this a joy to listen to. Michael and his producers put together a mix of traditional Christmas songs such as It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christams, Jingle Bells and I'll be Home for Christmas, as well as some we may not have heard of before such as Cold December Night and Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).  In the liner notes, Michael tells us that his family grew up listening to Bing Crosby. Well, the way Michael sings these Christmas songs, Bing would be proud.  This is a must-have for Michael Bublé fans and those that enjoy listening to Christmas music.
B002VWNID6|3.0|Movie was listed as new.  It played fine but think it was a copy because had to flip it over during the middle of the movie.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This AMC series is based on a graphic novel series that follows a group of people trying to survive the end of civilization due to a zombie apocalypse. The time frame is largely immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travels and drama surrounding the survivors. The story largely focuses on how the survivors live in this now non-technological world, hiding from zombies who are constantly searching for a food source (i.e., people, animals). As the group travels the road, they run into other groups of survivors who have banded together, sometimes good, sometimes evil. Because the show is put together by AMC, it is has high quality actors and is well written. It is really a drama that involves zombies more than a zombie show that happens to have characters. The characters in the Walking Dead are fully flushed out and complex with differing motives and objectives. It reminds me a bit of Battlestar Galactica on the Sci-Fi channel, where the characters and the story took precedence over the setting.<br /><br />This was the most highly anticipated series in my household, as we are huge fans of post-apocalyptic fiction. My wife and I watched it first to make sure that it was appropriate for tweens/teens (16, 13 & 12), and then went back and watched with the kids (I admit, we let them see violence and gore, but no inappropriate sex/nudity). The kids love the show as much as we do, but it is not for those with a weak stomach or the faint of heart. We are watching the second season now, and it is every bit as good as the first season. We have been, and continue to be, very impressed with this show.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|What an incredible concept, imagine another earth as close as the moon.  The story line is incredible. The movie keeps moving along and does not get bogged down with korny space alien stuff or wierd ufo sightings or epic space battles. So glad hollywood didnt touch this.  If you need independance day, avatar or battle for LA this movie is not for you.  This is for all the Libra's, dreamers, and the what if'ers.  Awesome twist at the end.  Took me a few minutes to put it all together but very thought provoking.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Change can be good, but not change for the sake of change. I'll keep my old copies of Star Wars. I would rather a lesser quality than modified scenes.
1451648537|5.0|I found this book absolutely fascinating. Isaacson, as in his previous books, writes with clarity, depth, and beauty. We see Steve Jobs' creative genius and also his difficult personality and sometimes cruel words and actions. This was a man who seemed have much greater love for a beautiful and elegant products than for the engineers and designers who created it. Did Jobs experience empathy with other people's pain or joy? If you believe as I do that actions, and only actions, tell the truth of human beings, including ourselves, then Steve was without emotional empathy. He was passionately devoted to making Apple products that are intuitive and easy to use, perhaps because he was not a computer engineer himself nor a software coder, and seemed to be much more attracted to poetry, art, and design than to physics and engineering. The antenna problem with the iPhone 4 was due to Steve's ignoring his engineers and placing his aesthetic sense over the laws of physics. If he wanted something to be true, he declared that it was. He was famous for his \\"reality distortion field.\\"
B00004RCO8|4.0|After being banished to Elba, Napoleon Bonaparte (Rod Steiger) returns in triumph to Paris to reclaim his Emperor's throne while King Louis XVIII (a mountainous Orson Welles) flees the city. But his glory is short lived as he meets the armies of Wellington (Christopher Plummer) at the battle of Waterloo. This handsome epic, directed by Sergei Bondarchuk (1967's WAR AND PEACE), is a mixed bag. With the exception of a well done ball sequence, the dramatic portions tend to be stagnant. But the battle scenes, which occupy the second half of the film, are pretty awesome. More so because it's not CGI the way it would be today. Filmed in the Soviet Union, the Russians not only helped fund the film but provided some 16,000 soldiers to act as background in the battle scenes. When you see some of the incredible aerial shots or the charging armies, you know it's real people on the screen, not computer generated images. Steiger, while an odd choice for Napoleon, is effective in his restrained scenes while his eye popping acting is distracting in others. The Nino Rota score is a dud but Armando Nannuzzi gives the film a nice sheen whether the rich looking interiors or the vast exteriors. With Jack Hawkins, Virginia McKenna, Dan O'Herlihy, Michael Wilding and Philippe Forquet.  The Sony DVD via Great Britain is a nicely rendered wide screen (2.35) transfer.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A really good calming thinker game. Nice graphic and sound effects. The levels progress slow enough to learn the secrets of the game but fast enough not to get bored.

0446547654|5.0|Great book.  Interesting ending.  I am a Nicholas Sparks fan and this book did not disappoint me.  As a man I can appreciate Sparks writing.
B005K8QIS0|5.0|Others have summarized the plots well. Although Jason Isaacs is much more physically aggressive than I pictured the hero from reading the great books in this series, he is very good. Above all, the intertwining mysteries, although obviously improbable, are entertaining and interesting. The acting is uniformly excellent. The shots of Edinburgh (not the location of the books) are picturesque. Best of all, the stories are both suspenseful and humorous, as well as often touching. I look forward to more--and urge you to read the books, which are even better.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you haven't seen Every Single one of the blurays, and you decide to make a review..you're automatically wrong, go home and watch them.   ep 1- CGI yoda, Incredible   ep 4- New Ben Scare. It sounds like he's actually trying to scare them. Better Greedo/Han Shot. Looks more realistic  ep 5- better arm cut  ep 6- Ewoks eyes are even noticable unless you're looking, and the NOOOOOOOOO is the connection between ep 3 and 6. It's the same scream let out by anakin when he thinks he killed padme and it represents so much more in the star wars universe.  Overall 9.5/10   Picture 10  Sound 10  Bonus Content 8( Originals arent included)
0521008433|1.0|While I do think that this book does offer some valuable information, I also think that a reader can only get so much information out of a book that is thoroughly unenjoyable to read.  The book would be far more effective if reading it wasn't such a painful task.  The material is very dry and many of the explanations within the text are very unclear.  I found myself reading the same pages over and over again because the book just couldn't hold my attention .  Overall, I do not recommend this book. It's far too dull to get much out of.
B004SKJTY6|4.0|we loved it it was fun to watch the whole family can enjoy it together for a family fun night

B000044TZU|5.0|A true troubador, Natalie outdoes herself on this album. It was a favorite for me when it came out, but somewhere along the way it got lost. I'm thrilled to have it back!  She again reminds that not all of her songs are just \\"songs\\", but that some are true prayers (psalms,hymns). Thank you,Natalie, for enriching my life and spirit.
B005LAIGFA|4.0|There is a lot to like about \\"J. Edgar.\\" The actors to a person give stellar performances. Leonard DeCaprio as both the young and aging Hoover is totally believable and gives a performance for which he surely will be nominated for awards. Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson, Mr. Hoover's longtime companion (?) is certainly easy on the eyes. It is easy to see why Hoover could have been attracted to him. Judi Dench as Hoover's mother just keeps on acting and can do anything. Naomi Watts as Hoover's Rosemary Woods is the totally devoted private secretary that every executive would kill for. Dustin Lance Black's (\\"Milk\\") screenplay and Clint Eastwood's directing (would that we all live to be 80 and look that good) are excellent. The understated photography is particularly effective. The details, the sets, the persons who swelled the crowd were flawless. But in the end the whole movie was not as good as the sum of its parts. And I cannot put my finger on just what was wrong. For one thing, the film certainly moved slowly. And as a friend of mine pointed out, there are certainly scenes in the movie that were pure fiction. On the other hand, the film is certainly worth seeing and is one that Mr. Eastwood has no reason to be ashamed of.
B000066NW0|5.0|Amazing product, very good cd and music from a very good singer Avril Lavigne. First cd of her musical career, new and cheeper.
1439102813|5.0|Frightening, heart-breaking, touching, and tender....so many adjectives can be used to describe this amazing book.  I found this book hard to put down and love so many things about it.  The characters are wonderful and their relationships seem so true to life, from the husband-wife relationship to the bewildered adult children to the superwoman trying to handle everything alone.  The whole butterfly theme--from the cover art to the name of her suicide file--is so perfect and seems to hold so much truth.  One of my favorite quotes is on Page 111: \\"She remembered being six or seven and crying over the fates of the butterflies in her yard after learning that they lived for only a few days.  Her mother had comforted her and told her not to be sad for the butterflies, that just because their lives were short didn't mean they were tragic.  Watching them flying in the warm sun among the daisies in their garden, her mother had said to her 'See, they have a beautiful life.' Alice liked remembering that.\\"   And I love Alice. I cheered for her, ached for her, and wanted to hug her.  And of course, she is still Alice.  Although she may not remember who she is, those who love her remember, and that can be enough.
B00005RFAI|5.0|PINK the most incredible singer ever, best cd of her musical carear with a lot of famous singles. Like new and very cheeper album.
B005KJZDXK|3.0|That pretty much sums up the review. A harmless enough holiday album, but I found no strong favorites on this one.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I ordered this blu-ray/DVD/digital copy on Nov 7, and afterwards saw the reviews that pointed out that Amazon was still showing a photo that indicated a digital copy, but that it expired Sept 13.  Mine did include a digital copy code, and when I tried to redeem it, I received this message from the WB website:  Thank you for submitting your request.  You will receive your Digital Copy disc in 2 weeks  So, I'm hopeful that it might work when it comes.  If not, it is not too hard to turn a DVD into a digital copy with Handbrake.

0385534639|1.0|I was completely prepared to love this book. But I only made it through about 80 pages, and then I was so disappointed and annoyed that I stopped reading.<br /><br />Morgenstern's style is frustratingly self-indulgent. It's like the publisher didn't assign an editor. She writes lots of descriptions of things that are themselves apparently marvelous, but her word choices are mediocre, so it all feels cloying and false.<br /><br />The third-person present-tense narrative makes all the characters seem very inaccessible. I didn't care about any of them.<br /><br />So many people have expressed amazement that Morgenstern has never published anything before this wildly-hyped-and-thus-obviously-brilliant-right? novel, but I have to say IT SHOWS. Her writing is tedious and undisciplined.<br /><br />Elmore Leonard said, 'If it sounds like writing, rewrite it.' Morgenstern would do well to try that approach.<br /><br />If you feel like reading something dark, sparkling, and fairytale-ish, try 'Deathless' by Catherynne Valente.
B005P89F1C|1.0|There is no need to write a long review as my sentiments mirror that of several other reviewers. Justin can not sing or his voice is changing. This is the worst christmas album I ever heard.  I ended up giving the CD to Goodwill when I couldn't even give it away! Pass on this one.... there are no redeeming qualities to this album.
0307593312|5.0|Wonderful Book!  I highly recommend. It finally made the best seller list today. Well writen. Interesting. Keeps your attention. Tells several stories at the same time. I am sure they will weave together later. I am only about half way thru.
0385534639|5.0|You are invited to witness a magical duel.<br /><br />The competitors: two children, Marco and Celia, torn from childhood to train under the world's greatest magicians.  Observe as they create a dazzling fairytale world of fantasy and splendor, showcasing their talents in a splendid array of enchanting tents and symbolic exhibitions.  Hold your breath in anticipation as they fall in love and are torn between the challenge and their hearts' desires.<br /><br />The venue: a late nineteenth century circus of dreams, spun of the magicians' imaginations, that appears mysteriously outside cities and opens its gates at nightfall, lit by the subtle gleam of the evening stars and the brilliance of the circus' blazing central bonfire.  Explore its myriad of exotic, sensual displays; stand mesmerized as you watch its living statues and contortionists; see your world foretold by the Tarot cards; feel yourself drawn into its magic and changed by its influence on your life, as are the characters that populate its exhibits.<br /><br />The spectators: a rich cast of characters that are both influential upon and influenced by the circus.  Sigh as their lives are irreversibly altered by its magic.  Weep as they experience tragedy and loss as a result of the circus' effect.  Cry tears of joy as they find love and purpose within its circles.<br /><br />How can I aptly describe how I feel about this book in a unique way?  My praise can only be a drop in the bucket of lauds that have been heaped upon it already.  With its intimate and beautiful prose, its sensual yet non-graphic love story and its broad cast of characters, Erin Morgenstern's metaphoric story held me spellbound from beginning to end.  The circus become for me, as it was for Celia, a 'wonder and comfort and mystery all together.'  Beautiful, beautiful novel.  According to Alexander, there are many kinds of magic; one of them, perhaps one of the most powerful, is storytelling.  Erin Morganstern is just such a magician.  Her story captivates you while you're reading it and stays with you long after the last page.  It will transform you into a reveur.eading it and stays with you long after the last page.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Picked this up on a whim when it was in the daily deal. The only thing that sucked was knowing that this was cancelled and there wouldn't be any more because it didn't take long to realize how great this show was and get hooked on it. I can't believe this was cancelled...  Money well spent.

B0065FFMR0|4.0|American Horror Story follows the lives of an average upper-middle class family who relocate to try and escape some demons from the past.  Unfortunately their new house has some demons of it's own (real demons).  I was hooked from the first episode, it is definitely a horror genre buff's dream and will leave you guessing each episode.<br />I truly think it is a must-see but I can't help but wonder how long they can keep it going.  Will this family just stay in a haunted house for eight years or so?  I doubt it.  Oh well it's great fun and I suggest it!
B003PTP4S6|5.0|This is simply one of the most exquisite cello CDs, classical CDs, I've ever heard, and that's a few.  Yo-Yo Ma defies proper accolades, and Morricone's compositions are among the world's classical greats - it's almost heresy to use them in films, but I understand a producer's desire to elevate any film with the work of this genius.  Ah, but Morricone played by Yo-Yo Ma...beyond description.    The opening \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\" (from the movie \\"The Mission\\") is so tender, so ethereal, so perfect in composition and execution, that it brings tears to the eyes and a swelling to the heart, as if the music came straight from God.  I am not given usually to hyperbole, so please forgive the reference to the Deity, but you have to hear this to understand.  It is utterly profound.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun and challenging puzzle game.  Beautiful graphics make this game a pleasure.  Hope to see more from these talented and creative developers.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|I have been a Stephen King fan since I read Salem's Lot in 1975.  The first big book I read was \\"The Stand\\" while home sick in bed after taking the Swine Flu Vaccine.  Very poignant read considering the way I was feeling.  During the summer of 2000, I paid $3.00 for the eBook, \\"Riding the Bullet\\", that I read on my Palm IV, PDA.  I knew that was the beginning of a wonderful match, Stephen King and eBooks.  We want to read wherever we are, and we don't want to carry a book nearly the size of a dictionary with us do we?  When Amazon Kindle first came out, I bought one.  Reading on Kindle is a pleasure, and I don't have to worry about packing away 20 book boxes of books when ever I move, which is too often.  (NB: This is an update to my original post.)  I had a problem with Simon & Schuster's Kindle edition pricing. Here's my problem with this book. The price for Kindle edition WAS $26.46 in Canada, and that is an increase from the original Kindle price of $24 or so.  I thought this was is insane, and that Simon & Shuster were setting a dangerous president where eBooks were priced higher than paper and ink copy.  This has changed and it appears the price is now more in line with other eBooks on Amazon and elsewhere.  I was simply shocked by what I saw as an outrageous price scheme, and I thought Simon & Schuster needed to know that Kindle readers are not willing to pay more for eBook content. Not me anyway.  It looks like kindle readers won, as the price has dropped.  I have since raised my rating of Stephen King's book, because I am enjoying the hardcover version of the story.  And, I purchased the Kindle version now that the price has dropped because I like to read when I travel and can't carry large books easily.  Plus, I do appreciate the live dictionary when reading.  A few writers like King throw in a word or two from time to time that I either am not familiar with, or not familiar with an odd use of a familiar word.    Now my review of the book.  It is very easy for me to get into following George through the late 50's and early 60's.  The crossover with other King books like IT, that I've not read are an interesting twist.  Thanks to Wikipedia, I was able to figure out some of the points I thought were included from other Derry, Maine stories, Like the Turtle, and the Clown. I am now going to look for a copy of IT and the Dark Tower to read on Kindle if possible.    In this book, King points out the failings of American culture of the 50's and 60's that many would like to forget.  Having lived in Dallas for several years, I'm thinking there are people who won't like this book for the way King Slams 60's Dallas racial bigotry and violence.  Dallas is nothing like that today, and I'm guessing there are many who lived there in the 60's who think King has been unfair.  I need to make a parting shot at Simon and Schuster for their attempt to KILL KINDLE.  They might have succeeded in charging several people $26.46 for the Kindle version of this book. I hope many people who held off buying the kindle version now buy it.    This is a 3 star book in my opinion.

B005ZB91KY|2.0|All though the movie I felt rushed, like the film makers were trying to get me out the door.  The scenes are predictable and forced in order to cram character development into 5 minutes. Even the action scenes were compiled into a simple montage that shown as a film within the movie.  The CG was also very poor. I guess they wanted to use the same cg from the film in the video games.  As a review for the amazon video service. It's very nice, but I would like to see more functions implemented like subtitles, settings management, and the ability to play HD movies on my computer not just on my tv.

B005C5A66G|4.0|Machine Head has been one of the bands that started great  (Burn My Eyes, The More Things Change), sucked for a few years (The Burning Red, Supercharger), and has came back strong (Through The Ashes Of Empires). The Blackening was AMAZING, so I wondered how they would top it. Unto The Locust would be their masterpiece...BUT....The Blackening came out in 2007. It is still a great record, however. I Am Hell is a great opener, and sets up the rest of the  record. Be Still And Know has a great sing along chourus, as well as Locust. Let us not forget the playing of the dudes. Robert (or Robb) Flynn is still a great riff master, as well as a great vocalist. You can tell that he has really stepped things up as far as playing and singing go...and why the hell not. Phil Demmel really impressed me with his lyric writing, as well as his awesome leads. The duel harmony lead on Be Still And Know is astounding. Dave McClain has stepped up his game (again), on this record. Adam has great chops, but, I expected more from him as far as writing goes. This Is The End starts off slow, and beautiful, and then CRUSHES you with its sonic assault, and catchy chourus. Now we come to the \\"odd song\\", Darkness Within. I liked the fact that the song does take a chance, but, it seems it went a little TOO far with the chance taking. Pearls Before The Swine brings things back to focus, though. The albums closer This Is Who We Are, is wonderful as well, with the kiddies opening the track, and it will stand as a great anthem.   If you are a Machine Head fan, or not, buy the record....well....buy The Blackening first, then this record.

The movie has details a viewer doesn't need about the characters, but doesn't include details a viewer unfamiliar with the Green Lantern story needs. I won't include the specifics for people who haven't seen the movie. This is a coming of age story about the origin of Green Lantern, yet the body language or the personality of the actor playing Hal Jordan doesn't change after he truly becomes Green Lantern. The female lead has a good body, but isn't pretty enough. Stay away.
B001HN6922|4.0|Cars 2 is enjoyable and well-animated, but definitely suffers from sequel-itis; it seems so concerned with generating excitement that it feels overly manufactured. The plot centers around Lightning McQueen & Co. traveling to Japan, Italy and the U.K. for a series of three races against an Italian superstar racecar. McQueen brings along his best friend Mater, but Mater embarasses him, and they have a falling out. The races and Mater friendship storyline probably would have been enough for most kids, but entwined with this is a complex James Bond type plot, involving an alternative fuel company, a bunch of 'lemon' cars, and lots of mistaken identity. My kids, ages 5 and 7, couldn't really follow that at all. I'm not sure I completely did either! And the focus on the cast of characters involved in this plot means we don't get to see a lot of some of the original Cars characters, other than Mater and Lightning McQueen.<br /><br />On the plus side, the friendship plot is touching, and having Mater overseas does create some amusing culture-clash scenes. Tokyo, Paris, the Italian Riviera and London are all beautifully rendered, stunning really. And the race scenes are lots of fun. So all in all, it was enjoyable, just not a home run like the first one was for me.
1451648537|5.0|I believe this book should have been called \\"A Brilliant Visionary and Showman!\\" Steve Jobs has an amazing ability to redefine a problem or approach with the end result of having eliminated the problem. What he appears to have trouble with is the ability to put aside emotion and dogma when it comes to people who disagree with him. He doesn't have a disciplined nature. I thought I was the only one who detested PowerPoint presentations. Jobs once said, if you need slides, it shows you don't know what you are talking about. He likes people who can talk things through, as do I.  Jobs also subscribe to the belief that creativity comes from spontaneous meetings or random discussions. This is one of the reasons I like to brainstorm with my colleagues and friends whenever I find myself stuck on an issue.<br />Kelly Yip<br />November 2011
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I had been waiting for these films to make their Blu-Ray debut. And in my opinion they don't disappoint. Though I recommend you purchase the set from Best Buy.<br /><br />I bought that set because you can get them in a Steel Case, and it contains 6 discs vs the 3 you get for 10 dollars less.<br />You get the Blu-Ray/DVD/ and Digital copies of all 3 films.<br /><br />The new documentaries are a nice insight into each film along with all the original features added in with them.<br /><br />I only found the first movie to have some graininess, and that was with only a select few in door scenes. Not a problem for me.<br /><br />Overall the Blu Ray editions are beautiful, much cleaner and crisp then the originals, flawless sound. I watched the first movie and all the new Return to Jurassic Park features tonight. I sampled the other 2 Blu Ray editions on my PC and found them to be flawless as well.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|After all the philosophical thoughts in the comments, I must admit, that my feelings are much easier to explain.  I like that film, not only because of the determination of the young hero to do the right thing in life.  Not politics but human beings in their struggle to survive were impressive to me.   The figure of Saladin - one of the greatest and wisest men of his time - still gives us much to learn from, especially our generals nowadays are far away from his greatness.    I do not know whether it was  caused by his belief in Qur'an. He was a Kurdish man born in Tikrit/Iraq who later in his life became the Sultan of  Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Kurdistan.  He was very much admired for his chivalry by the crusaders and European nobilities, whom he had beaten in the battle, which this movie is about.   The crusaders were as bloodthirsty as the God of the Old Testament whose rules of slaughter they took to heart.  -  Not so Saladin (exception in this movie: He beheaded  Raynald of Châtillon, who broke treaties between them).  Otherwise Saladin was known for his largesse.   Learning that Richard I. (Lion-heart) during the Third Crusade was suffering under the heat during battle, he sent him snow from the mountains and fresh fruit. Both never met personally but negotiators for Richard I. were deeply impressed by the generosity of Saladin.   Lessing's drama  \\"Nathan the Wise\\" shows Saladin asking Nathan, what religion is the true one.  Nathan answers with the famous Ring Parable that the ring's powers could prove true, to live a life that is pleasant in the eyes of God and mankind. But that would be another movie story.
B004AYCWY4|1.0|Like his god, Charles Darwin, Richard Dawkins drowns you in classic fallacies based on Arguments from Analogy.  There is no limit to his, and other evolutionists', use of Argument from Analogy without delimiting it within sensible parameters.  Potatoes have eyes, therefore, we evolved from potatoes.  Birds are said to have evolved from dinosaurs because of the alleged similar morphology.  Well, not all dinosaurs were Theropods.  Some were Sauropods.  So, I have yet to see the four legged bird that reflects the morphology of its ancestor sauropod.  The fact is, dinosaurs were man's contemporary, and may still be contemporary in some remote parts of the world, such as the Amazon and Congo.  Dinosaurs were called \\"dragons\\" in the old days.  The word dinosaur was coined in the 19th century (1842 by Sir Richard Owen).  The word dinosaur is used nowadays to imply some creature that lived in a remote past, far away from human history.  It is key to the evolutionists claim that \\"fossilization\\" implies their entire hypothesis.  However, without the great Flood that Noah experienced, there wouldn't be a catastrophie to cause fossilization.  It's too bad fossilized humans are ignored.  Of course, that would destroy that comfortable faith in evolution, wouldn't it?

B003R50FRI|2.0|I'm a voracious reader of some intelligence I believe, and have also spent a decent amount of time in India....including the location of this book.    I have had Shantaram on my bookshelf for some time, and despite getting quite a way through the book, on repeated attempts was just unable to finish it.  I found it boring at times and was unable to get into it.  It was \\"interesting\\" but did not grab me.  May give it another go, but struggled.  There are better books around I believe. If you're intrigued by India, try A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth.

B00009NHC5|5.0|I first saw this movie in the early 70s, and have seen it several times since.  I won't go into a summary of the plot, since so many others have done that already, but I will say that I have used it in my psychology classes with great success.  After studying the theories of personality development, I show the students Wait Until Dark and have them select one of the characters and one of the theories, then write a paper analyzing that character's personality.  They have really enjoyed the movie and the assignment, while learning a great deal about psychology.    I know exactly when the audience will jump, as does any fan of this movie, and I really get a kick out of watching the audience when that part comes up.  Once, a girl was sitting by her boyfriend, totally engrossed in the story, and she had his hand, holding it in a death grip up near her mouth when the \\"jump\\" part happened.  She bit through his thumbnail!! So don't tell me it isn't scary.  It just proves that to be scary doesn't require blood, guts, and gore.  This film has fine performances by a cast of extremely talented stars and I highly recommend it.
B004LROMSO|3.0|Another take on Arthur and \\"Camelot\\"? Indeed. While the production values here are pretty good, though everything is a bit well-scrubbed and placed in more original settings, the storyline re-workings are what draw a viewer to continue on this newest adventure of \\"Camelot\\". The development of the antagonistic relationship between half brother, Arthur and half sister, Morgana is the driving force of the dramatic huff-ings and puff-ings that carry the weight of the series. Fortunately, it's enough to carry our interest. At first, I wasn't sure about the lead actor playing Arthur- but the casting risk seems to pay off as we do get to see real growth of the character from the obstacles he has to overcome- many of them of his own making. I will be interested enough to watch a second season...

1401324517|5.0|If you are a fan of professional tennis, then you already know that Rafa is one of the greatest tennis players of all time.  This book unlocks the secrets to his mental toughness, his family ties, his approach to the game, and you will learn that Rafa has wisdom well beyond a twenty-something.  I enjoyed learning about the mental toughness and his character.  There is much more to Rafa than meets the eye.  The book also details his thinking in critical tennis matches he has played.  I didn't appreciate the review, point by point, of all of these matches except for the 2008 Wimbledon final, during which he and Roger Federer played the greatest tennis match of all time.  I wondered why he was writing a book in the middle of his career.  Rafa displays the greatest mental toughness on the tennis tour, therefore, this is a must read not just for tennis aficionados, but also can serve as a manual for anyone participating in sports.  The secrets to his game are revealed, and it is worth the read.

B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Cassia finds herself in the farmlands near the Outer Provinces. Day in day out she scratches in the soil planting seeds, tiny specks of hope thrown into the cold ground. Far from all traces of her former life in the center of The Society, including her family, Xander and Ky. She survives on the meager messages that sporadically come from the Port, scraps of love from her parents, who loved and trusted her enough to set her free down her path of discovery. A trip that will hopefully lead to a reunion with Ky and her destiny outside of the omniscient clamp of The Society. She clings to the memories of the stolen minutes she shared with Ky. Her determination to find him sustains her through the toil in the dirt. Will Cassia escape and strike out to find Ky in the wilderness?<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />*The beginning of the book continues where Matched left us dangling. Cassia is scraping by on the Farmlands trying desperately to reach Ky. Again I felt the overhanging dread and anxiety of the suppressing, demands of Societal Life. In the Outer Provinces Ky is in a fight for his life. Society is dumping the castoffs, Anomalies and Aberrations, into the deserted villages and using them as decoys, knowing that this is a sufficient way to have them conveniently eradicated without having to dirty their own hands. I appreciated the chilling, terrifying parallels once again presented. In Matched, I witnessed the sickening, dread of life in a strictly controlled environment, reminding me of events that transpired during World War II. The massacring of the unwanted populace in Crossed is reminiscent of the genocidal slaughter that history witnessed in our world. A stark, frightening reminder of the darkness that mankind can possess.<br />*I liked unearthing the past of Ky. Crossed offers Ky's view point and through his voice I gained an understanding of his history, feelings toward Cassia and all the events in his life that carved and chiseled him into the man he is today.<br /><br />And The Not So Much:<br />*Normally my reviews contain an abundance of positive points. I struggled with this book because unlike its predecessor, there is not much for me to rave about. Crossed starts out thrilling but about half way through it flounders, languishes and drags to a stagnant finish. The latter portion of the book involves the characters dallying in the deserted farmer's confines. Almost nothing happens and the gripping sense of anxiety fades and you are left with a dull, lethargic story. A devastating let down in comparison to Matched.<br />*This book felt like a filler book. There are no big developments, shocks or major events. Nor, is there significant movement in the plot regarding the characters' struggles to break free from The Society. Instead, Ms. Condie spends the majority of the pages trying to impress with fragments of poetry and metaphorical descriptions, that fail to elicit much of a response. While I appreciate that she is a talented author, this time I think she overreached and tried too hard to produce a work with stunning detail hoping for a prolific impact. It ends up fizzling and falling flat.<br />*Again as in Matched I hungered to snatch up details regarding The Society's rise to power and eventual corruption and twisting of ideals. There is nothing in this book to satisfy my palate. All I found was a tiny taste, that stated Society was initially a choice and it formed to stave off another \\"Warming Event\\" and to eliminate illness. That is it! If she truly aspired to write a sandwich book she could have at least thrown me, the starving reader, a few satiating scraps of information to feed my craving for knowledge on The Society. My stomach is still growling and churning, longing for nourishment.<br />*This book has two points of view, Cassia and Ky, while I liked seeing through Ky's eyes, the concept just does not work for me. I do not mind the flickering of view points in books, I know many readers disdain them but for me if they are well executed it usually is not an issue. In Crossed the voices flit back and forth so many times it gave my brain whiplash. I would be reading along engrossed in a view point and then wham two pages later it switched. Sometimes (even despite each chapter being labeled with either Ky or Cassia) I failed to perceive the shift. I think one of the main reasons for this, was no radical differentiation between the two voices.<br />*Cassia, what happened? I admired her tenacity and determination to follow her heart even at a high cost. She makes her decision to be with Ky and then after near death and personal sacrifice she is ruminating over her choice? Really? Big fail especially since Xander is for the most part absent in this book.<br />*The author introduces three new characters, Vic, Eli and India but she neglects to fully develop them. Vic was the character I had the best grasp on but he is not involved in the entire story. India particularly needed more augmentation. Again, due to the lack of action or story progression she should at least take the time to fill in the secondary characters that are spending time with Ky and Cassia especially since there are only four characters for most of the book.<br /><br />At the end of Crossed I felt profound disappointment. This book fails miserably compared to the shining promise of Matched. I truly missed the prevailing, foreboding sense of apprehension that I grew accustomed to in the first book. Unfortunately, this book takes you to the deserted plains of the farm lands and leaves you there languishing over subpar poetry. If you are a die hard fan of this series then you may like Crossed but I am afraid the overall majority will leave this book in the dust. I would advise proceeding with caution and I can wholeheartedly recommend that you first borrow this book instead of buying. At this point I am conflicted as to whether I will continue with this trilogy. Ms. Condie has a steep mountain to overcome after this miss. She does provide a faint spark of redemption with the transpiring of the final events in this book. I hope she has a mass of tricks in her writer's bag to dazzle and woo readers back for the big finale.<br /><br />Favorite Quotations:<br />\\"And it is strange that absence can feel like presence. A missing so complete that if it were to go away, I would turn around, stunned, to see that the room is empty after all, when before it at least had something, if not him.\\"<br /><br />\\"Because in the end you can't always choose what to keep. You can only choose how you let it go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Watching Ky wake is better than a sunrise. One moment, he's still and down deep, and the next moment I can see him returning out of the dark, coming to the surface. His face shifts, his lips move, his eyes open. And then his smile, the sun.\\"lly is not an issue. In Crossed the voices flit back and forth so many times it gave my brain whiplash.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It has been years since I have purchased a book I could not put down. I'm too tired to describe it in great detail, because I woke up early this morning and decided to re-read the entire book the night after finishing it, but suffice it to say: BUY THIS. You won't regret it!
B003L77G8I|4.0|As some have said, the season was episodic, ups and downs.  It did contain the best episode of the whole 6 seasons -- \\"The Doctor in the Photo\\" -- which was written at a level far above the rest (and acted beautifully by Emily Deschanel).
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|UPDATE: I followed the advice of many Amazon posters and contacted Flixster again. I gave them my redemption code, and they sent me a code for an iTunes digital copy, which I have downloaded. :o)  I love getting a digital copy of my movies, along with the DVD, so then I can watch a movie on my iPod, or my computer, or my tv. I bought this edition of HP7p2 at Target because I'm a HP nut and wanted it TODAY! :o) I was skeptical of the UltraViolet copy, since I'd never heard of it before, and I wasn't excited to use it at all when I read the back of the DVD case and found out I'd have to create not just one, but two new accounts and usernames and passwords to both UltraViolet and Flixster. However, that seemed to be the only digital copy combo available at the store, so I bought it.  Too bad I didn't do my homework online first.  I followed the instructions to sign up for Flixster and UltraViolet. In theory, the concept behind UltraViolet looks promising: any six users can access any one account from any device, streaming the movies as they wish, plus you can have a certain number of \\"hard\\" downloads to actual computers/devices. Cool, eh?  I downloaded and installed Flixster Collections, their software for viewing their movies on your computer. It has a really odd interface that makes you scroll horizontally, which is super annoying, but that's neither here nor there. Anyway, I went about downloading the movie to my computer, and I was surprised when it said Download Complete! after about 2 seconds. Really?  The file that was downloaded was 1 byte large, so obviously something went wrong. I deleted the file and tried again, with the same result. I wondered if maybe the movie didn't download really until the first time I tried to watch it (which I know makes no sense, but I couldn't figure out what was wrong), so I pressed play from within Flixster Collections. Predictably, the movie didn't load, and I was left watching a progress circle spin around on itself forever and ever.  Flixster's help section of their website is a joke, and the troubleshooting team, who did respond quickly to my problem \\"ticket\\", didn't really help either (they suggested deleting the file and re-downloading it... yeah, did that). I declared the downloaded copy of HP7p2 a flop.  But there was still the copy I can download to my smartphone, so I downloaded that. It was something like 600+MB, so I used a large portion of my  monthly 5GB data plan to download it (I access all my web use through my data plan, so a file that big is significant). Can you guess what happened once it finally finished downloading? That's right, it didn't work. I restarted my phone and tried again, but it still didn't work. I don't know why, it just tried to start and then said it couldn't. It wouldn't work.  So I tried to stream the video on my phone. That didn't work either. I have a MyTouch 4G, running on Gingerbread, so it's not like I'm working on some weak tiny smartphone--this phone is quite capable, but no go on the streaming.  There was one option left for accessing my digital copy of HP7p2: streaming online from my computer. I logged on and clicked to watch the movie. It buffered... and buffered... and buffered. And then it started. Alas, the film was grainy and pixelated. It might have looked nice on a 2-inch screen, but it looked horrible on my laptop.  Pathetic. All I wanted was a digital copy of Harry Potter to watch on my iPod or computer when I'm not plugged in to the internet. Now, not only do I NOT have a digital copy of HP7p2, I also have a huge portion of my monthly data plan wasted, and I have a DVD/Blu-Ray combo I can't return to Target because it's been opened. The only thing I can do is to warn other people: DON'T BUY THE ULTRAVIOLET MOVIE. Go to iTunes and buy a digital copy there; that's what I'm going to do. I'll never buy another movie associated with Flixster or UltraViolet again.
1451648537|5.0|A fine portrait of a man who spanned genius and flaws. One of the very few books that I pre-ordered from Amazon.  Genius in what he did and the imprint he leaves in everything he touched. Flaws in that he never gave a thought to degrading those he felt inferior. But the bottom line is that his demeanor brought out the best in all most of the time.  Whether you are an Apple fan (and I am one) or not, we can only hope that his legend will live on with vision, innovation, and products that continue to captivate our imagination and bring a \\"wow\\" to our voices time and time again.

0061743526|5.0|One of the great classics.  The movie version is extremely good but nothing beats reading a classic novel with prfound substance, written beautifully. Who wouldn't love Scout and her innocence to see things as they are and speak of it...nor her father Atticus...a tower of strength and moral courage in a time of great and open prejudice toward our fellow man.  The humor is warm.  The seriousness of predjudice is unsettling and real.  The outcome though sad for Tom and his family, is tender and sweet for Bo. Read the book and be transformed back in time...when rolling about in an old rubber tire brought more simple fun than the overwhelming complexities of today's all absorbing electronic entertainment that our children are drawn into.  Simple and less really is best.
0765365278|2.0|The Mistborn trilogy was wonderful, Elantris was great, Warbreaker was not as good, but still better than the majority of current fantasy.  So I was eagerly awaiting new material from Sanderson.  The size of \\"The Way of Kings\\" gave me pause, but I finally got the determination to read it.  Conclusion?  I'm probably done reading Sanderson.  He seems to have gotten the affliction that bedevils many newly successful authors, that of excess.  He thinks that if a little is good, more is better, and much more is much better.  This entire book reads as backstory, with little of significance happening in it.  Perhaps this is to be expected, as first book of a planned 10, but I expect SOMETHING to happen in 1250 pages.  The final battle was exciting, but really didn't change much.  I'm also not a fan of endless series (The Wheel of Time was originally supposed to be 7 books), and 10 books, each of which is long enough to be a normal trilogy in its own right, is just too much to spend my time on.  Sanderson teaches creative writing, and the character development, plotting, and style all reflect much effort.  But he really needs to learn pacing, and he really needs to learn how to tell how to tell a story in fewer words.  He also needs a good editor to rein in his excesses.  In short, this monstrosity (Sanderson's word) probably would have been a pretty good novel at half the length, or even a third.  It's a shame to lose a good author to his own ego.  Here's hoping he writes a few other novels in between the books of this series.
0385535139|4.0|I have never doubted Grisham's ability to tell a story.  Unfortunately most of his books recently have been preachy at best and boring at worst.  In The Litigators he has created several very enjoyable characters.  Finley and Fogg, although not lovable, are interesting.  David Zinc is a very decent guy and almost believable.  There were times in the book that I was ready for the story to become trite and then there would be a plot twist.    This book does not invite nor need deep analysis.  It is just a fun read.

Yea, it's typical switch up movie but its entertaining and delivers a great message.

I'm not going to say that this is a fantastic and a must buy, but neither am I going to relentlessly criticize it while completely contradicting well written 5 star reviews (a persistent occurance here on amazon).  As the title says I did buy the R.A.T 3 and I say so because I see most reviews on this page to be only about the 5-9 models.  First I will start with what I liked about the mouse and my first impressions etc etc.  The shipping was painless, quick, and arrived perfect as I have come to expect from amazon (super saver shipping).  It comes in a nicely packaged box, nice design.  I expected it to come with a disk for the drivers and software but no big deal.  The mouse itself is a good size, not to large or small.  overall it is very stylish and appears to be pretty well made.  After downloading the software I opened up the program and tried configuring buttons to test it out.  All went well, and it is very easy to map the buttons.  The main buttons were adequate but the scroll wheel and dpi switch I thought felt great.  The tracking performance worked fine with no errors to speak of.  Lifting the mouse will not do anything like what is said about the more advanced models dual eye sensor.  Now moving to the negative points, and what earned this mouse its final score.  First, even though aspects of the mouse appear well made and look good, two things really annoyed me.  The profile switch button LCD indicator looked cheap and the red wire going through the bottom of the mouse looks very poorly constructed.  I could overlook this easily if it weren't for this mouse simply being not very comfortable.  Two things contribute mainly to why I dislike the mouse so much, first the lack of smoothness on the body and the placement of certain things give my hand a feeling of constraint or a feeling of not being able to move much without hitting something.  Second is the shape of the palm rest.  it is a little higher than the front of the mouse and has an awkward ridge dropping off the right side of it making it very irritating over time.  This may not seem like that big a deal but it makes all the difference.  Enough difference to where I removed the rest entirely (yes this section is actually partially adjustable.  Allen wrench or screwdriver required) to see if it helped.    After using the mouse for some time for browsing and playing a few games I felt unsatisfied for the price paid and decided to return it and will likely update this review with how it turns out.  I am now considering some other models of computer mice including the popular mx518, the razer deathadder, and the appealing SteelSeries Xai.  One last word, everyone is different and opinions of mice can vary radically from person to person.  If possible you should try to demo the mouse first and see how you like it.  In conclusion, I hope everybody can find a decent mouse they like (and don't throw away the receipt!).  I hope this review was informative and set apart from the rest.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|LOVED IT!! Great movie.  Some places had me CRACKING UP! and others had me crying.  It is bordering on TOTAL chick flick, I'll admit but still good.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|My grandsons love these toys.  On their birthdays, they immediately got all excited, and wanted to play with them before opening any of their other presents.  Personally, I know little about their durability. They can be very expensive when you have multiple children to buy for. I do know that these are on their Christmas lists for this year.
B004WO774M|1.0|From what I can tell, these extras are not worth buying it at the actual value of $19.99. Any seller doubling, tripling, quadrupling, or as I see currently sextupling the price, should be ashamed of themselves. But if you're a buyer considering paying this amount for it, shame on yourself. You can watch the extras on you tube and they're not much to look at. Some day I'll end up with blu ray probably. I bought the combo pack when WB refused to make this a wide regular dvd release. It may mean delaying gratification, but if the alternative is paying someone SIX TIMES what the dvd is worth (and I don't think it's worth the original price for what WB didn't offer dvd users), then I will gladly wait. Buyer beware.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|When it comes to Christmas music, people either love it, hate it, or tolerate it. Most of us probably fall into the latter category. A song now and then is fine, and if its an artist we like we may actually listen to it more than once. For the artist, a Christmas album is sometimes obligatory for their audience. However, occasionally, there is a Christmas album that is done for fun, with no real expectations of being overly celebratory. This is where A Very She & Him Christmas seems to fit.  She & Him consists of M. Ward and Zooey Deschanel, who are two of the most likable musicians in the alt-folk scene. Given the success of their previous albums (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2) it may seem a risky move to release a Christmas album, given that they are not your traditional holiday crooners. It seems to be a risk that pays off, with simple renditions of comfortably holiday songs. Most of the album is pretty low key and mellow, with 'Baby It's Cold Outside' being a bubbly exception. It is then countered by perhaps the most melancholic version of 'Blue Christmas' one will ever hear.  The magic of this venture is the simplicity that is maintained with such well known songs. A lot of musicians try to be showy and ass extra flair when it comes to holiday music. She & Him maintain their integrity as musicians and keep their comfortable and cozy sound throughout the album.  As Zooey & M. traverse their way through any album, they create an intimate and fun sound that makes them feel like your best friends after one listen. So, when they sing their holiday songs, it's no wonder that one may feel the need to add them to the Christmas card list and bake some sugar cookies. It is easy to welcome this duo into one's home for the holidays.
B00023B1LC|5.0|Dvd plays great, came with out scratches and doesn't skip or get stuck.  I love the Borne movies and had to complete the set.
B005HSL626|5.0|Do not listen to stupid reviews. The ads are not inappropriate at all, and the game does not erase your high scores after 5 days. These people are stupid and just want something to complain about.  Awesome graphics, a lot of different game modes and tons of unlockables. One of the best games I own.
B005IY3CMQ|5.0|Anybody who gives this majestic revisiting less than 5 stars should have their head remixed...and re-examined...just sayin'...absolutely stunning stuff mon! :)
0385535139|4.0|This is a story of a David vs Goliath, one of John Grisham's common premises.  A a small law firm takes on a giant one and its client in a class action lawsuit against a big drug company that's cholesterol drug is killing people.  The protagonist used to work for the big firm that represents the drug company.  You don't have to hate the drug industry, or big corporate America, to appreciate this setup. If you enjoyed Grisham's [[ASIN:0385339607 The Rainmaker]] (decades ago), you'll enjoy this one. It's up there with his best, although still nothing beats [[ASIN:0440245923 The Firm: A Novel]].
4789009637|5.0|\\"Genki: I, An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese\\" is an excellent way to start learning Japanese. It is a college (or motivated high schooler) oriented text that teaches hiragana, katakana and starts you on kanji (Chinese characters). It moves quickly but provides good vocabulary lists (again oriented to college age), dialogues, grammar notes so you can make proper sentences, and plenty of exercises to practice. There is also a work book and a CD (separate purchases). Unfortunately we did not get the CD (the secondary seller did not provide one) so I cannot evaluate it. We have a college student teaching me and my two high school aged kids using this book and she provides the correct pronunciation as well as correcting our exercises. You could probably use this book without a tutor but you'd have to have the CD and be motivated. Our local college uses this text book and we could transition to their class. I have been told that one would need to complete this book and \\"Genki II\\" to begin being fluent in an all-Japanese language setting.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I finished this book yesterday but waited until today to write my review because I didn't want to gush, but I still feel the same way today - this book is so awesome.  I'm definitely a Stephen King fan, but I think people who have never read his books would love this one.  The concept of time travel and the consequences is something that is always fascinating, if we change one thing in history, how does it affect the world for years to come?<br /><br />King's descriptions of how life was in the early 60's is so realistic, I felt like I was there (well, I actually WAS there).  He talks about so many details from that time, things I once knew but had forgotten, like Ship 'n Shore blouses for girls, Ban-lon slacks for men, drive-in movies, and the concept of seeing these things from my life in 2011.<br /><br />This story is not typical King, there are no creepy-crawlies, no monsters waiting in the closet.  There is a very fine, touching love story that is interwoven throughout the story.  I actually cried 3 times toward the end of the book, something I've never experienced before in a King book, and I've read everything he has written.  I was a little concerned about how it was going to end, was he going to have an unsatisfactory end, leave us hanging?  But no, the ending wrapped up the story very nicely, maybe not the way we want it to, but still very nicely.  At the end, the story was truly \\"finished\\", doesn't leave you to draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />I loved this book so much I wish I could have a do-over.  I know I can always read it again, and experience nuances that I missed the first time, but I can never read it with the same sense of anticipation and just pure happiness that I did the first time.  Please read this book, you will love it!
B000FC1AGG|1.0|It is absolutely shocking that this poorly written book received such high ratings. The dialogue is full of aggravating &#34;Erm&#34;s and &#34;Er&#34;s. As in, &#34;Emma, can I see you in my office?&#34; Emma replies, &#34;Er, sure.&#34; Where was the editor? I hated myself for reading this book and the trite story it told. Excuse me while I throw myself into traffic.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|Im really liking this album, and evanescence is probably my favorite or second favorite bands. but the thing is, with evanescence, their music really had to grow on me for me to fully appreciate the songs. And its the same with this album, just as it was with the previous ones. Im not saying its their best, or their worst. and i dont rate music overly-poor, or overly-good just because the Name of a band name i like/hate is linked to it. No. I really just like and appreciate this album. First impression id say 3.5 stars... after obsessively listening to each song and letting them sink in.... i now give it a 5 and say that some of my favorite evanescence songs are on this album...
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 BLU-RAY REISSUE ***<br /><br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet's delicious \\"Amelie\\" wowed many hearts back in 2001 and has remained a warmly remembered favourite ever since. Now in October 2011 (UK) - to celebrate its 10th Anniversary - \\"Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain\\" (its full French title) - finally makes its way onto BLU RAY - and I'm thrilled to say it's a peach.<br /><br />First up - lovers off the film who already own the 2DVD Special Edition set from 2002 - will be glad to see that all of its extras have made the transfer to this Momentum Pictures Blu Ray reissue (see list below). The card-wrap on the outside of the keep case gives it a classy feel (and it's cheap too). But of course the best news is the picture quality, which is rarely anything less than BEAUTIFUL.<br /><br />Some words on this because it's such a huge part of the movie. Jeunet was bitterly disappointed at how his 1991 film \\"Delicatessen\\" translated to screen - it seemed that none of the work he put in showed on the actual print. He took no chances with the densely populated and complicated \\"Amelie\\" - it was filmed entirely in digital - which meant that post-production could add or detract whatever he wanted with precision. The film therefore has a very deliberate pallet of colours - particularly GREEN and RED. It gives the whole look a treated feel - almost a glow - but it's exquisite - and subtle too. It's gorgeous to look at and was deliberately rendered to be so. The scene where Amelie walks in the attaching tunnels of the Paris Subway sees the walls look 'lime green' and the effect is beautiful (digitally changed).<br /><br />There are so many great visual moments too - unplugging the aerial of a male neighbour who tricked her as he tries to watch football, her mother examining her puckered fingertips in the bathtub, explaining the sights and sounds of the market as she rushes a blind man down a street, skimming stones on the canal outside her home, her father examining her as a child and mistaking her excitement as a defective murmur (dialogue above), stealing the garden gnome, Blubber the suicidal goldfish, the book of discarded passport photos made by her equally odd male fancy (a wonderfully cast Mathieu Kassovitz) - all are realized and framed with a warmth that fills the entire film. BRUNO DELBONNEL received many nominations for Cinematography and won some too.<br />[Note: The natural default for the print is 2.35:1 - which means lines at the top and bottom of the screen - but even if you stretch it to 16:9 aspect (full screen) - the subtitles are still visible on the bottom of the screen (just about).]<br /><br />Then there's the script. Co-written by the Director and GUILLAUME LAURANT - and told almost entirely in narration - right from the off its quirky, imaginative and on many occasions - ball-breakingly funny (a sex scene in the toilet of the Windmill Caf&eacute; between a jealous patron and hypochondriac woman is fantastically good). Being spoken in French too only adds to \\"The Big Lebowski\\" madness of it all as random events pepper the story of Amelie - a kindly yet mischievous dreamer who works as a waitress in a Paris cafe. The place is emotional central - peopled by a boss with half a leg and a man who bursts plastic bubbles under his table as he spies on a woman who spurned him.<br /><br />There are two particular scenes of cinematic genius - first is when Amelie finds a tin box of toys hidden behind a tile in her bathroom wall put there by a little boy 40 years back. She then tracks down the now older Dominic Bretodeau (masterful acting by Maurice Benichou) and lures him to a phone booth where he finds this lost treasure. His tears and look of childlike wonder is cinema at its very best. He then talks about it at a bar afterwards with Amelie listening close by. His dialogue is full of heartbreak and wisdom.<br /><br />Second - there's the elderly frail painter Raymond Dufayel (a superb turn by Serge Merlin) who hasn't ventured out of his apartment for decades (nicknamed `The Glass Man' because of his supposed frail bones). Raymond continually paints and repaints a Renoir classic - but never seems to get it just so. A local grocer's boy called Lucien who is belittled by his bully Dad - brings Raymond his groceries and goodies. There is a scene between Lucien (great casting in Jamel Debbouze) and the wiser Raymond where the older observer of life helps the young put-upon boy to vent his rage with humour - it's touching, inspiring and poignant.<br /><br />But the movie belongs to AUDREY TAUTOU who quite effortlessly made millions of men fall in love with her - and pine helplessly for her presence ever since. There's that touch of Audrey Hepburn beauty and class about her - a very rare thing in cinema these days. She could boil an egg and guys would stand there drooling. It was her breakthrough role and rightly so.<br /><br />Rewatching \\"Amelie\\" on BLU RAY has been a delight - and I'd forgotten how funny, charming and deliciously inventive it is - all the way through.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and crack-open this Cr&egrave;me Boulez of a film...it has layer after layer of flavour - and I for one loved every soppy calorie-filled minute of it.<br /><br />ASPECT RATIO: 16:9 (Original Aspect Ratio 2.35:1)<br />REGION CODE: B<br />AUDIO: DTS-HD French 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br />Commentary with Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet<br />Making Of Amelie<br />Director's Interview<br />Q&A with Director and Cast<br />The Look Of Amelie (including interviews with Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Bruno Delbonnel)<br />Audrey Tautou's Funny Faces<br />Screen Tests<br />Photo Gallery<br />Storyboards<br />Trailersass Man' because of his supposed frail bones).

B00664C0PC|2.0|I have been a fan of this series for a long time.  Last year I thought the season started off slow and then picked up, and I am hoping that this year is the same.  While there is always something distasteful in the show, gore wise I mean, this year, it seems, the writers are really going for shock value.  That is all this is.  Sensationalism.  I have always had a problem with the bed hopping and sexual parts in the show, I have been able to overlook it.  These are not my values, and I certainly don't ever let my children watch or even be around while I am watching.  The stories and the science are interesting.  I loved the comedy and the electricity between the two main characters.  So far, the writers aren't writing this year for the love interest, just the gore.  The relationship between Brennan and  Booth is sterile and cold.  It is almost like she was artificially inseminated after all.  And I don't understand why they don't at least talk about marriage.  I guess this is the carrot that is being held out in front of us all this year. Yes, they live together, supposedly love each other, are having a baby together, but will they get married and live happily ever after?  And I don't care how clinical Brennan is supposed to be, pregnancy usually causes a woman to feel nauseous.  Some of the things I have seen in the last two episodes have made me nauseous, and I am not pregnant. I pay almost two dollars an episode to watch this.  I figure I am going to give it one more episode to see if the shock value subsides and the relationship part becomes more realistic. I'm probably not being realistic.  The bottom line is that I would never have started watching this show if these were the first episodes I saw.  Too bad.
B000000993|5.0|Very interesting and captivating music and lyrics, sung by the best singer in the world. His voice is unmatched.   I don't think music like this has been created before, this is really something special. It might take some time to get into it, but when you do, it is so rewarding!  One of the best cd's in my collection!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I originally wrote a review complaining about the price of Stephen King's new book, lamenting the cost and giving it a one star without ever having read a single chapter.  I was lambasted with negative comments about my remarks, all of them absolutely correct.  I couldn't have been more out of line.  I'm not sure what I was thinking when I wrote that review, maybe I shouldn't have picked that day to kick my coffee habit.  At any rate, I listened to all of you, purchased the book, and loved every page.  I have read most of Mr. King's works, some of them I devoured, some of them I struggled to read, this one is probably my favorite. Great premise, wonderful characters, realistic portrayal of the USA in the late 50's and early 60's and a heartbreaking love story. Stephen King at his best and worth every cent!

B004EPYZSK|5.0|My 13 year old grand-daughter and I saw this movie and we both thought it was a good movie. I had no clue what the plot was. I had seen the trailer earlier and decided I had to see this movie. I knew there were cowboys and aliens and Harrison Ford. That's all I needed to know. And I was not disappointed. My grand-daughter said it was stressful in a good way. We were on the edge of our seats  most of the time. As I left the theater I thought I must have that on DVD. And I don't purchase very many movies anymore with a redbox on every corner.
B005FVA3LK|4.0|I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE.  MY WIFE LIKES IT BUT I DO NOT.I LISTENED TO ALL THE CDS.I THOUGHT CDS WOULD HAVE SLEEVES BUT I GUESS IT COSTS TO MUCH MONEY FOR THE GROUP. IT SOUND A LITTLE LOUDER BUT IT SOUNDS ABOUT THE SAME.IF I HAD MY WAY I WOULD HAVE NOT BOUGHT IT BUT IT WAS A GIFT FOR HER.I AM GLAD I DID NOT BUY THE UBBER DELUXE.

B000F8O35U|5.0|We ordered The Little Mermaid Movie for our 2 year old granddaughter.  We went to Disney this past fall and she fell in love with Arial.  After looking at all of the retailers, and at the Disney store, I was told that this movie was in the vault for several more years.  We looked on Amazon and found it!  The movie arrived within days and was PERFECT and BRAND NEW!!!  This Christmas will be extra special with the addition of this classic Disney movie!  Thank you!
1860498825|5.0|I ordered Fingersmith because our book club had chosen it.  What a wonderful surprise. The main characters, Maud and Sue, really come to life.  The author's way of taking us from one to the other, telling us each of their life stories with such great twists, made it a page turner for me.
1594744769|3.0|Today's review is on Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs<br /><br />I must say that I only picked up this book because of all the hype I have heard about it. Though the cover is interesting, it didn't really pull me in. Thankfully though I found the story did. The story is well written, with such vivid descriptions you can almost feel your own feet sinking into the bogs of Wales and feel the ocean breeze on your face.<br /><br />Jacob is stuck in a hum-drum, boring life. The most excitement he ever gets is the amazing stories that his grandfather tells him about the children under the care of Miss Peregrine and his short time there. The stories of invisible boys and girls that can float in the sky turn into just that, stories as Jacob grows up and his grandfather ages. He now longer believes them to be true and chocks them up to his grandfathers vivid imagination.<br /><br />Everything changes however on the night that his grandfather passes on. His final words cryptic in nature. Jacob is not safe. He needs to find \\"The Bird\\". He will be safe with \\"The Bird\\".<br /><br />Set on uncovering everything from his grandfather's past, Jacob winds up on the adventure of his life.<br /><br />Though I did enjoy the book, I found some errors that should have been caught by the editor. I also felt that the photo's mixed into the story were unnecessary and interrupted the flow of the book. Besides that, I read this book on my Kindle and they were VERY difficult to make out, as were the shots of the letters that were written. Perhaps they are not the type of things one should put into an ebook.<br /><br />3 of 5 stars
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I notice a central theme running through this thread. I, like other post, did not like this album when I first bought it (yes, I bought the album when it came out. I now have the cd).   However, I downloaded my Rush music to my iPhone and decided to listen to all of it and noticed Presto was missing. Before I listened to it I read Presto reviews and couldn't believe the overwhelming excitement over this compilation, that is until I gave it a listen.   I don't know what I was thinking when Presto first came out but I LOVE this cd! The thing is, I must have listened to it an awful lot because I remember all the songs. The whole is grand. Available Light is my favorite tune on this cd.
B00117FGLY|5.0|Apostrophe is a great second or first album to listen to if you're trying to get into Zappa.  This and [[ASIN:B0000009SG Overnite Sensation]] are both great places to get your feet wet.<br /><br />Top Tracks: The first half of the LP all plays like one long song so its hard to pick top tracks for this album.  To be honest the entire thing is brilliant.  As I said before this is very accessible and even non-Zappa fans should like Uncle Remus.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I avoided this show at first because of all the self-impressed promotions - \\"Best show on television\\" etc. I glimpsed yhe commercials and it just looked like some guy in prison having a hard time. Yawn. Then I noticed it on streaming Netflix and decided to see what all the hype was about. WOW!!! I was hooked in the opening 60 seconds. Great writing, performances, direction! Dark humor - my favorite. 3-dimensionl characters. This is the best TV series I have seen since....maybe ever. SEE IT!!!!!
B00117P3XK|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time.  It was written during Dylan's divorce with his wife Sarah and all that emotion is captured in verse.  Very powerful, moving stuff.  The definitive break up album.<br /><br />If you can get a hold of The New York Sessions, which contain the first take recordings of this album.  Dylan thought it was too dark and rerecorded most of the songs.  The NY Sessions are much rawer and if you enjoy this album I highly recommend you give it a listen.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Awesome! Fun, funny, smooth controls, and very long game! Lags a-bit everytime when you acquire a new plant, but otherwise, Pure Genius!!! HTC evo
B0016SEW9K|5.0|Zappa is an excellent musician.  There is no denying that.  With that noted it can I could see how he could be a challenging artist to \\"get into\\".  I could imagine first timers getting turned off by [[ASIN:B0000009SV Sheik Yerbouti]] and [[ASIN:B0000009SY Joe's Garage Acts 1-2-3]].<br /><br />Over-nite Sensation is a great starting point for Zappa.  It and [[ASIN:B0000009SI Apostrophe]] are probably his most accessible albums.  I would venture to say that Over-nite Sensation is more so because it follows a more typical album format, whereas Apostrophe' s first few songs follow a narrative.<br /><br />Overall great album.  Zappa classic.  Best Tracks: Camarillo Brillo, Dinah Moe Humm, Montana
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I'm a Jane Eyre fan.  I've loved the book for years, and lately got on a kick about watching the movies out about it.  Some of them are *very* long and plodding.  Perhaps they're truer to the book, but the acting seems more suited to stage than film.  I can see why this movie could cause some purists to be unhappy.  There is so much skipped and glossed over.  There are certain scenes from the book that I cannot imagine how they cut them out.  However, I really liked how the movie showed.  The lighting, the atmosphere.  I really thought the flashback method worked.  I thought it was a great way to make a plausible movie in a reasonable time while highlighting key events.  It was a pretty unique and unexpected thing for this book.  I *really* enjoyed the deleted scenes.  Many of them featured Helen Burns, and I wish they had been left in.  When the commentary said that this movie had featured more on the gothic horror part of it than other movies, I think they're right.  I'm glad I got it.  Enjoyable!
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I got into heavy metal back in the mid 80's, and Anthrax was one of my favorite bands.  Unfortunately, when Joey Belladonna left the band, a lot of what I liked left too.  They toned down their metal sound to more of a hard rock sound.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't the Anthrax that I loved.  I pretty much wrote these guys off during the John Bush era.  But now Joey Belladonna is back, and so is the thrash.  This is by far their best album since Persistence of Time (which I consider one of the top 10 metal albums of all time), and it's good to have them back.  If you're a fan of classic Anthrax thrash, then I think you'll really love this album.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The kindle edition is not much cheaper than the book!  Why?  I bought the Kindle to SAVE money! This doesn't create an incentive for me to buy the Kindle edition.
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|Rarely, as a musician and music enthusiast am I awed by an album in modern times.  After listening to Florence + The Machine's sophomore effort [[ASIN:B005QI4TP8 Ceremonials]] I was awed.  The musicality showcased by Florence Welch, all of twenty-five years old, is immaculate.  Still lofty after a Grammy nomination for best new artist, Florence + The Machine have used that momentum and inspiration to create arguably 2011's best album.  Combining numerous musical styles - rock, pop, soul, singer/songwriter and folk, Ceremonials is nothing short of a crossover masterwork. Well produced, well written songs, and brilliant vocals, this is an album that you should not sleep on.<br /><br />The effort starts with a bang with \\"Only If For a Night,\\" which opens with mysterious descending instrumental lines and piano accompaniment.  Welch enters singing a few lines in a subdued fashion before big drums enter buttressing and setting the tone for the `gargantuan' proportion of this cut - and album.  Soon, Welch's vocals are washed in a well conceived array of vocal effects (reverb, chorus) and a massive wall of sound underlies.  With everything working in tandem with each other, \\"Only If For A Night\\" is possesses almost an `angelic' sound.  \\"Shake It Out\\" is just as good, if not better. Opening with organ, Welch's vocals enter both soulfully and refined.  Again, the drums are well produced, yielding a big percussive sound.  The overall timbre is a throwback pop/soul feel, recalling 60's - 70s Blue-eyed soul, a la Dusty Springfield.  The refrain is anthemic and both catchy and simple-as all: \\"Shake it out, shake it out.\\" What more can be said, Welch has it going on!<br /><br />\\"What the Water Gave Me\\" opens as mysteriously as the other cuts, keeping the intellectual quality alive.  One of the album's most trivial cuts, \\"What the Water Gave Me\\" is certainly the most enjoyable after successive listens. Welch's opening vocals are restrained, making the listener hinge on her every lyrics.  As the track evolves and progresses, intensity grows and the track reveals all its mysteries and secrets.  As far as the timbre, the vocal production superb, not mention the production as a whole.  \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is more straightforward than \\"What the Water Gave Me,\\" aiming for an outright `soul-stirring' performance. High points include the background vocals (\\"never let me go, never let me go\\") serving as an ostinato for Welch to ad lib atop.  \\"Breaking Down\\" opens with a percussive groove and enthusiastic production work that is a mix of folk-rock and blue-eyed soul sensibility.  The harmonic progression work well here and overall the songwriting is equally strong.<br /><br />Florence + The Machine continue to impress on \\"Lover to Lover,\\" where Welch's `false-voice' is at her best and on solid showings  with cuts \\"No Light, No Light\\" and \\"Seven Devils.\\"  \\"Heartlines\\" features some incredibly big vocal moments while \\"Spectrum\\" is most notable for it's pummeling, percussive groove.  \\"And This and Heaven Too\\" is as solid as anything else, but closing cut \\"Leave My Body\\" is the strongest cut since \\"Lover to Lover.\\"  On \\"Leave My Body,\\" Welch shows how great her vocal range and vocal facility truly are, closing the album with perhaps her strongest, most soulful vocals yet.  The background vocals are well arranged and contribute to the grandiosity of the closing cut.<br /><br />In a nutshell, [[ASIN:B005QI4TP8 Ceremonials]] is nearly flawless.  There is little to quibble about.  The songwriting is clever, the performances electrifying, and the production excellent. Ceremonials definitely tops my list as one of the best of 2011.evolves and progresses, intensity grows and the track reveals all its mysteries and secrets.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus is an excellent and affordable solution for the budding (and frugal) overclocking enthusiast. The core temps on my AMD Phenom II X2 550be @3.4ghz were 40ºC idle and 60ºC full load (prime95 for 5 hours) with the stock HSF. After installing the Hyper 212 Plus temps dropped to 24ºC idle and 35ºC full load.<br /><br />As others have said in previous reviews this HSF is big, please make sure you measure how much space you have available in your tower before purchasing.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Releasing an album at the `ripe young' age of 85 is an accomplishment in itself.  Even more of an accomplishment is releasing a quality album at the age of 85 and making history by debuting at #1. Tony Bennett caps off his extraordinary career with a fine duets effort.  Duets II may never be revolutionary, but it provides 17 enjoyable duets, regardless.  Bennett's voice remains intact and impresses more often than not, making [[ASIN:B0052GACNM Duets II]] one of the better albums of 2011.<br /><br />\\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" features a manic Lady Gaga as Bennett's duet partner.  While it shouldn't work, the outlandish nature of the classic standard coupled with Gaga's energetic performance makes the opener one, if not the best cut from Duets II. John Mayer won't be out done by Gaga, as he contributes a solid vocal on \\"One for My Baby (And One More for the Road).\\"  Harmonically, while Bennett and Mayer don't perfectly match pitch (others are more accurate), the timbre of their respective voices still has a certain chemistry nonetheless making this cut enjoyable.  \\"Body and Soul\\" is the ideal duet placing the late Amy Winehouse with Bennett.  The  arrangement is lovely with strings and notable piano lines.  The chemistry between the two is instant.  Mr. Bennett is 3 for 3.<br /><br />\\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\" is another strong showing, this time featuring traditional pop singer Michael Bubl&eacute;.  Bennett's previous duet partner k.d. Lang joins for \\"Blue Velvet.\\"  While \\"Blue Velvet\\" is pleasant as all else, it is not my favorite cut.  Aretha Franklin surprises with her restraint and solid tone on the lengthy, but beautiful \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing.\\" Aretha's musicality here is worth noting, particularly given her nuances and jazzy riffs.  But the queen will be `queen' as she shows off her gospel histrionics at the end - it is tasteful though! \\"The Girl I Love\\" gets Sheryl Crow in on the action while \\"On The Sunny Side of the Street\\" brings in country legend Willie Nelson.  Both of these cuts prove pleasant without proving to be the highlights.  That said, \\"The Girl I Love\\" ends dramatically while Nelson's guitar playing is as sharp as ever on \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\" (even where his vocals sag).<br /><br />\\"Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)\\" highlights a talented Queen Latifah, not to mention a lovely trombone solo.  The orchestrations on this particular cut are fantastic. \\"Speak Low\\" features Norah Jones and yields some magical moments.  Even more magical, however, is a beautiful ballad performed by Bennett and Groban, \\"This Is All I Ask.\\"  Vocally, Groban's tone is magnificent, and Tony has no problems letting the tenor shine.  Natalie Cole shines on the brief \\"Watch What Happens,\\" even if the cut itself yields no mega fanfare.  Similarly, Andrea Bocelli sounds nearly perfect on \\"Stranger in Paradise,\\" even if the cut lacks the same magic the Groban/Bennett collaboration yielded.  Faith Hill holds her own on \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" while Alejandro Sanz's spanish vocals are impeccable on \\"Yesterday I Heard the Rain.\\"  That said, these cuts are enjoyable, not revolutionary per say. \\"It Had To Be You\\" reignites Duets II with a surprisingly effective duet with country superstar Carrie Underwood.  Mariah Carey has her way on \\"When Do The Bells Ring For Me\\" to close out the effort effectively, though not valedictory.<br /><br />Overall, there is not much negative to say about [[ASIN:B0052GACNM Duets II]].  It is what it is - a solid album of classic pop vocal standards that are sang very beautifully by Bennett and his respective partners.  Never revolutionary, Duets II  may be remembered more for Bennett's achievements as opposed to the material on the album itself.  But for 2011 and for a seasoned vet like Bennett, Duets II is another rich milestone in an illustrious career.h of these cuts prove pleasant without proving to be the highlights.

B004LROUNG|3.0|This book is a hit and miss for me. There were parts that dragged on but other parts seemed to fly by -- they were that interesting. Mr. Zinc is the most interesting person in the book. Smart attorney stuck in a dull law firm. Enjoy it.

PS the glitches happened at the exact same places on two different disk being played on two different machines so not a problem with my equipment but disk manufacturing.
B004LWZW8S|1.0|Watching Immortals is like eating a big platter full of candy and sugary sweets. There's plenty to look at and many savoury sweets to indulge in... Only for you to not realize that by the time it's all over and done with, you'll be left with a lingering stomach ache. Which is exactly what is the problem with all types of candy; eye candy or the actual food itself. It's not until you're finished devouring such huge portions of it you realize you've absorbed absolutely nothing.<br /><br />I have nothing at all against Tarsem Singh, an amazingly talented and visionary director. I loved The Cell, even though it was a bit mind-screwy (though as soon as it's done, you realize what was real and what was not). Every shot in that film was to die for, starting with the opening frame of Dead Vlei. The Fall was a movie that I managed to stumble upon by accident on IMDb. I watched the trailer and quickly decided \\"I must see this!\\". Soon after I rented the DVD, watched it, and thought \\"holy crap, that was amazing.\\"<br /><br />So as you may or may not be able to tell, I went into Immortals solely due to Singh's namesake, and the one thing that entered my mind as soon as his name appeared over the closing credits was \\"did someone hold a gun to his head and force him to direct this boring 'movie'?\\"<br /><br />It really is a shame. I love Greek mythology, and I thought Singh would be able to carry a Greek mythology themed film well. Let's say he did well with the visuals part; his trademark visual brilliance is all over this film. Every single frame of the movie is a work of art in itself. That said, the script is so agonizingly slow, boring and disgustingly patronizing.<br /><br />Sure there's a lot of holes in the mythos- Theseus being a bastard, the sacred bow, etc. But those are the least of the films problems. The story and sequence of events plays as if it were adapted from a gore-obsessed 10 year old's paper on Greek mythology. One particularly insulting plot hole comes from the bow- when Theseus buries his dead mother in the cave, we are to assume the bow chose him and deemed him worthy of using the bow itself- yet Hyperion can use it without problem?!<br /><br />The acting is insultingly awful. Cavill seems to think that just standing there and looking handsome and what not is acting. And while he is indeed a handsome fellow, he fits the role of Theseus in looks only. He barely emotes throughout the film, and even the one scene (where he watches his mother get killed) isn't enough to redeem his boring performance. Freida Pinto does an alright job though her performance wasn't nothing we saw in Slumdog Millionaire or Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And I have a gigantic man crush on Mickey Rourke, but he was just hilariously bad. He rehashed his performances from Iron Man 2 and Sin City, and the result was not good.<br /><br />The film plods along at a snail's pace. We get a handful of action, and all are very short. Even the battle scene at the end was boring as frack. The slow, sedated pace wouldn't be such a problem if the dialogue weren't so awful. The dialogue sounds like an immature 14 year old wrote it, and I wouldn't be surprised if one did. The exploding heads scene was awesome, but that was it.<br /><br />In short, guys will go see Immortals for the battle sequences and gods fracking stuff up, and girls will go see it for the guys walking around, letting their abs/muscles be the center of attention, neither of which being anything they wouldn't get from viewing the IMDb publicity stills for the movie- something they can do for free. Well, girls, if your boyfriend takes you to this movie, swiftly pull him aside and tell him \\"maybe you and me being together just isn't working out for either of us...\\". Guys, if your group of buddies drags you to this movie, immediately cut all ties with them and inform them that they're idiots.<br /><br />And to the writers, your scripts are more suited for no-talent hacks like Michael Bay or Terrance Malick. Have you seen either of Singh's previous 2 films? That guy has a wicked imagination. Let him use it on worthy scripts.<br /><br />OVERALL: 3/10<br /><br />THE GOOD: It looks pretty. There's exploding heads and Mickey Rourke. And Freida Pinto naked.<br /><br />THE BAD: ...everything else.icked imagination. Let him use it on worthy scripts.  OVERALL: 3/10  THE GOOD: It looks pretty. There's exploding heads and Mickey Rourke. And Freida Pinto naked.  THE BAD: ...everything else.
B001W2I9Y4|4.0|I'm always looking for new Metal, that doesn't sound like someone being waterboarded or a cat being skinned. My favorite bands include Tool, Black Label Society, Fear Factory, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and other bonds along those lines. I can almost always make out the lyrics, the guitar rifts are fresh, and the band overall has a unique,infectious synergy.  I came across Mastadon via a metal blog. I was searching Google for \\"bands that sound like 'x'\\". Mastadon's metal is pure heavy metal in the sense that Metal was extension of fun/rebellious rock-n-roll, but with way more guitar distortion and a general sense of screaming out at whatever ticks you off.  If you're looking for heavy metal along the lines of COC, Symphony X, or Black Label Society, you should consider seriously giving Mastadon a try. At least download the song, \\"The Last Baron\\". I thought that song best represented the album overall.
B001G8NW6Y|5.0|Typically, we think about economic issues from only one side of the debate.  Lost from our awareness are the economic and social consequences that affect the other side of the any economic equation.  \\"Should the minimum wage be increased?\\", is one such example.  We argue and debate this question only in terms of those who earn the minimum wage but we fail to look at the pressure exerted on those who must pay this wage and the affect it has on society in general.  The book explores the principles of economic questions by looking at the whole equation of A+B=C from a non-partisan perspective.  It examines the reality that when a dollar is spent on product \\"A\\", it follows that all other options for spending that same dollar are now gone.  This book is an introduction to critical thinking.  I highly recommend it for anyone who votes in that it dispels that false notion made by politicians that throwing money at a problem makes the problem go away.  Written in the 1950s, it reads as though I was written with current 2011 issues in mind.  This book should be mandatory reading for all high school students in America.

B0064J6OMO|2.0|I like body switch movies because life is more interesting when you walk around in someone else's shoes awhile.  The problem with this movie, and a few others recently unleashed, is that it seems we've regressed back to the 1980s, when showing boobs was the thing to do, even if we didn't understand why.  Now, as then, it's pretty pointless and it doesn't do anything for the story.  It made the entire movie difficult to watch, and that's too bad, because there's actually a pretty good movie in there - if you can just dig it out from under the trash.

B005UG542S|5.0|Unfortunately, there are issues with the digital copy and that is the reason for the many bad reviews.  I watched this movie online and had no issues.   I felt this was one of the best Harry Potters made.  It was not exactly as the book was written, but did a good job of capturing the spirit.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I thought this was a very engaging adaptation.  I felt the characters were a perfect fit and especially enjoyed Matthew MacFadyen as Arthur Clennam.  The visual scenes of movie were extremely well done and the musical score was wonderful.  The only criticism I have is about the end because it was more than a bit rushed.  I had not read this particular story by Charles Dickens, so in order to fully understand what happened, I had to read a synopsis just to understand.  This was disappointing because the very thing that made the story so compelling was trying to find out the connection between Little Dorrit's family and the Clennams. I think people who are willing to watch a series of this length, would be also willing to have an additional 30 minutes or so in order to fully develop the end.  Anyway, it was still so good that I am happy with my purchase and recommend it to others.

B000FQIRXQ|1.0|I love to watch period films based on classical novels and I am a huge fan of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens.  The BBC has done just a wonderful job of reproducing many of these works in recent years, but I thought I would give this one a try since it was at a discounted rate on Amazon.  It was just plain unengaging.  The characters were difficult to relate to with the exception of the young David Copperfield, his mother, and Piggoty.  I found the whole thing to be more of a depressing adaptation instead of the triumphal tale of overcoming a difficult past. I now have buyer's remorse. :/  If at all possible, please watch the movie by renting or watching snippets on youtube before buying.

1416550550|3.0|When her grandmother dies, Cassandra discovers that as a young child Nell was found abandoned on an Australian dock. Taking up the search for the truth where her grandmother left off, Cassanda tracks the path of Eliza, a 1900s authoress and the only link to Nell's origins. The Forgotten Garden is reminiscent of other multi-generational magical (realist) female sagas--which seems too specific to be a genre, but similarities to Hoffman's Practical Magic and Howe's The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane suggest otherwise. Accordingly, The Forgotten Garden is likely to be a success for fans of those books. Its fantastic elements are subtle and largely allegorical, tying the book into an emotionally resonant, if trite, little package. The bulk of its plot is taken up by the mystery of Nell's origins, but the mystery doesn't warrant 550 pages; it's a breezy, slightly florid voice and three intertwining narratives that make the journey to the truth so long, although Morton manages to avoid frustrating dramatic irony--and surprisingly, the pages speed by. Despite all criticisms, the book is absorbing and quick to read; its themes of identity and family are traditional (read: heteronormative and frankly limiting) but satisfying, and its included fairy tales are an unexpected delight and the best of the book. That's not quite enough for me--I have a love/hate relationship with this mini-genre, and enjoy its premise but often take issue with its execution; The Forgotten Garden falls right in line, and while it's an enjoyable read I demand more from a book than just that. Interested readers will find worst wastes of time, and the book would be ideal distraction over lazy summer days (as a bonus, much of it takes place then), but on its own standing I can't recommend it.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|The concept is intriguing: take a pill that massively increases brainpower to the extent that you far surpass nearly everyone else, and then seen how your life changes because of that.  The benefits are impressive: rapidly finishing challenging projects, learning new languages with ease, making big money by discerning patterns no one else can, becoming irresistible to attractive women, and generally moving up in the world.  But of course there's also no free lunch, since other people (including bad guys) will take notice and want a piece of the action, plus the pill itself turns out to be addictive and has serious side effects, including potential death.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the exploration of this concept, and the acting was also pretty good (De Niro stood out), my one complaint is that the plot construction seemed somewhat haphazard in an amateurish way, which really took away from the believability of the movie, so I found it hard to stay fully engaged.  For this reason, I have to deduct one star, but I can still recommend the movie to people who have fantasized about what it would be like to be super smart.
B001R0O9K4|5.0|I've watched this movie time and time again, and each time there's a nuance I catch that I didn't catch before by one of the truly brilliant actors - Liam Neeson, Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn and Alan Rickman. At times is can be hard to watch, it's not just a story but a depiction of a time in history of Ireland, the brutality may seem unnecessary to some but the truth of matter is that Ireland was subjected for centuries to the most brutal of regimes as time and time again the British sought to erase the Irish culture, language and traditions and if not their culture wouldn't be erased then they sought to eradicate the Irish themselves. So, will difficult to watch at times, and for some, unbelievable, history books show the truth of the matter was much even more hateful and barbaric.   I do like how the movie subtly addresses the weakness in DeValera - his fear that Collins would achieve what he himself wanted to. What's unspoken is that Collins watched over DeVelara's family, putting his own life on the line for them time and time again, and yet DeValera did him in. History has shown that the deal was done by DeValera to partition Ireland even before Michael Collins set said for England for negotiations. For wasn't it clear that it was DeValera who was the ultimate politician and not Collins? Who choses to send a soldier to negotiate a peace treaty? Only a devious politician seeking to undermine a brilliant and brave general who was a leader among men. I firmly believe that DeValera's new ranking in Irish history is where it belongs now - below that of Michael Collins.  The one blight on this film was the producers idiotic casting of Julia Roberts. They didn't need her 'name' for this film - they had brilliant actors already in place. She's awful, her portrayal of an Irish girl insulting, her acting capabilities are quite sub-par highlighted by the excellent actors she does scenes with. She's like long one big long nail along a chalkboard. Producers really need to leave her in the genre she belongs - and great acting films isn't it - Mystic Pizza, Pretty Woman are her genre.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|OK, look, let me say right out, as a movie, this will not be everyone's cup of tea. It is dense and strange and long and lacks what most people would recognize as plot, dialogue, story, and so on. So don't go and rent or buy this because of what I'm about to say or because I enjoyed it (at least I think I did...). The most apt comparison is perhaps Kubrick's 2001 - and this is less plot-driven and stranger. Looking at reviews here, it is obviously polarizing. Some will think it is unspeakably profound, others will think it is unbearably obtuse and pretentious. Both are valid opinions, in my view.<br /><br />But as a Blu-Ray? Holy Toledo. Easily, easily, EASILY the finest Blu-ray I've ever seen. This transfer trumps the superb BD's available for The Thin Red Line, Baraka, Sin City, Hot Fuzz, Pirates of the Caribbean, and any other live-action BD I've seen (I won't evaluate it against animated movies except to say that I'd rather watch this than any of those, because reality trumps animation in terms of visual interest, IMHO).<br /><br />In terms of detail, every single frame of the film displays absolutely pristine detail. Every blade of grass, pore of skin, stray hair, texture of fabric, pebble on the ground, ripple of paint on a wall - is visible with absolute crystal clarity. The detail on faces is unreal (and believe me, I was transfixed by Jessica Chastain's face whenever it was on screen - she may be the most radiant vision of feminine beauty ever committed to celluloid). Peach fuzz on a baby's face in a mid-focus shot was easily evident.<br /><br />Color is superbly realistic, black levels are deep and inky but not crushed, and there is absolutely no posterization or banding on a set of very challenging scenes depicting skies, spacescapes, starfields, and so on.<br /><br />Film grain is visible from up close, but I am assuming the film stock used was a relatively low-grain one (similar to \\"The Reader\\"). There is absolutely no evidence of any undue digital manipulation. It is as if there is a piece of film being projected by a perfect machine, onto a perfect screen surface, with perfect focus on your HD television screen.<br /><br />Stunning, stunning, stunning. Even if you don't end up liking the movie, it's worth a rental just to witness the Blu-Ray format in its full flower. Any A/V or home theater enthusiast worth their salt owes it to themselves to see this on their home setup at least once.f film being projected by a perfect machine, onto a perfect screen surface, with perfect focus on your HD television screen.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|Would be a single star but that is not fair to the author.  If you are buying the Kindle edition be warned:  1. You cannot move between books. You start at 1st page and go from there.  2. Your last page read is only accurate about 50% of the time, and Never right if the Kindle goes to sleep (you get called away unexpectedly).  3. Since downloading my Kindle reboots on average every other day - a 5 minute annoyance.  4. The Kindle feature sort from most recent is messed up since this download - so you have to search for your book. For me it landed on page 5 mostly, but occasionally moves elsewhere.  Only pro is you don't need to carry these heavy books.   Amazon or the publishing house - can you please try and get this right? I hope there is an updated version offered before I get through the entire thing.  As to the books themselves - I am about 20% through. Wasn't sure I would get that far as make believe time/settings usually are not my thing. Historical fiction is fine for me if the time and place actually existed. However it is growing on me. Consider that a compliment - the characters and their development are intriguing enough that I am overlooking the \\"winter is coming\\" and 10 year summer nonsense.
1451627289|3.0|This filled my need for some airplane reading, but I guess I knew going in that this wasn't going to be King from the era of Dead Zone writing tight page turning terrifically written fiction.  There is no way this book wouldn't be far better with 40% of the book edited out.  On the plus side there was very little of the eerie stuff King lays on all of his books -- Yellow card man I am talking about you!  Didn't follow this stuff but it was mercifully short and grouped at the end.  It is always fun to find anachronisms in any time travel novel and there are skads here.  Don't Mess with Texas was a slogan developed for an anti litter campaign long after this time, Bostons Combat Zone wasn't nicknamed in 1958, Louie Louie wouldnt have been known enough to use as Sophia does to describe a bands style in 1961.  I don't think \\" man up \\" would have been used as a phrase at the time.  This lays aside the improbable such as ambulances in the ealy 60s screaming from kileen area to Dallas 3 non interstate hours away, instead of going to Austin or even Temple.  King spends huge amounts of the book going thru all of the details of a high school dance, but skips very quickly thru the final stop Oswald scene.  Pity because king could have turned this into one of his greats instead of this so-so effort.  Sadly we will never again see the novels that king wrote when he first came out.  And not because he isn't capable, but because he is too big to be edited again.
B00004WX4E|5.0|I think of this album as the one that influenced pretty much everyone one of my favorite bands from 90's which is my favorite era of bands.. had to get this on vinyl to hear the quality I've been missing all these years and boy was it a night a day difference from their CD version. RATM is designed for vinyl for those who didn't already know. Its amazing, just get it if you're at the point of reading this review...
0439023491|5.0|Katniss and Peeta are back! And Gale of course! Part 2 of the Hunger Games trilogy is still juicy and exciting. You won't be able to put it down!
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|Wow. This album is absoloutly amazing. Though, I didn't really know of Paramore during it's release, I listened to some songs on youtube.com. I thought they were amazing. I listened mostly to \\"When it rains\\", \\"Misery Buisness\\", \\"That's what you get\\" and \\"Ignorance,\\" so I had heard none on this album. One day, when I had alot of money on me, my brother found the CD in Shopko, and brought it over to me, because he knew I listened to some of their songs.    I bought it, despite not hearing any songs on this album, but by the time I returned home, I listened to a few songs and fell in love. The first songs that caught my direct attention were \\"Pressure\\", \\"Emergency\\", \\"Never Let This Go\\", and \\"My Heart\\". I was very surprised by the powerful vocals of Hayley Williams, who was only 16 at the time. Also, the Farros's very creative beats and rythms. I couldn't stop listening to the album, and quickly I fell in love with \\"Conspiracy\\" and \\"Here we go again\\". Though it took a little bit longer for \\"All We Know\\", \\"Brighter\\" (Which I sing almost everyday), \\"Whoa\\" and \\"Franklin\\" they all amaze me now! The whole album I would say, is a complete masterpiece! I love it!
0618918248|5.0|If you are religious, you should read this just to be informed about how others view the world.  Unfortunately, you may end up having your world turned upside down! (Many have). It exposes many religious fallacies, and presents a truly logical, reasonable explanation of life. I DARE you to read it! I had an audio version, but purchased this copy anyway, for reference. I'll probably purchase more copies for gifts.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|what can i say. this CPU will blow you away. i have heard comments after comments that this CPU being such a disappointment. i just Upgraded over my AMD 955 and this baby is running my games 57-60 frames per second! thats with the power of the GTX 560 ti and 8GB if DDR3 RAM boys and gals. now when it comes to other performances sure the i7 and i5 are better and all that jazz. But when it comes to gaming or everyday computer needs WHO CARES! it dose just as good for 110 bucks! all u need. smooth game play, rarely any hiccups, cranked this bad boy from 3.6 to 4.O. cant say anything about the stock fan because i'm using liquid cool. and its actually not even hot while gaming or having two monitors compared to my 955. this baby is fast.If you choose a 6 core and your mind is set for gaming, your kinda wasting your money, because the AMD 4100 is a fast CPU and i personally wasn't expecting this to be that fast. Get it...stop reading this right now...just get it
1439192812|5.0|This book would make a great text for a middle school science course. It subtly teaches scientific thinking. It is easy to read, well-illustrated and easy to understand, yet written without talking down to the reader. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Once again, Dawkins has done a wonderful job. I previewed this book at the public library, then I bought this copy for my 12 yr old granddaughter.
B005F3XV62|5.0|This movie was fun and entertaining. Will keep you laughing, but does have serious moments. Although plot is predictable movie was very good.
0765348276|5.0|Just read John Scalzi's \\"Old Man's War\\", a birthday gift from my eldest son. Incredible. It had me laughing, crying, simply marvelling. The man is a latter-day Heinlein. The story is awesome, its pace is perfect. From first sentence to last it is a masterpiece.
B004F77SHC|4.0|Love this movie from the saga! Great adaptation from the book! If your a twilight fan I would recommend this product because of the collectors photos and all the amazing special features!!!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|A great Lego set for any VW enthusiast - either to build or collect. I purchased one through Lego and was talked into building it right away with my boyfriend. The building instructions come in two booklets, which is really nice when building with another person. He took book 1 which built the frame of the bus, engine compartment, interior. I started on book 2 building the pieces that would be added onto the main part of the bus later on.<br /><br />Took us probably 3-4 hours total to build it. It helps to get a large, flat box to dump all the pieces into rather than searching through the plastic bags for each piece.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the roof piece at the front of the bus (above the drivers and passengers seats) kept crumbling apart when you build it, there wasn't enough support Lego's for it to hold as you tried putting on another piece. Eventually got it to work somehow, won't be touching that part again!<br /><br />Overall, it is awesome. It sits on our shelf in all its Lego glory.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Received very quickly and dvd is in great shape. I have see this movie a ton of times and it still makes me laugh.
B000001ELP|2.0|Says the KISS fan-boys now don't get me wrong i am  a huge KISS fan i own all 3 of the KISSology DVDs and almost almost all their albums but i can never get myself to say i actually like this album. some of the songs on here are just crap and actually gave me a laugh when i heard them such as Just a Boy Mister Blackwell and I. But some songs are actually ALMOST passable as KISS songs and they are:<br />A World Without Heroes (though the unplugged version is better)<br />Dark Light<br />Escape From The Island<br />and the Oath<br />so bottom line dont buy this unless u are a hardcore KISS fan if not then check out their 70's stuff (as long as its not dynasty) and see if you like that
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks' books, including this one.  He moved away from his norm, and took us a bit further than usual - the possibility of infidelity in our main characters, ghosts, and a different type of happily ever after.  Stepping out of the box is not always a bad thing; and in this case it was a great move.  Loved this book as much as the others.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have liked all of Grisham's books, but this has to be one of his best.  It is fun all the way through and, as usual, his characters are well developed and hilarious much of the time.  I highly recommended this to everyone.
B005WGBQ9G|4.0|Yep, when writers in movies or television write hunting scenes, they are always painfully embarrassing. That deer would have been 10 miles away long before the kid got shot. Really, is it that hard to look up a few things about wildlife? Try the internet, but for god's sake stop embarrassing yourselves with your ignorance of nature.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|After pushing the release date back twice, and a total of five years since their last studio album, Evanescence returns in perfect form.  The new self-titled album is as distincly different, artisticly and thematicly, from the earliar albums as the first two were to eachother.  It delivers a strong new sound that is still quintisentially Evanescence.  While still driven by the strong dark emotions that have defined the groups work, this new album conceives of and expresses them from a new perspective.  Along with strong imagery and soaring vocals from Amy Lee, the new album probably has the best instrumentation Evanesence has yet had.
B005G26NJE|5.0|Some people just have it!  Stevie Wonders soul, Hendrix's fingers, SRV's power, and Buddy Guys matter of fact \\"This is where I'm from.\\"  Gary Clark Jr will be in this line up.  Great soulful voice, powerful player and a persona of truth.  Can't wait to follow this man's music!  A must have to see where the blues is headed.  You cannot be disappointed.
B002ZG9788|4.0|I chose this movie as a pay per view choice on Direct TV. I wasn't expecting very much. After all remakes can really be bad e.g War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise comes to mind.  However , I realized that this remake was going to be surprisingly different right from the beginning.<br /><br />  In the beginning of the movie there is a scene where the king and queen are holding court and really running off at the mouth, saying some pretty nasty things about the gods. However, they soon realize they have an uninvited guest. Hades materializes and soon begins to spoil the party. Hades is there to make an ultimatum , they will have to make some serious decisions. Hades ,a god, approaches the queen and commands her, \\"Kneel,mortal queen!\\"<br /><br />My God ,I would purchase this DVD for that scene alone. Let's face it . Ralph Fiennes is the dark Lord. Whether his name is Voldemort or Hades; he sure knows how to be dark. Ralph Fiennes was an excellent choice for Hades as was Liam Neeson for Zeus. While Sam Worthington gets the lead billing as Perseus ,there are excellent actors in the supporting roles that really make this movie worth your time and money.<br /><br />When I read the 1 star reviews I couldn't believe that anyone would prefer the original over this remake. While the original may have been entertaining ,the remake is totally superior. The director sort of pokes a little fun at the original version. In a scene where Perseus is searching for weapons and supplies for the upcoming journey they are embarking upon and he reaches into a bin of materials pulls out the mechanical owl prop used in the original and asks a soldier \\" Whats this?\\"  and receives the simple response  \\"Leave it \\".  I chuckled to myself during that scene because I realized that the director thought that the mechanical owl was a ridiculous prop too. That owl didn't really work as good as it was intended; and in the remake they had the good sense to leave it out.<br /><br />I am not sure what the 1 star critics are seeing when they watch this movie,but it is obvious that we do not see the same thing.y watch this movie,but it is obvious that we do not see the same thing.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|very fast and easy to deal with will recomend to my friends. I will consider buying from them again for similar products.
0688014291|4.0|The book states common sense approach not only to business management but also skills for everyday life.  It is short and to the point and easy and quick to read.
0375703764|5.0|There's nothing I can say about this book that hans't already been said. This book has kept me up so late at night, I simply could not put it down. It lured me in and trapped me, and changed the way I look at literature. From the multiple layers of narration to the typography and layout of the book, it is one of the best books I have ever read.
B0002DB52M|5.0|What happened to the female character in Dogville was so reminiscent of the many stories I have read about African American women during the days of slavery. I kept wondering when her \\"inner Nat Turner\\" would manifest itself.   I don't know if the writer of this script had that in mind, but one of the two actors of African descent called the male lead \\"Master Tom,\\" at the beginning of the movie.  I was not disappointed with the ending of this movie.   \\"As thou has done unto others, so shall it be done unto you.\\"
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Yes the book is repetitive. Despite this the plot seems to draw you in and build more and more suspense as you read. The ending was totally unexpected and resolving. Very nice for Watson's debute novel.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|When I buy a movie and on the outside it states \\"Digital Copy\\" I expect a \\"real\\" digital copy.  Something that I can easily import into the media player of choice and review at will without having to look for the disc.  When I purchase a disc and pay extra for a digital copy so I won't have to purchase another copy for portable devices, AppleTVs or other uses only to find that the Digital Copy included does not allow for importing into my music library of choice, but rather requires a poorly built APP on my iPhone or iPad to view the movie I'm rather frustrated.  The movie is amazing, its not as good as the books, but it never is.  The movies tell a slightly different story, not necessarily worse, but different, and that's OK.  The BluRay's video looks sharp and the soundtrack is great.  I just wish Warner Bros. would leave our \\"traditional\\" digital copies alone and include the value of a portable version I can import into a music library management solution of my choice be it iTunes or Windows Media Player.  I'm alright with providing the Ultraviolet option, but they should include it as another option for the digital copy, not the only choice.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Ok, when I first saw the preview to this, I was like what the cuss!! I really don't like wasting my time with movies that suck, they must have a decent story, meaning, message, and good dialogue and so much more. I am very picky about the movies I watch so I read reviews before I do. I saw so many good things about this one, I figured oh well. Fantastic Mr. Fox truly surpassed all my expectations. WOW! I can't stop watching this. Amazing!
B005UPOAT2|5.0|In my opinion John Cusak's best movie.    He & Kate Beckinsale are magic together.  The storyline is fantastic, the music  alluring, and the acting first class.  I have watched it at least 20 times.
B002Y5FKUE|1.0|I saw this at the MET HD. The production is a nightmare. So much that I hated the opera. Florez is superb but Natalie is past her prime after her many operations. If you want to see a traditional staging in a Swiss village get the one with the amazing soprano Gueterrez. Now if we can only get Florez together with Gueterrez.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Listened to a couple songs. It was painful I suffered through it. I would give it negative infinite stars were it possible. made my son cry.
0071762345|5.0|This book is a must read for any business owner or marketer who would like to harness social media and gain the most they can out of it.  The author Dave Kerpen breaks down the different ways to be effective and successful with your followers across all social media platforms in easy steps that everybody can understand.  As with all business and marketing recommendation, the difficult part can be implementing them to fit your needs and uses, however this book makes it easy and simple.  This book also comes with many great examples of people using the different social medias effectively which can be realistically translated into your own marketing strategy.  I would highly recommend having a read!
0385738773|1.0|No, really, what did I read and why?  James Dashner, what, what, what are you doing?  There are a few cool reveals along the way, but as far as books go, this was not a satisfying conclusion to a trilogy.  We get answers, but the one thing I wanted to know most of all (Thomas' past) remains a mystery.  It felt like most of this book was pointless action that dragged on for no reason, so even though there were things happening, it felt like nothing was happening at all.  The plot was not advanced.  It was violence for the sake of violence.  Theresa and Thomas were, at this point, the only two characters I cared about, and Teresa barely showed up at all in the entirety of the story.  The ending was rushed, and yes, I enjoyed the few twists we got at the very end (the last page), but come on.  This was a story that needed answers and plot twists and instead, we got epic battle scenes that I didn't care about in the slightest.  This is not a movie.  This is not that kind of book.  More LOST, less epic ending of oh, I don't know, Harry Potter saga?  When there's a book that I've been looking forward to for a long while, it really sucks to end up ultimately disappointed.  I wish the story had been condensed into one book, because The Maze Runner was truly one of my favorite books, where the last two books were just pointless battle scenes one after the other.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|This DVD was a wonderful break from the \\"normal\\" main-stream music scene.  It was full of creativity and a lot more passion.  The band definitely works together wonderfully, and they bring to light a brilliant new mix of audio and visual aspects.  I was greatly impressed with the editing, personal comments, and finesse that went into the making of this set.  Vai shined as always, and the addition of the new violinist was a nice treat. Vai played with passion and made his guitars sound absolutely beautiful and riveting at the same time.  His arrangements and singing helped show his crazy side as well as wowing the audience with some favorites.  The band showed a little of their personal sides, and the great teamwork that they have in order to pull off such a great show.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to see an awesome show, and hear some of the greatest musical talent of our time!
0385738765|1.0|I always struggle with the second book in a series.  So much time is spent just stretching the story out to fit the designated three-book series format.  This silly trope of introducing a love triangle in the second book in a trilogy just needs to go.  Better yet, let's throw love triangles out altogether, is that something we can do?  I spent a large portion of my time reading this book alternating between wanting to chuck it and screaming \\"WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS BOOK?\\" at it.  I understand that the book was set up for the reader would have those unrelenting questions and want those answers desperately, setting up a pretty effective marketing model, but I'm sick of the same story format repeating itself over and over again in YA trilogies, and I want to be engrossed in a book without asking why it's stretched so thin and seemingly pointless.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love these puzzles! Its something different and challenging... love it! The music goes along very well with it, too!! Can't wait for Quell: Reflection!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This story is definitely in my top five romance novels I have ever read. Sometimes I ask myself, why do I read so many romance novels? I love them, can't get enough of them, and this book comes along and reminds me exactly why I read them in the first place. My reasons are to get a glimpse of what true love is like, to feel like a hopeless romantic for a couple of days while I lose myself in the novel, it's to put myself in the heroin's shoes and wish to God that I had a man that loved me like that & just for a couple of moments-feeling that kind of love reflected from the book to myself. Love is crazy, love can be sad, love isn't always perfect, but when it's real it prevails through all obstacles no matter how tough they are. This book encompasses all of those qualities. It made me feel all of those things and more. It will make you laugh, cry, it will make your stomach knot, it will make you crazy at some points, but in the end it is all worth it. THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE BEST ROMANCE NOVELS I HAVE EVER READ AND I WILL NEVER FORGET IT! Thanks to the author for giving me a glimpse into what true love can be like and what we all strive to find. Read it, I can honestly say you won't regret it.
030788743X|5.0|This is a great book! I am not a dungeons and dragons fan, nor am I into videogames, but I loved the nostalgia of all the old arcade games I played in high school. Great read, lots of fun, as addictive as a game.
B004SRNH10|1.0|I understand the benefits of developing apps with air from a developer's standpoint, but on a mobile device with limited space, it's ridiculous to require users to eat up extra storage so you can be lazy enough to not code a native version of your app.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent app.  Lots of levels, hard enough to challenge and easy enough to not get sick of.  Thanks for the app
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I was so excited to get this cd, and then I started listening to it. This is the worst idea ever. I appreciate the artistic need to create and be original, but Lou Reed has no business trying to keep up with Metallica's rhythm. I was so disappointed in each song, I couldn't even make it through one full song. I am a lifelong fan of Metallica, and I feel that if they had just done a full instrumental album it would have been phenomenally better than this. What a waste of money and talent!
B0054N73EY|2.0|It could have been better. I found only a few songs on it that I liked, which is rare for a RHCP album. I don't know what the trend is now with these bands just putting out mediocre work and expecting their fan base to adore it, but this isn't the finest work that the Chilis have done. If you are a Chilis fan, you might want to wait for the next round, a few songs that are worth listening to do not make an album!
0374530718|3.0|Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder is a summarized history of philosophy disguised as a novel, and the disguise isn't very compelling. If sitting in on a philosophy 101 lecture sounds like a good time, then this is the book for you because 90% of the novel is more or less that - a mysterious teacher recapping 2,500 years of philosphy to an eager young learner, Sophie Amundsen.<br /><br />There's a clever narrative holding the novel together that twists your imagination, but there's too little of it. Meanwhile, there's too much slogging through the historical impacts of one philospher after another.<br /><br />I enjoyed another one of his novels, The Solitaire Mystery, and I am suprised this one was more inaccessable for me since it's his most popular work.
0140158766|4.0|This is the sequel to Chickenhawk, which I read 8 Nov 2011, and is a sad but gripping book.  The account of the trip to Columbia to pick up 3 and a half tons of marijuana, and of the arrest on a South Carolina river, is well told and full of interest.  He finally got Chickenhawk published before he had to report to the prison at Eglin Air Base--a prison for non-violent criminals--and his account of his time there is a vivid insight into prison life. Some might resent the amenities the prisoners have but it simply makes sense that less dangerouc criminals not be treated as harshly as the more evil ones.  I found this book consistently interesting and the account of the success of his first book (Chickenhawk) I found overpoweringly poignant. Some of what the author says about bad effects of our drug laws makes much sense, and certainly the simplest way to end drug trafficking is to permit at least light drugs such as marijuana to be legal--the reduction in prison costs would be staggering and many a drug dealer would have to earn an honest living.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game involving strategy and luck. The directions suggest 3-4 players but you can play this with only two people.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Don't buy this for the digital copy or special features. While there is in fact a digital copy included, it's not similar to the previous Harry Potter digital copies. In the past an iTunes redemption code was included and all you had to do was redeem in iTunes and your digital copy would automatically download. This time, the digital copy is provide by Flixster. You have to create a Flixster account, download Flixster software, and then download the digital copy. BE WARNED THAT THE DIGITAL COPY CANNOT BE PLAYED IN ITUNES OR ON ANY APPLE DEVICE (IPAD, IPOD, IPHONE, ETC.). You are stuck playing the digital copy on your PC/MAC or streaming it on a portable device. Yep, streaming it. The only way to watch your digital copy on an iPhone or Droid device is via streaming. So no internet access means no movie on a portable device. The Flixster concept is just stupid.  Any digital copy that says, \\"Ultraviolet\\" cannot currently be played on any Apple device or any other portable media player either. This is not explained anywhere in the item description. Flixster claims to be working on the issue. Just FYI, when I complained to Flixster about the digital download joke, they sent me an iTunes redemption code for the same movie, which I thought was excellent customer service.  As for the Special Features of this combo pack, they are a joke. I guess I should not have expected more than 10 minutes of special features worth watching. No one wants to listen to JK Rowling promote her new website, listen to Daniel Radcliffe or Emma Watson deliver an interview for 30 minutes. People want extra footage (there is a little bit of that), behind the scenes footage, and more on how the world of Harry Potter was created.  The only redeeming quality of this combo pack is that I got the Blu-Ray disc, which alone is worth the $19.99 I paid.
B002KE47Z8|4.0|Jhumpa Lahiri deserves the Pulitzer and her writing is great, but I'd kill for a funny or light-hearted story from her at least once. Everything is doom. You're doomed if you marry a Bengali, you're doomed if you marry a white person. You're doomed if you live in the US, but back home in Calcutta wasn't much of a choice, either. So, though she's a good writer and I loved The Namesake, I gotta say this book is great but a downer. How about some satire about the immigrant experience rather than it all being, like the epigraph from Hawthorne hints at, just going into decay? America after all is the country everybody in the world is clamoring to get to. And everyone in the book is a bunch of well-educated, moody rich people who've never had to do 1) manual labor in their life, 2) live in a country with corruption and power issues [I'm talking about the lights going off any time of day and no air conditioning], and 3) have to live in a joint-family system, which translates to living with your in-laws, which is common in South Asia. And this situation is hell with lots of in-law fighting, which makes up for the greater portion of most drama serials in South Asia. Seems like Lahiri writes a lot of poignantly written trouble-in-paradise kind of stuff, almost as if she's warning her cousins back in India: \\"Don't come here--America isn't a bed of roses!\\" And why do all her characters seem to be so globe-trotting, as if they have some kind of permanent gypsy-like prerogative? As if nowhere is good enough for them?  And also, if living outside of your parent country brings feelings of guilt and malaise, how about GIVING BACK instead of GOING BACK--Calcutta needs lots of charity aid and expatriate Indians can (and do) built schools and hospitals back home. The characters in Lahiri could do this instead of throwing bundles away on gourmet whole foods. They sure do seem to eat a lot, and well.  It was good writing but if you're reading it fast for a book club it kind of wears on you after a while.  4 stars for fabulous writing, still better than a lot of the stuff out there!
1451648537|5.0|Great book, well written, unbiased, very informative and very enjoyable; tons of interesting information about the man and the computer industry. A must-read for everyone who loves biographies.
1594744769|4.0|I am a middle school librarian and we chose this book as a teacher book club read. It was enjoyed by most of the teacher's who participated and resulted in lively discussion. I think many people were frustrated with the way the book ended. There was no closure and left room for a sequel. I think we were hoping for a more \\"finished\\" feel. Interesting read and GREAT pictures.
0812550706|5.0|Many other reviews will give you a synopsis. So I'll just say it's a very well written story and an easy read(ages 10 and up according to the cover). At some points I wondered whether or not it was suitable for a 10 year old plenty of violence and details about a young kid going through a lot emotionally. In the end it was a good story but I would recommend reading it before buying it for a child.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My 10 year daughter read the books, and liked the series.  I then wanted her to experience the visual qualities that escaped her imagination and bought \\"Half Blood\\" for $5 on sale, then the 1-5 for $50 and \\"Hallow Pt 1\\" for $15, and finally \\"Pt 2\\" for $20 (to get the DVD).  I rather have all 8 for $80 here.  Basically, there're worth $10 per movie and you get them all here for that price.  If you're buying this for kids, skip the \\"special features\\" versions and just buy the movies at the lowest price.  After 2 1/2 hours (probably past sleep time) per movie, the kids do not want to see interviews.  Maybe teens want to see the actors, but c'mon people, if the kids read the books and viewed the movies, they need to do something else outside of the Harry Potter franchise.  I also dropped $100 on Warner Studio Harry Potter halloween costume, 2 wands and a broom . . .  enough.  So this set is a fair buy.
B0011FDVKE|4.0|I bought this CD for the song \\"Another Country\\" which is played in the movie \\"New in Town\\" with Renee Zellweger and Harry Connick, Jr.  The song is very moving to me and this woman, who I had never heard of before, has a very pretty voice.  I've only listened to the whole thing a couple times so far so can't really rate the other songs, although none of them sounded bad to me.
0756404738|2.0|Rothfuss writes well, sentence by sentence.  The problem is, he piles those sentences on top of each other until the story can't be seen beneath them.  As with the final two Harry Potter books and George Martin's ongoing mega-saga, this would have been much better at half the length.
0385738773|4.0|There were things I would have liked to see happen differently and things that weren't answered but overall it was a good book and a pretty good ending to the series.
B003PGNBNY|5.0|I ordered the product for a birthday gift four days before the party. I was surprised when I received it before the party. Very fast shipping and exactly what I ordered.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I'd like to disagree with the other review who said this book isn't good for the Kindle. I just finished it on my kindle and I had few problems with the pictures and the hand written notes. On the few times that I did, I opened the book up in Amazon's Cloud Reader and looked at the pictures on my computer. It was easy to do and since the pictures are every few pages it was easy to find the picture I wanted to look at.<br /><br />This book is an easy read. I finished it in about 6 hours. I enjoyed the world that the author created for this story making it very believable. I would love to see this book as a movie and I eagerly wait for the sequel!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game. Looks great, plays great, feels great. The simplicity yet underlying challenge of the game is what gives it such appeal. It's really worth the measly 99 cents to buy it.
B005KAJPY2|5.0|VNV has put out some incredible songs over the years (every album has had at least one great song) but they have never had an album this solid.  This is song after song of heavy VNV lyrics against irresistible beats and hooks that will force you to the dance floor. Great stuff!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Well Michael I have followed your career since day 1 and you have nailed something timeless here. My wife is a sentimental Sicilian girl with a doctorate in education.

B004KA9UXO|5.0|Great to see all the classic Dune novels on Kindle now. Dune is the kind of book that, if you haven't read it, you've left a huge gap in your knowledge of contemporary sci-fi and fantasy writing. If you never read any of the others, don't sweat it, this is the first and the best. Almost more quotable than the Bible.
B001LMAK88|5.0|I'm not sure about this one.  I bought it for my daughter, a new westerns buff.  I guess the movie is okay, but I've only watched it about twenty times, so the jury is still out.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|When I first watched this movie I was immediately in heaven with the soundtrack. I love the remakes of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"White Rabbit.\\" White Rabbit is one of my favorite songs, and so, finding this in the movie and in the setting it was set rocked. I am looking forward to getting this soundtrack!
B00005JNS0|5.0|The movie arrived as advertised, no scratches, plays fine. My son loves it and watches at least once daily. I love purchasing used DVDs on Amazon.
B0062LU85S|3.0|I would give this 2 1/2 stars if that were an option.   I realize that BD Part 1 the movie is not as climatic as Eclipse was. There's a wedding and really no action scenes at all. The movie which by the way was actually good for the first time in Twilight movie history (and I'm a hard critic to please). I pretty much hated this soundtrack until I saw the movie. The music does work in the movie somehow.   I never expect much from the Twilight movies, but this soundtrack is a little boring which compared with the Eclipse line up with artists like Metric, The Black Keys, Florence + the Machine, Sia... I could go on. Granted there are fight scenes in Eclipse and a lot more action so obviously more up-beat songs on that one, but the music on BD Part 1 is just a sad lead up from that. I guess we can blame Stephanie Meyer for that. New Moon is a slower movie as well, but still a great collaboration including artists like Thom Yorke, Lykke Li, & Grizzly Bear. The New Moon soundtrack was about as good as the Eclipse soundtrack to me.   I would have to say I am most intrigued by the song Cold by Aqualung & Lucy Schwartz. This is the most Twilight, slow, vampiric, tragic love-ish artistic song.  I also enjoy CIder Sky's Northern Lights and Turning Page (as it works really well in the wedding scene). From Now On works well as a Twilight-ish song too. Those are really the only highlights for me on this soundtrack.  End Tapes is a pretty good entry song, but is followed by a pile of a sappy songs unfortunately. And as far as sappy songs go: Requiem on Water, and Love Will Take You are pretty good.  Bruno Mars.... Really? Having this song that does not fit at all with the music genre that the Twilight soundtracks have created, makes the soundtrack into what the movies are... a pop sensation. Flightless Bird, American Mouth ... great song. No need for a slightly slower wedding version or for it to be in two out of five movies. Might as well have just put the original on the soundtrack. Find something different and more original. Neighbors is an interesting style of music and something unlike the usual indie alternative rock that has been on Twilight soundtracks' in the past, and it somehow it works.   This track list doesn't flow to me the way an album should. I think that this soundtrack could have possibly been salvaged with a Rob Pattinson song. Why was there two songs by him on the Twilight soundtrack and then never another? Also, if we are following the usual format of every other Twilight soundtrack, where is the Muse song? Each single Muse song seems to fit itself nicely into all three of the other soundtracks.  Bottom Line: BD Part 2's soundtrack has something to prove. Least Favorite Twilight soundtrack yet.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|As many other's have stated....UltraViolet Digital Copy is not a true Digital Copy and I, along with the rest of you, feel very duped!  I have all the digital copies but this one and while I LOVE all the Harry Potter movies I am not happy at all about UltraViolet.  Now I have to buy the digital copy from iTunes to complete my collection and it makes me very mad about the completely lack of disclosure by WB.  I will never purchase another UltraViolet \\"digital\\" copy again and will just wait until the true digital copy via iTunes or elsewhere is available for purchase for a reasonable price.    On another note and to make the other people who want everyone to rate the movie on the movie alone and not the lack of a true Digital copy....i love the final movie and I feel very sad that it's all over.  The Blue-ray is, as always, fantastic and I love all the extra features.  The interview between Daniel Radcliffe and JK Rowling was fabulous and I am really looking forward to Pottermore as well.
B0046MOVD0|1.0|This whole series is a mess.  I am a huge fan of the Resident Evil video games.  I remember hearing rumors of the movie in the mid to late 90s and I was so excited that my favorite game was going to be made into a movie.  Well, since then, I have been nothing but disappointed with each movie.  However, while I have been disappointed with each one, I always felt like they were at least worth watching.  However, Afterlife is just too messed up.  This will probably contain some spoilers, so if you don't want to have anything ruined for you, then stop reading.  Let me say, the very beginning of the movie is awesome.  It is revealed that the T-Virus' world-wide outbreak actually started in Japan, not Raccoon City.  Unfortunately, after this scene that lasts only a few minutes, the movie turns into a mess.  One thing I noticed was that there hardly ever seemed to be any zombies.  This just turned into a straight up action flick with the zombies thrown in only occasionally.  And since the movie series decided not to follow the game series' storyline, what we have are enemies in the movie that make absolutely no sense.    There are Majini zombies in the movie (if you've played RE 5, then you know what I'm talking about) that are completely unexplained.  And why are there Majini zombies?  That's not a property of the T-virus, they are caused by Plagas from RE4 and RE5's storyline.  Also, the Executioner (known as the \\"axeman\\" in the movie) makes an appearance in the movie.  It is actually pretty cool seeing him, but why is he there and where does he come from?  This is all unexplained.  And ultimately, Majini zombies and the Executioner are both types of enemies that don't belong in the movie.  The thing that really bothers me is that the story could have salvaged after RE Apcalypse.  Because in the game's storyline, after Raccoon City is nuked, that is the end of the T-Virus (actually the G-virus) and Umbrella goes under too.  This opens a brand new storyline of people infected with Plagas... but instead of following this, the movie producers decide to forget the video game storyline, do their own thing and have Umbrella save face and the T-Virus still continues.  So now when new enemies make cameos into the movie series, it makes no sense.  Because they are combining T-virus zombie enemies with Plagas infected enemies.  If all of this weren't bad enough, the movie itself just isn't good either.  At the end of RE: Extinction, we are set up to expect Alice to go to war with Umbrella with countless clones.  I never liked the idea, and apparently neither did the writers.  Because within the first 15 minutes or so, all of the clones are killed off and we're onto a new plot point.  Alice has her \\"powers\\" stripped away, but you'll never notice as she survives a plane crash unscathed and still is able to pull off all of her same acrobatic moves.  I only hope that one day, the Resident Evil series will be re-started and the next director can hopefully get it right and stay more faithful to the game's storyline.

1400069181|5.0|Whether you know anything about TOMS or not, whether you are a business person or a high school teacher, whether you are young or old you should read this book! Blake Mycoskie, founder and \\"Chief Shoe Giver\\" of TOMS, does a fantastic job informing and encouraging readers to invest themselves their communities. The book is full of nuggets of helpful information including lists of additional resources (websites, biographies, and other business books) for pursuing projects. Mycoskie's tone is very casual and the text is very readable. The purpose of the book is to provide food for thought and inspire readers to get involved in ongoing social responsibility projects or to start their own giving movements.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to everyone!
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|Considering the negative reviews, I was really pleasantly surprised by this album.  Judging by the reviews, I'd say about 40% bought it for Lou Reed and about 60% were hoping for another Metallica album.  Just to be clear, this is a Lou Reed project and he asked Metallica to be his backing band.  I don't think Metallica expected their fans to like this, but they have the musical collateral to do something completely different once in a while and get away with it.  As for Lou, he made a career out of it, and at almost 70 y/o he continues to.  It's great poker music, i wouldn't throw it on at a dinner party though.

B005LAIIQM|4.0|Does anybody out there actually dislike David Cronenberg? It's just bizarre to think that fans of any sort of film genre could hate, dislike, or not care for anything in Cronenberg's genre-spanning repertoire. He's a pretty versatile director and dabbles in a little bit of everything while leaving his fingerprints and trademarks all over everything he's a part of. Videodrome, The Fly, Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch, and Spider are a few personal favorites. With that said, A Dangerous Method more than likely won't be considered one of his best but is still a very solid effort overall.<br /><br />The entire film feels like an acting vehicle with Keira Knightley firmly in control of the driver's seat. Viggo Mortensen isn't really around much at all and his performance is the most forgetful of the three leads. His performance is still fairly engaging, but it pales in comparison to his co-stars and even his performance in his last film with Cronenberg Eastern Promises. Michael Fassbender does let his talent slip through his rather wooden-feeling performance at times. Carl Jung (Fassbender) and Sigmund Freud (Mortensen) are the two main scientific minds of the film and being know-it-all, emotionless drones is practically expected and kind of natural to think of when a scientist comes to mind. Fassbender at least shows signs of emotion and it's almost as if you can see the wheels turning in his head before he speaks at times, but Keira Knightley steals the show. Her facial expressions, body language, and hand gestures are just phenomenal and almost inhuman. I've never seen someone's teeth used to be so expressive before and her Russian accent isn't too shabby either. It'd be kind of a tragedy if Knightley isn't at least nominated for an Oscar after this.<br /><br />The film becomes notorious for the repetitive way certain scenes are shot. Two characters would be in frame, one in the background and one in the foreground (usually a close-up), and it would only last for a few lines of dialogue. It was a simple idea yet was visually intriguing and the technique usually made the shot more memorable because of it. There's also a scene near the end of the film with a discussion between Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein (Knightley) sitting by the lake. It's mostly absent of background music other than some piano that creeps in later on in the scene, but hearing the sounds of the lake during their conversation made it a little more spectacular.<br /><br />A Dangerous Method is set during World War I and is about how Freud and Jung developed psychoanalysis at its core, but is driven by the masochistic affair that develops between Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein. Their intimate scenes are usually fairly disturbing and incredibly emotional. They're practically the heart and soul of the film. There are also a handful of one-liners that are sure to stick with you long after the journey ends. (\\"Little do they know we're bringing them the plague.\\")<br /><br />A Dangerous Method is a little unnerving at times, but is very tame in comparison to nearly everything else Cronenberg has done. Keira Knightley is absolutely outstanding. A Dangerous Method is a well-written and intelligent drama that is powerful and superbly acted with just the right amount of discomforting material to keep you fascinated until those final credits roll.s a simple idea yet was visually intriguing and the technique usually made the shot more memorable because of it.

0307272702|5.0|I'm not a diet guy.  I'm fortunate that I've never had a problem with my weight or my cholesterol.  But when I found this on a waiting room table, and skimmed the introduction, I was intrigued enough to buy a copy.  It is a quick read, and (I know this is weird to say about a book on weight), quite a page turner.  I looked forward to finding time to read and finish the book.    I've known from friends' experience that low carb diets like Adkins work, and I've had a vague understanding of why. But I've never really understood the medical impact of such diets, particularly on cholesterol and other related measures.  The author really distills the science into a very understandable and believable summaries.  He backs up all his work with references to populations and medical studies from many different decades and geographies.  I spot checked a couple of the recent studies he references online, and found the summary presented by the author was accurate, not taken out of context.  There is a brief portion of the book towards the end where he gets into some of the \\"maybes\\" and a little \\"out there\\" for my taste.  But, that is a very brief section and didn't turn me off to the rest of the book.  In the end, I'm not going to make any dramatic changes, but he's changed the way I think about carbs and consider what I am going to eat.  I've started adjusting my meal proportions and portions in small ways, and I'll be interested to see what happens to my weight and cholesterol levels.

But seriously, I like a lot of the versions of these songs on the bonus tracks of the early 1990s CDs.  It's great to have as a complete artistic package though.  Still, its not the greatest Beach Boys album.  Pet Sounds and Today are better for experimental Brian Wilson \\"soundscape design\\" if i can apply that term.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|I should start off by clarifying, the movie itself is fantastic, but the quality of this DVD is atrocious.  The color is so bad I returned the first copy I bought to the store, assuming it was defective.  I bought another copy from a different store, and it is just as bad.  It is so dark that the actors' faces are barely discernible in most scenes, and the entire screen goes pitch black in several others.  In many scenes you can barely tell what is going on, if at all.  I loved this movie, and was looking forward to the DVD release.  I am SO disappointed!

B005NPLXJ4|5.0|First of all, this is NOT a \\"Metallica\\" record. It's Metallica experimenting with Avant Garde, New Wave, Minimalism, and Electronica.  The atmosphere and dark emotions created are astounding.  You won't hear Kirk shredding, but will hear the boys create an intensity only heard in the music of e.g. Steve Reich.  If you go in with an open mind not expecting to have a head-banging good time, you might have a whole new world open up for you.  Now do yourself a favor and listen to the \\"other\\" Lulu...the \\"Opera\\" (I know, it's a dirty word) by Alban Berg and REALLY get thrown on your ass!  You'll realize that there was METAL before \METAL/.  Sabbath was not the first use of atonality and down-tuning.
B001HN6922|1.0|Violence is everywhere in our current world. It's a fact of life, and as adults we all learn how to cope with it, avoid it, or confront it when we need to. I accept this fact. But I can't accept that in a movie rated \\"G\\", there are multiple scenes of violence, death, even torture. I'll need to explain these concepts to my child at some point, but I'd certainly prefer that I be able to wait until he's beyond the age of four. I'll be explicit so that other parents who are considering this movie will know exactly what they're in for: there are several scenes in which the \\"bad guy\\" pointedly tells his subordinates to \\"kill him\\" (directed a Finn McMissile and Mater). There is a full-blown torture scene in which a car is restrained, heated to the pain point, and then destroyed (the actual death is shown only as a reflection). There are a lot of guns, bullets, and missiles. There's plenty of hand-to-hand (or wheel-to-wheel) combat, which seems like a picnic after the other stuff.  I'm not anti-violence, and I appreciate a good action movie. But I'm 35 and my kid is 4. We have different perspectives on life. When a movie is rated \\"G\\", I  expect something significantly less violent than James Bond.  The first Cars movie is among my favorites. It's a fantastic story that has a great message and doesn't rely on explosions. Are Pixar and Disney really so short of ideas that they need to blow things up to make money? Come on...I know they can do better.
B00005JKJA|5.0|More than 1,000 people have reviewed this film. Almost 200 took the time and trouble to say how much they hated it.  What a triumph for surrealism.   Myself, I prefer to think of the heroine as changing into the poor suicide victim as she investigates her death. She \\"becomes what she beholds,\\" as William Blake put it. Or she shows that everyone comes to Hollywood innocent and turns ugly and death-haunted.   I especially liked the acting try-out scene, done entirely realistically, but seeming surreal because of the scenes surrounding it. I liked the fairy tale elements too.  I'm not particularly a fan, saw the movie twice, once ten years ago and once a couple days ago to share it with a friend. It was as good as I remembered and even more fun the second time through. Blake's THE BOOK OF THEL is a six-page short read that did the same kind of thing ... in 1787. I wish I had a dollar for every rock star and wannabe who is into William Blake and probably David Lynch as well.   It's a good world where movies like this can stir up so much continuing excitement.
0385504225|3.0|I think that if I hadn't read Mr Brown's other books with main character Robert Langdon I would have enjoyed this one much more.  The story felt very familiar and was quite predictable.  There were situations Langdon was put in that felt like they came out of previous books.  I will say there was one aspect at the end that surprised me but was that enough for me to take the time to read 500+ pages?  IDK.  All that being said I will probably continue to read his books but will more than likely be checking them out from the library instead of purchasing.
B004YJMQCS|4.0|This movie is another in the \\"final destination\\" genre. The plot is the same as the others, a person's vision prevents a lot of deaths and then death catches up with each person in unique and unexpected ways. The 3D in this movie is great. It adds a lot to the experience of watching. But as in the other final destination films, the interesting part is to see the many \\"Rube Goldberg\\" like ways death claims its victims. Movie has some imaginative turns in this way. There is also a little 3d movie in a 3d movie moment which is fun. Good to excellent special effects, decent and imaginative story and very good 3d make this movie a good choice for those who like this film genre.

I could suspend my disbelief and travel right along with Jake.  Loved the ending also!

B001E45XT4|2.0|I bought these about 8 months ago and have used them extensively since then. I wear them to listen to music and play games mostly, and wanted a microphone that I could also use in certain FPS and MMO's I play.  They work fine, however I have a big head and this headset isn't very flexible. The padding on the ear pieces is thin and doesn't protect my ears at all. I can feel a round hole in the earpiece where the speaker is set in, and the edge of that hole digs into my ears when I wear them. It becomes very uncomfortable to wear after about an hour and I have to take it off.  If you have a small head you might enjoy this headset, but I will be looking for another one that is larger and has better padding.

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I was fortunate enough to see a free advanced screening of Happy Feet 2 (Two) this weekend. Unfortunately, this is probably the worst children's movie sequel made to date. Unlike the first Happy Feet, Happy Feet Two does not have a story or message; nor does it have much to do with the first Happy Feet (other than most of the original characters/ voice actors).   This movie is simply just a weak excuse to sell tickets (during the Thanksgiving weekend/ holiday-- what a coincidence) of the 'newest 3-D movie', AND because it's a name (Happy Feet) that many people/ children recognize! Do yourself a BIG favor, don't be a victim of this bad movie. If your children absolutely insist on seeing this movie-- save your hard-earned money and watch it during the Matinee (half price) Hours; or better yet, convince them to watch another movie.
0743277708|5.0|I picked up an old dog-eared copy this book when I was in 4th or 5th grade at a yard sale. The lady selling it said that I wouldn't like it that much. It sat at home for the longest time until I was in 7th grade English class. There was this one particular section in the text book we had that intrigued me. It was various excerpts from the book that was part of a lesson on punctuation. After reading and rereading that particular chapter many times over it sparked a long forgotten memory. I had this book in my possession.....I must read this book. So the first thing I did when I got home at the end of the day was run into my room and dig out that forgotten dog-eared paperback book. It was at the point that I was in love with anthropomorphic stories and Watership Down in particular. For a week I read that book in between classes, in study hall, and on the bus. By the end of the book Watership Down had become a immediate all time favorite of mine. I have since reread my old copy of the book until the cover fell off and the book fell into 3 pieces. It's still stashed in my book case cover and all.  Now at my age I was an advanced reader. But I wouldn't suggest Watership Down to a kid younger then 4th grade unless they are an advanced reader. Some scenes are rather graphic and detailed. If I remember right I just about lost it during study hall when Bigwig was in the snare....I thought he was about to die and I was on the edge of tears. If you have a middle school aged student who loves to read (especially Redwall) I am quite sure they would enjoy Watership Down. I would also highly suggest this book to any high school student or college student that must write a book report. Why not read something that is interesting and has plenty of themes to explore.  I would love to own either a Kindle edition or a nice hardcover copy of this book for my little collection of favorite childhood classics so that it can sit between White Fang and Redwall. Sadly the Kindle edition is rather over priced when compared to others and the actual dead tree format.

014312093X|4.0|After the death of Control (head of British Intelligence also know as the Circus) and his being forced into early retirement, George Smiley has suddenly been approached to lead a secret investigation to find out if there is a mole in the Circus and if so, who it may be.  George knows that this is no easy task and that danger lurks around every corner, but it's personal and he's willing to risk everything to find out the truth.  This book starts off somewhere in the middle of the story and I found it quite confusing at first.  However, once Smiley starts looking back at the past and you're able to see the events that lead up to this point, it all starts making sense and the story becomes quite intriguing.  The most interesting thing about the story is that it is based on actual events that occurred when Le Carre was a British spy.  Because of this, you know you're getting a realistic look at what it was like to be a spy during the Cold War.  It's quite scary to think that this sort of thing can and does happen.  I'm very interested in getting the rest of the story, so I do expect to read the next two books in the trilogy at some point.
1933633867|4.0|If you what an in-depth answer to the question, \\"What is Money?\\", read this book. This book is full of interesting history and shows just how much an anthropologist's perspective can add to our understanding of some fundamental yet often ignored questions about economics.  Unfortunately, I ran across this sentence on page 96:  \\"Apple computers is a famous example: it was founded by (mostly Republican) computer engineers who broke from IBM in Silicon Valley in the 1980's, forming little democratic circles of twenty to forty people with their laptops in each other's garages.\\"  Now I have doubts about all the interesting things I learned from this book about the Axial Age and more since the author seems to muddle events that took place less than forty years ago.
B004EPYZTE|1.0|Top 10 check list for a lousy Conan Movie....<br />1) Find the most monotone, uninspiring narrator possible for voice-over (Morgan Freeman)<br />2) Cast Conan as a gym drop-out, muscle-less B-list actor<br />3) Cast Ron Perelman in any role<br />4) Ignore everything Robert E. Howard ever wrote about Conan<br />5) Only use Frazetta inspired imagery for the baddies<br />6) Create a truly bland, forgettable score<br />7) Pay as little as possible for props - buy plastic swords, knives and costumes on closeout from a Halloween store<br />8) All wood must be rotten, so head-butts or stomps will shatter any plank, spindle or board<br />9) The only power a \\"new\\" god has is the power to scream like a woman<br />10) Those who are evil, will in the end, forget how to fight, get clumsy and chicken out<br /><br />And that's just the start.  The only thing this mess had to do with Conan was that they called one of the characters by that name. They could have cast Conan O'Brien as Conan and it would not have been worse. It would have sold more tickets, though.<br /><br />I like Morgan Freeman - in the appropriate place. \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" \\"March of the Penguins\\" \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" - which movie does not belong in that list?<br /><br />Look, Cimmeria is supposed to be a rugged land of warriors - not some lame 2nd rate vacation re-enactment spot.  \\"300\\" had it right - send the kids out, see who survives. In this waste of time? Have the kids run around a hill with a small egg in their mouth. Whomever returns with the unbroken egg, wins.  What's next? Run down the hill with a cup of beer and see who spills the least?!? Then there's Conan's birth.  Anyone else notice that this was in the middle of a raging (albeit very lame) battle - and during the birth, everyone vanished - maybe it was lunch time.<br /><br />Perlman's lack of muscle and tone was distracting - I mean, this is a Cimmerian warrior?!? Jason Momoa would not have placed in the top 20 at any fitness or bodybuilding show. No muscles to speak of - not even a six-pack. This is the \\"massive\\" warrior who \\"towered\\" over everyone in his tribe, even as a youth. Yet here, Conan is the runt of the tribe. When he returns to his village with his collection of gory trophies, the men and women seem ready to faint. Huh? These are seasoned, blood-thirsty WARRIORS, remember? The tribe should have been more like the warriors from \\"300\\" - all ready to kick butt, not pass out at the first sign of blood.<br /><br />The battles were pathetic - the choreography was terrible. Watch the slave drivers use the whip - they have no idea how to us it! Or the scene where Conan \\"frees\\" the slaves. He rolls boulders down a hill, indiscriminately - yet only the slavers (and a cart of lettuce and some oranges) gets nailed!  When the topless women  slaves ask what's to become of them, it's basically servitude to Conan and his army (of which we ever only see three or four people) - and everyone cheers! I should note that the topless women are played by the least animated women ever to \\"grace\\" the screen - who thought bouncing C's and D's could be this uninspiring? Or un-interesting. They needed lessons from Russ Meyer.<br /><br />Watch when the freed slaves have to retrieve the key - look at the blades. Blunt and plastic! The bone mask? OK, it was broken with a simple sword blow.  Everyone knows it should never be reassembled.  Why not just destroy the fragments? Toss them in a volcano, crush them, and so on - keep them in ornate boxes under a floorboard?! (and did you notice how generations later the boards looked the same and there was no dust on the box?!) When it is complete - nothing. No effects - audio or visual. Did it look to you like they simply forgot to add the effects there? Oh yea, the DVD / BlueRay cover? Photoshop. Totally touched up. The movie slogan \\"Born on the battlefield\\" - how lame is that?<br /><br />One of the paragraphs from a Conan book still sticks in my mind. Conan returned to his homeland after years of adventures.  Hey lays on the frozen, snow covered ground to sleep, half naked.  Conan bunches up some ice and snow to rest his head on.  One Cimmerian warrior remarks - to paraphrase - \\"He has become soft - look - Conan needs a pillow to rest his head on!\\"  Does this sound like the wimps that infest this movie?<br /><br />Conan is constantly out of breath, panting after a run uphill. When he has to scale a wall, it's look for the easy way or stairs. In the novels, Conan is spidey-like in his ability to scale walls, cliff faces, craggy fortress walls - you name it. Here, he looks for the stairs. Or an elevator.<br /><br />This is Conan as Monty Python would do Conan. Only Monty Python had better acting and better production values.s up some ice and snow to rest his head on.

B004LWZVZM|4.0|Before the feature begins on the Blu-ray, there is a brief introduction about the production company behind the film, called The American Film Company.  They claim they are dedicated to fictional films based on American history, so I can assume there will be more films like The Conspirator, in the future.  I'm looking forward to what they produce.<br /><br />The film itself is an interesting bit of unknown history, unknown at least to me. The Conspirator tells the story of Mary Surratt (Wright), the mother of John Surratt, a known associate of President Lincoln's assassin, actor John Wilkes Booth.  Apparently, since the U.S. could not try Booth himself, having been shot to death days after the deed, a tribunal court was formed by the War Department to try Mary Surratt for her role in the conspiracy to assassinate President Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.<br /><br />James McAvoy plays Fredrick Aiken, a war hero, fresh from fighting for the Union in the Civil War, charged with defending Mary Surratt. His task is a nearly impossible one, as the country wants blood as payment for the loss of the beloved President.  McAvoy is a weak link in the story, as his portrayal is lightweight.  Aiken appears as though he's unconcerned with the outcome, despite the dialogue and the punishments he faces from friends and society.  There is no urgency in the performance.<br /><br />The story is smart and pretty fascinating, but unfortunately the script is choppy, as it drags in some places and paces much too quickly in others.  It makes for an odd viewing experience at times.  I would have liked to have seen more focus on the conspiracy itself, as much of the trial is spoken of, but barely seen only in very brief flashbacks.  Characters are introduced then cast aside, never to be seen again.  Others are talked about, but hardly seen, adding to the cloudiness of the proceedings.<br /><br />The majority of the cast (with the aforementioned exception of McAvoy and a severely miscast Justin Long) are very good carrying out their historical roles, both famous and infamous.  Kevin Kline is almost unrecognizable as the man behind the tribunal, Edwin Stanton.  He makes the most of his brief time on screen and is memorably villainous.  Wilkinson is also only briefly onscreen as Aiken's mentor, Reverdy Johnson.  He is solid as usual.  I've never been a huge fan of Robin Wright.  Her turn as Jenny in Forrest Gump, always struck me as a blemish in an otherwise classic film.  She is fine here, as she doesn't have much to do but look sad.<br /><br />As a whole, the film, directed by superstar Robert Redford, is a intriguing curiosity of a tumultuous time in our nation's history.<br /><br />History buffs would do well to check out The Conspirator.scast Justin Long) are very good carrying out their historical roles, both famous and infamous.

B000BT97AO|5.0|If one needs more evidence that Gaiman has one inventive, twisted brain (or perhaps two?), I don't know where you'll find it. The visuals, ideas, characters, and sheer inventiveness of this on-screen art (yes, art) are mind-blowing. If you don't get it - watch Mirror Mask again. Still confused? Good. Watch it again.  You'll keep finding new things to see and new twists and turns in the visuals.
B005C7SXNW|2.0|Submarine is one of those quirky and eccentric coming-of-age comedies in the vein of Rushmore.  Unfortunately, it's too quirky and eccentric for its own good.<br /><br />Oliver Tate (Roberts) is a peculiar young man growing up in Wales.  He finds himself with his first girlfriend, a peculiar firebug (Paige), while trying to save his peculiar parents' peculiarly sexless marriage.<br /><br />First time director Richard Ayoade, who also wrote the screenplay (based on the novel by Joe Dunthorne), is primarily known for his acting, having starred in one of the best comedy series in the last 20 years, The IT Crowd (a British show, available on DVD in the U.S., highly recommended).  He tries to hard to emulate Wes Anderson, but falls short.  Hell, sometimes even Anderson himself can be too \\"Anderson-y\\" (sic).<br /><br />The film is watchable, but ultimately forgettable.
B000BT97AO|4.0|Great movie to watch with the whole family. Fantastically creative and excitingly imaginative! I loved it just as much as my kids.
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Paul is an oddly subdued comedy, but could have been an over-the top-disaster, so I can forgive it for it's sometimes lack of lunacy.<br /><br />Pegg and Frost (both of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame) play English friends visiting America starting with San Diego's Comic Con and continuing with an RV trek across the U.S., visiting famous UFO sites.  Along the way they encounter the real thing, (almost literally) running into Paul, an alien who has been a guest of our government since the 1940's.  He's on the run and heading for Wyoming to meet up with a ship ready to take him back home.<br /><br />We learn that, over the years, Paul has been giving advice to our government, movie studios, and other sources, contributing heavily to the pop culture of the last fifty years (this leads to a pretty funny cameo from a well-known Hollywood director).  He looks like the familiar basic alien because he was used as the model.  Paul likes to smoke, drink, curse, and joke around.  And he can be a douche.  He's a uniquely American alien.<br /><br />Naturally, the boys agree to help Paul, meeting Kristin Wiig (who nearly steals the whole show and has some of the best lines), redneck morons, a bible-thumping nutcase, and eccentric government spooks along the way.  Bateman and Weaver play it straight, but have some amusing conversations chasing our heroes.<br /><br />Director Mottola doesn't have the whimsical touch of Pegg and Frost's usual director of choice, Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World), but he does have a pretty decent comedy pedigree in Superbad and makes Paul a lot of fun.<br /><br />It's not the holy grail of comedy we're used to from Pegg and Frost (who also wrote the screenplay), but it's an entertaining and playful piece of quiet schtick.

B004EPYZUI|2.0|Director Zack Snyder has a keen sense of visual style. His films are a visual feast for the eyes: 300, Watchmen. Sucker Punch is no different, but for me, where it has a lot of style, it is missing substance.<br /><br />Browning plays Baby Doll, a young girl institutionalized by her abusive stepfather. She dreams an alternate reality in which she is in a dance hall/whorehouse, and devises a plan of escape. What makes it more crazy, is she creates another alternate reality, within the alternate reality. Whenever she is supposed to be dancing, she's actually fighting alongside her fellow inmates against hordes of demon Nazis searching for the things she needs to escape.<br /><br />I can see how writers Snyder and Steve Shibuya are trying to make something out of all of this, how we sacrifice for those we love, but it's just an excuse for a creation of another fantasy world where all the sexy girls are dangerous assassins, carrying big guns and samurai swords. They kill demons, fight a dragon, and blow stuff up.<br /><br />These action scenes are pretty cool, but as they exist as a coping mechanism of Baby Doll's incarceration in a mental institute, they are incidental and unnecessary. Just an excuse for action scenes.<br /><br />Ultimately, Sucker Punch feels like two different movies jammed into one. But, unlike peanut butter and chocolate, they just don't go together.

B0058ZPMYG|3.0|I've known guys like Hesher. Chain-smoking, tattooed, long-haired, stoner douche-bags. It's easy to instantly dislike Joseph Gordan-Levitt playing said douche-bag, but of course, this the movies and life-lessons must be learned, so Hesher turns out to be an o-k guy, just with douche-y (sic) qualities.<br /><br />Life is in major suck mode. Young T.J. (Brochu) and his Dad (Wilson) are in mourning. Along comes Hesher (Gordan-Levitt) an uninvited guest, who makes himself at home in their garage. Grandma (the terrific Piper Laurie) doesn't mind at all, in fact, no one seems to mind. T.J. has a crush on a check-out girl (Portman) and they form a friendship. All of these lives intertwine throughout, leading the story into humility, sadness, and redemption.<br /><br />Hesher is a sweet film. Nothing Earth-shattering, by any means, but a semi-quiet (except when inside Hesher's heavy metal van) story about dealing with life. The cast does a great job with director Susser's debut film.<br /><br />Worth a rental.
1451627289|5.0|This book isn't your typical King read.  In 11-22-63, Kings writing ability seems to be more on display.  He creates characters that you care about mixed in with real characters that you really care about.    And most importantly, he causes you to  imagine. What  would I do under these circumstances?  I'm 62 and I vividly remember this era.  King does a good job of painting the times.  What, no cell phones?  Party lines, what were those?  For a lot of younger readers, these may be unfamiliar.  11-22-63 was the 9-11-2001 of my generation, and King depicts it accurately.  Of course I kept asking \\"Why doesn't Jake just go to Las Vegas to bet where his winning would be a little less obvious?\\".   There were a few insignificant historical errors.  For example, the Dallas Texans became the Kansas City Chiefs, not the Cowboys.  But for a book sweeping across time as this does, these can be forgiven.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|When a bunch of stereotypical college students make stereotypical assumptions of a couple of rednecks, all hell breaks loose in the horror comedy Tucker and Dale vs. Evil.  I don't want to give away any more than that quick summary, as I wouldn't dream of ruining your movie watching enjoyment.<br /><br />TaDvE, is horrifying and hilarious.  It takes bold shots at The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Evil Dead (I & II).  It works as a comedy and as a gore-filled horror romp.  The rarest of the rare.<br /><br />Tudyk and Labine have solid chemistry as Tucker and Dale, respectively, and they work well together as an inspired new comedy duo in the tradition of Jake and Elwood Blues and Abbott and Costello.  Their comedic timing in both the physical and the verbal aspects are dead on (pun intended).  I sincerely would love to see them in a sequel.<br /><br />Director Craig, making his film debut, has a keen eye for action and comedy.  I read in Entertainment Weekly that his mother, Sally Field (!), read the script and approved.  High praise indeed.  Cinematographer David Geddes uses some unusual and effective angles to heighten the tension and the laughs.  Writers Craig and Morgen Jurgenson have created memorable characters placed in a crazy-ass situation.<br /><br />I loved, loved this movie.  I can see it becoming a cult film being shown at midnight showings in the future.  I'm sure it will become a favorite of mine.<br /><br />It didn't get much of a distribution into theaters, so be sure to seek it out on blu-ray or DVD.  If you like good comedy and don't mind some red splashing around, this will fit the bill quite nicely.

B0052U59F4|3.0|I have a lot of feelings about this book. Overall there were parts I enjoyed -- up until about 65% in. After that it went downhill for me. I'm reading the second one and so far it is not picking up. *** Warning that there may be spoilers ahead ****<br /><br />In terms of exploring characters and creating conflict to use as a tool to explain characters it gets high marks. I caution though that this is not really about BDSM in spite of what it might appear. To me the BDSM here is vilified -- as Ana puts it \\"Why would you want to hit me?\\" which of course extends to hurt physically and so on. She is constantly searching for the reason for him to 'have' to do this - of course inherently that lends to the belief there is something 'wrong' with him. Ana is being portrayed as innocent but it's hard to buy into the way she is - on one hand she lives with a roommate and does normal things and the other is she doesn't have a cell or a laptop.  Not to mention someone that had been shuttled between parents and had some of those experiences should already be more mature than she is presented. Though I did think that showing her as being attached to old novels and such had a kind of \\"head in the clouds\\" feel and helped explain a bit her lack of common sense in the real world. I had very high hopes with their convo from the beginning -- the email exchanges in particular are fabulous. So here's what I'd say-<br /><br />The good:<br />* Character driven - who you get a real sense for (warts and all) - inner dialogue is strong although \\"inner goddess\\" is lame -- but thank goodness that is not all that frequent least in the beginning.<br />* humor is used to great effect with witty, snappy dialogues<br />* the emails are simply phenomenal - one star alone is for them. I have seldom enjoyed reading as much as I enjoyed them!<br />* the sex is pretty good - don't worry anyone who does not \\"get\\" BDSM - it's not really here anyway - it is just kinkier sex.<br /><br />The bad:<br />* Characters are at odds with actions - though development is welcomed I did not buy where the book ended up as far as what Christian was willing to do. It did not ring authentic to me. As for Ana she starts off thinking she could be a sub but then this goes by the wayside completely -- with really no true exploration. I wasn't feeling that -- seems immature to me.<br />* Ana getting her way pretty much all the time makes me think of Christian as, well, wimpy<br /><br />The ugly:<br />* BDSM comes off as the bad guy here - it gets no real explanation and is being used to drive the exploration of Christian's issues. What's weird is that some of the sex scenes that incorporate some D/s elements are suitably hot -- but come off as vanilla just the same.<br />* the constant emphasis on how gorgeous Christian is wears thin about 30% in to the book<br />* Ana's innocence is overdone. It's like a bad Victorian spoof! Come on - a twenty something WITHOUT a cell phone or laptop? Seriously?? Riiiggghhhtt....not buying it.<br />* the emasculation of Christian is just not attractive. I had to put this in both categories (bad and ugly) since that's how I feel about it. I went from \\"hubba hubba give me my own Fifty\\" to \\"no thanks - I like a man who I cannot run all over\\"<br /><br />My opinions only - my sense is that folks who like a very angst driven novel with a \\"he loves me he loves me not\\" feel will enjoy this. Those who enjoy tortured heroes may as well. Since those are not the books I tend to pick this one falls in at 3 stars for me AND it would have been 2 stars without the emails.

0525423656|4.0|I nearly passed on this novel, being rather indifferent to Matched, the first book in this projected trilogy.  Still, I do like dystopian future novels and the last one read quickly enough, so I decided to give this a try.  I'm glad I did.  If not a great book, it's a better book.<br /><br />In my mind, the problem with this book is much the same as the last one--Cassia is just not very believable as a rebel against the Society.  Though her dogged pursuit of Ky in spite of hardship raises her believability somewhat, I'm still not satisfied.  However, Ms. Condie sidesteps this problem rather nicely by bringing Ky forward as a narrator with Cassia.  (The chapters alternate between them.)  Unlike Cassia, Ky has the past and the skills to be a real rebel.<br /><br />In fact, it is what we learn about Ky's past and the people who live on the edges of the Society that make this novel interesting.  With more revels about character (as opposed to just revels about the world we're inhabiting), the stakes get a lot higher here.  There's an energy to this book that was missing before.<br /><br />The plot is a little pat and the ending a bit flat, but I'm interested enough now in the characters to come back for more.  I'll be checking out book #3.

For the noobs, reading this review...this movie is FILLED TO RIM with symbolism.  From the start, to the finish...there is symbolism throughout the movie.  If you watch and missed that....watch it again, only more carefully.  This movie is a MUST on any movie buff shelf.  Thank god, it's finally on Blu-Ray.  I love how David puts Roger Ebert's clearly retarded and clueless review on every release.  David clearly laughs as hard or harder than I do everytime I see it.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Unfortunately, this product, according to information I had at an authorized service center here in Brazil, comes with a hard fault which is typical of this model. After only 2 months of use, the display of the clock went off and did not care anymore. Searching the net I saw later that it has numerous forums about this problem or very similar and that was not the first nor will I be the last. Some watches even return to work (after a couple of days without work) after waiting a few days to put it in the charger, other timepieces take weeks, some no more.  Worse, some even with comings and goings of technical assistance to return to similar problems.  Unfortunately, moreover, is an expensive product over the competition. I have Garmin GPS for cars and never had problems, moreover, the quality is excellent, but this watch i only indicates to anyone, only to enemies.
B003PIUBZS|2.0|Sparticus has moments, but overall it bores me to tears. First, the combat scenes are laughingly phoney & look like something out of Batman & Robin in the 1960s. Cartoonish to say the least.  Next, the guy playing the leader of the House of Batiatus looks like a middling accountant in LA. His seemingly only lines of conversation are \\"F...\\" & once again the same. He has the vocabulary of a 13 yr. old &n is completely unbelievable in this role. Talk about being miscast! Then you have the gladiators themselves. They are WAY over muscled & look like a lifting show for men. Not very realistic at all.  Naturally, sex scenes are a major part of the series but again, way over done, w/ even women spectators in the stands going topless at times.  All in all, it is completely unrealistic w/ cartoon blood spattering everywhere & ninja style jumps that are hilarious. The only saving grace are the scenes dealing w/ the internal politics of the day.  This series demonstrates how badly Hollywood can completely screw up a good idea for a film.  I could do MUCH better than the director as well as just about anyone simply pulled off of the street.
031603441X|4.0|I was expecting sex, drugs and kiss and tell. I did not get this. At first I was dissappointed, but when I changed my own attitude and read not what I wanted to see in print, but what Keef wanted to say, I was impressed. I found that I did not know who he was. He is someone who is extremely deep, very caring towards his family and extremely dedicated to music. Now, maybe all the rest is true, but I came out learning a great deal more than the regular books of the Stones.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Ok. I've had my satechi for about a week and I have used it extensively. So here is the pros and cons.  Cons:  1. The the \\"dynamic\\" option to boost the music makes a hiss sound and has occasional static. It only enhances older mp3's that are really low and not to be used regularly.   2. The remote only works close up.  3. The soundfly will occasionally remember old information and must be unplugged and restarted to reflect file updates.   4. When the car is cut off the song starts over from the beginning.   5. The sound isn't great unless you play with the controls on your radio and minimize the soundfly volumes.  Pros:  1. No more cd's to burn (hurray!!)  2. Listen to almost 80 cd's in your car. That's 32 gb.  3. Navigate easily inside music folders.  4. Simple to moderate ease of use.  5. Brag to your friends how electronically savvy you are.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The movie is great. I love Harry Potter but the digital version won't play on any I-pod or I-phone. Since this makes up the lion share of portable devices out the it makes it completely worthless.
1451648537|4.0|I have always admired Steve Jobs.  I just saw the PBS special on him and had to learn more.  It was a very interesting read, but I was left wanting to know more about his personal life.
0140120416|5.0|This book starts from the very beginning with the cyrillic alphabet and explaines the most important grammar topics, which aren't simple. I started learning Russian with this book from the very beginning and it helped me a lot when I was in Russia and needed to communicate with natives. The exercises with answers are very useful to verify the level of comprehension. I definitely recommend this book.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|As a long time Amazon Prime customer, I probably have every app they offer for IOS and Android.  I do most of my shopping on Amazon.com as well.  I have in our arsenal multiple Windows, Linux and OS X machines, two iPod Touch devices, an iPhone 4, iPad 1, HTC EVO 4G Android phone and a Vizio VTAB1008.  I say \\"our\\" arsenal as my wife and I share the devices.<br /><br />The Amazon Mobile app on the iPhone and iPad is very nice.  Still not as good as the real website, but close.  It isn't as good on my HTC EVO and I can't even install it on my Vizio 8\\" Android tablet as Amazon says that it's not compatible.<br /><br />If I'm on the go, I have both the iPhone and HTC with me, so I just reach for the iPhone.  If I'm home and away from a computer (like in bed), I'll grab the iPad to get on Amazon.  With the Vizio, I obviously have to use the web browser.<br /><br />If I had only the two Android devices, shopping on Amazon wouldn't be nearly as convenient or happen as often.
B00000JLX0|4.0|It should be noted that the VHS Col.Ed. in the blue box may have only come as a full screen version.  The UPC sticker on the back corner of the box clearly states Titanic Gift Set (Pan & Scan):  ISBN 0-7921-5322-7.  I have seen a white box version with a gold widescreen sticker on the front on the internet.<br /><br />Is the gift set worth it?  The filmstrip is random, so you take what you get out of 17 possible images.  The booklet is color and sepia photos, primarily of Leon and Kate, with lines quoted from the dialogue.  If you want a making-of sort of book, look elsewhere.  If you want a gift for a romantic, here you go.
0316017930|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but rarely do I read a book that has this kind of impact on me. Gladwell's other books are good, but Outliers is his best at engaging the reader and causing a significant shift in thinking. My friends and I read the book at the same time and it made for some great conversations. I can't recommend Outliers highly enough.
0307405095|5.0|I just love this book by Martha Stewart on pies and tarts.  The recipes are easy and the pictures makes it great to follow.  I saw this author on her show and wanted to try to book.  Well, its a great assest to any baker who also wishes to expand these recipes to savory pies and tart.  What a treat :)
0525423656|3.0|I want to give this book 3.5 stars.   I was so excited to finally get my hands on this book! I've been anticipating its release for so long now.   Overall, I enjoyed reading it. I mean, I read it in 2 1/2 days. If I had not enjoyed reading it, it would have taken me much longer to get through. But is it the best book I've ever read? No. Did I like it as much as Matched? No. Compared to Matched, I found it to be a little less riveting, a little slower moving. But I believe Crossed has served it's purpose as a middle book in a triology.  With Crossed, the writing style is much different. It's from a 2 person perspective. It did help me understand characters better, but I still have not decided whether I liked this technique or not. I wonder how it might differ if it was just written from Cassia's perspective. (Although, having the added perspective of Ky helps us understand events and the story line a little better. Plus, He seems to be such a closed off person. I don't know if we could get a good read on Ky or what he has experiences just from Cassia's point of view alone.)  I don't think this book was as mentally engaging for me as Matched was, but it was still enjoyable trying to put pieces together and trying to guess what things meant, or what was going to happen next. Of course, the book left loose ends. I'm wondering who of her loved ones will see Cassia again, or who she will end up with. I wonder about the farmers and what part they'll play. I wonder if the Rising will really end up being as corrupt as The Society. I'm wondering what way of living will give everyone the happiest life.  I'm okay with the unanswered questions and the pace of this book because I realize that is the nature of in-between books of a trilogy. The second book always serves as the bridge between the first and the third. Is it usually more pensive, explanatory, and slower that the first or the third. That's why I say, it is what it is. It is book two of a triology. having this in mind,and understanding the dynamics of trilogies may help you enjoy this book more. I'm once again counting down the days until I can read book #3!  -------------------------------------------------------------------  OPINIONS AND FUTURE PROJECTIONS: (Contains slight spoilers)  Overall, I'm team Xander. My heart is a flutter whenever he comes around. He seems a lot more attractive in personality and quality. Ky...just...there's something about him that I don't trust. I don't trust for him to stick it out with Cassia. I don't trust him to make things work, no matter what. He's too introverted and stubborn and insecure. He seems like a whiner when it comes to his past. Get over it. Don't use it as a crutch. He doesn't want to live up to his responsibility. He needs to just RELAX and loosen up a bit. He seems to be very guarded and on the defense, even with Cassia. It BUGS me. Why should she have to work so hard for him? In this book, he has become more of an angry, bitter, cynical person, and he still thinks of himself to be his #1 priority. Cassia faces death and dangerous circiumstances several times to find him. And when she does, and then wants to go with him to The Rising, he just counts himself out? Cassia can go her own way now, because he won't go to the Rising for anybody? That initial attitude just baffled me. I would have been done with him right then. He just seems to give up on things when they seem to get to complicated--he just plans to remove himself from the situation. Frustrating! From my current perspective, i do not think Ky is the best person for her right now. I'm not hoping for this \\"love can conquer and transform all\\" theme in the next book. Though that idea may be true, it doesn't mean that is what always happens. Sometimes fighting for a relationship so hard, when the other is not willing to work as hard as you, can eventually come to the point where it's not even worth it anymore.  I'm wanting Cassia to choose Xander in the end. He's just a total hearthrob, and the kind of guy anyone would want to marry. He'll love her always and always do his best to take care of her, AND make sure she's happy! Cassia's relationship with Ky is starting to bore me. And i find that it is just sooooo much work for Cassia to maintain this relationship, it's almost not even worth it. Especially when you have very awesome Mr. Xander on the other side. I'm curious to see what happens in book three. I hope the story doesn't leave me dissappointed.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Excellent item! The shipment was very fast! Very pleased and now I can take more pictures.....happy shopper! Way cheaper than retail store.
1451629184|4.0|I absolutely 100% respect and admire this brave young woman for enduring what she went through.  Despite her captivity and the mind/body manipulation she went through, she knew deep down in her heart that what her captures were doing was wrong, and she held on to hope.   The book is truly her own thoughts, and she is very perspective and insightful- such maturity for a girl her age.  She did what she had to do to survive, was which basically submit, mentally and physically, to her kidnappers. Kidnapped at a young age, she didn't have a choice to know what to do in her circumstances.  The deviant details are disturbing, but she doesn't get into FULL detail, but paints a general discription of what Phillip did to her. And she mentions the general details just a handful of times, enough to give the reader a realistic view of what basically went on for several years. So the disturbing details are not frequent, but just sprinkled here and there.   PROS:  I like how she is so perspective in her book, telling the reader her exact thoughts and mental state throughout the years.  She is very clear in her thoughts, and due to this, the reader receives a full picture of what she went through.  She doesn't gloss over the deviant, sick details, but also doesn't go so deep into it, but upholds her dignity.  I like how she included \\"post-captivity\\" chapters, including her reunion with her mom, reconnecting with her old friends from school, her days with her therapist and horse therapy, and more.  I've always wondered how things were for her in the very first days after her discovery, and now I know.  CONS:  Because of her education level, her writing style or sentence structure is very elementary and not as \\"sophisticated\\" as other books you may read.  It sometimes took me a couple of times to re-read a sentence to understand it.  This is no fault of her own, obviously, but an editor's touch could have made a difference.  It doesn't take away from the story, its just what I observed.  But I know in the 20/20 special she had said she wanted the book to be strictly her words, not an editor's.  Enough said.  I would have liked her to discuss more in the book her mental state when she was pregnant, such as: did she know she was pregnant before Phillip/Nancy confirmed it to her?  Or did she think that her belly growing was just part of growing up? To learn you are pregnant by your rapist is a traumatic thing, and I wanted to know her state of mind during those experiences.  She is very honest in all other matters.  Overall, a compelling, disturbing book, but one of triumph and hope.  May God continue to bless her and her family.
B000K3V0AQ|4.0|It's interesting that this anthology of Agatha Christie's early Hercule Poirot short stories has remained unadulterated through several reprints over the years. A prolific writer's shorter works are often shuffled and reshuffled for successive anthologies.  I just read a crumbling Dell edition from the late 1950s/early 1960s (the price on the cover is 45¢), and the table of contents is consistent with other editions under this title.  Together, this particular set of stories collects early markers of Poirot style and themes.  It would be ripe for a critical introduction, because the stories are apparently plunked unedited from their original appearance.  The novella length title story, \\"The Under Dog,\\" is narrated in the 3rd person, but the rest are narrated by Poirot's friend Hastings--if you are not familiar with other Poirot stories narrated by Hastings, you may be at a loss for wondering to whom the voice belongs at first.  There is a pause about three-quarters of the way through in one of the stories with an insert signed \\"the editors\\" that suggests the reader stop right there, formulate a guess as to the solution and then read on to see if it pans out.  None of the others do that, so I'm assuming that is a leftover device from the magazine in which it originally appeared.    The stories are mostly fine, vintage Christie. She was obviously enjoying herself. I did not fully appreciate the debt Christie owed Sherlock Holmes for Hercule Poirot until I read this group together, the confident, eccentric detective and the play along friend/narrator.  And one of the stories, \\"The Lemesurier Inheritance\\" has a Sherlock Gothicism going for it.  That said, you can see Poirot and Christie bursting out on their own, creating a measurable distance from Holmes and the 19th century.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I wasn't wild about \\"Chasing Pavements\\" so I didn't pay a lot of attention to Adele's first effort, \\"19.\\"  Things changed with this CD.  I absolutely love it!  It has such a rich, bluesy feel to it.  Some of my favorites aren't even the singles (\\"Rumour Has It,\\" \\"One and Only\\").  Of course, the masterpiece of it all is \\"Set Fire to the Rain.\\"  I can't get enough of that one and I love Adele's delivery.  Overall, I'm well pleased with this product.  In fact, I'm such a new fan that I think I'll give Adele's first CD a listen.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|I absolutely love this show.<br /><br />This season started out slow and methodical at first, leading you in different directions and keeping you interested, much like the first half of the previous seasons. Once the ball gets rolling halfway through the show becomes borderline addicting. The writing, acting, directing... it's all pure genius, the level of which has become a rarity on today's Television shows.<br /><br />You will love this show.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Hubby liked this dvd set. We had never heard of it because we don't have the channel on our cable. But we ordered it anyways because it sounded interesting and he likes this type of thing. It was great! Season 2, here we come.
0756686970|4.0|If you are a Lego Star Wars fan, this is a must-buy book as there really is no other book with as much information about the Star Wars minifigures (the Visual Dictionary focused more on the SETS). Also, it is worth getting just for the Ceremony Han Solo (which you can add to your Ceremony Luke from the dictionary, and it is said that Ceremony Leia will be in an upcoming 2012 set).  HOWEVER, if you are looking for a comprehensive Lego Star Wars minifig book, you will be a little disappointed. A collector who wants to know and see all the different VARIANTS of a particular minifigure, say Jedi Luke, will instead see a single listing of him where it'll indicate that there are 7 variants. It does have separate pages for other VERSIONS of Luke (like Tatooine Luke, Hoth Luke, etc.), but really, how hard would it have been to include even a small photo of all the other variants (yellow skin, flesh skin with two regular hands, flesh skin with one black hand, white pupils, just to name a few). Even if it didn't want to include such photos, at the very least it could have listed the set numbers of the variants so we could know how to find them. Instead, it just shows a couple variants and then merely states VARIANTS: 7.  So to sum up, it is a character encyclopedia. It is not a Lego Star Wars minifig BIBLE.
B0061DOEJI|5.0|I will have to come back later with a fuller review, but I've listened to this whole album twice now and I am just blown away. These so-called young soul and neo-soul singers should use this album as an educational tool to see how it's really done. This is one of the best albums I've heard all year regardless of genre (and I listen to all types of music). Betty Wright's voice is simply amazing and has lost none of the luster it had some nearly 40 years ago. You can call her the \\"Godmother of Neo-Soul.\\" Buy this album! You won't be disappointed.
0374532990|5.0|This book is an amazing urban planning memoir with not one boring recollection in the entire book! Highly recommended for everyone with an interest in NYC urban policy and planning.
B00622D3BS|5.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie, and I was not disappointed at all. It is well written, well acted, and done perfectly. The cast of this movie couldn't be better, and the story is not some gushy love story, more about the bumps in the road of life and love and how different people cope with those bumps. Great sound track, too. I really enjoyed this film and highly recommend it.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|If you liked Final Fantasy you'll like this app. The graphics are \\"meh\\" but the gameplay and plot is solid. Haven't beaten it yet but so far I've been entertained.
B005VMVUAQ|1.0|Where are the academy award winning actors Nicholas Cage and Nicole Kidman? They didn't show up for this movie. It is watchable, but well beneath both of their acting abilities and I'm surprised either one of them agreed to be a part of this film. I would wait till it shows up on tv to watch this and am sorry I paid to watch it, and embarassed for two actors who I usually like. Leaving Las Vegas anyone? Where is that Nicholas Cage? Please find him and have him show up before this imposter makes any more stupid movies and completely ruins his career.
B005F96URI|1.0|The film attempts to follow in the visual story  telling of Sin City, 300, The Spirit etc., but fails. The story line and the acting leave a lot to be desired.  The movie is full of popular actors, but no stars. You recognize mostly what I can only guess are out of work actors.  This is a typical Saturday afternoon made for cable movie.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|This is a very good movie, and refreshing in the sense that it is a totally different story than most action films. The story is new and exciting, from the beginning to end it is non stop action, with twists and turns along the way that keep your attention. The characters are fully developed, and acted out perfectly by the excellent cast of this movie. I highly recomment Hanna for anyone who likes a good action movie.
B0002EXH40|5.0|I really like Youthanasia. Megadeth change a bit their sound on Youthanasia, but i like what they became in this part of the 90´s. Some songs like RECKONING DAY, TRAIN OF CONSEQUENCES, YOUTHANASIA and BLACK CURTAINS are Megadeth´s high class heavy metal gems.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|This movie is soooo overrated. Slogging through 2+ hours is not worth your time for this garbage. AVOID! I like Brad Pitt, but this is one of his worst.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Rust in Peace is a complete masterpiece by the best line up Megadeth ever had!!!Mustaine, Friedman, Ellefson and Menza  create this monster record with 9 songs, and the 9 are Megadeth´s classics! HANGAR 18, TAKE NO PRISONERS, 5 MAGICS...I really love all the songs, it´s one of the greatest and most inspired moments of heavy metal!
B002WY65UQ|1.0|I mistakenly thought this film might bear some generic resemblance, at least, to the original series, which were hilarious.  No.  the contemporary version is vulgar and not in the least bit amusing.  The tone of the film is uncertain, and the person who plays the part of Ms. Fritton is hopeless.  There was style, humor, and hilarity in the original film; this is modern Britain; evidently NOT a fun place.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Endgame is one of the best albuns from Megadeth! All the songs are powerful, with some of Mustaine´s highest moments like HAND THAT BITES, BODIES,THIS DAY WE FIGHT and ENDGAME. GREAT GREAT ALBUM from one of the best metal bands of all time!
0312330537|5.0|Gregory David Roberts has created a classic in every sense of the word.  Just as works like Dubliners and Pale Fire are taught to every generation of literature students, so too will Shantaram.  It's one of the great books -- a vital, timeless epic that asks (and answers) so many of humankind's essential questions.  It challenges precepts, explores moral and spiritual dilemmas, and accomplishes all of this in the most vibrant, readable prose.  An unforgettable journey that every book lover will cherish.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|Countdown to Extinction is one of the greatest metal albuns of all time!!! After some masterpieces like PEACE SELLS and RUST IN PEACE, MEGADETH really mature their sound and create this classic album!!! It´s more polished and slow than the fast frenetic Thrash metal of their previous albuns, but all the songs are amazing!!!This is like THE BLACK ALBUM from MEGADETH...don´t expect the furious raw thrash and enjoy this masterpiece!!!One of my favorite albuns of all time!!!! REALLY GREAT!!!!!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Midnight in Paris is, without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable films that I have seen in a long time. Masterly crafted by director Woody Allen, it is a well paced film, full of beautifully shot and magically captured moments of Paris. A film of romance and love, Midnight in Paris also uses the science fiction device of time travel to create a very fun and compelling story. The ensemble cast is wonderful and entertaining. This could easily be considered one of Woody Allen's best films.
B001KP2Y3K|3.0|I like her music and her voice. She has a soft voice and melodic sound. However, as on many recordings today, the music occasionally overwhelms the voice. Not as bad as many though. I hate the overproduction on so many recordings.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Crossed was an excellent continuation of Matched.  I loved all the geography and detail that Ally used to support the drama of the characters.  I felt like I was there in the \\"carving\\" with the characters, feeling what they felt, and seeing what they saw.  Her descriptions were beautiful.  The story line was well thought out, and she left just enough questions for the third book to answer, but resolved enough so as not to disappoint her readers!  Overall, I can't wait for the next book to come out! Ally is a wonderful author with colorful descriptions!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Movie is great, but don't offer a digital copy that is crap.  The iTunes digital copy or Windows Media Copy is the standard of what a digital copy is.  It can only be used on the devices registered to the original redeemer and therefore is a safe and reasonable way for the movie industry to limit pirating.  This Ultra Violet crap is ridiculous. What if they go out of business?  Who wants 15 different programs that you have to remember which service you have what movie with when you can just go to iTunes and get all of them.  Warner Brothers... listen to the people.  ULTRA VIOLET SUCKS.
B0040QYROA|5.0|This is a review of Kino's The Complete Metropolis (1927) which was released in November of 2010.<br /><br />Briefly, Metropolis is one of the greatest silent movies ever made and everyone who loves movies will appreciate this version.  The influence that this 1927 film has had on the whole history of modern cinema is profound.<br /><br />For those who don't know about the movie.  It is a great early science-fiction morality play/love story, complete with mad scientist and an iconic robot all wrapped around a modern retelling of the Biblical Tower of Babel story for the industrial age.  This movie was inexplicable edited down right after its premi&egrave;re and has suffered at the hands of various film butchers afterwards.  In the 1970's, what was left was very poor quality versions with most of the film cut out and thought lost to history.  Through several persons and institutions, an effort was made to search the world for every piece of existing footage.  Those efforts have resulted (as of 2010) in Kino's Complete Metropolis.<br /><br />Half an hour of footage was discovered after Kino's earlier restoration of Fritz Lang's Metropolis and that footage has been incorporated into this new version.  The discovery of this new footage is a cause for celebration for every movie buff.  With this footage incorporated, whole plot elements have now been restored to this great silent film.<br /><br />The result however is a vast difference in the quality of the footage:  The earlier restoration is pristine while the newly discovered half hour is very poor quality.  This is not the fault of Kino, it is simply the best (read: Only) copy available and Kino worked on that footage as best they could without further loss of picture.<br /><br />Furthermore, although this is titled the Complete Metropolis, there are still at least two pieces missing from the movie.  First, the fight between the mad scientist and the master of the city is still missing.  Most believe that a motivation point was part of this scene (a reason why the Master orders the gates open later in the movie).  That scene is the last important part of the film left to be discovered.  The second part still missing from the film is the scene where we would have seen the Preacher behind the pulpit (later imitated by the thin man).  The fact that these two scenes are missing does not subtract at all from the enjoyment of watching The Complete Metropolis.  We can only hope that these scenes still exist somewhere and will be discovered someday.<br /><br />This version also restores the Original music made for the 1927 release.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />NOTE: Those looking for the 1980's Moroder version of the film (the wildly colorized short version with the Rock n Roll soundtrack) will NOT find it in this release.  However, in 2011, the Moroder version has been re-released on DVD and Blue-ray and it can now be purchased elsewhere (A version I also love and recommend to anyone who loves 1980's rock music).n point was part of this scene (a reason why the Master orders the gates open later in the movie).

0316098337|4.0|This was a difficult book for me to read.  The subject matter is disturbing, but I think it definitely helped to have the story told from the perspective of a five year old boy.  This tends to insulate the reader from some of the harshness of the topic, and you definitely get a different perspective, one I had not considered.  It was a good exercise in examining what I consider to be \\"normal\\", and how in other situations, there might be a different \\"normal\\", especially if it's the only thing you are familiar with.<br /><br />I thought the book started off slow, with Jack's descriptions of Room, but then it picked up in the middle, only to slow down again at the end.  I had some questions about why Jack did some of the things he did, when it never seemed to occur to him to do those things a week previous.  I know that children truly believe that a birthday changes everything (\\"now that I'm five....!\\"), so I guess that could be the answer.  I could understand why Jack would use large nouns and adjectives, but struggle with subject/verb agreement (as some people do even into adulthood), but it was still jarring at times.  Some of these complaints may be related to the fact that I have not had children yet, so I'm not used to the way they interact with their environments.  Also, I was a little confused about why Ma didn't teach Jack any manners until much later...<br /><br />Despite the sometimes overwhelming minutia of Jack and Ma's life in Room, and the language incongruencies that interrupted the flow of the story at times, I did truly enjoy the book.  I think it's an important, and timely topic, and I really enjoyed thinking about it from a different perspective.  I also enjoyed the fact that we are not given many descriptors of the physical appearances of the characters so that each reader can fill in this detail based on their own life experiences.
B0000042GM|4.0|Katchen's playing is mesmerizing, and the music provides an interesting insight into Brahms's development as a composer over the course of his life. My one qualm is the excessive white noise in the background on every track. It really does disrupt my enjoyment of the music. I would look around and see if you can't find another good reading of the piano works without this drawback.
1451627289|3.0|If, like me, you are not really a Stephen King fan, but come to this book because of an interest in the Kennedy assassination be warned that over half this novel has little to do with that epic event. Our hero, Jake, returns to the past, for unexplained reasons, in 1958 and so has much time to fill before he can attempt to prevent LHO from his enormity, and I would guess that close to two-thirds of the novel are taken up with his adventures/romances that have nothing to do with why he has returned to the past. Mr. King can tell a story and it is easy reading and the characters whose stories he tells are likeable. But for those like me, who are only interested in re-visiting the curious and enigmatic events surrounding the Kennedy killing, it is a bit of a slog. This could have been an interesting and concise novel of about 250 pages about 11/22/63, but I guess for King bigger is better. For me, not so much. I did enjoy however those parts of the novel where Marina, Lee and the perhaps Mephistophelian de Morschildt take the stage.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Thanks to someone borrowing our DVD of this movie, I needed to repurchase it new as cost effective as I could. Brand new. Arrived exactly as promised. Made my experience easy & quite enjoyable. Thanks for an outstanding job ! This one get's labelled as \\"MINE\\" & won't be lent out. It's been watched several times since the day it arrived, and due to the fact it's a timeless classic for our family, will be ENJOYED for many years to come.Don't hesitate to purchase. I had an excellent experience from start to finish for this one !

1439192812|4.0|Richard Dawkins missed his calling as an author of science books for children.<br /><br />The Magic of Reality is a wonderful book that feeds the reader spoonfuls of science anyone can understand in a friendly way. He still makes no apologies regarding belief in myths and gods as fairytale material; but he does use valid scientific facts in his explanations.<br /><br />If this book was part of every child's education there would be better educated children coming out of both primary and secondary schools.<br />In earlier books, Dawkins used his adult voice to speak to adults without sparing those who do not have a sufficiently full vocabulary. In The Magic of Reality, Dawkins' \\"voice\\" reflects a less strict discipline that works well and should appeal to younger students.<br /><br />Other reviews offer more on the contents of this book but my intent in writing this review is to heartily recommend this book to parents who want their children to understand the \\"magic\\" of science as well as understand how things actually work.<br /><br />Buy this book. Read this book and let your children read it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1439192812 The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True]]
B0058VW36U|5.0|It's really simple, and yet really addicting. It reminds me of angry birds, not a lot to do to beat a level, but a lot to do to figure it out.
1609611543|5.0|OK, there are hundreds of us all saying the same thing:  this book changed my life.  I've been wheat free (and low carb) for 2 1/2 months and I'm feeling great, losing weight.  I happened to have \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" blood panels done.  I was borderline high cholesterol before,  now my numbers are all in the ideal range (217 before vs 190 now).  My father, a doctor, was convinced I was taking a statin as he'd never seen the numbers move so low without medication.<br /><br />I love this book because Dr. Davis' style is very easy to read; yet the book conveys complex and sophisticated information.  I love that he cites study after study.  I was doubtful of some of his claims (that there's a link to alopecia areata, for example) so I appreciated being able to google the study he cites myself and read for myself what it said.  (Dr. Davis was correct!)<br /><br />I can't find the words to say how important this book is.  It is revolutionary and earth shaking!
0316098329|4.0|All things considered, I liked this book. I enjoy crime novels, and this was close enough (it was definitely related to a crime novel)  that I had a definite interest in reading it.   Donoghue is very clever in her writing, slowing unfolding the story in a way that isn't forced. However, 300+ pages in a five-year olds voice and I was beginning to get annoyed - the only saving grace was that it was such a quick read I was able to finish it before wanting to throw it at the wall.   I recommend anyone give it a chance.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|So disappointed!  And I spent $30 at the only store where I could buy it immediately in Japan.  My kids have already asked me to put it on the ipod. :(  What a waste this ultraviolet is.
B005J29HCQ|4.0|As much as I'm glad that Smile has finally seen release I have to admit that it's a bit of a letdown for me. I came late to the Smile party. I only recently discovered it earlier this year (July/August?) and downloaded the Purple Chick Reconstruction. It blew my mind and I haven't been able to get these beautiful songs out of my head. I've watched the Brian Wilson Presents Smile DVD and have purchased books on the making of Smile. Having now listened to this new release I have to admit I'm slighty disappointed. I guess having played the Purple Chick mix to death I grew accustomed to hearing it a certain way. The Purple Chick reconstruction sounds mostly in stereo and the songs flow into each other better; sounding more like a \\"suite\\". This new release, though I know it's mixed in mono for historical reasons or because that's how Brian Wilson would have mixed it, I have to say, it just doesn't sound great to my ears. Plus the gaps in between the songs takes away from the \\"suite\\" flow that I'm used to. It's great that this has finally been released and the songs are still spectacular (not taking away from that at all!) But I think I'll stick with the Purple Chick Reconstruction bootleg. It just sounds better to me.
B0052TDGQO|4.0|This is the first album from Scotty McCreery, and overall, a very good first album.  Many of the songs were written to appeal to a younger listening audience (songs about girls, football games, etc), but they're still enjoyable to listen to, even if you have been out of high school for 30 years like I have.  The songs are actually very well written, and all the little things that make a great album are present.  Scotty's vocals on the album are very good, the background vocals are also very good, and the recording is first rate.  Give this guy a few more years and some songs with more mature subject matter and he'll be a huge star.  But for now, just enjoy a very good freshman effort from a guy with real potential.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|I have a hearing problem and the first five seasons of West Wing were great with good sound and closed captions.  For seasons 6 and 7 I had to really jack up the volume and the only closed captions were in French and Spanish.  useless to me.  I am going to see how I can return a produ[[ASIN:B000HC2LI0 The West Wing: The Complete Series Collection]]ct for the very first time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't usually pay this much for a Kindle book, but this one was well worth the price.  I was a sophomore in high school in 1963, so this was a reminder of that time for me.  The book is very thought-provoking, an enjoyable read and one that I will read again.  The book is long, but never slowed down.  Loved this book!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really loved this book! At first I thought it was overly dramatic, but then I rememebered when I was a teen and EVERYTHING was a big drama, so it stays true to a teens perspective.  I have to admit that for whatever reason (maybe it is the good bad boy) I have read this book four times and find myself returning to it when I want a good little love story. I would love to see this author write more romance.
B002SF9YNO|3.0|A good movie with some interesting characters (e.g. the boss) that could have deserved deeper picturing. I found Masahiro Motoki's play not very expressive, which is no good for some scenes that could have been poignant. The movie is good otherwise, but don't expect \\"award-winning\\" quality: it is good, not excellent.
0385738773|5.0|This was a great end to the series! I thought The Maze Runner was an excellent read and The Scortch Trials was WAY better! After the second one I didn't think James Dashner was going to be able to pull off a final book that would stand with the previous two. I'm happy to say that I was NOT disappointed! So much action and suspense right from the get go! I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I will say this: characters will die, other will come back, secrets are discovered, lines will be crossed, and above all The Gladers have had ENOUGH and take the fight to WICKED! Oh, and you finally find out how Newt got that limp! (Sorry, but that was a small detail that I had always wondered about) It really took me by surprise too. You even learn what happened to Gally from The Maze Runner (which I'm glad that part is explained too). Read this book!
B005D0RDKW|5.0|From a technical, engineered, sound and video standpoint they finally got one right. This is by far the best sounding live recording they have ever done. DTS 5.1 Master is AWESOME! There's actually some low end to this one....yeah! Blu-ray vid through Oppo 93 and 60\\" plasma looks excellent. Very ...very good quality.   My only complaint is that the song selection sucks! Coming from 40+ shows going back to Hemispheres I'm sick and tired of everything on MP but Camera Eye. Come on guys. Get rid of every \\"hit\\" and give us a B sides live. Please!  It rocks, it's Rush. If you have a good blu ray player and sound system....buy it.

B005F96URI|2.0|I picked this up as a rental and could hardly make it all the way through. It feels like a stage play, all artsy and full of unusual sets. But the actual story is weak and feels like a series of pasted together moments. If you're in the mood for an interesting visual experience/experiment, try it out. If you want a good action movie, don't bother.
1419702203|5.0|The actual hardcover is a beautiful color blue and is of fine texture.  Inside the book are excellent photos from George's childhood to his gardening days at home.  It is a very personal book and one that compliments the documentary.  Nothing in the book is different that the Documentary but if you love George than this is a must own especially this quality for $20.
B0047Y17P2|3.0|I thought this Connelly was pretty half-hearted ... written like he was meeting a deadline and not crafting a great story.  Skip this one.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Our family (4 boys) have watched this film for quite a few years.  It's witty. It's sweet.  It's magical and it sums up our feelings for the holiday. This film is a MUST HAVE in your home library.  It is clean.  There is no nudity, or course, suggestive language.  It's goofy and charming.  It has an all-star cast (IMHO) and it is one of the BEST films ever!

0634049011|5.0|This is a great book but after the 1st day I had no need because I have two personal friends that are guitar educators who contacted me and offered to guide me. Still, if you are a beginner I highly recommend this book to start then move on to fretboard logic or other advanced books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard about the Hunger Games I will admit I was annoyed. I didn't like the similaries between the Hunger Games and Battle Royale, a popular Japanese book/manga/movie (which I adore). I also didn't like all the hype the Hunger Games had, as I thought \\"oh jeez, not another Twilight saga\\".  I eventually borrowed a friend's copy of the Hunger Games and dove in, mainly to tear it apart. However I was suprised how much I liked it and found myself not tearing it apart, but getting engaged in the storyline. The futuristic setting is intriguing and the characters have depth.   I ended up buying all the books, as I found they got better with each volume, and I wanted to have these to display (because they are that awesome). These books are NOT Battle Royale. Similar story at the beginning however it quickly separates and goes the other way.
B003LPV960|5.0|NANNY MCPHEE is a delight of a film with a glorious turn by Emma Thompson as the infamous nanny.  We also get a stellar cast also including the great Colin Firth as well as Angela Lansbury.  This film has a heartfelt message in its center and can get uproariously silly in its well spun tale.  This film is definitely made for kids but is highly recommended as well for the child in all adults.  Grown ups will either squinch a little at the foils the children get into or watch with glee.  Parents with kids will find this the ideal film to share and laugh together with as life's lessons are learned.<br /><br />And the blu ray is the way to go.  The film comes to life with a video presentation that jumps off the screen.  This is a colorful, vibrant film and colors are bright and pop in spectacular clarity.  Flesh tones also are superb.  The picture is also very crisp and no fine detail goes unnoticed.  The black/white ratio is also excellent.  The superb audio presentation then brings everything together.  Dialogue is strong and present and the whole speaker system comes to life with each fun filled action scene.  If you've been watching the dvd viewing this blu ray will make it a brand new experience.  You will be awestruck with each scene particularly the superb ending.  Can't recommend this film enough for its joy, positive message and fun filled story.  And the blu ray just makes it all better.  Grab the kids and have a glorious family night with a blu ray that will entertain over and over.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|My brother and I sat in the theater in 1977 all day watching Star Wars over and over.  This is not the Star Wars we saw.  In fact, the movies are beginning to look like cheap YouTube hacks of the originals, not a professional production from a Hollywood studio.  Shame on George Lucas.

015603008X|5.0|For some reason, whenever I went into a book store to buy something random, I kept on picking up this book and then placing it back on the shelve, looking for something \\"lighter\\".  One day, I found it in a second-hand store, and deciding there was a reason why I kept being drawn to it, I decided to buy it.  I took one look at the very first page, and was immediately convinced.  The story is absolutely fascinating and the way Keyes portrays the main character through his writing, which reveals his mental development along the book, is a stroke of genius!  Absolutely Brilliant!
0316056863|3.0|Tina Fey is hilarious.  One of the funniest, smart women in TV and movies.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book, and I recommend it.  I think you will like it if you don't set your hopes too high.<br /><br />I laughed out loud, I learned a few things, and I enjoyed the details behind different decisions made on her TV shows.  The chapter about photoshoots and photoshop was hilarious and enjoyable.  The chapter where she explains her father was also great.  My favorite is a chapter where she is simultaneously filming 30 Rock with Oprah, deciding to impersonate Sarah Palin on SNL, and throwing her daughter's birthday party.<br /><br />I think I enjoyed the chapters when she was working as an adult more than her childhood ones.  Overall I would recommend this book for a fun, entertaining read.
0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey is possibly the most talented woman of our generation currently working on TV.   She is a brilliant writer of comedy and a hilarious story-teller, never afraid to make fun of herself as a way to make the audience laugh.  In this book, the adorable Fey tells us about growing up and how she was able to write her way up to the \\"big leagues\\", eventually landing a show based on her experiences working at SNL (30 Rock).  I adore Tina Fey and absolutely loved this book! I just wished it was longer.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Coming from a semi-fan of Lou Reed in the 1970's, and a diehard Metallica fan since the beginning: Woof! This was a bad idea. Uncatchy melodies, irritating vocals (pitch and words), forgettable album cover. I just don't know what Metallica is thinking these days. Not sure if I can even forgive the 69 year old Lou Reed for this mindless perverse banter. I was excited to hear this after Lars Ulrich went on about this album on \\"That Metal Show\\". I listened to this once and will never listen to it again. In the song \\"Little Dog\\", the lyrics \\"Our Money Can Do Anything\\" hits the nail right on the head. Absolute crap... you've been warned.
0439023513|1.0|I really enjoyed \\"Hunger Games,\\" and though \\"Catching Fire\\" seemed to be less riveting to me, I was hopeful \\"MockingJay\\" would really bring the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion; however, \\"satisfying\\" is one word I will not apply to this book. Ever.  The overall theme to \\"MockingJay\\" is \\"war is terrible.\\" And that's a fine theme to write on, perhaps a bit overdone, but a worthwhile topic if you have something new to say; Collins doesn't. Imagine reading about four hundred pages artlessly and reiterating this point without expounding on it or bringing the reader to a cathartic, or at least meaningful conclusion about all the violence in the book, except maybe to add that people who endure war can never be happy again. Truthfully, that's Collins's final point: the main characters that survive the bloodbath gain some semblance of a normal life, but it seems to be in such a way that they will never heal from their psychic wounds. They merely exist in a shadow of a normal life. I suppose that is my biggest frustration about the last book, that Collins's leave the reader and her characters feeling hopeless.   Besides all this, the book suffers from poor editing. There are times when I couldn't follow what was being written because passages were too vague or ambiguous. For instance, (and this is a spoiler alert) all the surviving Hunger Game champions are given the choice of whether they want to continue the games. There is a argument about this, but the passage leaves the reader without any clear understanding as to whether Katniss and Haymitch voted to continue the games. I'd like to think they wouldn't, but the book isn't a great source on that point.   I was also pretty peeved with Collins's direction with Katniss. I lost count how many times Katniss woke up after being knocked out or passed out, only to find huge sections of plot had moved on without her and the reader. That was deeply annoying. Katniss appears as a figure of action in the first two book, but huge passages of text pass with Katniss being relegated to just talking or crying or feeling bad while action happens... off page.   I won't even touch on how disappointing I was about what Collins did with Peeta and Gale, or the confusing, bizarre ending sequence that asks readers to believe President Snow rigged an entire city with fantastic, elaborate booby traps. Sigh, Suzanne Collins, please, please, please-- can we get a re-do?
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Excellent movie. Clear and simple, which I need. I do understand that this was only one perspective... at the same time, it was pretty interesting to see certain people avoiding questions/giving evasive answers when directly questioned. And it was also interesting to see who refused to be interviewed for this movie.<br /><br />I'm buying it. And I'm watching it over and over again, until I understand the nuances. Whether you agree with it or not, I hope you'll consider at least borrowing it / renting it and watching it just once. Only when we consider a variety of viewpoints can we ever make an informed, rational opinion on anything.
1401219268|4.0|Politics can influence one's beliefs.  Moore's supposition that Dr. Manhattan's strength and protection would make America less safe is the equivalence of Peace through Weakness.  The inevitability of nuclear war is specious - possibility, not inevitability.  At times the characters act smart or stupid depending on the plot.  SPOILERS  AHEAD.<br /><br />After learning that the Comedian found out about something so monstrous it made even his blood run cold and suspecting World War III after knowing that the Comedian is afraid to stop it, no one thinks \\"Who has this much clout and ability\\".  Only Veidt has means and motive.  No criminal would do this.  A foreign power wouldn't spook the Comedian.  Dr.  Manhattan would need no secrecy.  Neither Dreiberg nor Rorschach (Kovacs died long ago) tells the authorities because that would ruin the end of the book.  The people at the New Frontiersman don't give Rorschach's journal even a cursory look - for the same reason.  A killer killed Veidt's secretary instead of Veidt.  The killer shot at point blank range.  Everyone assumed Veidt was the target.<br /><br />The book is filled with loopholes, ridiculous things and moral ugliness.  There is Rorschach's absurd fight with Veidt.  Laurie calls out to Veidt before shooting him.  Veidt catches the bullet.  Moore doesn't realize the speed of light or vastness of space.  Osterman's comment that \\"Mars did not choose life\\" is rationalizing his own selfishness as standing up for inorganic matter.  Mars cannot think or choose, moreover, if there were no life, there would be no point to the universe because there would be no one to notice it.  Earlier you have Laurie leaving Doctor Manhattan despite possible consequences.  Veidt even refused to admit that he murdered his servants.  So many of the characters are solipsists.  It's all about themselves.<br /><br />This Veidt, the smartest man in the world has an idiotic plan for peace.  It wouldn't work.  Within a few years to a decade, things would go back to the way they were.  Veidt said \\"let's compromise\\", but asked for capitulation.  The moral ugliness of Osterman (Dr. Manhattan) and Veidt is crushing.  Osterman says that \\"nothing ever ends\\", implying that peace will be undone.  He, of course, is admitting that he murdered Rorschach on a whim, just to see Veidt's plan unfold.  When he leaves for good, he is saying that the earth can die because he has no stake in it.  The ending of the book still suggests peace, though it hints at Rorschach's journal being looked at - two months too late.<br /><br />The high point of the book was the study of Rorschach - chapter six - how a hero turns psychotic.  He goes too far and is mostly violence oriented, not a thinker, but at least he cares, and not in the abstract as does Veidt.  Fascinating.  The character, an atheist, lived his life free from compromise and faced death without complaint.  He is the most interesting character in the book, and the only one I have some sympathy for.<br /><br />Lastly, some of the book is filled with such raw ugly descriptions (like the pirate sections) that defy comprehension.  The book would have been better without such overkill.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, the book cannot be dismissed.  This disturbing book will haunt one.  I wish Moore had written in detail about it and what he intended.  One thinks about \\"heroes\\" advocating a murder coverup.  One thinks about Veidt's insane plot and Rorschach's unwillingness to look the other way.  What would they have done if Rorschach had lied and later had exposed the plot.  I'm sorry, Mr. Moore.  I guess I shouldn't think such things.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Perfectly executed, engaging superhero saga that imagines the beginning of Professor Xavier's X-men. Nice to see Kevin Bacon in a villainous role! What makes this work when several other of the comic book adaptions that have appeared this year haven't? Story first, special effects second. Get the tale right, and then throw in the pizazz. My personal favorite movie of the year, after WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Just wanted to do a real quick review on this product.  I needed a case that was inexpensive and yet durable for my white iPhone 4S. It would such a waste to get a white iPhone but not be able to show it off. Aesthetically the look of the clear case complements the white iPhone 4S in such a manner that the the clear rings on the back do not deter the overall look of the case. The material is made from a hard rubber and does provide support and protection for your iPhone. I have personally dropped my iPhone a few times from waist height, and it has survived each and every fall. The case does leave openings for the earphone jack, on/off switch, volume buttons, and the speakers/charging port. I do like the large camera opening for the iPhone camera, so far on all my pictures the case has never interfered or distorted the photo's quality unlike some cases, where the white case or key holed openings for the camera have interfered with picture quality especially when the flash is being used.  There is an amazon logo on the lower back of the case which might not go so well with other people, however it is a small price to pay especially when you are getting a good quality clear case for such a reasonable price. After a day, I find myself to not even notice the amazon logo. Another plus for the product is that the case does not add bulk to your iPhone. Unlike other cases such as the otter box which add a significant bulk to your iPhone, the amazon clear case does not sacrifice size for protection. I am still able to keep the iPhone in my pocket and not make it look like I'm carrying a brick. With that said, I give it four stars because I  tend to find it difficult at times to take the iPhone out of the case. I believe it is due to hard rubber plastic material the case is made out of. It does not give way like a silicone case would but then again you can be sure that your iPhone can take a drop and come out fine. All in all, for a very good reasonable price and for good iPhone protection, the Amazon Basics Protective TPU Case is the way to go. It protects your iPhone without adding bulk and does not cost the average paying consumer $20-$30 for a good quality iPhone case.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|I find it outrageous that you cannot buy the DVD version with the Rowling interview. That the interview can only be seen on the Blu-Ray version. I refuse to purchase a Blu-ray player so I will simply not buy this movie at all. Thanks a lot, Warner Bros.
0553386794|5.0|An amazingly readable epic fantasy novel. Excellent political intrigue in a medieval world. A worthwhile read for anyone that loves the Lord of the Rings or any fan of the fantasy novel genre.<br /><br />It took a little while to break into the story -- lots of names and families to learn -- but once I did, I was hooked. I went through the last 200 pages like a glutton, reading faster and faster to learn what would happen.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|Ordered this in a rush because my SB600 crashed just before a series of shoots.  Now, the old one is repaired by Nikon (not cheap....nearly what I paid for it new a few years ago)  SB700 seems reliable and works well.  Battery life is quite long...a nice plus.  Like the \\"locking pin\\" for the hot shoe as the SB600 has.    Have shot hundreds of photos with it and am very happy.  Sure hope that this does not need costly repairs too.  But, if it does, I now have a spare.  Will never use the stand, but not a big deal.
B002Q9VPFM|4.0|The graphic novel escaped my notice in the fast flowing stream of pop culture and I've never read it. Conventional wisdom  says that the movie's good but flawed because it's too faithful to the original material. Since I've never seen the 'original material', then, my review may offer some perspective. The movie has an appealing premise, cast, cosutmes, set design, good special effects, fast moving plot and enough gritty 'noir' atmosphere to satisfy us fans of that genre.  The premise is just believable enough to create a 'real world' for these characters. The 'heroes' are flawed humans (well, Dr. Manhattan was and still is sort of human) acting out a sci-fi mystery.  There are quite a few 'adult' moments, with nudity, simulated sex and bad language but these fit so integrally into the story that it isn't offensive.   The 'Black Freighter' story within a story is probably appealing to the fans of the 'graphic novel' (aka comic book) but for my money are unnecessary. I'm sure there's some allegory or meaning connected to the larger story but I prefer to enjoy the film on its own as a good 'noir' yarn about outlaw, past-their-prime costumed vigilantes in a global power struggle with evil, large and small.   Despite the opinions of other reviewers, I think the story moves along coherently. You can easily tell when the time frame shifts forward and back.  It may not have 'big name' stars but the actors here are very appealing and fill up the screen as well as any big dollar talent would in these roles. The Comedian is a scene stealer and Rorschach is as good as you'd hope. Dr. Manhattan and Nite Owl both become fully engaging characters by the end of the film. I can see why this has become a cult classic.  I will watch it again soon.
159420229X|5.0|This was probably one of the most useful - and fun - books I have read in a long time.   The author reviews how evolution has affected the development of human memory over time and how our memory system is not well-suited to today's kinetic lifestyles. Armed with this information and how to take advantage of how our memories most efficiently function, one can begin to memorize large amounts of useful information.  I have used this affectively in learning to play the piano (memorizing scales, sings, etc.).  A great book for high school students for summer reading - the pedestrian task of memorization of facts becomes much less daunting and less time-consuming.
B004TB6GQI|5.0|I got this really fast and I totally love the whole cd. I payed a cheaper price than in stores. Happy with my purchase I would recommend this cd and buyer.
B000HT386M|5.0|This is a really good movie.  Though it had it's funny parts, it's not as funny as Sandler's other comedies.  What makes the movie so great, is the message it gets across to you.  It reminds you how short life really is and how often people take things for granted.  You should appreciate even the smaller things in life and always accept the bad with the good.  Life isn't supposed to be fair and it's never perfect.  This movie shows how important family is and all the things you can miss out on by working too much and putting all your focus in work. It's like he says in the movie, family comes first.  Really is a great movie.  I'd recommend it to everyone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is definitely a MUST READ.  I can't seem to be able to put it down once I started.  I sometimes speed read trough my books depending on how well its written.  But with this book, I didn't want to miss a single word!!
B004RBXVFO|5.0|This book is just wonderful. Stephen King in this book talks mostly about his struggles as a writer while giving some insightful advice on writing. King goes slightly in-depth on some subjects on how to write well. I will admit though there are a few times it felt as if he were rambling, but the rambling was still helpful. This book also tells you how you can find a publisher by giving a site chalk full of them. While I may just be a beginner at writing stories, this book has helped a little.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I was worried when I heard this book was coming out and it realized all my fears. I loved the other books and followed all the interviews and blogs. I even read some of the fan fics the author addressed in those interviews while saying there would be no half vampire babies. Then we get an entire book about half vampire babies and Edward slowly becoming human (HE SWEATS!) half of which is stolen from the fan fics!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is simple and fun if you want to pass the time without getting stuck and angry.  Nice serene music.
B004132HZS|4.0|This was very cleverly written. The plots take place in modern times and both actors are spot on in their portrayals of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. My husband, the Holmes fan in the family, gave it a rave review and although I am not the rabid Conan Doyle aficionado he is, I will sit through anything even vaguely British.  Definitely check this one out if you like Sherlock Holmes with a modern twist. I can't wait for the next series. This is a winner!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I have seen this movie with my 2 little girls.<br />We love it and its cute and funny. Makes us want to learn to cook!!!
B001NKI60W|3.0|Okay, let me be honest. I had heard about this film/musical for a long time. I thought I'd give it a shot because I like ABBA songs and a good musical. Sadly this film had a stupid plot meant to try and fit in the various ABBA songs they wanted to feature.  I won't comment on the singing which ranges from wonderful to terrible. Bravo for trying and you will also be surprised at who can sing in this film.  I found myself saying, 'Who cares?' most of the movie. I watched it on dvd and fast forwarded most of the second half.  The best songs were at the end of the movie in the wrap up scenes. What were they thinking? Put them in the movie, not at the end when people are walking out.  I think I was just confused at the muddled plot. Very stupid, stupid idea for a movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I remember my first workout with Jillian's 30 day shred. I thought no way can I do this I'm only into it a few minutes and my legs feel like jelly. Fast forward a week. What jelly legs? I'M MOVING ON TO WORKOUT #2! I love the feeling of accomplishment when the workout is up. Jillian claps and I have to do it to. \\"and...BREAK!\\"  She doesn't let you quit. She encourages and pushes you through it at exactly the time I needed! I can't wait to get to the end! GREAT BUY! It's been a good way to start my weight loss journey for very little money.
B003QNXPUK|4.0|Highly recommended for ANY phone (not just apple) - my boyfriend also has the Samsung version and we are both worry-free! I even have a thin hard case that snaps on my iPhone 4S when I want extra protection. While it's a snug fit with the back & side invisibleSHIELDs, it still works great and the open front screen is protected as well. My only complaint is it took me 30 minutes to apply this perfectly to the phone. But once it was applied, after about a day or so, all air bubbles had smoothed out and it looks great!
1594744769|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I liked his descriptions, and how the book flowed.  I expected more of a children's/teens book.  This book is great reading for adults!  Interesting fact is that all the photos in the book are real.
1451648537|2.0|Don't buy into the hype about this book. This bio is an overrated, mediocre work, and it's such a shame. Instead of giving us a rich, nuanced insight to Steve Jobs we're handed basically the Labors of Steve Jobs. Like a checklist, Issacson, hits the major beats and peppers it with some quotes before moving on to the next thing in line. It reads more like a collection of articles than an exclusive official biography. It's the bare minimum I'd expect out of a biography. But to give such a meager offering with unrivaled and exclusive interview access to the person is disappointing at best.   Issacson overemphasizes two things over and over in the book. His adoption (phrased often as abandonment) and the impact it had on Jobs' personality, and the often mentioned \\"reality distortion field\\". I always thought it was writing 101 to not reuse the same term over and over again. But damn if Issacson didn't run it into the ground. The guy should've trademarked the term as much as he used it. I imagine you could make quite the drinking game out of listening to the audio book. Issacson doesn't even discuss the origin of the term until he's mentioned it a couple dozen times.   Issacson goes through  the book oscillating between Jobs portrayed with sociopathic tendencies, and being a demigod capable of making the impossible possible. He skims over heavy moments that would give Steve Jobs a more three dimensional portrayal (Jobs screwing Wozniak out of bonus money, his adoptive parents dying, his battle with cancer...)  At least Walt gets the perspective other people who were involved, but just scrapes the surface without digging deeper.  I'd honestly rather read transcripts of the interviews. I wouldn't count out ever seeing them since the book seems to have been rushed to print to cash in in a timely manner after Steve Jobs died. I guess Steve couldn't bend reality far enough to make Issacson do a decent job with the official biography.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I used to be against E-books. After I decided to try it, I can see there are many advantages to it. I take my phone with me everywhere, which is easier to do than a book because of size. I can read between classes or anytime I get bored. I dont have to worry if I brought the book or not because it is on my phone. I still preffer concrete books, but I do enjoy this app.
B001IF252M|5.0|I have this product for almost a year, and still works fine. I hadn't have any problem with it :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have played this game over and over. I have beaten it at least 15 times and it never gets old.
B003Y5H57E|1.0|Movie is great but this review is about the Ultraviolet digital copy - the worst.    To give you an idea of how flawed this is, the URL they give you to download the copy isn't even active!  It's a dead link!  I don't want to sign up for another service, I just want to DL the damn thing & put it in my iTunes, like EVERY OTHER DIGITAL COPY.  Why studios try to pull this garbage is beyond me and I will NEVER buy another Blu ray or DVD with Ultraviolet - should've saved the money and used it download that I can use.  Studios should not be allowed to advertise \\"Digital Copy\\" on packages unless it's available in a format that can be used anywhere on any device.  Otherwise they are taking advantage of consumers.
B0067H9W72|3.0|Currently we are at episode 5 of this show and I am starting to feel the chick flick/soap opera style shining through. I still absolutely love this show, I love the premise and the theme of zombies taking over: there is just something so disturbing and horrifying about zombies that vampires and werewolves don't possess. Maybe it is the fact that zombies dont have a will of their own; that they are bereft of consciousness and self-awareness, yet ambulant and able to respond to surrounding stimuli; maybe it is the fact that they dont seem to have a reason for being really other than feeding on the living and moving on in their brain dead daze. Whatever it is, it is more intriguing than most other horror villains.    Anyway, I still believe The Walking Dead to be one of the best out there. However, at this point, it is just not as intense and breathtaking as it used to be during Season 1. The intensity has slowed down, there are fewer and fewer \\"Walkers\\" around and they are focusing entirely too much on the interpersonal relationships of these people and that love triangle. One would think that in a time where the WORLD HAS COME TO AN END and its population largely replaced by the walking dead, people would start to rise above the occasion and instead of sneaking around with their only friend's wife, band together. But no, not here. Human nature seems  to show its ugly selfish face even when the world has come to an end. While in the beginning the \\"we hooked up because we thought you were dead\\" story line was sort of interesting, it is starting to occupy too much screen time. This is a show about the zombie apocalypse; a  show about the end of humanity and life as we know it - this isnt about grown men being driven by juvenile behavior as they fawn after the chick who rejected them and get all bitter about it during the apocalypse no less. Does it really matter when life has  become nothing but a struggle and fear that at any moment some flesh eating zombie might attack you and eat you.  I want to see them move forward, keep traveling in order to find other people, if at all, or find out more about what is going on and what has been going ever since the rise of the dead. I want to see more of the desolation, more of the destruction, more of those flashbacks about how the apocalypse and take over started; how the world ended, lives lost and turned zombie; I dont want to see them spending more and more time on this farm with the odd inhabitants. I want to see them traverse the desolation, encounter the \\"herds\\", struggle for their lives, try to answer some of the tough questions like that time they were at the CDC, face horrifying challenges in the face of a world gone by and taken over mostly by flesh eating freaks. I want to see the kind of intensity in acting and drama as I saw when Amy was bitten and transformed or when Grimes entered spooky and desolate Atlanta packed by hungry zombies. Bringing humanity in the equation is great - such as the time they talk about their lives before the end, when former adversaries bond, or when they reflect about their predicament as humanity has come to an end. But please no more of that chick flick type of dialogues and tired clichees of who is the father of my child and how are we feeling about this today. Urgh. In season one danger was lurking in every corner and nothing seemed safe. They were attacked left and right and good people were lost in a shocking way. Now it has all slowed down and everyone seems to have found a lasting repose on this farm.   In season 1 Rick told Dr. Jenner at the CDC that they had to go and find out what is still left and if there is more. Now he is comfortable sitting on his butt at the farm looking for a girl that's disappeared in zombie land for days now with Herschel who is less than accommodating and is pushing for them to leave already. I couldnt agree more. Get out of there.   Looking back, I want to see more of that sinister darkness so prevalent in season 1, i want to see more of the tension that is slowly built up, culminating in something horrible. Right now it all just seems too drawn out. They been on the farm for what three or four days, but it feels like they've been camping here for weeks. The zombie elements and the fact that the world has ended have become secondary and the characters are entirely too occupied with their feelings and emotions and all that sentimental crap.    One thing I hope this show will never morph into is:   +alien intervention  +government conspiracies of any kind  +a high tech underworld, or village or enclave, creating a new government that is kind of totalitarian  +soap opera type of story lines a la \\"whose the father of my child\\" etc.   I do hope they continue on the intense, sinister and bleak note as  - after all - this show is about the zombie apocalypse and how to survive in a world that has come to an end. For this show to be successful and stand out, it is imperative that the writers and production team do not divulge into any of the topics mentioned above and thus resort to the kinds of cliches we are all too familiar with and how somehow most shows en up these days. They also need to stop on the whiny and sentiemntal notes and melodrama and remember that this isnt 90210 with zombies thrown in.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|I'm not sure why this movie isn't as acclaimed as many of the other Disney animated movies.  Great story, great soundtrack.  I honestly like this movie better than the Lion King, which is considered by many to be the best of Disney's lineup, but which I find to be very overrated.    I'm anxiously awaiting for Mulan on Blu-Ray.
0062011847|3.0|Just when I was really getting into Agnes along with the grinning Nanny and not-a-busy-body Granny and the other denizens of Lancre, and/or really missing the insane wizards of the Unseen University, or wondering how Moist would handle taxes, along comes \\"sigh\\" another Sam Vimes dominated book and unfortunately to me it was more along the lines of \\"Unseen Academicals\\" - e.g, a novel that makes some profound social statements, but for the most part isn't something I grin maniacally over. If anything there are social commentaries here that are completely heartbreaking.  The author was always like that, but the teaching was slyly done, like a quick mirror flash, in the midst of a hysterical roller-coaster ride.  And there are other things that bothered me - the Vimes are so old-coupled they are boring, kids may be fascinated by bathroom functions and later sex but the endless talk of fecal matter got old, and when did a butler with a worrying expertise in cutlery evolve into a sidekick assassin dispensing justice? How come Vimes has lost all those deliciously clumsy moments that made him human?  Why is he like Spiderman now with a Venom inside?  I associate Pratchett novels with making heartbreak bearable, not wincing at some disturbing images. Still give it 3 stars because the writing for the most part deserves it, but oh, I pray for just a few more books to show me what happens to Rincewind and Agnes and Moist and Granny and Nanny and have me laughing me @ss off and not crying, and hope the author puts Sam on the back burner for a while, I'm tired of him.  But I will say, in a serious mood or not, the author has not betrayed the reader - I'm talking to you George Martin!!!
1594200696|5.0|This book is amust for every student or teacher. It is much better than I anticipated. The illustrations are also wonderful.
B001UV4XIS|2.0|I was extremely disappointed that the DVD version of this movie doesn't contain any special features except deleted scenes. I would have been more than happy to pay more for them.  I don't want to have to by Blue Ray version for the special features. I don't understand why they can't be delivered on both. I suppose they want to push me to Blue Ray.
B002N8A14M|1.0|The armband is too wide and you can't tighten it enough, it slips down.  If you take it of the armband and try to clip in on your running shorts, it's upside down and tends to fall out of the case.  Good company, just a poorly designed product.
0307593312|4.0|If you're going to settle into a 925 page dystopian fantasy set in Japan, you either buy into it right at the start or not at all. And to keep you going until the end, the story has to remain intriguing throughout so you don't invest several days and then give up somewhere in the middle. Murakami weaves his magical unrealism with his usual deft touch, even if there is quite a bit of repetition here, moreso than usual. But the atmosphere, mystery, unreality grabs you, and just when you think you've got it figured out, throws you a curve. There are inside jokes abundantly on display -- one of my favorites is when the heroine finds herself plowing through Proust, all six volumes, being caught up in another world lovingly described to the finest detail. A worthy comparison to this work in which no sight, sound or smell is too insignificant to omit. Each character is asmost cinematically portrayed, but to film this would be a disaster. I can think of other unworldy classics that have been filmed to disappointing results (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, for example). But Murakami sets his narratives against a totally believable, recognizeable backdrop that is slightly to the left of reality. Worth the effort. Worth the time.
0547258305|3.0|Graceling is a unique story in a world filled with generic knock offs (that is to say, this book is unique!).  Katsa as the heroine is fun and interesting.  Her quest to uncover the truth in an enchanted setting was enough to pull the reader along page by page without becoming bored.  The story starts at a quick pace, though her time in her own Kingdom comes to a quick and almost unsatisfactory end. That being said, I really appreciated the writing style.  Parents of young readers should be aware of the mature content before allowing their child to venture into the story.  As an overall interesting tail, my rating of 3 stars might come as a surprise.  I feel this might be because of my chance to delve into Fire before reading Graceling.  Fire is intricate, amazing, and beautifully written (as is Graceling).  I felt a much stronger connection to Ms. Cashore's second novel than her first.  I feel that Graceling came as a letdown after having read Fire first.  My suggestion to those who want to read Cashore's unique tales should start with Graceling, lest they be disappointed as I was.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The Ultraviolet version of the digital copy is useless.  It is lower quality, can't be played with iTunes, and requires you to create 2 different accounts with 2 different companies and download 2 different programs in order to use. Unfortunately, you can barely read the fine print on the actual Bluray box, let alone amazon's website. There has to be some legal concern there.  To those rating the actual film, this is not a movie site; it's a product site. If a third of a product's features (blu-ray, DVD, digital copy) is worthless, how can you recommend it? Go to IMDB if you want to rate the movie as the best thing ever.  I heard the Canadian version has an actual digital copy, and the blu-ray/DVD is the same region code as the US, so it will play fine. But I'd rather no one buy it at all out of protest.  Flixster account = deleted.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|The processor fan on my five year-old Athlon X2 processor developed a tendency to run at maximum RPM for protracted periods, which was both unpleasant and slightly worrisome. At first, I thought I needed a new fan and cooler combination, but then I read somewhere about how thermal grease can lose its effectiveness over time. In fact, as one commenter wrote, five years is approximately the expected lifespan of this compound. I bought the Arctic Silver.<br /><br />Not expecting much, I removed the old thermal grease with denatured alcohol, a q-tip, and a couple pieces of plastic packaging, and applied the new stuff to my long-suffering CPU. At first, my computer hung on boot with the usual error message about a malfunctioning processor fan. Then, after a few minutes, the grease warmed up and spread out and the machine would boot.<br /><br />End of the story: it's running cool and quiet again, with no racing fan, even under heavy load. Needless to say, I won't be keeping my current mobo/CPU components long enough to need reapplying new thermal grease.
0307891402|5.0|I own this guide and it is beautifully written and looks just as good. The only issue I take is with idiots trying to overprice this during a temporary out of stock.   Please do not pay 70+ dollars for this guide. It is still available for around $24 from other sites and $40 in retail outlets.  Edit-Looks like its back instock now. I sincerely hope nobody overpaid for this guide. It's great, but not worth the $70 some scammers were trying to charge.

(I heart stars!)<br /><br />Once again author, Stephanie Perkins has created unique characters full of heart, passion and who are just plain fun to read! If you could take a rainbow, a few rays of sunshine, some shooting stars (for their sparkle factor), and maybe even a snowflake or two, mixed them all together and shook them out, Lola is what would you get. She's bright, colorful, full of life and has a sparkle that's all her own.<br /><br />\\"Lola\\" has all the love and heart pounding romance that \\"Anna\\" did but with a couple of interesting twists thrown in.

Let's take a peak at them shall we?<br /><br />Max is our resident rocker bad-boy. What makes him bad? Weeelll, for starters, he's just a \\"few\\" years older than Lola but just a few. Her two Dads aren't too thrilled with the idea of him but then again they're dads. He's cute, he sings and writes music, has multiple tattoos and engages in less desirable behavior (according to dear old \\"Dads) which of course, makes him a total chick magnet.<br /><br />Cricket is Lola's neighbor and childhood friend. He's not only cute, nice and super intelligent (he invents cool stuff like Barbie elevators) but he's tall - really, really tall. He's also the twin brother of Calliope Bell (aka figure skater extraordinaire/mean girl). Lola's parents like Cricket and there's a bit of history between he and Lola which isn't all happy, happy sunshine but no biggie, because he's the very definition of \\"Tall drink of water\\". Thirsty much? Yes.I.Am!<br /><br />Whose the third cute guy? Well, now, that would just spoil the fun so you'll have to read it for yourself. *wink* *wink*<br /><br />Lola struggles with making the right choices sometimes as a way to protect herself or those around her from getting hurt.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|When I first heard the concept of Stephen King's new novel, I was skeptical. The idea of someone finding a way to travel back through time and stop the Kennedy assassination seemed like something far more generic and B-movie-esque than I hoped for from King. But, hey, it's King, so of course I'll try it...and I wasn't ten pages in before my doubts started to fade. One of the things I forgot in my expectations is how well King can make even the oddest scenario seem both logical and yet completely fresh, and his handling of the time-travel method here is both, creating something that feels like no other time travel story I've ever heard in my life, yet one that feels...well, natural in a way you might not expect. But more than that, 11/22/63 is a testament to King's storytelling skills: this thing moves like a rocket, and there are scattered climaxes and scenes that pack such impact that I had to take a break afterward. King puts on a clinic with regard to pacing, structuring his story deftly and juggling dozens of characters so well that it looks effortless - only to collide them in ways you're never prepared for. It's those characters, of course, that really carry the book - you'd expect nothing less from King, whose character work is always second to none, but his cast of characters here is something special, something far more touching and complex than I might have expected. Maybe it's because for King, the past isn't a gimmick - it's a vibrant, fully-realized place, one that's as much a character as any of the people that inhabit it. There's so much more here to rave about, and so little space, so let me just say this: for my money, 11/22/63 is probably King's best book since the accident, and even one of his best, period. It's ambitious, profound, intense, unsettling, moving, and powerful, and it's the work of a master at the peak of his craft.
0142419400|5.0|This was such a fun read! It only took me a few hours to get through it. This is a coming of age story that's full of fun, humor, romance and hot boys with accents...with ACCENTS! Doesn't get much hotter than that?!<br /><br />Anna Oliphant is our main character and she gets sent to Paris for her senior year of high school by her dad. Dad is a novelist whose books (which have been made into movies) make women swoon and who left Anna and her brother Sean when he was a baby. She and Dad don't have the best relationship but the one thing they do share is their OCD for cleanliness. Besides her OCD, Anna is a HUGE movie buff and an aspiring movie critic, writing reviews on her blog. Anna is not too happy about having to leave behind her best friend, Bridgette and a budding relationship with hot boy #1, Topher. Topher works with Anna at the local cinema and she's had a major crush on him forever and just when he starts to show interest, Dad springs the Paris thing on her. Way to go Dad!<br /><br />Topher is a rocker boy (rocker = automatic hotboyness) and is in his own band. He has that bad boy attitude too which makes him all the more appealing to Anna but he's in America and she's in Paris. Kinda gives new meaning to \\"long distance relationship\\", huh? He e-mails and calls her reassures her that he can't wait to see her at Christmas.<br /><br />Bridgette is Anna's BFF! She's bold, brassy and an awesome drummer and she's also taken over as babysitter for Anna's 7yr old brother Seany while she's in Paris. She makes some interesting choices that affect their friendship in a way neither ever expected.<br /><br />When Anna lands in Pairs at her new school, the first person she meets is Meredith, another senior. They meet when Meredith hears Anna sobbing after her parents leave her and head back home to Atlanta. Meredith is kind and selfless, putting others first. She's big into sports and spending time with her small group of friends which she readily introduces Anna too.<br /><br />Upon leaving Meredith's room that first night, Anna runs into, like literally runs into, Etienne...hot boy #2 (w/accent!) Beautiful, British, brown eyed, perfect haired, Etienne St. Clair...sigh. He's funny, charming, beautiful, kind, has a girlfriend, is fluent in French and, you caught that, didn't you? Yeah, I thought so...he has a girlfriend - boo! Even so, he and Anna become fast friends, he helping her find her way around Paris and she with his family stuff. They quickly realize that they have a lot in common and they also have feelings for each other that go beyond friendship. They ARE in the city of love, but there's Topher and Ellie (Etienne's GF) to consider.<br /><br />Anna also meets Rashmi and Josh who all part of the her new circle of friends and a couple too. (I enjoyed these two even if I don't agree with what they're up to all the time) Josh (hot boy #3) is an artist and Etienne's BFF. He has a great sense of humor but is also a tortured soul (criteria for hotness). Rashmi appears to be cold and only interested in playing tonsil hockey with Josh all the time but once we get to know her, we see that she puts up a wall to protect herself.<br /><br />During her jet setting journey through her senior year, Anna learns some hard lessons about love, friendship, trust and betrayal, forcing her to take a good look at herself and the hot boys. It wouldn't be high school without the teenage angst, secret crushes, unrequited love, nasty rumor mills, budding romances, break-ups and make-ups and talks of sex. There's also the occasional bad word yelled out of frustration or anger and they're in Paris where the legal drinking age is under 21 so some of the characters have an unpleasant experience with alcohol.<br /><br />There was a sweetness to this story which is what I enjoyed the most.

There's also the occasional bad word yelled out of frustration or anger and they're in Paris where the legal drinking age is under 21 so some of the characters have an unpleasant experience with alcohol.   There was a sweetness to this story which is what I enjoyed the most. That and all the details of Paris which really make me want to go!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book, and do not understand the bad reviews for it at all! The scenery description was breathtaking, the characters made me smile, and the magic was, well, magical. I found myself thinking about the plot when I wasn't reading. I actually finished this while huddled under the covers with my booklight, while my poor husband snored away next to me. I haven't done that since my Nancy Drew days. I would love to see this magical tale come to life on the big screen!
0525423656|4.0|In this much anticipated sequel in the \\"Matched\\" trilogy, \\"Crossed\\", picks up where \\"Matched\\" left off and we find Cassia still willing to do whatever it takes to find Ky even if it means risking her life. We're introduced to new characters in Vick, Eli and Indie and while we see very little of Xander (insert disgruntled sigh), we learn he has a secret he's been keeping from Cassia.<br /><br />Cassia begins to question everything, her feelings about Ky, her sorting ability and when she discovers Xander has a secret and that both Ky and Indie have known about it and kept it from her, she questions her trust in both of them. To make things even more interesting, Ky has a secret (or two) also, including something he has in common with Cassia but he can't reveal it to her just yet because it could put them both in danger.<br /><br />Nothing is what it seems (including those pesky little blue pills) and everything and everyone seems to have an ulterior motive. Who can Cassia trust and whose really in charge, the Rising or the Society? Is she really just a pawn in a game? Cassia is faced with tough choices, none of which are black and white, (or should I say, green, blue or red?) The things she'll discover about herself and the two boys she loves will change her forever. Even though she's still \\"matched\\" with Xander, she's continued to \\"choose\\" Ky but will that all change once she learns Xanders secret or Ky's for that matter? When the truth comes out will she still feel she ever really had a choice to begin with?<br /><br />I enjoyed how the chapters alternated between both Ky and Cassia's POV's and I can only hope the third book will include Xander's as well. I did find the story a little slow in the beginning with the feeling of Ky and Cassia being \\"so close yet so far away\\" as they both were trying to get back to each other. It wasn't until page 191 where everything changes and begins to pick up. I happened to be up reading late one night and stopped at page 190 which was probably a good thing, otherwise I would've stayed up the rest of the night to finish the book. Overall, I think this was a really good sequel and I'm really looking forward to the final book.herwise I would've stayed up the rest of the night to finish the book.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is a tale of family and choices and parents who do their best by their children and parents who fail their children completely. Of grandchildren who want to right the past, and mothers who will kill to protect their secrets. my only gripe is that I sometimes struggled to keep the plot straight as the chapters were written from 3 perspectives during 3 different time periods. I was sometimes flipping backward to see what I missed, when actually it hadn't been revealed yet. Overall though, I loved it and will read her other books.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Set the stage and shout \\"ACTION.\\" Another of Grishom's best--like the old days of \\"The Firm.\\" Great, inventive characters, good plot twists,fabulous story, and, as always, the best writing and research. Some really interesting points of the law.Grisham does his reasearch thoroughly. It might be a tad slow in the beginning, but as I said in my opening, he is setting the stage. Don't miss this--I am still thinking about and missing the characters. A charactor driven story. Great read!!!!!
B004HO6I2O|5.0|This is the best of its kind, these movies are all fun but this one is so much better then what we've seen in the past, movies like vice versa,like father like son & freaky Friday. These are all great but this one goes were they could not and then some. That's what makes it such a good movie.
030726999X|4.0|This book is a fantastic way to end the trilogy.  I love how the book developed many peripheral characters from the second book (whom I personally thought were kind of boring) into much more interesting personalities.  Salander didn't play as big of a role in the third book as she did in the previous two.  But these interesting side characters more than made up for the lack of Salander and also made the overall story much more \\"complete\\"
B000IAZPKM|5.0|I have owned this dvd twice. I highly recommend. This band is talented, and i feel that they are not as big as they should be. The production value is amazing. Now ive seen a lot of music dvd's, and some bands out there just dont come across live, well Kamelot does. I give this dvd 5 out of 5 stars, and would suggest everyone picks this one up, it is more than worth it.
1905492073|5.0|Every diver should read this book. If you dive, and haven't read it, buy it. If you know a diver, do them a favour and buy it as a present. Not only is this book exeptional at taking complex theories and making them accessible to the average person, it really educates a diver on what is happening to their body every time they dive. I now understand deco and DCS far better than i did from any technical diving course. It's a book i'm going to take on every diving holiday from now on to show people, particularly older \\"experienced\\" divers how deco theory has changed.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|NOTE: I streamed this video.   This is an excellent film that focuses on the virtue of martial arts and its peaceful nature. This movie is mainly about a man that, through his martial arts, rallied the Chinese people against the oppressive Japanese forces during the Second Sino-Japanese war (same time frame as WWII).    This movie mainly shows the path of Ip man before and during the war. How he went from being a fairly wealthy individual before the war, to little more than a peasant during it; and how he struggled to support his family during Japan's occupation of China.    I don't want to give any of the movie away, but I found this movie to be very enjoyable. It's not the glamorized mindless violence garbage that Hollywood puts out. However, there is a lot of excellent martial arts action during this movie.    If you like action movies, and or dramas, you'll probably like this film.
B004G25V9S|5.0|I wanted to wait a little before posting this review until I really digested this album. My initial reaction to all the other reviews was a desire to post a good review because a lot of the other reviews were so negative based on the different direction of the band. I can now truly say a love this new album. I have listened to it a lot ... and saw Opeth play a lot of this material live. It is not death metal but really does sound like a continuation of the direction Opeth has been going in for years on many songs.  My favorite tracks are Folklore, The Devil's Orchid and The Lines In My Hand.  If you only like Opeth's death sound, then this album isn't for you. I also loved their death sound. However, if you also like Opeth's more dynamic songwriting where heavy and clean guitar sounds clash with clean vocals, this is a great album.
1401323820|4.0|After reading Naked Heat, the novel tie-in for the TV series Castle, I found that whoever writes them does a pretty good job.  To pick up the thread from the start, I got a copy of Heat Wave from the library.  It's not a long read, and it feels like an episode of Castle (which I'm sure it's supposed to).  But like Naked Heat, it's good for what it is... a few hours of escape and mind candy.<br /><br />Heat and her team (along with Rook who is researching his next article) get tagged for a case involving a wealthy businessman who takes a header from his 6th floor apartment.  When they head up to the apartment to interview the trophy wife, they find out that he has a fortune in art (no taste, mind you... but a lot of money) adorning the walls.  They also find out that his business enterprise is a sham, literally bankrupt from his gambling and spending habits.  Heat's digging lands her on someone's bad side, as she encounters a killer in her apartment who is ready to shut her up permanently. But she gets that \\"ironed\\" out (yes, that's a pun) and starts to pull the threads that will unravel the truth.<br /><br />Heat Wave sets the scene for the romantic chemistry between Heat and Rook.  Coming into the series at the second book, I had to assume that the relationship between the two had started here.  This book wasn't critical to understanding the second book in the series, but it would have been nice to have had read this one first.  Another reason why it was easy enough to track the action is that it's impossible to think of the characters as anybody other than who they are in the actual TV series.  There's a reason it reads like an episode of Castle... it basically is.<br /><br />Heat Wave isn't something that's going to win literary awards or be an ageless classic.  It's simply a fun read that works well for what it is.  Just sit back and enjoy it.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowed
B0036EH3XE|2.0|This is a comment on the whole show.  As I dislike following T.V. series chapter afer chapter, week after week or - as in this case - year after year, I decided to wait for the DVD release of the sixth seasons so as to watch them from certain distance, far from all the hubbub, the fame and the worship in order to get a more objective standpoint and, eventually, a more accurate and emotionally detached judgement.  The first two seasons seemed to me to be the finest. Round characters, interesting story and thematic concern (how to survive in extreme situations), a brilliant score, good acting from the main interpreters (Michael Emerson as Ben, the best) good directions, impressive locations and great entertainment all the way through. The love stories of Jin/Lun, Claire/Charlie, Hurley/Libby, Jack/Kate/Sawyer and Sayid/Shannon are well developed, touching and true to life; at least, you believe in them.  However, things start going wrong by the middle of Season 3: long incidents over the weighter, some unnecesary flashbacks going nowhere, additional adventures cut off from the main plot. This goes on and on up to the point when the story becomes uninteresting and confusing, a hotch potch that becomes a total boring mess. Once the \\"time traveling\\" and the island transportation start, you are the one who becomes \\"lost\\".   No doubt: Hollywood has given us some good series in the History of T.V. Centennial, Roots, Carnivale, Holocaust, Rome, just to name some of the ones I've seen.  And other european masterpieces such as I Claudius, Upstairs - Downstairs, The Earth or Berlin Alexanderplatz, works of art that have never been surpassed in artistic achievement. Although LOST was never conceived to become an artistic masterpiece as the ones just mentioned, it might have reached a high level of pre-eminence if shorter, less pretentious, less ambitious and more common-sensical and coherent. The truth is that, after Season 3, the series becomes weaker and goofier, reaching a \\"grand finale\\" in a chapel (actually it looks like an all-cast cocktail-to-be celebrating the end of the shooting) wich is a tribute to Utter Nonsense.  If scores allowed, let me rank the series by season, on a scale from 1 to 5:  Season 1: 4  Season 2: 3.5  Season 3: 3  Season 4: 1  Season 5: 1  Season 5: 1  The best: Michael Giacchino's score  The worst: the length and the folly of the last three seasons.  In a nutshell: A hyped Hollywood extravaganza that it might have been much better if less contrived and pretentious but simpler and more coherent.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Personally, I enjoyed this game. It wasn't overly hard, like Myst or The 7th Guest, which I just gave up on. Some of the puzzles are on the easy side...some will make you scratch your head,lol  The game isn't real long, good for an hour or two. Worth the money in my opinion. I hope I can find similar ones :) Keep in mind, this isn't a$60. game..you really can't expect a months worth of playing...
B0050R0XPA|3.0|Wake up, Amazon!!! I purchased the other winter themed sets (the toy shop and bakery) from Amazon and intended to buy this as well... but the price will make me wait until Amazon wakes up and lowers the price or I'll get it from Lego.com directly (for $69.99) as I have before when Amazon allows pricing far above the list/MSRP prices.  I'm sure the set is great, but the price is insane!
B002JCSWV6|5.0|This is a very good and moving story. After spending 27 years in a very small cell in South Africa, Nelson Mandela was released and he was elected president of his country in 1990. But he had a serious problem. Not only he, but all the blacks in South Africa had been despised, oppressed, and terribly mistreated their entire lives. Many lived in dirty unhygienic shacks. They were poor. They were very angry. The whites retained their prejudicial attitudes. They kept their idea that they were superior. They believed that only they could rule the country. They felt that \\"ignorant blacks\\" would ruin their land.<br /><br />How could the new president unite the people of his country? How could he start afresh? What could he take away from the white oppressors without increasing their anger? What could he give the blacks? How could he inspire his nation? How could he get the world to respect South Africa?<br /><br /> Nelson Mandela devised the idea that he might unite his people by having both blacks and whites join together in hoping that the South African Rugby Team would win the 1995 World Cup. But the problem was that the team was not that good. How could he improve the team? This movie tells the story of what he did and the results.
B001684L0A|4.0|The DVD series has much to offer that informs and it is mostly well filmed.  However it does depart some from the book inserting detail that the book does not.  One instance of this that I found very offensive was the scene where Abigail  comes to John in Paris and he practically jumps on her in a most graphic and repugnent manner. Such a acene does insult to the memory of this great man and his wife. I wanted to share this series with my grandchildren some day but I would have to edit that, and a few gratuitous curse words out first. Also, I think they sometimes failed to create an atmosphere of great events taking place making them seem commonplace. Then, the actor playng George Washington was somewhat unbelievable, not having the imposing appearance of the man as described by those who admired him, even some of his enemies. Lastly, I think the portrayal of Franklin focused too much on his poor morality and failed to present the greatness of his contribution to our independence. As a long long movie it is good.  As a historical presentation it lacks.
0385344325|5.0|The millions of Reacher fans know that he had been an Army MP Major who left the army after some kind of disagreement or physical assault, after fifteen years of service, after receiving a silver star, and began wondering from town to town, unable to settle down, where he helps people who need help. They know that he is exceptionally tall, has a keen understanding of practical matters, has a clock in his head that tells him time to the minute and wakes him at the exact moment he wants to be wakened. They know that frequently, driven by what he considers to be right, Reacher acts as investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury, and executioner, even though the law explicitly forbids this behavior. They know that he can fight. Those fans who read the short story about Reacher at age thirteen know that he could fight even at that age and even against large odds. He can anticipate what will happen next, where blows will fall, and knows how, as a brawler, he can land blows that will fell his opponents, like a woodcutter landing his final chop on a tree. They know all this and much more about this hero. But what they don't know, and what they have wanted to know for so long, is why he left the army. Now, Lee Child reveals the past. It is 1997 in this novel, the year that the affair occurred that caused Reacher to leave.<br /><br /> Reacher was, as we know, a well decorated and respected MP Major at that time. But he was also a man who did not suffer fools gladly; he was a competent man with his own ideas, which he was not afraid to state. Thus he was well like by many, but not all. This was the year that the army was cutting back its forces. Would Reacher be one of those who were cut?<br /><br /> He was given an assignment. A woman had been killed in a small Mississippi town adjacent to a Ranger camp. The town inhabitants and its ex-marine beautiful MP Sheriff  were convinced that the murderer was a Ranger. Reacher was ordered to go to the town under cover, as a civilian, control the sheriff, and find the murderer among the civilians. Another MP Major was sent to the Ranger camp itself to look into the situation and control it. This second major was very competent, as competent as Reacher. Was the army setting him up? If anything went wrong would he be blamed? Was this a cover up? Could the other major be trusted? What was this second major really doing in the camp?<br /><br /> Reacher discovers that while the murdered woman was white, there were two other murders in the town during the year, both black, all three very beautiful. He is soon drawn to the beautiful sheriff, but the army assures him with proof that she is not what she appears to be. Other murders soon occur.<br /><br /> Readers will enjoy reading how Reacher is able to see things that others miss and how he reacts to them with his customary moral force. They will also finally find out why this hero left the military, the work his father and brother did, and begin to wander and help others.l the sheriff, and find the murderer among the civilians.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|I don't understand why some people knock this album as if it's the worst they've ever heard! Any true Coldplay fan, as I am, will appreciate the album for what it is- some old like \\"Up In Flames\\" (remeniscing of \\"Fix You\\" and one of my favorite tracks! Talk about heartbreak.)but mostly new stuff..dating back to their last album! To me they will never be able to duplicate Parachute, A Rush of Blood to the Head and X&Y..those albums are classics...frozen in time like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon or The Beatles White Album.  I would not call it disappointing..is it any of the albums mentioned above? No! But there are hints, bits and parts all over it! When I'm in the mood to listen to my favorite band, I go back and listen to \\"Yellow, Trouble, Sparks, Spies, Don't Panic, The Scientist, In My Place, Clocks, Warning Signs, Talk, Fix You, Square one, What If, Low!

0307891402|5.0|I love Bethesda games. I also have a horrible sense of direction. Even with a nifty little on-screen compass and quest tracker, I find myself getting easily lost. So, after a couple hours of playing I decided to take a break and go buy the guide. It made a HUGE difference. I was hesitant to spend $40 on a game guide but now that I've seen what I'm getting, it was well worth it. Not only are there maps, but there are also quest guides that don't give TOO much away, crafting recipes for every item you can make in the game, and strategies for defeating particularly difficult dungeons or NPCs. I suggest buying the hardcover so that you need not worry about the durability. This book was made to last.
B005O30Y5Y|3.0|I read the book first and i'm kinda pissed that i did because i was let down that they cut out so many things that i thought they should have put in. I liked the movie. I'm just mad because i was expecting so much more. The final fight scene between Harry and Voldemort was a lot weaker than the book. What about poor Teddy? People that didn't read the book will never know Harry's his Godfather. I'm just a whiner i guess, but i will always love the Harry Potter books and movies.
B004LROUW2|5.0|This is a fantastic book. It is well written and I love the characters. I couldn't put this book down. Great cover too. I Highly recommend this book. Not sure why this book is gettiing low ratings. I love love this book,

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I bought this from that other \\"market\\", but that was before I knew the Amazon AppStore existed  It's a well written app. Easy to use with a very user friendly and intuitive user interface - no guessing what you can do or how to do it.  My opinion is the app is way under-priced, definitely worth the price now. Do it before the developer comes to his senses and decides to raise the price to $2.99 or $3.99

Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to announce to the world that I have not read this book, but I can afford $16.99 and plan to buy it in the near future.<br /><br />This completely baseless five star review is being written to cancel out one one star review in the hopes of making the rating fair and not based on someone's bank account.

030788743X|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have read this year, I listened to the audiobook first, and then went back and actually read it. I thouroghly enjoyed each one. It is a great twist of fantasy/science fiction and a 80's pulp culture. I think anyone can truly enjoy this book, but if you grew up in the eighties, you will understand and enjoy the book that much more. One could argue that this book is just for people into gaming and pop culture, but it goes beyond that, it's a great piece of fiction, with characters I really enjoyed getting to know and was sad to part with at the end of the book. Thank you Ernest Cline for writing this book. This book made me laugh, and smile, and feel for the characters, which made for a great read. A movie about his book is supposed to be in the works, I look forward to a film adaption, but hope the essence of the book is not lost within it.
B00005TT77|4.0|Finally! A Beatles tribute album worth owning! \\"I Am Sam\\" is wistful and nostalgic while somehow remaining current. Recorded by a variety of artists it boasts a unified sound that is uplifting, whimsical and effervescent.<br /><br />Aimee Mann and Michael Penn kick off \\"I Am Sam\\" with an endearing rendition of \\"Two Of Us\\" that seems somehow autobiographical and sets the tone nicely for rest of the CD.  Sarah McLachlan follows with a lovely rendition of Blackbird; just vocals and acoustic guitar lightly spiced with intriguing little touches that sparkle and shine in the mix. It's hard to argue with Rufus Wainwright's soaring delivery of \\"Across The Universe\\".  The song is a perfect fit for his impassioned, dramatic and slightly over the top style. The Wallflowers do a credible version of \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" that is very close to being an exact duplicate of the original. \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" has always been a personal favorite and Eddie Vedder delivers the goods nicely with his gravelly baritone. Ben Folds offers up two of the strongest contributions on the CD with his stunning, tripped out version of \\"Strawberry Fields\\" followed by a beautiful rendition of \\"Golden Slumbers\\". Paul Westerberg performs a lovely stripped down acoustic version of \\"Nowhere Man\\" and The Vines add a dreamy psychedelic edge to their version of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" that works nicely with Lennon's evocative lyric.  Grandaddy goes a little off the beaten path with a quirky version of \\"Revolution\\" that adds some variety to the mix. I have never heard of \\"Chocolate Genius\\" before but he (they?) do a nice job with John Lennon's whimsical classic \\"Julia\\". The album closes with a dead pan Nick Cave entreating us to \\"Let It Be\\".<br /><br />A fitting tribute to the legendary songwriting team of Lennon/McCartney \\"I Am Sam\\" should please fans of the Beatles and modern music alike. As someone who enjoys listening to both I recommend it highly. With all of my effusive praise you might wonder why I only gave \\"I Am Sam\\" four stars. I reserve my five star review for the original renditions of these songs. They remain immortal classics that will never be surpassed by any tribute album no matter how worthy the effort might be.ve \\"I Am Sam\\" four stars.

B005FNVDSA|5.0|I have many recordings of the Brahms 1st piano concerto, including 2 earlier performances by Pollini. This is a piece that I cherish, though perhaps not as much as the 2nd (which is an unbelievable masterpiece). Anyway, the orchestration is beautiful, Thielemann gets a lot of wonderful beautiful thrusting surging lyrical powerful playing from his musicians -- and Pollini is a delight, absolutely muscular and Olympian, always extremely attentive and thorough, but definitely not fussy. The recording sound is fine, it's slightly dry but also very crisp -- you can hear an incredible amount of punctuation from otherwise neglected sections of the orchestra, like the Trumpets for example, but there isn't a lot of warmth per se -- overall, it sounds like a Symphony with Piano, and that's not necessarily a bad thing for this behemoth beauty.
B0014I4KH6|4.0|Taylor Swift's vocals were at her best on this album. She could hold notes for just the perfect length of time to impress here. The topics were varied also. The tracks are made up of ranging tempos and fare from traditional country to crossover pop-rock. The latter comes as no surprise though as none other than the Shania Twain is Taylor's idol. :)<br /><br />\\"Teardrops On My Guitar\\" was the breakout hit here although \\"lesser\\" tracks such as \\"I'm Only Me When I'm With You\\", the exceptionally cute \\"Stay Beautiful\\" and \\"Mary's Song (Oh, My, My) are clearly better records.<br /><br />This was just the beginning though. [[ASIN:B001EYGOEM Fearless]] made her a superstar but saw the singer's voice thinning for some apparent reason. Not a bad album at all though. However, [[ASIN:B003WTE886 Speak Now]] was much more than just power singles and somewhat of a true return to form in quality, IMO. All of her albums are honest though and that's what makes her so popular and--most importantly--relatable.<br /><br />4.4 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"I'm Only Me When I'm With You\\"<br />\\"Stay Beautiful\\"<br />\\"Mary's Song (Oh, My, My)\\" &<br />\\"Invisible\\"
B000093BDX|5.0|THE BEACH BOYS-THE VERY BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS/THE SOUNDS OF SUMMER: In spite of a career riddled by drugs, death, and family dysfunction, THE BEACH BOYS' musical disposition remained remarkably sunny. Their glorious, meticulously crafted catalogue, influenced by CHUCK BERRY, PHIL SPECTOR, and tight harmony acts like THE FOUR FRESHMEN overflowed with infectious good time ditties celebrating muscle cars, curvy chicks, and the eternal perfect wave. Tortured maestro BRIAN WILSON's early chestnuts SURFIN' SAFARI, LITTLE DUECE COUPE, and CALIFORNIA GIRLS were pristine, enchanting singalongs, while super-session juggernaut GOOD VIBRATIONS, sublime saga HEROES AND VILLIANS and the ethereal GOD ONLY KNOWS showed off a more mature, sensitive side. SOUNDS OF SUMMER boasts thirty more or less essential hits crammed onto one disc, although a chronological account would have mapped their growth from sand worshippers to serious artists. Pop this party platter in during your next cookout, road trip, or poolside bash and soak up the smiles.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE BIG KAHUNA'S

0307891402|5.0|This is the nicest strategy guide I have ever seen. It's well written and highly detailed.  I opted for the hard cover edition. The best part of this book so far is that, unlike other strategy guides, this one stays open to the current page even when sitting on my desk. There are two built-in black ribbon bookmarks.  The index at the front of the book is very useful.   The index breaks down each quest of the game and can be easily referenced at the front of the book. There are separate lists for the main quest and all of optional quests.   This book does not hold your hand through the game.   The dungeon maps are useful and slightly more detailed than the in-game dungeon maps, which I like.  If I could change just one thing about this book-  It would be the cover. Sure, I love the artwork, but I much prefer the basic cover design of the standard, soft cover edition. The standard cover would look excellent in a hard cover edition. It would have had a real classic look to it.
0525423656|3.0|I was lucky that I didn't have to wait long after finishing Matched before I could read Crossed. After finishing the second book in the series, I don't feel the same sense of excitement and urgency that I felt at the end of Matched. I'm interested to know more, but not totally desperate to read the next installment.  There were aspects of Crossed that I just didn't buy. The characters spend the bulk of the book in a physically taxing environment, wanting for food and fresh water, and are constantly under threat from Society guns. Yet they spend a lot of time being introspective and philosophical for people who are struggling to meet even the most basic needs in Maslow's hierarchy. The fight to survive and get to a safe place was too poetic to be believed.  The revelation of Xander's secret was an unsavory moment for me. It seemed so tacked on that it threw me out of the story and forced me to reconsider all the details of the previous book. The illusion of the story's unique reality was broken, which was unfortunate. Furthermore, Xander's secret killed the book's central theme for me. Cassia's struggle to choose between Xander and Ky was thematically a choice between fitting into the Society and forging her own path. Take away the thematic divide between the two options, and the love triangle is cheapened-it's just about a girl's choice between two boys.  The action of Cassia vs. Society is still alive and well, but the themes that Condie managed to so artfully construct in Matched are undermined in Crossed, to a disappointing effect.
B002DKGWVQ|5.0|Raw and churning and aggressive, (the) Pixies' \\"Doolittle\\" emerged on this side of the Atlantic as yet another ancestral focal point for the grunge movement in 1989. Subversively poppy, hook-laden, and with big stinky grooves, The Stone Roses' eponymous full-length debut that same year in Great Britain emerged as the spear-carrier of the Madchester scene, combining psychedelically-tinged rock with heavily danceable rhythms. Both CD's received a significant amount of airplay on truly alternative radio stations (before \\"alternative\\" came to mean corporately- sponsored modern rock programmed by super computers). Both CD's are considered to be masterpieces of post-punk pop, yet The Stone Roses benefited from a stateside release in 1990 that allowed them to shift many more units just as \\"Doolittle\\" was playing out, suddenly embraced by newly-emerging modern-rock stations and seen as heralds of The Next Big Thing.   I can't really qualitatively compare \\"Doolittle\\" with \\"The Stone Roses\\"; they represent two different sub-genres of music. But I think I can qualitatively compare \\"The Stone Roses\\" with the rest of the Madchester scene, and based on what I heard then and continue to hear to this day I can tell you that out of all of the music released from that era, this one is the most enduring. If you're just coming to The Stone Roses, know this; the band knew how to sell a groove. So heavily integrated together that they might well have been linked through telepathy, drummer Reni and bassist Mani consistently created supple, heavy, complex interlocking rhythms that set the band apart from the rest of the Madchester pack, allowing texturally-driven guitarist John Squire to overlay his muscular, sinuous, arpeggiated, and, at times, aggressively funky riffing over a heavy spine that nevertheless bent into all sorts of elastic positions.   Some of the tracks have an almost anthemic feel, building immediately toward crescendo or sustained explosive release (\\"Don't Stop\\" and  \\"This Is The One\\")while others reach that plateau in a more gradual build-up of dynamic tension ( \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\",\\"Made Of Stone\\", \\"Waterfall\\" ,  \\"I Am The Resurrection\\") while others simmer heavily or percolate (\\"Fool's Gold\\", \\"Elephant Stone\\"  and \\"Shoot You Down\\"). No track seem to have more of a ubiquitous presence on modern rock airwaves in `90 than \\"Fool's Gold\\", which seemed to be a universal feature on every playlist. Several other cuts also received quite a bit of exposure; \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\", \\"She Bangs The Drums\\",  \\"Elephant Stone\\", \\"Waterfall\\", and \\"Shoot You Down\\" all retain presence as classics today as a result.   And I'm not really an audiophile, so while this review is appearing under the re-mastered version, its primary purpose is informative w/r/t/ the relative strength of the content, rather than whether or not the sound has been definitively improved (or not), and this was (and remains) a muscular release.  I  strongly recommend buying it.
B0031N2NFS|5.0|It would seem that some reviewers on here must've had their girlfriends stolen by a member of Midlake, because I just cannot understand how anyone can call this music trash. I am not a hipster, nor am I a snot-nosed punk who enjoys bad singing. I think this album is haunting and poetic, like a beautiful dream that affects your whole day. The fact that they are from Texas is entirely irrelevant, yet one reviewer seems offended that this is the geographical region that they hail from. Bizarre. Either way, if you want a transcendent experience into another world that is part Medieval, part Folk, and all mood, this album is for you, as are any other records by Midlake. I think they're amazing!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Sorry, I don't usually all-caps my titles but this game is very, very addictive. If you find yourself getting addicted to games such as Angry Birds or fruit ninja then this game is for you. I like trying to work up the perfect strategy and found I could play for hours and it only felt like minutes. I kept playing and could not put it down, thinking I'd just do one more level.
B000001EGA|5.0|Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy was the first record I ever asked my parents to buy. Now it's 36 years and thousands upon thousands of albums of later and I never get tired of this one. It is really that good -- it never fails to amaze me after all these years.   CF was the swansong of EJ's best, most classic band -- the talented and versatile Davey Johnstone on guitars; the ever-tasteful Nigel Olsson on drums; Dee Murray, the most under-rated bass player ever; and the irrepressible Ray Cooper on percussion. Olsson and Murray would be dismissed before the CF tour began, and EJ's magical musical run with those two -- from Tumbleweed Connection to this album -- would be over. All EJ fans will concur that this was the best period he ever had.   But what a way for that band to go out. Great songwriting, inspired performances and sumptuous sonics. And the original LP came with more cool eye-candy than any album ever: a wickedly twisted Alan Aldridge illustrated two panel album cover, a  wall poster of the cover, and two booklets, one for lyrics (with yet more twisted artwork) and one for \\"Scraps.\\" With CF, it would probably take as long (if not longer) to go through the booklets than it would to listen to the record. And how cool is that?!?  I could go on for days about the music, a song-cycle about Elton and Bernie's beginnings. There's not a bad cut on here, but my particular favorites are the title track, \\"Tower of Babel,\\" \\"Tell Me When the Whistle Blows,\\" \\"Meal Ticket,\\" and of course \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight.\\"  I really think this album is what made me fall in love with the album as an art form. It's like Elton's version of Abbey Road -- the beautiful epic ending of the classic EJ era. Any fan of 70s music really needs to hear this.  And for those of you with SACD setups, this sounds AMAZING in 5.1. Well worth hunting down a copy.
B004GYY714|5.0|I've only said this about a handful of apps. But this is an app that every android user should have on their phones/tablets. Especially since it is free and it works beautifully. You are up and running, listening to a large variety of radio stations, within seconds of launch. The sound is crystal clear and it is nice to be able to tune in to my favorite radio stations no matter where in the world I am.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|This thing is FAST.  I use my computer for work and use multiple displays.   This item works great, fast, cool and runs on a stock cooler with zero heat issues.  I used Artic Silver just to be on the safe side.    Again, works great!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I've spent tenfold more on a game like this without complaint. For three bucks, this is a steal! It looks and sounds great and you can get many, many hours of gameplay on this before losing interest, if you even do. I wish more games like this were created and priced for about this much.  Highly recommended for anybody who enjoys RPG games.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|This CD called \\"Diamonds in the Rough\\" is Exactly as titled! :) The songs on this album are awesome and I wish they would sing some of them on tour. Great item, well worth the money.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|If you are like me and love having the things in your life categorized then this app is for YOU! It is great to look at a calendar and see what kind of events are coming up just by the color of the tab. Very user friendly and the price is right.

Not only are  your tools \\"sysinternals\\" a must  have in any sys-admin and security professional tool-bag but the way you have portrayed what some of us  have been preaching for a while in a fictional yet quite possibly story-line is beyond what anyone can do.<br /><br />Your book should be a forwarning for all us. Forget the who, why, when and where, but the main point of the story being we are far to dependent on our the Internet. Our lives are run thru the Internet. Too many people have are unaware of the dangers and not enough people out there with the expertise to help.<br /><br />Lastly, this book can be given to anyone who uses a computer for their daily task and can be taken to a journey of thrills, brain teasers and a small idea of how the \\"hacker\\" works.

B003UESJEM|3.0|The Company Men taps into the mass layoffs, downsizing, outsourcing, etc. of late 2008 and onward into 2011. Without really getting to know Ben Affleck's character, Bobby Walker, we see him go to work and get fired within about the first ten minutes of the movie. He then spends some time bitterly adjusting to unemployment as his funds dry up, he sells his house, has to move in with his parents and finally ends up working construction with his brother-in-law, played by Kevin Costner with a so-so Boston area accent.<br /><br />Chris Cooper's director level character also loses his job. Issues of ageism arise as one employment coach tells him to color his hair and remove anything over twenty years old from his resume. Ultimately, he copes with his challenge by turning to the bottle and worse.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones VP level character is perhaps the most complex, an idealist who helped found the company with a friend played by Craig T. Nelson (in full coldly brutal \\"I'm just trying to save the company\\" mode) who sees his entire department decimated by the down-sizing movement. Rather than deal with his wife, who we get the impression will have a hard time adjusting to a reduced spending lifestyle, he simply moves in with his mistress, the corporate lawyer played by Maria Bello.<br /><br />The story attempts to be relevant but I imagine that many people will have a difficult time feeling sorry for these guys when they represent, if not the upper 1% then perhaps at least the upper 5-10%. Others may well be able to place themselves in this position. The last three years have been tough in different areas of the country and for various industries.<br /><br />Ultimately, Jones' character makes a move to reinvent himself and provides Affleck's Bobby another chance as well. It's risky but at least ends the film with some hope.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|The CableJive worked as claimed... it allowed my to charge my iPhone 4s in my 08 G35x with no problem.  The issue I had with it was that the Cablejive fell apart in 5 days. In my view go with one of the other converters that are better built. While it worked,  mine didn't last very long.  It was in the center console of the car, attached to the 4S,  when I hit a bump and the whole thing fell apart...<br /><br />Follow up... I emailed the company and they sent one of the new design docstubz..... it worked great and did NOT fall apart... customer service makes up for the issues I had with the product!!!

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I very rarely review items on Amazon.  However, I felt I would be remiss in not warning potential buyers of this particular copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2.  I feel very cheated that the Digital Copy is not directly added to your computer.  As many reviews have stated the digital copy needs to be accessed through a third party, Flixster, and then you need to add an app to your Ipad, Iphone or Android to then \\"download\\" a poor copy.  Warner Bros. needs to go back to giving you a download code to download your copy on iTunes.  I wish I had just bought my copy on iTunes and then the BluRay seperate.  Please do not buy this and send a clear message to Warner Bros and other studios who want to do similar practices.
B003BFTS9K|5.0|I also have a Black Rapid strap.  I needed two of these connectors to create a \\"safety\\" strap to complement my single strap.  The finish and quality of these Connectors are excellent.  The barrel on the hinged part of the carabiner screws down to the main part to lock it/prevent from opening.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I don't have much to say about this cd except that I love it.  Florence Welch has definitely evolved from her last album, but in a way I enjoy.  I feel as if she's matured, with different inspirations and a more unified sound.  And I've matured too, along with her.  She really is an incredible songwriter and her voice is saintly.  It took me a few listens, I'll admit, to really understand her direction in this new project but I've come to adore it just as much as the first, if not more so and will be patiently waiting for all future endeavors from Florence + the Machine as they are sure to be wonderful.
B001AGXEA6|3.0|Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I inserted the Blu-Ray disc in my player, and turned on my TV and modern surround sound receiver.  The movie started playing, without the menu displaying, and in  Dolby Digital 5.1.  I had to pull up the menu to change it to Dobly TrueHD 5.1, which turned out to be excellent (lot's of surround sound).<br /><br />The movie was about an hour and a half long.  The aspect ratio was 1.85:1, so it filled my widescreen LCD.  I prefer 2.35:1.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this movie, and are picky about Blu-Ray video quality, you will be disappointed.  There is fine grain in a lot of scenes.  Somtimes the movie looks good; sometimes not very good.  It was very colorful, in fact, there was too much color in a lot of scenes.  The lowest I've rated a Blu-Ray was 4.0 on a 10.0 scale.  This movie varied from 6.0 to 8.5.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I so thoroughly enjoyed reading this book (thanks for the Kindle version!), just couldn't put it down until complete, frequently laughing out loud at the hilarious capers of this small group of unforgetable boutique litigators.  Left me wanting to know what's next for our hero David Zinc!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This box set is an obvious must for any SW fan. The movies are incredible in BD format, and the sound is just as amazing.
B002Z8IWMS|3.0|I am reviewing the Kindle edition of this book.  In this world where many write just for the sake of publishing, this one has more contents and more emotion. All in all, it is well worth your time to read it.  On the downside, I wished the Index pages were linked to the pages where the words are found. Index pages with no page # or links are useless and occupy space for no apparent reasons. This detail, although not a substantial setback, is a major feature of a normal book that is poorly implemented.

B0020BUWX2|4.0|This book is just amazing. it tears at your heart strings and pulls you in so you wont want to  put it down.<br />at the beginning this book is a little slow and for me it took me a couple of pages to want to read but it quickly picks up. This book could easily be true and that's what makes me like this book and by the end i was crying. its sweet and heart felt. the relationship between Adam and Mia is just amazing. i highly recommend if you want a break from vampire love story's or just want a true love story to curl up with. it wont disappoint..!
B005CA4SL0|5.0|Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was great.  I didn't see any grain, except for the movie in the movie theater.  I give it a 9.2 on a 10.0 scale.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was also great.<br /><br />The movie was about 2 hours long.  The aspect ratio was 2.35:1.
B006470HZ6|5.0|This seems to be turning into a love it or hate it series.  I think the people like myself who started out not having much hope for it have been pleasantly surprised.  The emphasis is on character development and interesting insights on group dynamics rather than on a relentless blaring soundtrack over tricky, jerky camera work and cut and paste stereotypical acting.  In other words, it's a cut above anything else on American T.V.    Well done I say!
B00070DK14|1.0|I am a Tull fan. I'd row a boat across the pond to see Tull but this is one of the weakest Tull albums. I saw the concert that promoted this album , it was thirty years ago. There is a lot of good and even great Tull music. The Christmas Album is one of the great Tull albums. But Broadsword isn't a great Tull album, in a word it sucks. Buy three copies of Songs From the Wood and give them to your friends but don't buy this one. The writing is sentimental and thirty years later it still sucks. Everyone writes something they wish they didn't, this is Tull's version of the album we wish we didn't make. Thankfully, there's lot of fantastic Tull music to make up for this .
B006470HZ6|5.0|It is no secret to anyone reading the reviews that this episode has caused a lot of people to be upset, but let's put things in perspective here:  1. This show is based on a comic book series, and there are LOTS of issues of the original comic that have few to no zombie encounters in them.   2. Without occasional breaks in the action, the characters have no way to be anything but one-dimensional. All we would see is people blowing up zombies and trying to survive, without even having reason to care why they should survive or not.  3. The \\"moral\\"/survival issues faced in the show such as controlling gun use, are nothing but practical. In a zombie apocalypse, I would be more scared of my comrades if they were all untrained, armed to the teeth, and scared to death wandering through a creepy forest.  Long story short, taking away these breaks in the action would reduce this show to mindless 'night of the living dead' clones every week. If you want nonsense plots, flat characters, and action for action's sake, go watch the Resident Evil series. But don't take away a zombie show that's actually believable and compelling!
0316098329|5.0|I could hardly put the book down the story grabbed me and held me captive and I think I finished it in just a couple of days.  Now I don't have a job outside the home any longer so I had more time available to keep on reading.  It is a page turner and the ending did not actually surprise me it sort of saddened me.  The one thing that got to me was the breast feeding that went on so long but I understand that the situation the mother and child were in left no other option.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Love love loved this movie. I was entertained and enthralled from the moment it began. Michael Cera is loveable and the part suited him well. He had to defeat all of Ramona Flowers' seven deadly exes and besides being funny it immensely plot driven. Loved the characters, loved the acting, loved everything. Well done.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been a long time reader of Stephen King's works.  I love it when he steps away from standard horror and writes something a bit different.  When I read that this novel was about time travel and JFK's assassination, I was intrigued.   I began reading and could not put the book down.  I had to see what happened to these characters.  Was Jake successful? What would happen to Sadie? What insights to gleam regarding LHO's life?  I also wanted to see what King would come up with in general regarding time travel.  I wish we'd had more on the yellow card man and others like him- that's a huge unexplored point to me.  The most intriguing part of this story is that it is a romance set in a time travel story.  People fall in love and have obsticles in their ways-- and it is such a lovely love story.  King's strength is in his characters and your heart with break right along with the book.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Great gameplay but has a few problems. Some of the graphics appear pixelated on my epic 4g touch, and I have had the game close several times without warning in the middle of a level. There is no force close message, and my progress is lost. If this bug were fixed and some of the resolutions bumped up, I would give a 5 star rating. Epic 4g Touch.

0670022950|5.0|Steven Pinker does an excellent review of the threads of data related to human violence.  As a psychiatrist, I find his scientific approach both comprehensive and salient.  There are many places where he puts things in a way that really gets you thinking.  I especially liked the postulation that the world has too much morality.  Indeed, Pinker points out that many murders are self-justified as acts of a moral nature, as determined by the person who perceives being wronged.  It is interesting that Pinker in his younger days trended toward anarchism, then moved away from it.  One can see in his writing his appreciation for a libertarian viewpoint while the evidence points toward the utility of a Hobbesian social contract.<br /><br />This book is worthy of a read by anyone fascinated with the violent nature of our species and the means we have found to limit that nature, when we apply those means.  Certainly, professionals in psychology, social work, law, politics, and teaching ought to be conversant about the content of this book.  Also, many lay people are simply misled by myths that violence is worse than ever, and the good ol' days need restored.  If nothing else, this book is a call to reject the regressive social forces that adore a past that was never very good.
1589795474|4.0|I liked the book and it was pretty interesting, but it should be less than half as long as it is.
B005RUV6RO|5.0|I feel like there was much more action and suspense in season 1 than in season 2. It seems like I'm watching a soap opera now and that is probably why their amount of viewers decreased by 8% last week. Either way, this is still a great series and Amazon's streaming in HD is amazing!

0525423281|5.0|(This review was originally posted at GoneWithTheWords.com)<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss was without a doubt one of my favorite books last year. With its incredible setting, characters, and realistic romance, it was hard not to put it at the top. Well, Lola and the Boy Next Door had all of those same amazing qualities.<br /><br />It's safe to say there's not one thing I disliked about this book. I ADORED everything!! All the complicated relationships between the characters were very realistic, as were the emotions that came with them. It was refreshing to see Lola have such loving, supportive parents who cared enough about her to set boundaries. And I liked that Lola respected her dads enough to obey them most of the time. :) Lola is a good kid. She's also unique, fun, and caring. I felt her relationship with Max, who was older than her by five years, was also very realistic and painful to read. I wanted her to dump him! He was such a jerk. Ugh!<br /><br />But then we had Cricket. [Insert HUGE smile here.] He's SO going in my favorite YA guys list! He's earned a permanent spot there, right above Etienne St. Clair. That's right! Above! I can't even come up with the right words to describe him. Well, actually, here's one: INDESCRIBABLE. He was just so genuine and sweet that you can't help but love him. And he was so nice! But not wimpy, which is sometimes hard to do when someone is that nice and sweet.<br /><br />Anna and Etienne are in this book. SQUEEE! :D I knew they would be, but I was not expecting them to be in this book as much as they were! They are very involved with our main characters.<br /><br />You know how in Anna, St. Clair was the one in the relationship but we really never got to see what it was like for him and what he was struggling with? Well, Lola is kind of in his situation, and we get to read what it's like for the person in that predicament. It's not always easy to make the right decisions for ourselves. We don't want to be wrong or hurt people we care about. Lola does the best she can do, and I loved her for that.<br /><br />This book's rating cannot be measured in a mere number of stars...because like our boy Cricket, it's entire galaxies (thank Stephanie Perkins for that little gem). Page after page, it mesmerized me. So, prepare yourself, you're going to love it...its amazingness leaves no room for doubt in this matter.an do, and I loved her for that.

B005OCFHHK|1.0|No bonuses or anything. I'm waiting for a proper box set. It's not cool when they release a movie series set without everything extra that each individual release had. I hope most people hold off on buying this.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|A fine addition to the Angry Birds family, but personally, I only need 1 Angry Birds game, and prefer the original. I personally wouldn't recommend it, but if you just have to have another Angry Birds game, this isn't a bad choice.
B00005Q6BR|5.0|MJ's last album was very mature and, as usually, with a lot of variety. Michael Jackson is music by himself. I put on top Lost children, Speechless and You rock my world. Thank you Carlos Santana for collaborating in Whatever happens. That was the coexistence of two great artists. Everyone must buy this album!

B001UV4XIS|1.0|Stay away from Warner Bros DVDs with Flixster/Ultraviolet.  It is an attempt to pirate your personal information and share it with 3rd parties.  The streaming/download service doesn't work and when you call ultraviolet support, they refer to flixster saying it isn't an ultraviolet issue.  Flixster then refers to a FAQ section and ultimately just doesn't respond.  You cannot download and store the digital copy in iTunes.  You can only download and view with their player.  It is a bad deal.  I will never purchase any DVD with the Flixster/Ultraviolet service.  Better off downloading in iTunes and watching with Apple TV.  Much better and more usable experience.  Hope you read this before you buy, wish I had.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|As has already been mentioned, Ultraviolet is NOT a digital copy but rather a license to stream. But if you are like me (or more precisely, like my kids) then the time and place of greatest need for a digital copy is on their iPad during a long car or plane trip, precisely the times when it is impossible to stream! Ultraviolet therefore fails the most basic test: is it useful when and where people need it the most. It is most assuredly not.
B004GYOQ6A|3.0|A fun little game, but not enough to justify the price tag. I got it on the daily offer so no regrets here, but I wouldn't buy it at regular price.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|As a music fan born in 1989, there are very few albums from the last 10 years or so that make me proud to be part of my generation. Of the few, Crack The Skye easily tops that list. In many ways, this is the kind of music I've been waiting to hear my whole life, so perfectly crafted it makes my head spin every time I listen. Heavy metal, yes, but this music also conveys an overwhelming beauty so rarely (not to mention genuinely) encountered in that genre. There is one moment about 3/4 of the way through \\"The Czar\\" that is just out-of-this-world beautiful and worth the $$$ all by itself. \\"Oblivion\\" combines epic riffing, clean vocals by drummer extraordinaire Brann Dailor, and a spectacular harmonious chorus. \\"Divinations\\" features a brief banjo intro, another haunting chorus, and a Dick Dale-esque guitar solo. The 13-minute closer, \\"The Last Baron\\", is everything that makes this band great in a nutshell: the riffs, the vocal harmonies, the chaos, the craftsmanship, it's all there. This album gets my highest recommendation. Trust me, you owe it to yourself to hear this. Great music is NOT dead!
B004GTQ4DI|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that it's not quite the same as the original Cranford, however I found it no less enjoyable.  The talented performances are just as great and the blend of humor and drama is still excellent, however there is more drama this time around.  Miss Pole, played by Imelda Staunton, has the best lines in the movie, and I believe the best reason to watch the movie.  She's fantastic.  She provides humor to balance the drama in this fantastic film.
0307593312|3.0|I have also read all of Murakami's books, including the short story collections, Pinball, and his book on running.  As I read through all of his previous books, I was mesmerized, unable to put the book(s) down, often reading or re-reading them in a single day.  Frequently, I have had the rather strange experience of feeling like my mind was being opened, not merely creatively, but physically, even feeling like I was losing my grip on this world - and no, that isn't a normal experience for me.  However, almost immediately, as I began IQ84, I was disappointed.    The beginning of the book hardly even seemed like Murakami and I had the distinct feeling that he was pushing himself to write rather than being internally driven to expression as in all of his prior books.  Instead of the book flowering creatively and dynamically from some unconscious well into a new world, this one seemed crafted logically, and philosphers (Camus excepted) are rarely great fiction writers.  Because of this predetermined path that Murakami seems to have for this novel, he apparently failed to realize some rather silly mistakes, particularly in places where he was attempting to move the plot forward, using artifical means to get to where he wanted the plot to be.    The initial conversation with Fuka-Eri's guardian is a great example.  The guardian is talking about how concerned he was for Fuka-Eri's parents who had seemingly disappeared within the religious cult of Sakigake and how he was attempting to find out more about them but hitting a brick wall.  The problem is those parents had apparently abandoned their 10 year old daughter, and the parents last known whereabouts are within Sakigake, as founding members.  Wouldn't the easiest thing, and most logical thing, be to simply go to the police and say, \\"Hey this is the 10 year old daughter of some close friends of mine who were running Sakigake, who just came mysteriously to my house and we need to find out what happened to her parents.\\"  Idon't know how it works in Japan, but here in the U.S. the parents would be found and charged with abandonment if their 10 year old just ran off and they didn't try to find her, or have any idea where she was at.  Instead, the Professor did all this other ridiculous stuff, from the outside, never telling the police anything...huh?  It makes no sense.  Then, at the end of the conversation with the Professor, Tengo asks him if he has permission to re-write Air Chrysalis...  Uhm...he's not the legal guardian of Fuka-Eri, as the Professor pointed out in detail since he never went to the police and created any sort of legal guardianship, so how can he give any kind of permission that matters?    Another problem, in a similar vein, had to do with the discussions between Ayumi and Aomame.  The sexual conversations between Aomame and Ayumi seemed ridiculous.  I think Murakami is much better at observing women through the eyes of a main male character than creating an authentic female voice through a female character, at least he doesn't do a good job here.  In fact, in some of his past novels his female characters have poked fun at the main male character for knowing nothing about women...I think this might be accurate in some sense for Murakami.  I kind of felt like I was reading an article from a guy, pretending to be a girl, writing about a lesbian experience to Penthouse magazine.  Maybe Japanese women are different than American women, but it just didn't ring through as authentic with me, so it stuck out like a sore thumb.  Women are generally more protective of each other and sensitive than Murakami portrayed Ayumi, particularly when she was a woman who had been sexually abused in her childhood.  \\"It was like a porno\\", Ayumi says after her night of having a foursome with Aomame with two strange men, where Aomame doesn't even remember what happens but realizes from the mornings physical sensations, that she had anal sex with one of the men...that strikes me as what aguy would say after a night like that, not what a woman would say.  As I was reading this passage, my first thought was that Aomame had been dropped GHB, or some similar drug and raped.  That was certainly a reasonable concern and given that Aomame didn't know Ayumi that well, she should have been concerned that this \\"friend\\" might somehow have been involved in getting her raped.  Instead, she takes it all in stride like it was no big deal.    There were parts where the usual best Murakami was still shining through, enough of them to get me to read the book to the end, but there were way too many spots where he was taking liberties with the characters to move the plot in the direction he wanted rather than letting the story grow naturally.  the character Ushikawa is a great example of this.  Basically, out of thin air Ushikawa figures out everything that has happened to the Sakigake Leader, then he starts looking for evidence of what he already knows and only because he figured it out in a flash of brilliant insight was he able to start uncovering the pieces that link the Leader's fate back to the other characters.  That isn't how things really happen, but Murakami apparently couldn't figure out another way of getting where he wanted the story to go.    Having read all of Murakami's prior novels, I was always left with the feeling that Murakami was a truly and unique and amazing writer.  The best writers hit foul balls from time to time, but Murakami never seemed to.  Every novel was amazing in its own right, and each novel was casually and creatively linked to all the others in various ways.  It almost seemed to me as if Murakami was putting together a series of linked islands that collectively explained the workings of the mind, consciously and unconsciously, and thus the world itself, as it appears and as it may be behind those appearances.  More importantly, I felt that through his novels he was opening up the reader's mind, quieting our conscious desires, thatour everyday world invigorates, and encouraging us to look within, rather than without.  This novel, however, doesn't belong in the archipelago he has been creating.  This is Murakami's first foul ball, and for the first time he may have been looking without, rather than within.  I have always thought that fame, or the desire for it (and the desire for money, which are really kissing cousins), kills creativity.  Murakami seemed to understand that, both in his life and his works, and I believe it was for that reason that he has been such a beautifully successful writer.  But this novel struck me as his first attempt to create a magnum opus, a crowning acheivement that might push him Nobel Prize conversations; when all he really needed to do was to continue to let his natural creativity spill out into the world without concern for the results.  The soul shrinks from the conscious mind's desires, whether it is the conscious desire for fame or anything else, and it seems to have given Murakami a slap on the hand.  I hope he realizes it, and the authentic Murakami returns again with a new novel.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Steve Jobs was a genius who enhanced our lives by his foresight, creativity, and determination to create the best products possible.  He knew what we wanted before we did.<br />This is the only authorized biography of Steve Jobs and it is well researched, well written, and does not pull any punches.  It draws  a portrait of a complex driven man, who who did not always treat people very well.  Despite his many character flaws, by the end of the book, I understood Steve Jobs and came to like and respect him.

B004ZN9W5M|5.0|This review will contain strictly my thoughts on the Guthrie remaster and NOT on the the album's lyrical or conceptual qualities. Lets start off with my equipment; I'm testing this cd on my full british hifi system ( Musical Fidelity A1 CD Pro, Musical Fideltiy A1 Integrated Amp, Bower and Wilkins 805 speaker). Forget the Doug Sax version along with the previous Guthrie 1994 remastered disc set; if you want  audiophile sonic quality this is the version to buy. This copy of the remaster retains all the character and essence of the original LP with added dynamic punch and texture lost in the previous versions. It is evident that much time was spent refining this album as its overall product is significantly different from past remasters. Especially on \\"Hey You\\" and \\"One of my turns\\" the imaging and sound stage really shine and show the real remastering magic from Guthrie. I don't care much for the miniaturized LP paper packaging sleeve; honestly I would have preferred an actual cd case but that is a very minor problem. I would recommend this album to anyone with at least an entry level hifi system or hifi level headphones. This is a must have for die hard pink floyd fans personally I enjoy more of the remastered disc found on the discovery sets instead of the live performance discs or other miscellaneous recordings which in my opinion are neither here nor there; they just don't hit that spot for me and are neither of any high sonic qualities. And for those who already have all the previous \\"The Wall\\" albums the difference with this 2011 remaster are definitely worth the cash. Great sounding hifi quality music will always deserve my hard earned money.

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Following 2009's acclaimed Endgame, Megadeth releases its thirteen studio album aptly called Thirteen (stylized TH1RT3EN). Megadeth's been fairly consistent over the years releasing strong albums in the 1980's, 90's and the 00's and Dave Mustaine and co are not about to let fans down with TH1RT3EN. David Ellefson makes a return to the band and this is his first contribution to a Megadeth studio album since The World Needs A Hero (2001). One thing is sure Megadeth isn't mellowing with the years and that's good as far as fans are concerned. I knew I could count on them to deliver like they did so many times before and after all those years Megadeth is still an excellent band both live and in the studio. TH1RT3EN offers the elements that make a great Megadeth album great without being an exact copy of its predecessor.<br /><br />\\"Sudden Death\\" opens the album right. It was released previously for Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock and I don't think I can tell you anything you don't know yet about this track. You probably have your own opinion on this before hearing the album but still, terrific way to open the album. \\"Public Enemy #1\\" is next, ok yes, the title has already been used a few times before but the track is good so what's to complain about? The band already released a video in support of the song which is to me one of the best songs on TH1RT3EN. I love the angry lyrics on \\"Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)\\", kind of like screaming at an ex-girlfriend \\"You hate the way I wear my clothes/You hate my friends and where we go/I see you in the shadows/You think you know what's best for me...\\". \\"We Are The People\\" is one of those more politically inclined Megadeth songs. Dave speaks his mind (and a lot of people in America's) on this track and what he says is right, this one is more lyrics oriented but it doesn't diminish a thing that the music rocks.  I'm not a big fan of \\"Guns, Drugs, Money\\" and find it rather average but that's just my opinion. \\"Fast Lane\\" is one of my favorite tracks here; it's one that's been getting more listens since I bought the album. Ok the theme has already been covered in Megadeth songs before this one. A relentless double-bass drum attack, the heaviness, the emotion in Dave's voice and the amazing breakdown, I love it all. \\"Black Swann\\" was previously released with the Japanese version of the United Abominations album but I never heard it until now. I don't mind that they put it here, from the start it never really lets you go, another great song. The title track and album closer 13 is an amazing song not quite like anything on this album or anything that Megadeth has released before. It's a very personal song for Dave and an epic conclusion to his journey in Metal, a lot has been said about this song (most of it positive) and I think it's one of the best things Megadeth did.<br /><br />I don't have anything bad to say about TH1RT3EN, it's a good Megadeth album and there's something for every fan here. There's been a lot of talk about Sudden Death already being released for Guitar Hero, Black Swann already released and the demos for \\"New World Order\\" and \\"Millennium of the Blind\\" on the 2004 Youthanasia remaster. Personally I think it's great that we get to have Sudden Death and Black Swann on CD and not just as digital release, I understand they're technically not so much new songs but I still think it's cool that we have them here. As those demos turned into songs well they were just that demos, not totally finished and the final results are pretty good. Mustaine said that they had about two months in the studio to make an album and this is the resulting album, to me it's not the best Megadeth album but it's a worthy, enjoyable and fairly consistent record.<br /><br />I don't know for sure that this is the last Megadeth album but the album cover shows Vic Rattlehead with his back towards us and the back of the cover has Vic lying in a coffin. Seems like he was put to rest and now maybe Dave is putting Megadeth to rest as well. It's not easy following an album like Endgame (which was one of the best albums in the band's career in my opinion) and TH1RT3EN doesn't exactly match it for me but it does quite well and is a strong release. I think if this is the final Megadeth album then bravo Dave for a fantastic career, bringing the metal, giving us excellent albums and keeping your integrity. If not, I'll buy the next album.  Not quite a 5 to me but really, really close. 4.5/5.not easy following an album like Endgame (which was one of the best albums in the band's career in my opinion) and TH1RT3EN doesn't exactly match it for me but it does quite well and is a strong release.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. And I read a lot! My only critque is that it left a little to be desired in the description of the fighting, and wasn't very clear at the end. Other than that, I love the book. Applause to all of the books in the Hunger Games series.
B00427X9WI|3.0|Like many movies before it, EPL is a film about \\"finding one's self\\".  Fortunately there are better examples than this story of a woman (Julia Roberts) who realizes her marriage is a sham, gets a divorce then shacks up with a young actor (James Franco).  Na, this doesn't feel right either, so she puts her belongings in storage (what no furniture?) and heads out for a year long journey to Italy, India and Bali.  It's hard to feel too sorry for her.  How many of us could take a sabbatical like that?  She can, as she is a successful writer and speaker about the human condition.  The film is beautifully shot but seems to lack the heart and soul and emotional depth we chick flick types look for.  The movie isn't a total failure however.  The acting is fine; the music is really good, ranging from some nice Brazilian stuff to vintage Neil Young.  The best parts of the movie are where Liz (Roberts) writes her letters or otherwise narrates her feelings.  These are beautifully written, I suspect straight from Elizabeth Gilbert's book.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe Season 3 expands the coexistence of our universe with the alternate one as patterned events create anomalies in both of them.  The pattern events are very creative and the interaction between the characters as they attempt make sense of these weird events makes for fun and exciting viewing.
B004ZJZPXO|4.0|Serenity is probably my favorite sci-fi film since Aliens, and a much closer franchise in feel to the original Star Wars then anything since The Empire Strikes Back. It is different in its tone from Firefly, the show that it follows (it is more plot and action driven than the delightfully meandering space western series) but the heart is still the same, with the most delightful set of characters this side of a Stagecoach.  Those who love Firefly/Serenity wax poetic about it to a nauseating degree, and I fall into this myself often times, so I will just say that if you have never seen the film or the series, both are worth your time.  There.  As for the Blu Ray, I bought it as an upgrade over my DVD copy of the film. It is definitely a superior disc, but how much you notice will definitely depend on your set up. The film is often shot in dark, grainy interiors, an effective stylistic choice, but not one that lends itself to HD scrutiny. The image is by no means bad, it just won't be your reference disc any time soon. In exterior shots and during the space sequences, the HD shines through much more clearly, and it is a significant bump up from the standard definition version.  The audio track is 5.1, but I would warn that you really need a 5.1 set up to appreciate it, or even to prefer it, to the DVD sound mix. Due to space restrictions in our TV room we are stuck with a soundabar with sub system that tries to emulate 5-channel surround sound through 3 speakers. On this set-up while watching Serenity, the dialogue often sounds too bright. Many times entire chunks of dialogue sound a bit like they've been looped (re-recorded after filming) which may or may not have been the case but were unnoticeable on the same set-up with the DVD.  Sound effects are booming and robust but fall into the familiar problem of being drastically louder than dialogue, so even with DAC cranked up you may have to ride the volume button through the entire film.  Again, this may be a result ofusing a soundbar instead of a 5.1 or 7.1 surround system, but it is a valid point to mention.  Overall, the Blu Ray of this fantastic film is a clearly superior disc to the old DVD version. While it's not anywhere close to being one of the top looking discs out there, it is the best-looking - and depending on your set-up, best-sounding - version of this amazing movie you are going to find.
B004GGQMRY|5.0|Rain man is a delight to watch. If you have liked forrest gump then ull definitely like this. Though the movie is different from forrest gump. But ull have the feeling of that movie.
