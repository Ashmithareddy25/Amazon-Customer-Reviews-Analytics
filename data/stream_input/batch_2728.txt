B007REV4YI|4.0|I loved the movie because I am a bond fan and it really gets in to bond a little deeper.  My fiancee who is not a Bond fan found it way to long and not interesting.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is entertaining, best of all I got it from free using the amazon appstore. free things should always deserve 5 stars
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Finished this one in about a day and a half. Very easy to get through and a lot of helpful insight to leaving the rat race behind.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|Smart, funny, well acted, and full of action. Everything I look for in an escapist summer movie.  Mary Louise Parker and John Malkovich made the movie!
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Got as a free app, but would buy for a couple bucks. The single player is all I've done and it is pretty challenging starting at the normal difficulty. Play your first couple games on the easier settings to get your bearings, then up the difficulty.

B00DU74U74|4.0|I watched the movie before reading the book since I read so many sour reviews about the movie from people who loved the book. Without having read the book, I enjoyed this movie. I could tell there was probably a lot more character development that I would get if having read the book, but overall it was a good movie. Now time to read the book!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I love this movie it is better than the first one an that is rare for most films. Each person fits when they are in the movie and it all makes sense were the comedy comes in. The only thing bad about this movie is it should have had a longer fight scene with Jason Bateham and Scott Atkins . For the third one Steven Segal should be the crime boss
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I thought this would only appeal to the kids, but I actually liked it more than my teens did. I even watched it twice. Entertaining. Sweet story. Special effects were cool. Great clean family movie, so long as you know there is a bit of human eating by giants. Not terribly graphic, but may be a bit much for younger kids.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I tend to either really like Tarantino movies, or really dislike them.<br /><br />This was a dislike for a few reasons:<br /><br />The plot, as simple as it was, didn't make enough sense.  There is a &#34;scam&#34; going on that amounts to &#34;you wouldn't sell me your object unless I paid you too much for it, so I'll try to buy another object from you . .  .for too much. . .then hope you throw in the first object . . .or something.&#34;  They didn't convey the reason why the main characters were going thru all the trouble.  but I could have overlooked something, so this is more of a pet peeve - something I'd look closer at if I ever watched it again.<br /><br />Jamie Fox  -the title character - ends up being (at best) the 4th most interesting main character.  His wife in the movie ranks somewhere after &#34;key grip&#34;.  So it's hard to care what they do or what happens to them.  This is the biggest flaw in the movie.<br /><br />The N word was a unneeded distraction.  I see no use for it in this movie. Bad, bad decision there.<br /><br />Tarantino's cameo.  Ugh.  Blurg.  The vomit in my mouth tastes repulsive, just like his fake accent in the cameo.<br /><br />2nd half of movie not nearly as interesting as first half.<br /><br />A list of Pros, but these don't save the movie: The German guy, who was in his last movie about the Nazis. He was great for the first 1/2 the movie.  But what should have been the most tense scenes (putting him on the flipside of his best scene /the first scene in Inglourious Basterds) ends up falling flat, and he's inconsequential for the rest of the movie.  Tarantino KNEW how to make that scene tense, and that should have been the emotional high point of the movie, but instead it went nowhere, and the movie went downhill from there.  It was 3 stars before this point, 1 star after.<br /><br />It's an unconventional western, and I like westerns.  The soundtrack was a mix of old and new songs, and I'll give it a plus.  The old ones sort of placed it into the past, which was good for a western.  If I was making a western movie (ha!) I would totally copy this idea and have all the music be 50+ years old. It somehow places you into another time, although of course not the right time, but the important thing is that it takes you out of the present.

It's a waste of paper and almost $30 for the hard cover copy?<br />No thanks! Save your money and borrow from the library if you wish.
B0028ADKNE|4.0|After probably 30-some years, I re-read Treasure Island, this time with my eight-year-old daughter, and it was an interesting experience after half-a-lifetime of reading adventure tales. The first thing that struck me was how much dialect there is in this book. Half the time, it was hard to understand what the heck Long John Silver and his pirate friends were saying to the poor, and much more well-spoken, protagonist Jim Hawkins. Here's a good example from Mr. Silver's mouth: \\"Not much worth to fight, you ain't. P'r'aps you can understand King George's English. I'm cap'n here by `lection.\\" I don't know how I overlooked this as a kid, but it has far more dialect than I'm used to. Yet given that it's a classic, that must have worked back in 1883, so I can't be too critical.<br /><br />The story also contains less action than I'm used to from reading fiction written in the 20th and 21st centuries, but back in 1883, Treasure Island may have been that generation's \\"Star Wars.\\" The plot is fairly straightforward. Young Jim Hawkins, who works with his mother at an English inn called the Admiral Benbow, meets a drunken old seaman named Billy Bones who is fearful of a mysterious one-legged man. After Billy dies, Jim discovers his old treasure map (with an \\"X\\" that marks the spot). He shows it to Dr. Livsey and Squire Trewlaney, a pair of gentlemen willing to take risks for the sake of adventure and a chest full of gold, and soon finds himself on a sea voyage to Skeleton Island. Unfortunately, the crew hired by Trewlaney - who seriously needs to work on his background checks - is comprised of former pirates who have been seeking the treasure for some time. Even worse, they are led by the one-legged man that Billy so feared: Long John Silver (\\"shiver my timbers!\\"). Naturally, a mutiny ensues, and before long, it's up to young Jim to save the day.<br /><br />Almost every pirate clich&eacute; you can think of derived from this novel, including the peg-legged captain, the talking parrot, the map with a great big X, and \\"yo-ho and a bottle of rum!\\" No wonder it's a classic. It did to pirates what Tolkien did to dwarves and elves. There were enough harrowing moments to keep me engaged, despite the awkward dialect and a penchant for \\"telling,\\" instead of \\"showing,\\" which seems to have been rampant in 19th century writing. There was more violence than I remembered, which made it less than ideal for my eight-year-old, but no one can fault Mr. Stevenson for that. I'm glad I re-read it, and I understand why it's so famous, but I must say, I think I'd prefer a more recently crafted pirate tale. That said, it's hard to be too hard on a classic.t, the map with a great big X, and \\"yo-ho and a bottle of rum!\\" No wonder it's a classic. It did to pirates what Tolkien did to dwarves and elves.

B00498YZH8|3.0|Winter's Boring should have been the title of this movie.It didn't keep me interested at all! Always looking to check out movies .
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|By the second viewing the film starts to feel like one story, you see why Tom Hanks character in the far future has an evil spirit with him, which at first seems anoying. Their is so much going on that I can see why 50% of the people just don't get it. Like the Buddhist reviewer said the reference on life and karma are everywhere.<br />This one stays in my favorite movie stash.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|Film lacked any credible plot.  Looks like a way for actors to make some $.  NOT even worth renting.  Don't waste your $

B00D41H2PS|4.0|Maybe I have played one too many point and click puzzle games, but this one seemed way too short.  The puzzles were somewhat challenging but the game would have been better if it had been more elaborate, more adventurous.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|Here's my update: AWESOME!  I sent the dead one back and Amazon promptly sent me a new one.  First test: Dark Side of the Moon, of course!  You can hear all the clocks, chiming, cash register noises, and all.  Is it perfect?  No, more like a car stereo w/ small speakers.  But still pretty great.<br /><br />Audible books aren't compatible and Amazon doesn't sell downloadable mp3 audiobooks but their competitor DOES.  To download, you need to install the Overdrive Media Console.  This is fine because that's also what you need to download from most civic libraries in the US anyway.  After downloading the book, navigate to those files and drag/drop them into the Neptune (by folder, not by individual files).  I downloaded books each way and tested them.  They work great!<br /><br />Why was my first Neptune dead and the 2nd worked well?  During registration, you're asked to input the \\"batch number\\" from the back of the unit.  If no number, input zero.  My first Neptune had no number and was a dud.  The replacement unit had the batch number 0032013.  I'm guessing that means either batch #3 of the year or the batch from March.  Presumably their initial manufacturing run churned out a bunch of duds.  After that they began to keep track of each batch more closely.  This is why they want you to go through their trouble-ticket process.  NO THANKS!  Amazon's replacement process was much quicker.  My replacement unit works well but like other reviewers, I get a screen w/ the names of the songs listed in Chinese characters.  I'm able to click past that to the names in English.  Presumably batch #4 will no longer have the Chinese bug...<br /><br />Audiobook tip:  After downloading w/ Overdrive, I copy the files to another location and use GarageBand to break them up into 30 min chunks.  This is how long I usually want to swim w/out a break.  I also use a swim snorkel.  No need to lift the head nor look at the clock.<br /><br />All in all, I think it was worth giving the Neptune a 2nd chance.  So worth it that they went from 1 star to 5 stars.  However, Finis NEVER DID get back to me about the first unit that was a dud.  So much for Marie...(see below).<br /><br />~~~~~~~~ Initial Review:<br /><br />I'm so bummed!  I was really looking forward to using my Neptune.  I got it yesterday, plugged it into my Mac and it immediately began charging.  I registered it and let it charge for a while and then started dropping some music onto it.  I only put a couple of albums on because I wanted to play with it before I loaded too much on.  But then I got distracted by life until this morning.  \\"Oh, yay, I finally get to take my Neptune for a swim!\\"  But no.  Although it was still plugged into my Mac, it was powered off, wouldn't power back on, and the Mac no longer recognized the device.  Attempts at holding down the power button and the return button for 15 secs did nothing.  Restarting the computer, plugging into other USB options didn't have an affect.<br /><br />I called their customer service number and they have a warm body answer the phones but apparently they only have one person doing support for the Neptune.  Her name's Marie and I left a message on her voicemail.  After reading about support on their website I called a different support line but ended up back at Marie's voicemail.  I hung up and called back, this time asking the very nice woman who answered how long I could expect before Marie could get back to me.  She told me that there was a phone queue of more than an hour.  Yikes!  Time to hire a 2nd or 3rd person!  She asked me to open a trouble ticket but after reading about what a hassle that is, I decided to simply return the device to Amazon.  Hopefully the replacement device will work.<br /><br />I\\"m still very excited about this product and I want a successful experience.  After I receive my replacement, I'll update this review.

This book is so enriched with the world it is set in and all it's problems that I totally forgot about any \\"Cinderella\\" links for a long time. Now that I think about the mean 'mom' and two sisters, it falls into place. This book has what readers want, if you are looking for some Science Fiction, robotics mixed with huge secrets that made my mind spin, so well this book has been thought out and written! Dystopian, romance, evil, twists, sickness, it's all here and more! Love it!

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Mr. Aslan is not an historian.  He is also a devout Muslim.  His purpose is clear, and it isn't an objective study of Christ.  The book is simply an OPINION piece written by an educated anti-Christian.  There is nothing 'new' or 'unique' claimed here;  the Muslim world has been saying these same things for hundreds of years.  Sorry, I find the book about as accurate as reading \\"Chariots of the Gods.\\"

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I just want to say that I agree with everyone's comments about this game. Its great, a lot of fun, with cool graphics (unless you play the game on a Samsung S4 phone. It starts looking like an un-digitally remastered version of a Disney movie).  Yes, if you want to, you can purchase virtual items with the game, but if you choose not to you can still play. And be successful in the game. It does take patience, which may be a challenge for kids. The developers have done a great job adding things and making improvements over the course of the game, which has made it fresh and new even as you get into the upper levels. My only complaint (and I don't know if I'm the only one or not) is that this game has a tendency to freeze while its loading. So much so that I have had to physically turn my kindle off. After doing so, it usually loads just fine. This doesn't. happen all of the time but frequently enough.  Curious if anyone else has had this similar issue.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Just like the original. and very fun to play.  I remember playing as a kid and now my son can learn how to play too. I would totally recommend this to all you gen X people out there who love pac man.  I'm waiting for Ms. Pac-man now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game, it really makes you think and tests your problem solving skills. The only downside is that it needs more levels.
B00A82VM7U|5.0|Gather the kids around a small table with your kindle in the middle and you will have tons of fun with this little gem of a game. It would be nice with an option to play on your own as well though.<br />EDIT in the new current version you can play against the computer as well! I recommend trying out the advanced board as well, - it's way more fun than the squares.

B004LROUNG|4.0|The story went fast, but it was predictable.  I like John Grisham novels and I will continue to read his books.  I just thought this one was just a step up from the Playing for Pizza book which I found to be boring.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It is the best app ever it's so fun, yet it has bad reviews  except one this app really does need more time and it does need more things to build with and it needs more animals and make it were you can ride horses the  than that it's awesome
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone on a journey to health. Spells out the 'why' we are so unhealthy. Getting all grains, processed foods and sugar out of my body has been a life saver. I was diagnosed with severe food allergies, especially to wheat and grains, so severe that is was causing systemic inflammation throughout my body including my brian. My health is improving day by day. I feel alive and so much better at 47 than I did at 30! It takes courage and determination to change to this lifestyle but the rewards are so worth it. YOU are worth it! I am never going back to eating the way I was. I was on a journey of enslavement to my food! And yet I was told it was healthy! Now I'm free! If you can see this program as freedom, you are well on your way to becoming the best you possible.
0446547638|4.0|the book is always in great shape.  I have read almost all of nicholas sparks novels and enjoyed them all.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This device should be a no-brainer for anybody who wants to try or already has netflix. $35 for a 3 months of netflix plus a neat way to remotely control your content from netflix, youtube, google play, and any other site that adds chromecast controls!<br /><br />My only negative is that based on the unveil, there doesn't appear to be a way to stream local content or use the device as an extended display for gaming like airplay. That said, streaming local content shouldn't be too much of stretch for some industrious developers, and additional functionality like mirrored and extended display could always be enabled in an update.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|Met my expectations. Even though Theo is a boy with knowledge of the law, he still acts like an average kid.
1594204217|5.0|This book is very well written an interesting subject, I highly recommend this book.  Looking forward to taking it to the beach with me this Summer.
B001AQIYJC|4.0|Definitely NOT a comedy, when the movie opens with a child dying and being escorted to heaven by an angel!  If you have doubts about a hear-after, this might make you think.  I won't spoil the plot or the ending.  Nick Cage was a real good-looking man in his early years.  Those eyes!  Meg Ryan is so &#34;Meg&#34;, but serious.<br />Enjoy!
B004ADH1RI|4.0|I grew up with this moving and love going back and watching it again and again. There is a little but of language that I could do without so that's why I picked 4 stars. It's a fun story and I love Astoria Oregon!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Having the ability to stream music on your phone directly from the cloud is convenient. It eliminates the need to manually transfer mp3 files from your computer to your phone. I have an aux input jack that I use to connect my phone to my car stereo, and the audio quality is better than that of Pandora. I have a JBL audio system I installed aftermarket, and so I can hear the difference between a high quality stream and one that has been compressed to save bandwidth. While not CD quality, the audio quality is still excellent.<br /><br />Caution: the app does use mobile data, so if you have a limited data plan, that is something you might want to watch out for. The app does remind you every time you use it unless you disable the notification. If you're like me, you probably have because you don't want to have to click ok every time you open the app.
B009NY43NY|4.0|So Mad at the ending!!! Loved the series, will reread over and over!!!! Please write more on this series, it can not be over yet!!!
B00CJGP116|5.0|I'm beyond thrilled that Marc finally has a new CD. It's been a long time! This CD does not disappoint. It's classic Marc.....great songs and his voice is to die for....emotional, beautiful and spot on. Great CD!

0553801473|5.0|Brand New hardcover for more than half the price. It was definitely one of the better purchases I've made. Delivery time was a little extended, but that's to be expected with deals like this. As for the book itself; like the previous 4 books, Dance with Dragons is gripping and lures you along. I felt so absorbed, always wanting to turn the page and read onwards. Can't wait for the next book in the series to come out.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|This series is always interesting and exciting to see how he will work thru it.  Eventho it is an old series it continues to be good.
0770437400|1.0|Terrible book. Nothing happens. No tension.  No narrative. No characters. Just the same voice talking but pretending to be different obnoxious people with an obnoxious narrator. What a disappointment!

B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This move helped me reflect on the methods God uses to mature us.  The experiences of Pi are unbelievable; but he lived through them.  In the end, he one is able to see the sovereignty of God  and rest in his peace.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Book gets the key message that Spirit repeats everywhere - YOU ARE LOVED!  It is written to the medical and scientific community but in a personal style that anyone can benefit from reading. It is engaging, well edited and an excellent read for anyone questioning whether Spirit is real.<br />Anyone you know who is sick or dying and fears death will find this a valuable read. If you have a doctor who is an atheist (many are) give them a copy, it could change their life and the way they interface with all their patients.
1594204217|4.0|I hasten to note that I haven't read every word. My interest in the book is topical, that is certain subjects are of considerable interest. I discovered a writer who has a pointed and interesting attitude toward his subject. It stands him in good stead.<br /><br />What I think impresses me the most is his apparent eagerness to jump in and get  down to the basics. Pollan doesn't just study and write about his topics, he creates and experiences them up close. His reseach appears to be impeccable, and if readers don't always agree, it's clear that thats okay with Mr. Pollan. And that's as it should be.<br /><br />Diet and cooking and eating and nutrition are among the most important and controversial subjects of our time and Pollan doesn't hesitate. Whether you agree with him or not, an excellent product.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|When it comes to children's films, I'm a hard man to please.<br />If I was going by my rating I would give this film 3 stars, since it does not just hit you over the head with it's overtly environmental message so much as beat you unconscious with it. Then it stands over your prostate body and sings Taylor Swift songs as it bludgeons you to death. Even as your last breath escapes your lips, it reminds you to save the trees in the cheesiest, most blindingly in-your-face way.<br /><br />OK. Rant over. I promise.<br /><br />The fact is, The Lorax is a success. Why? Kids love it! And that's all there is to it. My younger brothers and sisters will watch this any time it comes on. The movie successfully captures the whimsy and wit of Dr. Seuss, without veering into weird territory (Horton Hears a Who). The visuals are bright and colorful, the songs are catchy and fun, and the characters are Seuss-y and funny. The voice work is excellent. Best, the humour is funny and constant without being crude or stupid. So for that, I say Dr. Seuss's The Lorax (overtly obvious environmental message aside) is a WIN. 4 Stars!<br /><br />Yay. You've had your fun and games. Let's get down to more serious topics.<br /><br />Does this film have a far, far darker, more hideous message? I think The Lorax is better seen, not as a whimsical children's musical, but as a chilling, Gilliam-esque dystopia. Oh yes...let me show you what I am talking about.<br /><br />This is the way I see The Lorax:<br />A young, enterprising man wanders the world in search of his calling. He ventures upon a pristine utopian valley where nature lives in harmony. He then proceeds to tear down and destroy everything that is good in that valley in the name of industry. He forms a bond with a mythical beast called the Lorax, whom he betrays and stabs in the back.<br /><br />The man becomes a billionaire through every one of the dirtiest tricks in the book. But when a global fuel crisis forces the man to halt his empire of industry, every living thing in the valley is forced to leave their home. They are never seen again. The man's global empire collapses, leaving him destitute and impoverished. He takes to a cottage, where he is never seen again for many years.<br /><br />Another young man sees his chance, and this is where it really gets disturbing. So far this story has had maybe a bit of Scarface in it - the rise and fall of an icon. It's a typical by-the-numbers sci-fi. But it's about to get a whole lot weirder.<br /><br />Fast-forward 50 years. Everybody is abnormally happy. They break into song, and, at times, the whole city knows the lyrics, suggesting perhaps a collective-thought transmitter. Or a lot of brainwashing. You see, this idyllic paradise slowly comes apart to reveal something unbelievably hideous. The people seem oblivious to their problems - children glowing green with radiation poisoning, terrible traffic accidents, and dangerous and daring underground rebels.<br /><br />The young man - now perhaps in his 70's (I deduce this by the fact that everyone - even people in their 50's have never seen trees, which makes the man at least 20 years older) looks unchanged through some radical plastic surgery, perhaps. He has trapped every known human being on the earth inside a walled city, where he feeds them bottled air. What else does he put in the air? How come nobody knows the truth?<br /><br />Commence a rebellion led by a young girl, a love-stricken boy who will do anything for that girl, an aged grandmother, and the ax-wielding former billionaire, that will strike the very foundations of the established order.<br /><br />...<br /><br />How's THAT for original? Anyways, The Lorax is a great kids movie that will keep them entertained and, hopefully, inform them that all life on Earth is precious. The critic in me wants to rate this film 3 stars or lower, but I do not think this is a film FOR critics. It's for the kids. And that is where it succeeds.<br /><br />4 Stars!s!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I enjoyed escaping into Sookie's world of misadventures up to this point. This book is just... I don't even know what to call it, it's just there and it's a disappointment.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment is that I thought I was reading the *last* book, it is not the actual last book, there's an upcoming epilogue book called After Dead that is supposed to reveal the happy ever afters and tell us what happens to everyone after the \\"last\\" book. I don't know why the epilogue is being sold as a separate book, but considering the last book was very short it really could have been all one book to properly finish the story.<br /><br />Everything about this book feels forced and some of it doesn't even make much sense. I'm assuming those \\"makes no sense\\" parts might be explained in the upcoming epilogue book, but I'm not sure I want to bother reading that one after reading this one and feeling so disappointed.<br /><br />That's not to say that I didn't enjoy the book, I certainly enjoyed hanging out with Sookie again, but it just felt like it was a different story path ... sort of as if I were reading a different trail in a choose your own adventure style book.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**********SPOILER ALERT**********SPOILER ALERT**********<br /><br />Sookie seems to write off the entire vampire world without so much effort as batting an eyelash. That was the focus of the majority of the series so it seems a bit odd that she's so okay with the whole transition into suddenly having nothing to do with vampires.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss faced a large dilemma when they created Sherlock: How do you make a 100-year-old character feel fresh, considering the record 300 previous portrayals, including a towering Jeremy Brett and a box-office breaking Robert Downey Jr? How do you make a show that diehard Sherlock fans will love, without alienating your modern audience?<br /><br />The answer? Start with a deep respect for the character. Then add the guts to go somewhere new and do something different. Then get the sharpest, most talented writers around - Steven Moffat ([[ASIN:B003KH46GO Blink]]) and Mark Gatiss (Agatha Christie's Poirot). Compose a brilliant score, make the cinematography fresh and dynamic, and film in London - the London of chrome, glass, lights, and smokey streets. Add to that the finest Sherlock alive - the incomparable and utterly brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch, and the loyal Watson, played by an actor of incredible talent - Martin Freeman. Surround them by the finest character actors in the BBC, and stir. Add to that brilliant stories with their mix of Easter eggs and nods to the originals, and original, exciting, riveting, and action-packed plotlines. Lastly, add colorful characters - a Lestrade - dogged and determined, an Irene Adler of impossible deviousness and manipulation, and finally, a villain of endless reach and influence, a villain whose psychopathy and unpredictability know no bounds...Moriarty! Enjoy.<br /><br />And that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is how to craft the smartest, the most ingenious, the most Holmesian show to be had. The British Broadcasting Company presents Steven Moffat's and Mark Gatiss's SHERLOCK.<br /><br />Strongest Recommendation. 5 Stars!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It is exactly what I needed. Holds my 60D (with battery pack), 4 lenses, flash, and multiple other accessories!!! I still haven't filled it up! Its comfortable and sturdy. I am extremely happy with my purchase!
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|You'll have to forgive me. I don't &#34;gush&#34; about movies, ever, and I am not in the habit of rating action movies or superhero movies with 5 stars. But my choice to rate Man of Steel so highly is not my own. Well actually, it is my own. But it was my own several weeks ago, when I saw Man of Steel in the cinema.<br /><br />Below is what I wrote, or rather, transcribed, as the words flowed from my fingers through the keyboard. This is a moment captured in time, written several hours after I saw the film. They are my thoughts on the film before I had a chance to think it over, to contemplate it, to read what the critics thought.<br /><br />These were my INITIAL feelings on Man of Steel:<br /><br />  &#34;WOW! Now THIS is how to do a Superman movie! For once, a film that lives up to the hype! For once, a film that makes Superman compelling, relateable, and conflicted. Sure, it's nothing like the comics! There's little humour, less warmth, and Superman is given the Dark Knight treatment (and proves that he can stand up to it, unlike some other superheroes. Marc Webb, I am looking directly at you (Thanks for ruining The Amazing Spider-Man)). But the entire cast gives stunning roles: Crowe and Costner manage the weightier bits with ease, Cavill is perfect (mastering the human side and the super side of Kal-El, and looking the part 100%), Adams is good, but feels underutilized. Shannon oozes menace and quivering rage, and Lane is great too.<br /><br />  The villains are a real menace, with Shannon managing to keep up with Terrence Stamp (a very hard act to follow), and the other Kryptonians providing muscle and real danger. For once, Superman feels vulnerable and weak compared to these machines of war. This is superhero fighting without arrows, webs, batarangs, or hammers. This is superheroes fighting down and dirty, mano el mano. Matrix style, with less kung fu and bullet time.<br /><br />  The action is grand, gritty, and intense. The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and blood-rousing! Nolan appears to be keeping Snyder's wilder side grounded (No ramping! No super--slow motion!). The result is a large, sprawling, and weighty Superman movie. Where Iron Man 3 was perfect popcorn Marvel entertainment, Man of Steel strives for something greater. It does not always reach it, but when it does, the result is truly incredible.<br /><br />THIS! IS! SUPERMAN! 4.5 Stars!&#34;<br /><br />Woah. Check that out. I really WAS gushing. I was using ALL-CAPS and exclamation marks. I inserted a slightly cheesy Zack Snyder joke. I must not have been in my right mind.<br /><br />And I wasn't.<br /><br />The film had overwhelmed me. There was just too much to comprehend. My brain was still in awe from booming Zimmer music, darkly comedic and completely awesome one-liners, gigantic all-destroying setpieces, and the sight of two Spandex-clad superheroes throwing punches that would level a city.<br /><br />If I was to rate the film now, I would probably give it 4 stars, not 5. I see now, why critical reception has been mixed. There is an absence of strong female characters. The plot is jumbled and does not always work. What on earth was up with hologram Jor-El? There is just TOO much CGI city destruction (and you though Transformers was bad), and the casual attitude in which superheroes destroy gigantic buildings, most likely killing thousands, is, well, sickening. And Superman does something completely unlike Superman - he kills.<br /><br />Man of Steel is, like Zack Snyder's 300, a relatively simple minded affair. A film where you leave your brain at the door. Lots of action, lots of six-packs, a lot of punching, and not many female characters.<br />And like 300, the action is superb and intense and gritty, the six-packs are present, the punching is awesome, and the result is an epic (I say this in the truest sense of the word) action superhero film.<br /><br />I repeat my praise for the actors. I felt Henry Cavill turned in a (literal) towering performance. Michael Shannon was a quivering, bellowing mass of rage. Superman's two dads are perfect. Both Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner moved me to (metaphorical) tears with &#34;You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders,&#34; and pretty much anything Costner said. Seriously, Costner was TERRIFIC!<br /><br />You may pine for the simplicity and the charm of Superman I, and Christopher Reeves' dimple and forelock. I certainly pined for the criminally underrated Superman Returns (don't kill me for it, please, please, please), since it captured the Big Blue Boy Scout side of Superman. But Man of Steel is in a category of it's own.<br /><br />It is not a wholly seamless film. It has many, many problems. But I ask you to overlook that, and see the greatness beyond. I feel the words of Jor-El are appropriate in describing Man of Steel: It stumbles, it falls. But in time, it accomplishes WONDERS.<br /><br />The result is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've reconsidered and realized this movie is a giant disappointment.<br />P.S. Go easy on the dislike button for my past self's sake. He didn't know what he was doing. I'm just following orders...Please..please!vin Costner moved me to (metaphorical) tears with &#34;You will give the people an ideal to strive towards.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Having seen The Walking Dead seasons 1 and 2, season 3 was incredible! However, without watching the earlier seasons, this latest season would lose some of its entertainment value.<br /><br />Season 3 further built the characters, showing their toughness amidst the world changing around them. There was enough action to satisfy the intent of the show, yet, enough drama to add a delightful human touch to the show.
B009IJJ712|4.0|Elementary is the latest TV adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes characters. But unlike BBC's Sherlock (an excellent show also starring the sleuth), Elementary, character names aside, bears absolutely NO resemblance to the original stories.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes is now a tattooed, recovering heroin addict living in New York.<br />John Watson is now Jane Watson, a female doctor helping Holmes get off his drug addiction.<br />Tobias Gregson is now a New Yoyka detective.<br />And I'm not even going to tell you how they butchered and defiled the characters of Irene Adler and Moriarty in the name of originality.<br /><br />The plots bear no resemblance to Conan Doyle's writings, which allows the Elementary to go into complete original territories. And sometimes they go too far, which alienates hardcore Sherlock Holmes fans like me.<br /><br />But wait - you're getting the impression that this is a bad show! Well, it isn't. The cast is damn fine, especially Johnny Lee Miller as the impossible detective, who turns in an impressive and, at times, emotional performance. Lucy Liu pulls her weight, and Adrian Quinn is typically good. I have reservations about Natalie Dormer, but she is a solid actress who has played some fine roles recently. I am waiting on Season 2 eagerly to see more.<br /><br />The show is original, with fine production value. The characters are entertaining and realistic. While I do wish there was more of the actual hands-on crime-solving that Holmes has become famous for (grovelling around with magnifying glasses, using small envelopes to pick up cigarette ash, etc.), and indeed some actual crime-fighting (nowhere near the Downey Jr. heights, but at least some hand-to-hand combat), the sleuth's impressive cerebral capabilities are on full display here.<br /><br />So in conclusion, Elementary all but destroys the mythology of Sherlock Holmes that came before it, and the stories bear no resemblance to the originals that we have all come to know and love. So it's weakest point is also it's strongest. The show has a fine cast, who all turn in good performances, and the series is entertaining, original, and fun to watch.<br /><br />I was introduced to Elementary by the Super Bowl ads. A friend nearby said, \\"Oh yes, Elementary. It's a good show, yeah...it's a good show.\\"<br />And a \\"good show\\" is how I would describe it. Not great, like BBC's Sherlock (but that is an impossible comparison) but definitely worth your time watching it.<br /><br />Recommended highly! 4.1 Stars.<br /><br />P.S. Check out BBC's Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. In my opinion it is the finest TV out there right now. I eagerly await the third season!<br />P.P.S.

B00CXQL828|4.0|Artist:  The Winery Dogs<br />Title:  The Winery Dogs<br />Label:  Loud & Proud Records<br />Release Date:  July 23, 2013<br /><br />Your mom was right, first impressions really do count.  And your first impression of the self titled release from the Winery Dogs should be `Wow! These are some great songs' followed by the almost equally important second impression of `Damn! These guys can really play'.  Well of course these guys can play.  The Winery Dogs are Richie Kotzen, Mike Portnoy, and Billy Sheehan.  Three musical titans whose collective resume includes Talas, Dream Theater, David Lee Roth, Poison (wtf), Mr. Big, Avenged Seven Fold, and so many side collaborations that a simple internet search could shut down Google for a week.<br /><br />But back to the tunes!  The Winery Dogs members have achieved well deserved acclaim in genres where the number and speed of the notes played is the song, in this vibrant collection, the song writing, arrangements, and vibe take the limelight.  Here in the new age of the super group, we've seen Them Crooked Vultures get a little too artsy for their own good and witnessed the impressive phoning it in of Black Country Communion.  None of that is evident here.  The Dogs have a potent mix of amped up R&B, 70's gas pedal rockers, and stripper (or exotic dancer, depending on your budget) approved grinding.  Hell, even the sprinkled in ballads didn't have me reaching for the flush valve.  `Elevate' is as good of an album opener as there ever was!  It could make Glenn Hughes and Hanson equally envious of the skill sets used in the writing and riffing.<br /><br />But what about the notes, you ask?  Don't worry; there are a million of them on display.  This three headed dog has too many chops not play like it has rabies.  `Not Hopeless' and `Time Machine' are clinics on technical playing skills but don't sound like meth addled fax machines with Turrets' Syndrome.  Like the best bands of our youth, The Winery Dogs can navigate subtle stylistic shifts without sounding like frauds.  `One More Time' moves cheerfully into Little Feat territory while `The Dying' will have your girlfriend slithering around on the hood of your Rolls Royce while the dry ice creeps and the Bic lighters sway.<br /><br /> Lyrically, The Winery Dogs, stay consistently soulful and won't ever bum you out with vision of post apocalyptic hellscapes.  Kudos to the boys for that!  This album is must have material for fans of familiar rock leanings searching for new songs. And, yes, it really is all about the songs.<br /><br />For fans of King's X, Aerosmith, Mr. Big, Steve Salas, Travers, Trower, Kim Mitchell.<br /><br />Dave Buzard<br />BigsmileMagazine.com

0684824906|5.0|This is the best biography I've read to date. My colleague J Forrest told me this is the top book on leadership. My words that follow are more a report on Lincoln the leader than a critique of Doris Kearns Goodwin the author. That said, Goodwin has written a volume with the texture of a novel, filled with scenic details and perceptive insights into the complex interrelationships among Lincoln's family, friends, cabinet and generals. The 757 pages passed with ease. This is a great book.<br /><br />Lincoln seems an improbable president. Born in poverty and confronted with multiple miseries, setbacks and failures, he came to reunite a divided nation. Using stealth and skill to engineer an upset Republican nomination, Lincoln persuaded the emotionally bruised rivals he bested (William Seward, Salmon Chase and Edward Bates) to take key cabinet positions after he won the election of 1860. He later placed Edwin Stanton, a man who humiliated Lincoln when he was an Illinois lawyer, into the key position of Secretary of War. These actions were misinterpreted by some Easterners as the folly of an inept Western rube, but in time the nation and his fractious cabinet came to see that Lincoln was the indispensable person.<br /><br />Critics point out that Lincoln made political and military mistakes and openly displayed prejudice and racism during the Lincoln-Douglas debates in the 1850s. These counts are true. Lincoln also bent the truth at times. The author clearly idealizes Lincoln and gives short shrift to his faults. At the same time, a skilled historical biographer looks at a person within the context of their times and does not judge them through the lens of the current age. Additionally, all leaders make mistakes, particularly in times of crisis.<br /><br />From what I read in this book, Lincoln seems to be a proto-pragmatists, the distinctive American philosophy that is well rendered in \\"The Metaphysical Club.\\" Lincoln was able to balance Idealism with what could be done and what he knew at the time. As facts and conditions changed, Lincoln changed. His signature talent seemed to be an ability to learn, create and grow. His virtues were many, including: integrity, wisdom, empathy, forgiveness, friendliness, storytelling, logic and the long view.<br /><br />The question of why Lincoln became such a great leader is the most intriguing issue in my mind. Team of Rivals gives hints. Overcoming traumatic early life can give some people the skills to deal with great difficulties later on, and Goodwin paints a bleak early life for Lincoln. He transformed himself through books, contemplation of higher ideals, work, friendship and humor. Lincoln's time as a lawyer riding the circuit seems important as well, providing experiences that displayed a full range of human nature. Lincoln's circuit riding days also put him in daily contact with the best and brightest in Illinois, attorneys he would argue against during the day and share stories, jokes and philosophies with at night. Lincoln abstained from tobacco and alcohol, indicating self control and independence of mind. The most interesting clue to his leadership ability was Lincoln's belief, contrary to the popular opinion of the times, that there is no afterlife, and that the only way a person can live on is through great deeds that earn the respect and memory of future generations. Lincoln sought a great struggle to give meaning and purpose to his life. The Civil War provided the great act he was seeking and it also ended his life. But Lincoln's memory lives on.<br /><br />When I visited the Hart Senate Building in DC, a painting of Lincoln hung in then Senator Obama's reception area. History connects these two men. Team of Rivals also gives new meaning to my visits to Springfield, The Lincoln Memorial, Gettysburg, Jefferson's Monticello and the Southern White House in Richmond. The legacy of the Civil War still reverberates in American society and this book helps explain why.<br /><br />TeamOf Rivals is instructive and inspiring. It provides insight into America, democracy, politics, military strategy and the Civil War.  Most of all Team Of Rivals illuminates the amazing leadership of Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Here are some other biographical works I've enjoyed . . .<br /><br />[[ASIN:0374528497 The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America]]<br />[[ASIN:0965569934 Edison - A Biography]]<br />[[ASIN:B000VPKFRM Bill  &  Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company]]<br />[[ASIN:0143112449 Andrew Carnegie]]Of Rivals is instructive and inspiring.

B0078ZTWP4|3.0|Not bad for the price and works pretty good.  I wish that the instructions were written better, however.  They were a bit difficult to understand, but once I figured things out I had no problems.
B009KHCT94|5.0|Funny, and one of the best spoofs I have seen in years! The Nazis receive their just deserts, and good (and cute) triumphs over evil. We need more of this.
B00130UFY2|4.0|Amazon Instant Video is great for movies like this...they are cheap and easy to stream anywhere.  This story was much like the rest of the Bourne series, which is very good.  If you liked the others, you can't go wrong with this one.
B008D47DXC|5.0|This is a film I've loved since the 1980s.  I still watch it and still crack up every time.  Especially the scene in the blues hall.  It's just such a good time.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars is always fun to listen to; and this cd is a perfect way to get you moving and singing along.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|Absolutely amazing CD! These guys always deliver outstanding musicianship, composition, and quality.<br /><br />You definitely need to buy this for everyone you know!
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|My daughter is obsessed now that she's finally seen it!  She has also named her turtle Crush.  She loved it
0316228583|1.0|\\"A Casual Vacancy\\" was not what I expected from the talented author of Harry Potter.  I realized that this was her 1st attempt at adult literature but if this had been her 1st book, I doubt anyone would have read it or Harry Potter.  It was slow, crude, dark and long.  I listened to the audiobook on a long road trip.  After the 1st couple of disk, I kept thinking it would surely get better...it did not.  After getting approximately half way through the book, I felt I had invested so much time in it already that I had to finish it.  I kept trying to determine where she was going with the story and what was the point she was trying to make.  After 15 disk, I still did not see the point.<br />I have read all the Harry Potter books and watched all of the movies.  I believe Ms. Rowling is a talented writer but she missed the mark with \\"A Casual Vacancy\\".  I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a good book to read.  I only hope Ms. Rowling's future efforts are more successful in entertaining her fans and readers.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The emotions that this book is capable of drawing out of you is unbelievable. This is a book that everyone should read regardless of one's feelings towards zombies.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Nice story lines and solid acting. Special effects are nothing to write home about, and the professor's character is a little campy, but overall it's good enjoyable TV.
0380973634|5.0|I order this book because I wanted a hardcover edition for Neil Gaiman to sign at an event he was attending. I was worried it would not arrive in time, but it did and in great condition!
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|Movie has great graphics, but they fail to make characters worth caring about.<br /><br />Only moment is &#34;China Girl&#34;, this could have been a much better movie!
B000OXHRRC|3.0|This is a good movie to watch before visiting Southern France.<br />Generally a relaxing, comic relief sort of style.<br />The story line is not that realistic and at times seems too much of an exaggeration.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Please,please go back to Weather Channel before July 9.  This one can hardly be read for the current conditions.  I'm looking for a replace app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Am I allowed to give this a 10/5?<br /><br />I had to let TFiOS sit around in my brain over 24 hours before I could form a coherent post. I'm a John Green fan, but it took me forever to get around to reading this. I'm glad it took me awhile because I was able to see the reactions from others and think, \\"oh, come on...it can't really be THAT good.\\" It IS \\"THAT good.\\"<br /><br />I'm a masochist for sad storylines. TFiOS is told from the POV of 16 Y/O Hazel, a cancer patient who is in terribly poor condition. Her parents urge her to attend a local support group as a way to make friends. At one particular meeting, Hazel meets Augustus Waters. Augustus lost a leg due to a previous bout with cancer, but seemed otherwise healthy. As would be expected-the two fall in love. --That wasn't a spoiler...come on.<br /><br />Without giving away too much, I will say that TFiOS is heartbreaking, hilarious, and still shows a realistic view of what cancer does to the body. Hazel and Gus are both terribly optimistic given their circumstances. Their friend Isaac is also usually optimistic and frequently makes jokes at his own expense. What else are they supposed to do?<br /><br />But it is the ending. And some of the things that are said. ....but mostly that ending. Like I said, it took me a day to let the book boil over in my mind, but I'm still a blubbering mess just thinking about it. I highly recommend it to any late comers such as myself who may have not jumped on the train already. A movie is in the works and Hazel has already been cast, but I still want to nominate myself for the role...you know, just in case the actress has something come up and has to quit?
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Entertaining, great story line.  I've watched this movie several times and I really don't get tired of it.  Well worth the rental.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Second Time reading the trilogy....just as great as the first. Fast read. Captivating...feel like you're really there in th  story
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's best. I thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish. Highly recommend it for first-time readers or Flynn aficionados. Perfect!
B008Y78M60|4.0|This is a well written and well acted movie depicting the aftermath of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  The movie focuses primarily on the plight and trial of Mary Seurrat (sic) (Robin Wright).  A young lawyer (James McAvoy), who was a union soldier, reluctantly took on her case and the movie shows his attitude changing from indifference to passionate advocate for his client's rights under the Constitution of the United States.  The story illustrates what happens when constitutional rights are suspended for a trial by public opinion.
B002SHD9E2|1.0|Amazon Video does not support Dolby Digital Plus sound for movies and TV.<br />Netflix and Hulu Plus do. This should be a priority for you to fix.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|If your a true GEEK or Nerd then you will love this movie. Yeah there are flaws but come on who's perfect.
B00821OX98|1.0|Amazon Video does not support Dolby Digital Plus sound for movies and TV.<br />Netflix and Hulu Plus do. This should be a priority for you to fix.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The enhancements are great. This is a really fun game for the whole family!!!  We love it!  Make the purchase.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Incredible heart warming story! Put on my all time favorite list ! Very sad - but very inspirational as well!
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I chose 2 stars because it really wasn't what I expected, or rather not what I was hoping for.<br />Although it was quite funny in places, the use of \\"F-bombs\\" was so unnecessary. I lost count how many of them they used. The family dynamics were awful! Such disrespect from the children. Also, being a mother of four, married almost 16 years, and almost 40 ... I couldn't relate. Can you believe it?! I really thought it would be closer to reality, because let's face it real life is funny. This was not.
0785153942|2.0|just don't expect the younger set to find it interesting, concepts are far too adult for most.<br /><br />would have been nice to seem more historical background especially why giant robots vs monsters was better than shore mounted defensive weapons, they had reverted to building walls that didn't seem to hold up very well. and why fight monsters who swim in water in the ocean with robots who walk? too many logical inconsistencies could have been explained with some creative vision.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|While this was a ok movie, it just seemed to lack the quality and seemed at times to sort of drag along, like the producer just did not have a true direction and level of action associated with Arnold. It's watchable, but no where near the quality of past movies.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|The main characters remained bloody the entire movie while all other victims were cleaned up. The young Lucas was superb and should have been nominated for an award.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|This is a fascinating story. It is backed up by medical documentation.  It's refreshing to read something on this subject that is not from a Christian point of view. What I found interesting is that all of her afterlife story occurred while she was technically brain dead.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|excellent game for that price so cheap, I recommend it to every fan of this saga. excellent graphics, good story and memorable characters further.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I think this is the best show currently available.  It's hard for me to wait for each new episode to become available on Amazon.
B002KKCVVO|4.0|I bought these for the beach and salt water. Got a blister on my Achilles heel the second day I wore them but I think I may have had some sand in there. They are nothing special, probably have to replace them next year.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love books like this. They just suck you in and make you feel like your in the book. I read all of these books in less then a week, that's how much I liked them.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|more dynamic than season 1, extra wit, and extra appeal. definitely a good watch that keeps things interesting as always.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive but very fun I wish the time between the pause and game was longer but this US a very fun game
B008EEWN6I|3.0|not his best album but im still a huge fan of him and system of the down. i didnt even recieve this album to honest with you i totally forgot i ordered this. hmm ???
B00821OX98|2.0|I just didn't care about the characters. They were flat, no real development. Visual affects were not believable. I'm glad I had other choices.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I use it to hold both my Dell work laptop and my personal iMac Pro in separate compartments and still have plenty of room for my other needs.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I was too busy to sit and watch this well written show, when season 1 first came out. Still busy but have to take a break for my  BB time.
B007U2ABXM|5.0|Musically, the album is both a return to and expansion of the sounds that Smith achieves in many of her classic albums.  It's a significant addition to her catalog and stands well alongside her best work of the 70s.
B00992CF6W|2.0|The maps are extremely tiny and if you dig to deep you fall through the map. Also you don't get many tools, can't craft or use the furnace in creative.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This show is amazing! Don't miss one episode!<br />I bought all of the seasons and can't wait for Season 8 to start.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|It's great at the beginning , but in like 3 days they suspend your account and it gets frustrating because you loss all your followers not good for kindle fire hd . Kinda lame you also can't follow anyone it sucks but just don't get this app for kindle fire hd
B000W93CHC|5.0|Really long book, totally worth the time. It's an amazing book. All I really can say is wow. Just wow.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I bought this for one reason only, and that is it had the original theatrical version.  This is the one I first saw, and the one I watched repetitively throughout the 1980's on cable movie channels.  I am in no way slamming the new cuts, which on their own are excellent.  Nevertheless, I wanted to be able to watch the original even with its campy noir narration.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK it defiantely is a must read, it teaches you things about life and it is very inspiring.
0891419063|5.0|I first heard of Eugene Sledge when I saw HBO's  &#34;The Pacific&#34;.  His book is utterly amazing.  I highly recommend reading this one with Robert Leckie's &#34;Helmet for My Pillow&#34;.  Sledge tells his story with the eye of a keen, almost scientific observation, that in spite of its cold description does not obscure the horrors of the Pacific war.  Leckie in contrast has the heart of a poet, his writing is rich and distinct on its own for a clear picture of what these men gave and lost.  Both books should be read and re-read.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Mastodon have so many good albums, every time they put one out I wonder if they can top the last one. I can't say that Crack The Skye is better than Blood Mountain, but it is a great album. The vocals get triple teamed on the opener Oblivion and then the banjo led second track Divinations kicks major butt as well. The four part The Czar is actually well written and of course these guys can play. Having been tagged prog metal or even stoner metal, Mastodon is actually becoming sort of a Leviathan. I haven't seen major publications like Rolling Stone cover too many metal bands, but they seem to dote over Mastodon. Which is awesome. For a metal band these guys sell a lot of cd's and their concerts are packed. No Mastodon album is better than the last but any.time they drop an album, it is better than pretty much anything else that has come out. Every decade has it's most important or influential band and personally I think Mastodon is better than just about every other metal band of the last decade ( except High on Fire). Crack The Skye is another excellent release. I have ordered The Hunter and cannot wait to hear it. Check this album out. Four of the best musicians on the planet
B004FN1T3A|5.0|This is a birth preparation program that I later learned is being used around the world. This book is just the textbook that you receive when you sign up for the class, so borrow it from the library or a friend if you're on the fence about joining the class. I took the class after a friend explained that hypnotism sounds weird or strange, but it's not. We spend a good part of our day in self-hypnosis.When we watch tv, drive, or just plain &#34;zone out&#34; we are in a state of hypnosis.  In fact ALL hypnosis is self-hypnosis. No one is going to come to your birth, your birth companion (husband, or mom, ect) is going to attend the class with you and learn how to help you by reading scripts, messaging in ways that help you relax and just being the support during labor you wish for. I had a c-section with my first, and epidural gone wrong with the second and when I had my third I found HypnoBirthing and had him and my 4th using the techniques taught by HypnoBirthing. My last two experiences were the amazing wonderful experiences every mother dreams of. I easily got up after birth and showered then went and saw my fourth baby in the nursery! I was tired, but not bedridden. Instructors are more than happy to answer questions and sign you up for a class. There is a world wide instructor directory at HypnoBirthing.com
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I was excited to see this app, since my kids and I just adore minions. However, this one is a big disappointment. To start, the 11.6 mb file  size is misleading. It downloads a bunch more after you install it, totaling just over 30 mb. Next, it's loaded with in-app purchases. You won't be able to enjoy the full effect of the game unless you're willing to spend quite a bit of cash on this free app. Finally, I found the gameplay to be clunky, slow, and frustrating. Not as responsive as similar games. Long delay between runs. You want an endless runner game, just play Temple Run 1 or 2. The only redeeming quality here, for me at least, is the adorable minions. I had really hoped for a game that lived up to the awesomeness of the minions... sigh.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is hilarious. I TRULY enjoyed it. Very entertaining. And now I make others read it too! Just READ IT.
B00E00P5JC|5.0|This movie is FUN! AWESOME! ACTION PACKED! it has everything<br />that kids and adults would want in an animated movie.<br /><br />I took my daughter last night to see this and we both loved it!<br />It was awesome, in our words, and fun to be a part of!<br /><br />There are times when we could just simply yawn or be quiet<br />while watching a movie that people may say it was so-so, but<br />this one was simply not like that! I had tears while laughing<br />and it sure applies to all of us!!!<br /><br />go take your kids to see this, you will NOT be sorry!<br />I cannot wait for the blind buy of this combo already!!<br /><br />=)<br />highly recommended!!!
0385349947|3.0|A little too academic, feels like it was weitten as a thesis for one od those leadership doctoral programs.  But I'm not a woman.
B0084ANCBC|5.0|I really wasn't ready for this to be so good.  I saw the movie but the book is way better than the film.
B002KGEORM|5.0|The show really keeps you coming back for more. Every episode that you have seen makes you anticipate the next episode.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|I'm an undergrad science student. I read this book whenever I feel a bit less motivated than usual... And it always cheers me up without a single failure!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Nice battery app that does everything it claims. Great app to have on your device. Always alerts me when battery is almost drained. Shows how long the charge will take to bring it back up to 100% Very accurate.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|JJ Abrams inventive and keen eye for direction in film is shown front an center in this film. Reinvigorating a franchise that had only been able live through several movies in the 80s. The plot is engaging, the use of the camera is amaxing, and the characters you know and love are allowed to really shine through here. A GREAT BUY.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Streaming is really good.  I have been looking for some place to watch all of the episodes of the original series in order.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|What a Great book from start to  finish. The best of the 10 lee child's books I have read so far.
B003E20ZQA|4.0|I found this fascinating because of the period in the 60s it covers, living in the Chelsea Hotel and being around some of the names we all know from then. Also interesting to see the development of Pattie from Poet to Rock Star. Well written and holds attention right through.
0385360177|4.0|I have listened to this cd twice to make sure I follow their romance.  I like being able to back ie up and hear it again.  I can relate.  The delivery of my purchce was fast and easy. I opened it as soon as I could to get taken to another world.

0385360185|5.0|Love changes people.  So glad I decided to get the tapes instead of reading the book. I can relax and drift into a world that makes my liver quiver!!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Now that my regular shows are not airing this is a good filler for the time being.  Entertaining and not brainless sitcom with lots of good drama.  Very surprised!

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|If you enjoy season 1 you'll love season 2. The acting is better, the characters deeper and the chemistry between characters richer. The season finale alone is worth watching the other 15 episodes that lead up to it.
B000W967UQ|5.0|Death is a delightful character. Very happy Mr. Pratchett painted him in such anthropomorphic color!! Kind of takes the sting out of the grim reaper in a fun and really &#34;can't put down&#34; romp.
0684857219|4.0|This bible here is a great compilation of vast amounts of information that Arnold has acquired over his lifetime. What is contained within this book is not just wisdom, but also the mind and soul of Arnold himself. The book covers a vast range of subjects - from the very philosophy of life, to the philosophy of bodybuilding, to specific exercises, to training programs and nutrition, to name only a few.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|i found this to be boring. The trailer certainly looked great, but oh my the movies was bad. It was action, in spots, and the villain was not believable at all. The villain almost had superpowers, he survived cyanide? Superman could but a human? Well the plot sickens, not very much of a story at all, and there should have been. The destruction of Bonds house was not believable either, Bond has a shotgun against 11 or so men with machine guns, yeah bond will win this one. The worst thing that could have been done was to destroy the Aston Martin DB9, what was the purpose of that? I could not watch the whole movie in one sitting, and I am too stubborn to not finish the movie, so I did, and i would have been happier to have NOT finished the movie. Once again another modern day movie that trades a story for violence and stupid effects.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its a fun game and I enjoyed playing it. It really makes you think. I am anxiously awaiting for more.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|A very cleverly written story of love, loss, devotion, family ties, religious connections, nationality. The development and connections of characters were creatively woven. I really enjoyed this book.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Although occasionally predictable, Suits has interesting story lines, rich characters, good twists. A worthy watch. Like how they bridge the generational gap.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Resent change of format of the add is horrible.  It is hard to see any forecast between all of the advertising. Designers change it into many making scheme, rather than information add. Do not buy it. Impossible and unpleasant to use. I am deleting the add and getting another. To bad I use to like this app a lot.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I talk about this movie to everyone I know. Since watching this movie it's been super hard for me to go out to eat. I find myself questioning where the meat comes from, if it's organic, etc. I think everyone in the world should watch this video. The way the big businesses treat the poor animals we see as harmless creatures is so awful. Support local farmers and buy organic meats! :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed each chapter switching from one character to the other...really kept you wondering what was going on..highly recommend this read!

B0069JBKHI|1.0|I bought this premium baby monitor a few months back, thinking that a high baby monitor would be backed by decent technical support (if needed). And boy was I wrong..<br />I woke up the other day to find my baby somehow got hold of the wire & ripped it. So I contacted Withings support. For starters they have no phone number, can't they cough up a 2-3 member support staff for the dozens of products they offer. So I tried e-mail support which took them 6 days to respond -6 DAYS-.<br />After 6 days they responded with the following:<br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />My advise would be that you get one by yourself, here are the specs:<br /><br />- 2 amps output<br />- 5 V output<br />- micro-USB connector<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />   Withings<br />Turn on your well-being<br /><br />I contacted Withings because I wanted a OEM replacement, they didn't say they don't offer replacements, they just say go to Amazon. I bought a Withings product that why I'm contacting Withings!!! Shame on you Withings for not offering even half decent support with the high end products you sell.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this season is so good, but definitely lets you know the good guys don't always win!  Loved all three seasons and looking forward to the 4th.  SO nice that it is on PRIME.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it the most,my only complaint is that it should have an update for free that would add horses,dogs,and cats,as the PC version does!! It should be exactly like the PC version only on mobile devices so you can have all around fun!!!!!!!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|A story about the south. Liked the setting, a Plantation, slaves and how bad they were treated. It did have a good ending. Easy to understand. It seemed realistic considering it was a look at History.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Loved the story and the visuals.  Had to watch it again to really get the meaning...especially the end.  Thank you Ang Lee!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's love this game! I like  fighting the knight!Come and buy it!<br />REMEMBER TO LEP!! :) Get  it then tell your friends!<br />Go to the wistem tree.
B00C061I3K|4.0|Glad to see Daft Punk changing and adding new sounds which really improves their sound and brings it up to date for the newer generation.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is pretty fun to get on this game because you get to play with random people or friends
B005ES5Y4U|5.0|The fit is a little trimmer than regular crocs.  The heel strap tends to pull your foot forward, but it stretches out easily.  Overall they're still roomy and comfy, just prettier and more grown up than regular crocs, if you can call a pink rubber Mary Jane shoe grown up.  They're cute!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Slapstick combined with satire, cloaked around a decent adventure/thriller.  Well, perhaps more a comedy thriller.  I sincerely hope I can get to 100 and have the stories to tell of the hero in this excellent novel!  Buy it.
B00ACP3OOM|2.0|The product delivers - you can hear tunes while you swim; the clarity and fidelity is really quite amazing.  The issue with Finis has been and continues to be product reliability.  Over the years I have bought the entire line of this product, starting from the very first model.  In every case, the product failed, usually within warranty. There were various problems, ranging from broken membranes, software issues, battery problems, etc.  I estimate that in this time they have replaced about 8 of these units; I had to purchase an additional 5.  That qualifies as an appalling failure rate.  In this case, I loaded my songs and charged the unit.  It worked fine; the readout screen is a nice touch, but is only really useful to let you know that the unit is on (the prior units had very dim LED's that simply were unreadable in bright light.  Great if you swim in a cave; terrible if you swim in a bright pool).  I swam with the unit for a few hours, then attempted to recharge it.  No dice.  The unit simply would not charge, and the computer would not recognize the unit (it charges via USB).  I called them, went through the mandatory attempts to correct the problem, but it didn't work.  I suspect that this is not an isolated problem; I was told that they have had similar problems with the initial batch of these.  While it was a pain to have to pack it up and ship it off, they did replace it with very little hassle - this time.  My prior experiences were sometimes not so pleasant.  Finis - if you are reading this, get your act together.  This is a great product, but your reliability is just plain terrible.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Great story on story told by him and her - just shows how people's views of their lives and times and so affected by their backgrounds.  Loved the twist in the tail.  An honest look at the difficulty of maintaining a long relationship.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This novel was both funny and deeply insightful about what makes life worth living and how we each have to define that for ourselves.  Tough subjects handled with grace.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved this tale of a man who's lost the plot and belatedly realises he needs to get involved in life.  His journey through England gives the hero hope and at times leads him to despair, set among the roads, lanes and fields of and between English villages and cities.  A story of love and friendship.
B009IJJ712|5.0|What started out at first glance as your run-of-the-mill CBS procedural eventually bloomed into one of the most beautifully written character studies on television.  The care that has been taken in crafting Holmes & Watson and their iconic friendship is incredible, and Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are masterful in those roles.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Everyone loves a love story, particularly when it's full of preposterous difficulties and absurd characters.  The Asperger's perspective on life can be so endearing...
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|From the first, seemingly-perfect murder, I Am Pilgrim is an unstoppable thrill-ride deep into the world of secret espionage, terrorism, greed, lust and murder.<br />The complexities of human nature are examined as Terry Hayes takes readers on an international cat and mouse game and introduces you to a cast of indisputable characters, including the tortured soul of a man who technically does not exist. He's known only by the codename Pilgrim.<br />This is THE thriller book of 2013 and one ride I didn't want to get off!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Just download it tonight so far it's fun. Four year old son loves the character. It's a lot like Temple Run.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|First things first, the visuals and cinematography in this movie are outstanding. The world looks pretty damn real blending cgi with real locations and I want that swimming pool at Jack's home base. Again fantastic stuff that you should expect from good sci-fi, but the story and dialogue itself are decent and at points seem repetitive. But it wasn't enough for me to lose interest and I recommend a rental before purchasing.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|An enjoyable sequel to the original Upstairs Downstairs.  Same house, different servants, different owners, and different problems.<br />Well worth watching.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|When I'm not at home and on the run, I can easily pull it up on my kindle :) love it
B001NHNG64|2.0|** spoiler alert ** I liked the first Jack Reacher book but Die Trying was a mess. ***Warning Spoilers***. Very little worked for me in this book. A kidnapped FBI agent keeps escaping from an escape proof room and they keep just putting her back in it. What?!? Reacher keeps escaping, keeps getting caught and the bad guys still don't kill him. Ok, that's a thriller trope, I can live with that, but it's pretty extreme in here.. None of the FBI agents behave like you would expect an FBI agent to. We can't send in the military, 8 Marines aren't enough against a 100 militia wackos so lets sneak in 3 FBI agents wearing suits. Really? Child leaves open loops about mass suicide and women wanting to escape the compound. Finally, it's a .50 caliber, not half inch. Militia members would know that so Child comes off sounding like a neophyte.
B004WKI204|3.0|I liked it, I didn't love it. I was expecting much more laugh out loud moments, but it was more just a memoir/ tips on how to be a successful business woman. I didn't struggle to get through it, but I wasn't excited to read the next chapter either.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|\\"Staged Fright\\" goes at a million miles a minute and never lets up. There's a compelling mystery at the center of the story, the twists and turns of which would be enough for a good book. There's also an interesting family dynamic which would make an interesting book with even a flimsy plot. But then there's also hackers and musical geniuses, Laura Ashley wearing pot dealers, terrorists, germ warfare, militias, and a lot of sports cars.<br /><br />There's an original tone to the book, balancing between thriller and comedy. Most reviews would refer to this process as delicate, but delicacy is for other books. The line between them is pounded, flipped, and hopped over in a way I've never seen in a book. It is this sheer abuse of the genres that makes \\"Staged Fright\\" delightful. It's revels in an \\"everything but the kitchen sink-- no wait, let's throw a couple kitchen sinks in there\\" approach to story telling. Instead of getting messy, it's just a lot of fun.<br /><br />I think that all of the extra subplots and details would have spun out of control without the nicely plotted mystery at the center of the story. Each developing clue is a pleasant surprise, leading to a satisfying climax. All of it is played out by a cast of characters that are wonderfully over-the-top, with the kinds of resumes that would blow your mind and enough personal quirks to make Napoleon Dynamite blush. And yet the characters are still sympathetic and warm.<br /><br />Wildly energetic, well plotted, and a lot of fun, read \\"Staged Fright\\" when you need a real escape from reality.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great fun a must have. Have been playing for a few months have not lost interest. If looking for a good time killer you have found it.
B00DHNB5CY|2.0|Although the acting was excellent, this movie in no way compares to the original classic. This version takes itself much too seriously and is more comparable to every other slasher movie. It has little or none of the charm of the original, and the higher production values only take away from it. Would have preferred the story stuck closer to the original. Also, the lighting in this version sucked. It was too dark most of the time to see much of anything. The lighting in the original was brighter and actually much more eery. The original series was a real classic and one of my favorites. This one just didn't cut it for me, and I would not recommend.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|This could have been an excellent film however it was more about floating the Colorado than it was about the canyon. The real turn off was the flagrant attempt to make the film about climate change and how bad we americans are when it come to caring about our environment. Many factual errors in it to justify an agenda.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|This book is very well researched and brings to light many historical misconceptions that as a person who has read many history books on WWll and the lead up to the war changed my mind about many of the personalities in the book.

B0066W1AZK|5.0|Loved it! Haven't beat the computer yet but I won't give up until I do!  Entertaining and challenging! Can't wait to show my friends my new skills and strategies
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game. Had fun playing with my boys. I just wish there were more rooms to explore. Can't wait for the developers to program more of them.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|best game ever the first time i played but i was not sur  but latter on i was like i have to keep going
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence's performance is the primary reason to watch this movie.  The story and other performances were good, but you find yourself longing for Lawrence's character to be back on the screen.
140006922X|1.0|It is significant that the author is a Shiite; as a minority sect, Shiites are more practiced in the deliberate misrepresentation of their faith. The author claims to be a \\"follower of Christ\\" -- notice he does not say a Christian -- but he is, in fact, a Muslim, and the book is nothing more than a collection of blasphemies presented by Mohammedans for centuries. There is nothing new, nothing historical, and nothing worth wasting your time (or money) on here.<br /><br />Abu Ad-Darda best summarized this book, when he said: \\"We smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them.\\" If you need this kind of recreation, read _The Passover Plot_. At least it's entertaining and doesn't pretend to be a serious history.
B001DPDVE8|5.0|wish they continued stargate movies...we need more scifi good movies and have more young people inspired to pursue scientific majors...
140006922X|1.0|Liberal media love new Jesus book 'Zealot', fail to mention author is Muslim<br /><br />By John S. Dickerson<br />Published July 24, 2013<br />FoxNews.com<br /><br />Reza Aslan, author of the new book, \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" has been interviewed on a host of media outlets in the last week. Riding a publicity wave, the book has surged to #2 on Amazon's list.<br /><br />Media reports have introduced Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim.<br /><br />His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio.<br /><br />  \\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years.<br /><br />Aslan is not a trained historian. Like tens of thousands of us he has been formally educated in theology and New Testament Greek.<br /><br />He is a bright man with every right to hold his own opinion about Jesus--and to proselytize his opinion.<br /><br />As a sincere man, Aslan's Muslim beliefs affect his entire life, including his conclusions about Jesus. But this is not being disclosed. \\"Zealot\\" is being presented as objective and scholarly history, not as it actually is--an educated Muslim's opinions about Jesus and the ancient Near East.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years. Its conclusions are long-held Islamic claims--namely, that Jesus was a zealous prophet type who didn't claim to be God, that Christians have misunderstood him, and that the Christian Gospels are not the actual words or life of Jesus but \\"myth.\\"<br /><br />These claims are not new or unique. They are hundreds of years old among Muslims. Sadly, readers who have listened to interviews on NPR, \\"The Daily Show,\\" Huffington Post or MSNBC may pick up the book expecting an unbiased and historic report on Jesus and first century Jewish culture. (I will let my Jewish friends address Aslan's statement on MSNBC that, \\"there were certainly a lot of Jewish terrorists in first century Palestine.\\")<br /><br />As a journalist and author who is Christian I cannot imagine penning a so-called objective biography of Muhammad and then concealing my conflict of interest in national media interviews.<br /><br />In world history there are no religions more violently and anciently opposed than the crusading, fighting, at times blood-shedding rivals of historic Islam and historic Christianity. Even non-violent Muslims and Christians, like Aslan and myself, understand that we hold aggressively oppositional views--particularly about Jesus. National news coverage of \\"Zealot\\" has ignored this conflict of interest.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus--from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.<br /><br />Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark--because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.<br /><br />I believe in Aslan's right to hold and propagate any opinion. It's a right that, ironically, Christians do not have in many Muslim countries.<br /><br />My concern is that national media coverage be smart and forthright about this conflict of interest, just as it would be if I--a Christian author and pastor--wrote a book about Muhammad.<br /><br />Pouring praise onto \\"Zealot\\" as new information about Jesus, without explaining its author's devotion to a combatting religion, is blatant bias. This same bias would be unthinkable if the Christian and Muslim roles were reversed.<br /><br />With its riveting demolition of Jesus, \\"Zealot\\" will continue to attract interviews--some from reporters who want to seeJesus deconstructed. Many more interviews will come from reporters who simply don't understand that Reza Aslan has a horse in this race. He is not an objective observer, but, to use his own word, a zealot, with religious motivation to destroy what Western culture has believed about its central figure for hundreds of years. In many ways, this conflict is larger than Christianity and Islam. It is a conflict of Western and Middle Eastern foundations. These are great and important debates that we should welcome, but let's be honest about our motivations, positions and conflicts of interest as we dialogue.<br /><br />Let's hope reporters in future interviews will, being informed, mention the glaring conflict of interest in this Islamic opinion of Jesus. It is no more objective than my educated views about Muhammad, as a Christian.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is not new work from a historian. It is a sophisticated presentation of views that Muslims have held about Jesus for more than 1,000 years.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|i love this book! great story line! good summer beach read! Can't wait to watch the movie and see how that is
B00746O3X8|5.0|This is the lower cost equivalent of the product seen in magazine ads.  Well made, adjustable to fit even over a jacket, man or woman.  Mainly for out door use with heavy camera/lens, it transfers the weight from your neck to shoulders. Mesh construction makes it relatively cool in hot weather. Comes with a holster for a second camera and two locking adaptors with 1/4-20 screws. Adaptors do not fit any tripod, but are easy to remove.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I won't go on. It's just brilliant, entertaining. Acting is first class. Subtle, bombastic. Excellent Bond. Wonderful that the film explores Bond's past- mature and thoughtful.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|An interesting twist to an old fairy tale, breathing new life into the story I grew up knowing.  I was very pleasantly surprised with it all around, I wish it had actually been longer.  Loved the make up and the various witches scattered throughout the film.  I've watched it more than once already and am sure I will watch it again and again.
B0086700CM|3.0|after 1year of playing the game I didn't like it. It got boring and there was nothing to buy. ever 2moths you get an upgrades and that takes up to much memory. I like the game don't get me wrong but when you have nothing to buy and don't want to play the game its just boring not to mention that if you want more money you have to buy it with real money.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent graphics and challenging.  I look forward to many more rooms.  I wish it could have gone on and on.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the fact that if I forget my kindle I can just pull up this app and start reading where I left off.  I would recommend this to anyone who owns a kindle.
B0072IVGZG|3.0|Choice of Weapon is an album of great songs, but like other recent Cult albums it's just way too overproduced. What happened to the simpler more soulful Cult sound of the past? This album just sounds lost in a haze of loud instruments and noise.<br /><br />So then the band decides to release a \\"prequel\\" as they call it, the original version of the album available only as a download for 2 short months. The album title was in reverse, called \\"Weapon Of Choice\\" and is just amazing. Why didn't they release that version?? The production is far superior and it sounds just like the Cult of the old days, like it could have come out in the early 90's.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was only available for a short time, but I'm sure you can find it if you look hard enough.
B00319KS7C|3.0|The main character seems like he has a mental problem, but it's never discussed. Lots of confusion towards the end of what's real and not. Wouldn't recommend.
B009EELBIS|5.0|One should not be put off my the catchy Rodgers & Hammerstein songs sung by pious nuns and cherubic children.  This is a great film who's central message is timeless: \\"climb every mountain till you find your dream,\\" despite social, political or familiar convention or constraints.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|All the other reviews cover the best features of this product, many of the reviews mention that you cant stream local content (i.e. films, music, ect you may have downloaded and wish to play on the tv? Cant use the chromecast to do that). This won't be a flaw for long; Google is releasing Chromecast SDK, this will allow independent developers to make apps for the chromecast. Streaming local content is going to be wanted and you can anticipate independent developers to quickly start producing app to allow you to stream your local content.<br /><br />Chromecast on its own in an excellent product. Chromecast SDK will allow its usefulness and convenience to grow exponentially. There is zero reason to not purchase this product, unless your TV lacks an HDMI connector port.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey gets better and better!  Bravo to Lord Fellowes, the cast and crew!  Keep it coming!  And Dame Maggie Smith is still the best!
B00A7Z8KAU|3.0|It's okay but I can't save anything without it being upside down. If I don't want it upside down I have to start drawing with my Kindle turned sideways which I don't find as convenient because it's more difficult for me to draw. There are a lot more features added so I guess if you can draw with your Kindle turned at that angle than it's worth the money. I find it very annoying though so if they don't fix it in at least a hear I'm changing the rating to 1 star and will delete the app.<br />-_-
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Jane Austen is a wonderful writer. It's no wonder her books have been made into movies. Classic tales of love, sensible people and silly people. Love her books!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Really liked the originality of the show and the casting. It was good fun,  had a good message, and could be watched with the kids.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|it is not fun and  is boring and if i could figure out how to get it off my Kindle i would do that .
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This was so very entertaining, I couldn't stop watching !  It reminded me of the old movie A Chorus Line and the movie Center Stage
B00009AOBI|5.0|Cher did an amazing job in her role as Rocky's mother in this movie. It's in my top 5 movies of favorites I've ever seen and I highly recommend seeing this.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book as it helps me understand the Afghan culture.  I enjoyed this book from the standpoint of the story line, the journey of the brother and sister.  This journey takes them in so many different directions and I found myself caught up in the story of family, friends and a culture that really is not too different than my own.  I liked the book very much.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Sure its only a few hours old. Nobody has this in possession yet. But the idea of this is amazing. Being an Apple Tech, I applaud Google and the products announced today. Its nice to see that some company is being innovative and cheap. Bravo. I'm sure when I have this I'll be a happy nerd.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|Long time Metroid fan, this IS a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes the games or the character.<br /><br />It shouldn't be bought as a toy to play with, this is a collector's item, it is expensive and should be on display only.<br /><br />Works great for posing for the camera too!
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Love the movie, super fast and quick order and great packaging!  Couldn't be happier.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes comedies and good prices.
B005544V6A|5.0|Love the movie gives me some option how to look and talk cool. Every Sunday one serie to watch until I finish ....
B009NO1FFI|5.0|Another hardback for my collection of Dean Koontz.  I am now getting all of the older ones and this is one less I have to worry about.  In great shape, too.
B008220BLG|3.0|The actors are attractive and competent, but for me the story was unengaging.  Except for the fact that the hero is a zombie, plays pretty much as a straight romance, no twists.  Didn't suck, just didn't sing.  I did like the way it was shot, generally no jittery camera, and not hyper edited.  Two and three quarter stars rounded up to 3.<br /><br />P.S. I'm middle age and target audience for this film is teenagers to mid/late 20s maybe.  Nothing really much for me here, though I do enjoy a scary zombie movie; zombie romance, not so much.  Film made a lot of money so clearly I'm in the minority.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This is a hilarious movie. I wasn't sure about it before we rented it as it seemed to be pretty crude on the trailer but it was really funny!
B002361MLA|5.0|Very useful for anyone practicing meditation.<br />Critical for anyone to get happiness where it is : in the now!<br />And to escape from the trap of the mind.<br />A must read !
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I didn't think that this movie was going to be as funny as it was...but it was hilarious. You know how sometimes all of the funny parts are in the trailers and then you get to see the movie and have already seen all of the funny parts? This is not the case for this movie.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|It's an okay movie. The Sam story was pretty weak and the only parts I really liked was the Transformers parts. The movie was very simple and that was its hubris.
B009RXWYJQ|2.0|This CD is a copy of the original osmose with a copyright. not contain booklet and is very different if you compare with the real album.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This was a great way to pass the time.  The game restarted on me as I was building a large base and I had to rebuild everything, that's the only complaint I have.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|There and Back Again, was one of my favorite books.  Today, There and Back Again, is better known by its abbreviated title The Hobbit.<br /><br />The Hobbit is a fantasy novel and what many believe and have believed for years to be a children's book by English author J. R. R. Tolkien.  The Hobbit gives introduction to all the nasty, distasteful, distressing, diabolical carnivorous crafty characters that flesh out The Lord of the Rings heroes and villans. The movie, by the same crew who created the spectacular three-part Ring trilogy is entertaining, and definitely for the young until the action begins after the brawl in Bilbo's house as he is making ready to leave the world he knew.  The initial weakness of the movie faded into an enjoyable evening that sent me back to read the original writing of one of the world's greatest story tellers. I will watch it again.
0071636080|5.0|This book takes a look at the methods used by Mr Jobs in presenting ideas and concepts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking at becoming an Entrepreneur or one looking for work from an in-home business point of view. ANY job you work is one where you have to 'sell yourself' to make the next step. I am glad I read this book.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Far more accurate than the Disney cartoon and in keeping with the original Grimm Brother's tale before it was &#34;cleaned up&#34;.  Tales from the medieval era through the Napoleonic era were far more records of horror than fantasy, when people suffered so that a few would enjoy the embellishments of life with organized religion saying little to nothing while basking in its own torturous Inquisition. The majority of Europe lived in filfth and squalor leading to the real Dacula, the Queen of Hungary, being part of passion of self-aggrandizement and quest for personal beauty regardless of cost. This is a must-see, must-buy movie.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Cant go wrong with MJ and this was one of his greatest performances... Highly recommended for any music fan. See how a concert is supposed to be done..
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|This movie was excellent. It has a good plot and is engaging the entire time. Most reviews that have problems with the movie complain about holes in the plot related their concept of time travel. These people are basically saying they don't like time travel movies because you really can't make a time travel movie without holes. If you like time travel, watch this movie.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This was practically an accident in some amazon advertisement.  Songs are great, deep, mostly original, artistically free and not confined by the label from what I can tell, and the sound is just fun and awesome.  Some great workout songs.
B005PK56TA|3.0|Streamed really well - barely any hiccups in the service.  The show itself was okay but the ending made ZERO sense to me.
0393337170|5.0|Beyond a reasonable doubt, no matter how hard it is for you to solve problems or figure things out....you will be better at it after reading this book.  This should be a required readin in Highschools around the world.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is an easy-to-use and perfect app. It pops up at appropriate times and I like the voice feature for low battery.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book was pale in comparison to the Kite Runner.  Some good chapters, some not so good.  I had a hard time understanding the role of markos and why it was integrated into the entire story.  It was also difficult because the author kept switching time periods, and the ending left me a bit disappointed.  Some of the characters were just plopped in with no real value to the story.
B008AYA7WE|4.0|I enjoyed Tetris when it first came out many moons ago and still love it now in the newer, better version. It has always been a relaxer for me. My doctor even noticed a drop in my blood pressure since I got back to playing this game ( I play almost every day for at least 30 minutes).
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|When first watching this movie it starts off slow but during and towards the end was the best part. The bad guy was right up under everybody's nose. .
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I noticed when you send a message it says the person you sent it to said it to you. Also I wish you could log out other than that it's a good app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game its alot of fun.But they should have new horses that dont cost gems for sale.its a great game though.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|This sharpening system works well in knives with blades up to 5&#34;. The 3 stones sytem is all that is needed for everyday sharpening. Lansky provides good warranty service. I broke one of the clamps. I sent it back to them and they replaced it. I would recommend this system. It works well and it is priced right.
0767819659|5.0|After watching this movie over and over again on demand, I had to purchase it.  After school she puts her movie in and laughs and smiles like its her first time watching it.  I love it too!
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|It's the usual soap opera thing. After the 1st two seasons the 3rd season just seemed to drag especially since the choice of actress for the wife's mother was disappointing.
B009CGR82G|5.0|If you are a David Lynch fan, you'll love this film. If you hated Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, you will likely hate this also.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I started reading in 1998 when only books 1-3 were available.  Tore through them in a few months and loved it.  Had to wait ~7 years for the 4th book to come out and it was a disappointment.  At that point given the state of the plot and time between books I pretty much lost hope for the series and tuned out any news of it.<br /><br />When book 5 came out I ignored it because I didn't want to get let down again.  After all of my friends told me how good it was though I caved and read it.  Really happy I did.  The pace and style is much more inline with books 1-3 than book 4.  It renewed my love for the series.<br /><br />Although it looks like I'm in for about a 2 year wait for the 6th book.  :(
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Once I tried to watch a video it closed don't waste your time on this stupid app thank God it's free or I'd be so angry,more than I am now
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I could not believe the new upgrade to the  weather channel app.  Totally useless. Bring back the old app.  Heck I will even pay for it. I have deleted the app and will wait to see what the Weather channel does.  Not even worth it for free.
B00DURILJ2|5.0|This movie is the best movie of 2013!  I hope next years academy awards really consider this movie for best picture, I also hope that many people leave good reviews and watch this great movie!  :)
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I found this movie a bit dark, but mostly humorous. Definitely entertaining and a bit disturbing (hit girl was disturbing and humorous at the same time)<br />A twisted tale about a total dork &#34;hero-wannabee&#34; that then goes into a high budget &#34;b-movie&#34; - actually one of the more entertaining movies I've seen in quite a while.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Both of my boys love this game. We have gotten it on xbox since, and that is easier to play, but this is great for travel. It is a little hard to figure out at first, especially for me, they caught on quicker, but the more you play the more you figure out. This is by far the most I have paid for an app but I would buy it again.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|FUN game. CUTE gopher. ADDICTIVE. I enjoy playing this game when I don't have a lot of time, but beware you can't play just one round.  I rarely play less than a few rounds because it is so much fun.
B000QCSA54|5.0|An excellent monograph clarifying why one should endure the dips just before breakthroughs, but also showcasing how critical it is to quit doing things that are not leading you in the right direction.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My son and husband love this movie! A great buy!! We watch it all the time. Very handy to have it online, tv and kindle
B0080BFWE0|5.0|This is a great transfer of Romy and Michele.  The audio and video quality is excellent and the original movie is hard to pass up when on television let alone when you can pull it out of your own library any time you want.  Great visuals, quality audio, and an excellent movie make for a great purchase!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran gets my highest recommendation. Her style is witty and frank. I am passing this book on to my sisters and friends and I can't wait to read her next one.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This is a great fun time to be had by all.  The movie is now a Halloween classic and the acting/story is a great time.  The Blu-Ray presentation is good with a solid picture and good audio.  Shipping was fast and overall a great experience.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I previewed the exercises and every one of them are the exact same things my bootcamp instructor would have us do at some point during strength training (just more reps), but the cardio section of the app was more our warm up. I'm so glad I found this app because now I can do this in my home and will save me the $200 a month that I paid for bootcamp. I will still go to the gym for my cardio though. I would definitely recommend this app for warm up and in toning and building up strength, but maybe find another source for the cardio.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Love everything about this series! The interaction between the actors is spot on!  Can't wait for the new season 3!
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|My wife and I both enjoyed the movie.  It did not have the strongest plot in the world, but provided fun slapstick style entertainment.
140006922X|1.0|It might have been nice if all the reviews and interviews had mentioned the author is a devout Muslim repeating Muslim explanations of why Jesus wasn't Jesus.  Good grief.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. Defenant recommend.=^¥ As soon as I downloaded it I couldn't get off. It's so addicting. Thank you to the creators of Minion Rush.
B00190KZUU|4.0|I liked the story line it was cool to watch on a day where there's nothing to do but sit around.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 4 - but how could they do that to Matthew?!  Looking forward to the next season on Prime!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|So it was an automatic tear jerker in the end, but very funny and I enjoyed seeing familiar faces in the movie.
B007RV6X2Y|5.0|I. Loved the movie.  Crazy about all of Samuel l. Jackson's movies.  Good story.  Would recommend to others to see.
B009PMB3CI|5.0|This game is awesome it has so many features you don't want to miss out on. A furry little Dalmatian companion stays by your side it your pocket.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|it was the best horror movie I've seen in a very long time very scary very suspenseful and lot of gross bloody gore.
0765309408|5.0|all 5 stars cud its a good book and its interesting. i wanted to read more and not stop. but if i did stop it was because i was fed up with a characters decision, which made me mad. it was like i was in a fight with the character.
B008N2Z1L0|4.0|I liked this cd, but I still like their Red Letter Days CD the best.  I think the production was better on Red Letter Days.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is fun it's a level up game and everybody in my community likes it give it a try it's free and fun
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Finally, after all these years! It`s finished. What a ride. A group of captivating adventures I never really wanted to end. Bravo, well done. It was worth the wait and the endless anticipation. Will the adventures continue? I hope so. Today, January 22, 2014, I have just finished the complete series for the second time, re reading the series, each book, in order, first to last. I enjoyed every page, making new discoveries and enjoying past adventures through different eyes. Unbelievable, outstanding and fantastic.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|There are a number things about this book that I like (I've just started the diet, so I can't speak to the results yet). First, the authors provide a lot of citations (shockingly rare in health/diet books) and take relatively scientific approach to explaining the evidence to support the FastDiet. The authors acknowledge there is insufficient evidence on certain aspects of the diet's impact, but draws reasonable conclusions based on anecdotal evidence and related research. As a public health professional, I appreciate this approach and was convinced this diet was likely beneficial and effective.<br /><br />My complaints are minor. I found the book going back and forth between the two authors a bit strange-- wasn't sure who was writing what I was reading at points and sometimes they're writing together, I guess. My main issue is that there is so much filler: almost half of the book! The font size and huge margins provided a hint that this book was not super hefty, but for the price of a book, I would have appreciated more substance. For instance, they authors could have included more, better-presented recipes, more information about the diet and about glycemic load. Rather than a list of calories in random foods the back of the book, why not provide a more comprehensive list of the glycemic load of common foods? And I honestly can't believe they included tweets from people saying they liked the diet along with many emails to the authors and posts on listserves and blogs. Clearly, this book was a rush job after the TV special they mentioned took off. I'll look forward to recommending the next edition. Were I to do it again, I'd consider just buying the cookbook-- it has a basic explanation and lots of useful recipes.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This show about a town full of genius minds, is intriguing, amusing and addictive. Its like a book you can't put down. You just can't wait for the next episode to find out what happens next.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Have always loved Masterpiece Theatre.  I was hooked on this series from Season 1, Episode 1.  However, I really hated the way they ended Season 3.  I suppose it makes for better drama but I tend to like happily ever after. Really fun to watch on the iPad through Amazon Prime.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awsome I can't get the full version so I play this.I think it needs to update faster but besides that it's awesome.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|I have not finished this book, but I find Mr. Pink's descriptions of the need for new flexibility in our brains fascinating. I think he's right on point as to what skills are needed for the future. VERY interesting.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|This is such a great show!! Alway's something happening!! Never a dull moment!! I have been hooked since i first started watching!!!
0060254920|5.0|Where The Wild Things Are was my favorite book as a kid. Bought this for my y son and hopefully it will be his favorite someday as we'll.<br /><br />As for quality of the book...it's exactly the same as when I had it. Looks the same, really tough hardback along with a slip cover with the same print. It's simply a &#34;Where The Wild Things Are&#34; book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'd watch it over all over again! I like how every episode brings something new to this season! Something exciting always happens
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|As a Roku and AppleTV user, I'm excited to see this one come too and purchased it within an hour of hearing about it.<br /><br />Can't give it 5 stars or 1 star til I use it.<br /><br />One thing I noticed is that the box includes a USB power hub and cord, but all the pictures show it without one attached.<br /><br />Do some TVs have powered HDMI ports and the cord is only needed with ones that don't?  If so, I'm guessing I'm using the power cord.  Oh well, that's why I have a 15 plug power strip in the bottom of the TV cabinet.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was my first puzzle room game, and I totally love it. Can't wait for more levels. It's not that hard, but it makes you think.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this app, easy to use. I find myself promising &quot;only one more &quot; and spend another 5 minutes playing. the larger boards provide s nice challenge,  not your usual mindless entertainment
B00824ZJ84|5.0|I think the album was very good, especially since this is her debut album since the Voice (U.K.). The production is marvelous and the lyrics are sharp & straight to the point. 5 out of 5
B00DU73T08|4.0|I had read the book and enjoyed it, so of course I wanted to see how it would translate into a movie.  I liked it quite a bit.  If you hadn't read the book before seeing it, I'm sure the love triangle twist would have been a surprise.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|plenty of action, drama and good special effects for a tv show. totally worth your time to watch. Highly recommended
B00A8M7H42|5.0|Got as companion to Kotobukiya ArtFX New 52 Superman. Very nice detail, and price is such that could easily do entire Justice League. Doesn't appear that they used same body for both figures, and just stuck different heads with different paint jobs. Superman appears to be a bit taller, and the Batman figure seems a little thicker-its clear Batman is wearing thick body armor. Not up to the standards of other Kotobukiya products, but for around $40.00 quite nice.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Very funny, witty, chick book. Loved it and read it twice. The main character is out of control and my friend in my head.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am in suspense every time I watch! I never know what to expect. Looking forward to the next season already!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Sometimes these episodes seem to last longer than an hour, but they definitely draw you in. Several twists in this season that I didn't see coming, so you've been warned!
B000FCKC4C|1.0|I had to read this for school.  This was the most boring book I hAve ever read. It gives a good message though.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|there are still a few hiccups that need to be fixef game freezes up during the Victor stages but all in all fun games for all ages
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is fun but challenging I love playing it it is one of the addicting games that I have
1601251505|5.0|Tried the box set, now moved up to this rulebook.  Full of good information, all you need to get an adventure going.  Highly recommend this for players and Gm's
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are amazing and the game is so much fun!  also you aren't constantly being hugged to buy upgrades and things.
1601251831|5.0|helpful, and full of lots of nasties to keep adventurers guessing.<br />I have tabbed off the more common monsters, to make it easy to find
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game evvvvveeeerrrr!! I cannot stop playing!!! Most people say this takes too much time to load but on my Kindle fire it works great. So many opportunities!!! The only disapointing thing is that i cannot buy more coins so i cannot complete my challenges:(((((
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging way to kill some time. Puzzles range from fairly easy to slightly more challenging but should be lots of fun for all skill levels.
161655164X|5.0|If your into art books I recommended purchasing this item. I bought The Last of Us Post-Pandemic Edition at GameStop and wished I would have bought the survival edition for the art book after little research I noticed it was on amazon for a great price. When it arrived I was shocked it was so nice compared to so many other art books that many games come with its even bigger then the strategy guide!! I highly recommended this to anyone that enjoys video game art books.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have researched a lot of these and for the price you cannot beat it! I have used it several times in the last week and it has yet to fail me or need a re-charge!! Best bang for your buck!!
B000HKYA1I|5.0|Excellent movie, funny and moving at the same Time.  Showed real human characteristics that make us all individuals. Deep meaning regarding ancestors and how we are our past and present in one,
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Oh god this series is amazing! Every time I start another one of Cassie Clare's books I am totally hooked on it!! I am definitely giving this book 5 stars because it was amazing. It had just the right amount of action and romance and everything else in it!!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have purchased many headphones over the years these are by far the best. The sound quality is unmatched even when compared to some that cost twice the price (or more). The folding design is very nice for transport purposes. I wear these several hours a day and have yet to find them uncomfortable. I don't know why I wasted my money on so many others.  These are the way to go.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addicting!!!! Not to easy to play on kindle firs like to jump or roll but I love the game and movie I get mad when I hit something lol
B00BSWMITK|5.0|I have a deep love of guitars and guitarist who can make them rock and Joe has been doing that for years and years.  He has a passion for music and it shows, especially on this album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it its really fun and a cute game for the kids to play the kids have shot of fun
B0084IHVGG|5.0|This is a nice family movie to watch it is funny,sad,happy,and more i love this movie all so the little ones two
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game. I love can u escape. Me and my friends love to play this game. Hidden object games are one of my favorite  type of games and can u escape is like it so I really enjoy playing this game.<br />Awesomeness!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;
B004G0SJU8|5.0|Great movie! Story line definitely takes you to places you are not expecting!<br />I can watch this movie over and over!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Spectacular series.......great story, beautiful costumes and stage, and fabulous acting!!!!  Very disappointed I have to wait another year for Series 4!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|This was on the lines of Sean of the Dead. It was a very hip and very funny movie. The alien was so contemporary and influenced by some in our society which worked really well. All of the actors were great! Someone recommended this movie to us and I'm so glad we took the suggestion!
1591391105|4.0|This book was very helpful in understanding the transition my work place was going through. Michael Watkins outlined and explained situations and fixes in a way that the lay person who is just the gal at the desk can understand. I appreciated it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the costumes and the scenery.  The house is breathtaking.  The characters are touching, devious, interesting and it is the English version of Dallas!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Its good but its a little difficult to judge how close you can get, without hitting the obstacles in your path
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I cant get through level 1 please help me I got the red thing but what is the colour code?
B009ZQNN90|5.0|Great entertaining movie with good writing and cast. The chemistry was obvious and brought you into the film. I suggest viewing..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is loads of fun for both kids and adults. I challenges the mind and keeps you playing for hours on end. I haven't had any problems with this app. You should definitely download this app. :)
B004MYF4SS|5.0|This was recommended by blogger Jon Katz (bedlamfarm.com) and since we were heading to Scotland for vacation I gave it a try.<br />It was excellent. So much more than just a murder mystery. I'll be reading the other books in the trilogy.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|The only thing I can say about it is that it was free and my wife likes a song or two from it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|There are 4 different ways to play this, but my favorite is &#34;Mineral&#34; because I'm always trying to beat my best score.  It's a great way to pass time when having to wait for an appointment or standing in line.  Actually, it's addictive.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm addicted to this trilogy! I've been so engrossed in these books, definitely a good read! Recommending it to everyone :)
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This should please everyone, because it can be set up for individual preferences - background choices, tile choices and a great variety of games.  I can't imagine getting bored.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This is the cutest pool I've ever seen!! My nephew absolutly LOVED it!! And so did the other kids!! It's perfect for any kids!! You can regulate the sprinklers that are on the side of the pool. I would recommend that you buy an air pump since you have to blow the slide and the little pool by the slide and all the toys that come with it! I didn't know it came with toys when I bought this! It comes with two inflatable animals that the kids can ride and it comes with a cactus that has rings that you can toss onto it's arms!!!
B004SIP9RO|2.0|But there is little serendipity (an aptitude for making desirable discoveries by accident)in this film. There are few desirable discoveries in this 2001 film. The only thing the other reviewers seemed to like was the soundtrack. Skip this one.
B005F96URI|4.0|This film is nothing short of brilliant. It delves into an age where firearms are forbidden, and those who can't accept the consequences of the strong threatening the meek, and then getting the surprise of their lives, oughtn't to waste their time seeing sheer deadly fun. If you're intelligent, have backbone, a sense of humor, and have a taste for the bizarre when every part is evenly balanced then get this DVD and keep it in our library.
B005KELW26|4.0|I really like this folio.  I have another more expensive one that is stiff and unbending.  This one is softer and easier to use.
B0062YADWI|5.0|This replaced my keychain carabiner.  It is much more robust than the standard carabiners and is the only one (that I found) with built in bottle opener.  I used to have an additional bottle opener hanging off my keychain, which added bulk.  The only negative, which could also be a positive, is that once clipped onto my belt loop, there is a notch in the carabiner that makes it a little difficult to remove from my belt loop.  The notch catches onto the loop. Built in security?
B009G41CG2|5.0|Love the game...Play it all the time waiting in Doctors offices, for various appointments etc...Fun time, frustrating, but keeps my mind active.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Best james bond movie of late out of all 23 films best one yet of the daniel craig era. next bond film will be just as good
B009AP2G26|5.0|Television doesn't get any better than this. The show continues to capture the imagination and the characters to capture our hearts.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book. It was raw, emotional and beautifully written. Great characters that tugged my heart. Highly recommend it.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I just bought this an hour ago and am enjoying it a lot. Great graphics and seems to get more challenging. Worth the 99 cents. Buy and enjoy!!!!
B00846TTDG|5.0|Being from San Diego, I recognize a lot of the locations where they filmed.  Kind of scary to let everyone know what some of our tactics are.  That I am not happy about.  TMI for the wrong hands. Otherwise, action packed, emotional and best movie ever.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is a well made and a funny movie. I am glad I have it,  however, it was apparently 'used' because it skips a couple of times during the movie.
B009BJAPLK|4.0|I like this show, I however really wish it wasn't so long. Its got so much going on, I kinda wish they were only hour long episodes. So, sit down and pay attention. Its a movie basically.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|loved it. funny family movie for a rainy night. laughed alot not gory just good guys vs bad guys. will watch it again.
B008602KQI|4.0|For a post-apocalyptic world type book it is ok.  It is very predictable.  I read all three books in the series and regretfully knew what would happen in the last book when I read the first.  The ending of Hunger Games was very &#34;non-conlusive&#34;, so you know there is going to be a sequel. That being said, yes i went and saw the movie, and yes I will go see the next movie! I think everyone enjoys an adventure, and it is nice to have a heroine instead of a hero for a change, and where the men and women are treated equally.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|im a kindle fire user and it works for me. but it is slow and i did need to clear a few apps and old books. over all a good app unroll it asked me to buy full app. it took 3 dollars out of my account and I still have demo, I'm not complaining because the games worth it but can someone help? I have extra space for full game
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked the movie. It keeps you watching and guessing. I would watch it again. I recomend it to anyone to see it.
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|Having two modes makes this even better than a standard keypad.  Being able to use it as a calculator and then send the result is a huge time-saver.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Explains in great detail why carbs are bad for you. The book gets a little &#34;science-y&#34; in the last few chapters, but overall does a great job of keeping the reader engaged without beating him over the head with 7-syllable words. The books uses studies to refute common diet misconceptions  about limiting fat and focusing on carbs.
140006922X|1.0|Since Amazon's description of the book fails to mention that the author is a devout Muslim, I thought I would.  According to John S. Dickerson's article of July 24, 2013 on FoxNews.com, Aslan's \\"book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio.\\"
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Although the story line delt with loss and mystery there was also a hint of comedy due to Whoopie Goldberg's performance.  Always love watching this movie.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works fine!  Just trying to learn how to follow the steps for transferring files.  Time will tell on my part!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book was an interesting read. My book club is reading this book and we will give our opinions in our next meeting.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Stop reading these reviews and start reading the book!  My review would be shorter except that Amazon requires more words.
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|just when you get the hang of what to do, you can't play until you buy stuff.  This is not my kind of \\"free\\" game.  don't mind time to restock or purchase items, but this game does not restock over time you have to buy things.  Not my kind of game when there are so many games that really are free out there.  i would have liked to get to play it more to see if it was worth purchasing full version.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love it. play it all the time and it hasn't gotten old or boring yet. and it is free. how awesome is that.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Characters are so wonderfully portrayed. I cannot wait for next season to begin! Background and setting are just so beautiful.
B002B2ZIES|5.0|Kenny Wayne Shepard...great album, great rock collection of songs...way to go for an older album!<br />this is a great album to just rock out to on the road.
B005723JSQ|4.0|It was like reading a modern fairy tale story. Some scenes are obviously sweet and unreal but others I could relate. Is a fun book to read if you want to get your mind off reality and enjoy a romantic comedy. It made me laugh in a \\"as we I wish that was me way\\" that's why I will definitely recommend it.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|It took me about a week to get accustomed to this mouse when I first bought it two months ago. When I opened the box and started messing with it I was a little disappointed because it felt uncomfortable and the DPI settings it came with made it difficult to control the arrow on the computer. On top of that, I had to download the software from the website (because I couldn't find it once I plugged the mouse in) in order to customize it the way I wanted (the color of the light on top, the DPI settings, mouse speed, and the buttons) I thought of returning it the first few days because I hated how it either moved too slow or too fast, especially when I played BF3 online, even after changing the DPI settings several times. After the first week, however, I managed to find the mouse speed and the configuration that worked for me and after two months every other mouse I use feels inferior.<br /><br />tl;dr... thought of returning it the first few days, took me a few days to learn how to use it
B008CUVOKK|5.0|Complaining that the story is 'long-winded' is idiocy.  These characters are well-developed and extremely interesting throughout the series.  There is no lull in the plot throughout.  I can't see why people are whining about the lack of resolution in the most recent book in the series, \\"A Dance with Dragons.\\" It's a series for God's sake!  Do you not realize that the questions are intended to be resolved?  Take what you can get from an author who has done something incredible.  I don't know if this particular published set of the books is worth a steaming pile of poo, but reading Martin's series has left me desperate for more yet willing to accept a long wait if there is a quality product.  Apologies to the 72-year-old reviewer, but I am not a septuagenarian and have no plans to return to the dust in my near future.  There have only been 5 books written, so don't expect anything sold to contain more than that content in any number of volumes.  All I can say is: stay alive you fat bastard, and put to rest this behemoth that you have created.
B0014JLYS8|1.0|I purchased the product 5 weeks ago.This is my  third pair I bought.The first two was really good but the last pair I purchased was completely failure.The sole on the left pair come out completely.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent in every way. Writing, directing and photography. Casting perfect! We can't wait till season 4! We watched season 3 on our lap top via Amazon.  Not optimal, but it worked
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|n my opinion, the Crossfire series keeps getting better and better.  I was a little torn after reading the first novel in this series, Bared to You.  Personally, I had a hard time separating the first story in this series from the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy.  The similarities, in my opinion, were endless.  That said, there were a few key differences, mainly Eva's character, and that is what convinced me to continue reading this series. The second novel in this series, Reflected in You, really started to set this novel apart from the Fifty Shades trilogy.  After completing Reflected in You, I noticed that this series had started to stand on its own and go in its own direction which made me want to keep reading this series even more.  Ms. Day kept readers hooked by creating a suspenseful and intriguing plot.<br /><br />Entwined with You, the most recent novel in this series, continued in the same direction as Reflected in You.  In my opinion, this series is completely its own now.  I'm happy to report that I no longer associate the Crossfire series with the Fifty Shades series.<br /><br />I didn't know it was possible but Ms. Day heated things up even more in Entwined with You.  In Dana's words, &#34;Holy mother of flaming panties! You need a fire extinguisher aka hot guy nearby to put out the blazing inferno this book will leave behind!&#34;  Yeah. It's that hot!<br /><br />I gave Entwined with You (Crossfire #3) by Sylvia Day 4 STARS.  I strongly recommend this series to adults who enjoy erotic romance novels with a punch of suspense!
B00AYB0YFQ|1.0|Way too raunchy. Was just interested in the comedy factor but couldn't get passed all the garbage. No need to watch the sequels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|NOTE: I received an advanced reader copy of Hopeless in exchange for an honest review.  I'm about to talk the author and this novel up so much that by the time you finish reading my review you might think Colleen Hoover paid me to write this review.  She didn't.  I'm just a crazy obsessed fan who happens to review books!  :)<br /><br />Holy cow!  Colleen Hoover is a freaking genius!!  Mark my words, Hopeless by Colleen Hoover will captive readers all across the world, have a spot on the New York Times Best Seller List, and win many, many awards!!!  Hopeless is in a league of its own!!!!  I know for a fact that I will re-read this novel many, many times in the future, most likely in the very near future.<br /><br />I cannot rave enough about this novel.  Simply put, it's PERFECTION.  Not one thing was overlooked in this novel.  Every word and every action was meaningful.<br /><br />The synopsis for this novel is a little vague.  It's supposed to be.  It needs to be.  I'm about to give you some advice and I strongly encourage you to take it: don't go out and search for spoilers for this novel.  Don't do it!!!  If I can't predict the major conflict or get a general idea of what's to come after reading the synopsis of a novel, nine times out of ten I'll go out in search of spoilers.  I'm telling you right now, don't do it!!  I promise you, you don't want to spoil this novel.  One of the best things about this novel is the excitement,  mystery, and the element of surprise.  Don't ruin that.  Just take my advice and trust me when I say this novel is PERFECTION!<br /><br />I'm a mood reader.  Sometimes I want to read something light and funny.  Other times I want to read something full of substance, emotion, and grit.  I'll tell you this much, Hopeless definitely falls into the later category.  Hopeless is the type of novel that will make an impression.  It will touch your heart and soul, make you feel every emotion, and stay on your mind for days and days.  This novel isfull of witty, hilarious moments, but it's also covers some darker emotional issues.  In my opinion, it's the perfect balance and it's perfect for everyone.  As long as you don't read this novel when your looking for a fluffy, mindless romance novel then you are good to go!<br /><br />Colleen Hoover,<br /><br /> I like you. I live you. I love you.<br /><br />Morgan<br /><br />I gave Hopeless by Colleen Hoover 5 STARS.  Cancel your plans.  Call in sick to work.  Read this novel right this second!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Well worth a five star rating.  Good plot, imaginatively written and it held my attention from beginning to end.  The book lives up to Khaled Hosseini's other book.  I was sorry to when it came to an end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved season 1 and couldn't wait to see Season 2!  It's just as good as Season 1!  Season 3, here I come!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I've only played it for a few minutes and I already love it. Really good game and no problem spotted so far. It's like I'm playing on my pc!
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|The title says it all.  Its Dr Who (10th DR style...), but with more death, more violence, and highly sexually charged at times...both hetro, homo, and bi-sexual...Torchwood holds no preference or grudges.  Get past the smut, and the storyline will grab you, hold you, and twist things.  You will not see many plot twists coming.  Ahhh, the Face of Boh...
B00280LYHS|5.0|At the end I believe he summed up everything nicely and with a little cliff hanger for his next series. Overall one of the best books he wrote.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|It was wonderful to see this first season of my favorite TV show ever, after which I watced all of the remaining seasons.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I'm one of those people that usually arrives late to the party. Well, somehow I managed to miss the hype and lure of this tv series for 4 seasons until I recently decided to try out the first episode on Amazon. Now I'm hooked! Great cast, clever writing, laugh-out-loud funny at times and sometimes its very touching & sweet. It's a great mix.<br /><br />The Good Wife truly is a must see.

1451695195|4.0|A number of years ago there was an article in Time Magazine about how the brain functions. This statement was made at the end of that piece: \\"We still don't understand how the brain gives rise to consciousness.\\" No kidding. That's because it doesn't! That fact became apparent to me at the age of 14 when I had what some call a \\"spontaneous mystical experience\\" (different from a near death experience). In that moment I experienced my own consciousness as an eternal awareness that did not arise from the brain at all, but existed independently of both the brain and the body.  In other words, I had a direct experience of my own soul or spirit. But who was going to listen to a 14 year-old?  I am happy that Dr. Alexander has been divinely inspired (or divinely chosen) to share his unique story with the world, and -- as a respected man of science -- give credence to something I have long believed to be true: that there is, indeed, life after life. Written simply and succinctly, this interesting account of Dr. Alexander's experience will comfort many who fear that death is the ultimate end of their conscious existence.<br /><br />Steven Lane Taylor, author of [[ASIN:0974459739 Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow]]
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|That bluray disc was announced with many features, but finally there's no many things in there. Watch the movie, who's NOT an extended version (as it was promised by the director originally)and look at the few bonus involved. At best, you will have 5 hours with the audio commentaries. Gonna wait for a new edition ! This one is pretty bad, and expensive for what's there in it.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Beautiful images, great cast, enjoy! Came across this on Amazon.. heard about it when it was being promoted .. didn't get a chance to see it in theaters.  Glad we caught this one.  I highly recommend this film. Music was wonderful, the cast of real musicians made it even more special.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|It gives me goose bumps each lime I watch this. Liam sooooooo good, Ralph soooooooooo bad.  God love the Jewish people for all they overcame.  Bless Oscar Schnidler for all he did, even though he felt he didn't do enough.
1433537427|5.0|I like this bible. It is better than my niv. Study context are excellent. Small letters make good features including portability.
B00D0SEGMC|4.0|It is not user friendly.It may be a good product but right now I don't think it was good buy. As, and example, once i found out how to find a place, it did not list super walmart only 1.9 miles from my campsite. I might add that I was once a beta tester for delorme products and have a masters degree in engineering so when I say it is not user friendly you can believe it.
B000002LCD|4.0|Let's face it, I think the majority of people buying this soundtrack are picking it up because it's got four classic Madonna tracks.  Who's That Girl, Causing a Commotion, Can't Stop and Look of Love.  If you loved Madonna's True Blue album, then you'll love those four tracks since they are basically the same sound.  In fact, it would have been nice had Madonna's record label released those four tracks on the True Blue Remastered CD so we don't have to waste our time buying this soundtrack.  This soundtrack loses a star for not just letting it be an entire album of Madonna tracks, the rest on this are okay, but not that memorable.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|THis is a great little mouse! if you need a good gamining mouse this is it! For the price you cant go wrong.
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|These are very cute dolls and my girls were so excited to get them, but within an hour of playing with them 2 of the dolls had lost their heads. They went back on initially but from then on have always fallen off very easily to the point my kids don't play with them much anymore.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great app. Puzzels can be hard and may seem impossible but there is always a solution.  Good way to relax.  Give it a try.
B0091REZMW|3.0|A little slow to start with but a good game for the brain, something for those wet and miserable days.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|WOW!!!!  This is not your father's Gatsby.  Or is it?  How does one explain to a high school junior that the Charleston was decadent and that Jazz is not something played in the elevator made with a keyboard?<br /><br />If one wants to instill a true interest in history, then bring it to life, and this movie does!  Themes are classic because they relate to people across generations.  However, difficulties in culture and language can make even overarching human experiences like lost love seem somehow relevant.  Imagine Grandmother describing how all the boys fought over her, and that she used to be quite a dish!<br /><br />The Redford classic was immaculate but at the same time lacking in energy and life.  Sure, you can ask anybody over 75 what the Marble House is and what it signifies, but what does this mean to a bored teenager?  However, say Gatsby lives in a Bavarian castle, and now they can relate to his wealth.  Watch Gatsby flash his business card to the police officer to get out of a ticket, and later see the police commissioner illegally drinking alcohol and partying with Gatsby really tells the story of Gatsby's influence and power.<br /><br />More than anything, this movie emphasizes how COOL Gatsby has become and his parties and the paparazzi, and how HOLLYWOOD and the stars of the sporting world come to his home each week-end.<br /><br />Now, there are legitimate criticisms that the movie does not explore the deeper themes of the movie more in depth. [in particular, I missed a more in depth examination of the role of women, in particular the missing interaction of Daisy with her daughter and what is a desirable path for a female follow] This is a valid criticism.  However, the purpose of the movie is NOT to be some sort of visual novel, but rather to encourage people to read the literature, explore the deeper symbolism of the book, to breath some life into a nearly century old story, or simply to be entertained.<br /><br />The updates such as the substitution of substitution of the Duesenberg Model J for the stodgy old RR, and more importantly, the roar and speed at which it was driven help to convey to the audience that this is was the Bugatti one hundred years ago.  Times Square was also made to feel vibrant as it does today on the televised New Year's celebrations.  [how hard is it to make a pale yellow car look \\"cool?\\"]<br /><br />In summary, I view this movie in much the same way as I would The Marriage of Figaro or Don Giovanni.  No production is ever identical, and there is some magic in that.  Baz has put his brush to a clean canvas and come up with an extraordinary work.  It is not for everybody, but in a world that continues to lack in literary scholarship and \\"classic\\" has become synonymous with \\"out of touch\\" or worse \\"irrelevant\\" an interpretation such as this one can, perhaps, help to bring younger people to the classics by allowing them to be somewhat more accessable. When places and things are more identifiable, it is easier to realize that it does not matter that the Castle is now LeBron's house, and the Duesenberg is now a Bently, but the themes of love, achievement, morality and ultimately the analysis of the self are the same today as they have always been.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I own two Omega watches, a Speedmaster (the Moon Watch) and a Seamaster (007 version), and this Seiko has become my favorite watch. Enough said.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Well..if you are thoroughly bored and are looking for a quick read where you don't have to put much thought into, this is your book. It is very poorly written but it does have a decent story line. I am sure it will be made into a movie and I am hoping Hollywood can do a better job that Gillian did.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Now I am addicted to Temple Run 2, but this game is so much more fun. Although the sensitivity on tilting could be improved by being able to callibrate it.

B000LPR9ZS|3.0|the whole saw series is very good but the transition onto blu ray looks no different then it did on dvd
B004KPX4W2|4.0|it had all the elements funny,drama,excitement and old people kicking a-- and taking names and doing great stunts what more can you ask for
B00003CXXJ|5.0|the first two shrek movies are so good. i wish the other two would have been good too. oh well at least we have 2 good shrek movies
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I found the characters compelling.  The author chose an interesting technique to tell his story.  The main points of the story can be a metaphor for the lessons learned in any war.
B00005JMUA|4.0|another great movie but wasnt as good as the first kill bill. the first one was all action while this was more story driven and slower paced

B003TOMAPC|4.0|I would have said aimed at teen audiences except for the language and cartoonish use of weapons and gratuitous blood. It was and is a popular movie.  I imagine it has reached a cult following by now and I understand a new movie is in the works.  It's very watchable as a comic book story.  Don't take it seriously.
1416905014|5.0|Such gorgeous pictures and pop ups.  The little girl who got this book for her birthday was so thrilled and happy.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|The only comedian/actor we have today that could possibly act in Peter Seller's roles is Robin Williams.  I cannot imagine it being anywhere close to the same movie.  Kubrick was a genius and had everything he needed to become a film legend.
0399162097|3.0|The complexity of the story and the unusual nature of this character's upbringing kept me reading.  The fact that the protagonist is a troubled soul, caused however unintentionally by her parents, ran through the entire story.  I kept waiting for her to find some peace...which I suppose had begun by the story's end.  I found the story very unsettling and certainly gave me much to think about long after I finished the book.  Well written with a most unusual plot.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I was most impressed by the amount of data from studies that peppered the book. It helped to substantiate the thoughts and highlight the current situation of women today. It was helpful for me, a woman early in her career and considering having children but fearful of how it will affect my career. This gave me great perspective on how to achieve my goals. I would recommend this to young women as well as directors trying to encourage women to accept leadership positions in their companies.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I was surprised to wake up to a new version a week ago and I don't like it.  I know change is hard but  I had better access with the older version.  And I don't like the REWARD crap.  What's that all about if I wanted to collect rewards , I'd play games not hunt for weather conditions.
B007NZQU72|1.0|This book had so much promise - a really great questionnaire, which leads the reader into saying 'yes' to many of the questions and concluding 'yes I am highly sensitive...that explains so much about me....so what can I do about it??'. But from there the book fails to really provide any insight, comfort or tools in order to cope as a sensitive person in our over-stimulating world.<br /><br />I totally agree with her premise (which is what pulled me in), but she fails to really 'comfort' you and encourage you to embrace and capitalize on your strengths. Where are the examples of HSP's who have achieved great careers and great things? She provides a few examples of HSP's who have 'succeeded' but these people are all just everyday types 'getting by' in spite of their trait. This leads you to conclude that this is the best you can hope for. The kicker was towards the end when she talked about a HSP she went to school with, and here I am thinking, finally, 'this person will embrace their sensitivity and take on the world and bloom into a successful person, shining their sensitive light into the world' ....wrong... he committed suicide. Comforting and inspiring. Not.<br /><br />Her writing style fails to engage, and she also has a habit of instructing you to really minimize rather than embrace your sensitivity and hide it as much as possible, leading you to conclude that you are really not okay. Surely she realizes that sensitive types reading her book are likely to be quite wounded by this?<br /><br />In the hands of a much more engaging, skilled and warm writer (e.g. Martha Beck) this could have been a truly great contribution on a new and under-investigated topic. In its current form I found it quite an emotionally painful read like being told from a stern and uncaring mother 'you are not really okay and you don't really fit in, so go and minimize your trait and cater to the less sensitive types'. Huge disappointment..no, more than that....an unsettling and upsetting read.ead.

Harold is not athletic.<br />Therefore, he struggles and struggles, both mentally and physically.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|This CD is full of music to cook, relax or read by or for those romantic evening. Michael Buble has an unforgettable voice and singing style that doesn't come along to often. I recommend this CD.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I started reading this book, and I'm glad that I went into it this way. Like most of the world, I've been into zombie stories over the last few years, and I kind of thought that I'd seen every approach to stories involving the living dead. This one was different, though. Much different. If you are a fan of world cultures, government, and humanity in general, this book will make you feel proud of the human race. Most zombie stories thrive on hopelessness. World War Z is a zombie story about humanity and hope. Very well done.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I cant believe I haven't read this before now. I am so glad I decided to, enjoyed the whole book!
B00BF11STU|4.0|This film was not quite as I had expected. Obviously not a big budget film but still it is about an important time in history.

B000FCKC4C|4.0|This was a well-crafted story with all of the elements that make for a great narrative: adventure, love, mystery, and philosophy.  It's not often we can read a good story with lessons we can apply to our own lives without feeling preached at or bathed in condescension.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I waited 35 years for this album. Yes, I'm an older guy, and Black Sabbath was/is my favorite band since the moment I heard my first Black Sabbath song, which was Sweet Leaf, followed by After Forever. I quickly went out and bought every Sabbath album out there. The year was 1974, and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath had just been released the prior December. I attended the concert, made the front row, and bought every Sabbath album that came out since, and attended every concert since, too. But then in 1978, and after the release of Never Say Die, it ended. And for 35 years, I've been waiting for another Black Sabbath album.<br /><br />Well, it's not as if those 35 years were a void. You had the other \\"Sabbath\\" albums, some of which were pretty darn good. You had Ozzy's solo albums, some of which were also pretty good. You had Tony's solo albums, and Geezer's solo albums, too, which I actually thought were the best of the bunch. But none of those really matched the \\"magic\\" that came with the original line-up, and therein lies the problem with 13. 13 is yet another album that doesn't bring the original line-up.<br /><br />But it's still Tony on the guitars, it's still Ozzy on vocals, and Geezer on Bass. Maybe Bill's absence doesn't bother other people, but it does bother me. Why? Because since 1999, when they reunited for their tours, the thought of another studio album with the original line up seemed possible again. But it DIDN'T HAPPEN. I read about how they wanted it to happen, but then they didn't, and then Ozzy was suing Tony, and yadda yadda yadda, and no hint of a studio album.<br /><br />And then 11-11-11 happened. The original line up appeared and announced that they will indeed record a new studio album. But then more problems. Bill Ward suddenly changed his mind and drops out. Why? The only thing he says is that he couldn't sign the contract. WTF? It's an \\"unsignable contract\\" is all he will say. And so, they do the album anyway, but without Bill. Talk about popping your balloons!<br /><br />So is the music good? Anything with Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler will be good. So I gave it the five stars, just as I gave The Devil You Know five stars. But is it a Black Sabbath album? Well, it is as much as Heaven and Hell, Mob Rules, and Dehumanizer are Black Sabbath albums. But here's the thing: If just one of the original guys is missing, for ME at least, that magic is just not there. It doesn't mean the music isn't great. But, for me, that magic is not there. Make no mistake, I like the album, I like the songs, I like Tony's guitars, and it's great to hear Ozzy's unique vocals again, where they belong--on a Black Sabbath album. But whatever it took to get Bill on board SHOULD have been done.<br /><br />But hey, there's still time. Who says this is the last Black Sabbath album, anyway? So here I am waiting, yet again, for another studio Black Sabbath album. And I mean with Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and BILL WARD!!!

B00D6BQPMM|5.0|My friend recommended this movie or I would of passed it up.  It has not been promoted well.  There are several very funny lines in this film and then on  the other hand some touching  but not corny or predictable.  Gore is limited.  Characters well defined.  This film does poke fun at itself and a few other things too. It is well filmed and easy to watch.  Enjoy.

B0055S348W|3.0|I give this 3 stars only because it is missing one key feature. I won't print rtf documents, a very common and popular format. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating. Maybe they will consider adding rtf in a future update.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Another fun Gaiman novel. I loved the imagery in this one. Lots of interesting, thought provoking ideas on dimensions, the nature ofevil, and friendship. Throw in a little horror to keep the excitement up.
B001AMNL2Q|1.0|Full Metal Jacket is about the idea that war is not worth wasting our youth. It tries to prove this with two stories: the first is the marines training for deployment, the second is the marines in action in Vietnam.<br /><br />The first story, the marines training for deployment, is told with two external plots: that of the not so bright marine Pyle trying to finish boot camp and the second is the entire class of marines trying to graduate. The class of marines succeed in graduating, but Pyle does not. He goes crazy after the harsh treatment meant to harden him to become a killer and commits suicide. So this story gets to the point that preparing for war is inhumane and not worth wasting our youth.<br /><br />The second story is about the marines fighting to win the war in Vietnam. This is told with two plots: that of winning the war and the second of the declining morality of the marines. The war is not won, it ends ambiguously as the marines win a small insignificant battle and return to camp while the morality of the marines shows a constant decline and ends with our hero committing murder.<br /><br />The movie is a great testament to the anti-war movement and a visual essay on the meaninglessness of war. But it is not a very engaging story. The first half of the movie makes a tight dramatic point that training marines to be killer has some inhumane consequences and proves it with Pyle's suicide. But the second half doesn't have an overall story arc to hang its hat on. The status of the main external plot of winning the war is left ambiguous. So the moral decline of our hero who has to commit murder at the end doesn't create as much meaning since the murder doesn't get us any further in winning the war.<br /><br />One can argue that that's the point of the movie, is that these atrocities are senseless and meaningless. And that is true. But in terms of a dramatic story, the meaning of the action is lost because the filmmakers abhorred making winning the war into any resemblance of a real plot.<br /><br />In the first half of the movie, Pyle's suicide is juxtaposed with the success of class of marines all graduating. Thus it makes the point that his suicide is not worth it for us to successfully train marines. But in the second half of the movie, Joker commits murder but this action is not juxtaposed with progression of any other plot. So the action loses the chance to create meaning through a consequence for his actions. It feels like the movie was cut off without any real resolution, like another 15 minutes were missing.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.cany resemblance of a real plot.<br /><br />In the first half of the movie, Pyle's suicide is juxtaposed with the success of class of marines all graduating.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I realy enjoyed this book. The characters are excellent, the science well researched, and the plot keeps the reader in suspense from the beginning to the end. This was a fun read, and I look forward to reading more of Andy Weir's work.
B007NZQU72|5.0|... and it answered so many life-long questions that have been with me since childhood.<br />It's a Great book.  Highly recommended.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I'm happy I didn't pay to see this at the theaters, but it's definately a good video to watch at home.  Entertaining with a few funny parts.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|If you need to share large files with friend and family this is the program. You can pick the computers on your home network that you want to synch with. If you want you can place items in your Dropbox and have them accessible to do work on any of you home computer. You get a set amount of space available to you but can increase the size of your storage by completing a number of simple steps. Want more memory available to you recommend to friends and family  for bonus space.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|I find the development of a community a fascinating study. The dominance of military authority and its style of leadership has its advantages at times of crisis, but it ignores and minimizes each person's humanity, thus devaluing and restraining development of the individual. This is especially noticeable in Colonel Young's stagnant approach to leadership. He really needs to grow, but does not.<br /><br />Acting is outstanding for some characters. Other characters fail to develop. Writing? Direction? Acting ability? Not sure. The concept offers greater exploration of human development and the societies we form than is pursued by the writers.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It will make all of the changes that you need to dress your photos up before sending out to friends and family. It has a ll the tools that higher priced programs have. Great for all your photos.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I loved the movie so much I got the book to read!! Couldn't put it down and enjoyed finding the slight differences between the book and movie.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It will do some of the things you need for and alarm clock. I decided to get the pro version with more bells and whistles.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun game for young &amp; old.  it also changes the game up so it's not predictable &amp; you won't get bored easy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice to have a number of different calculators in you pocket. Whether it is just the simple math calculator or one for making conversions. This is the one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google has a new innovation, the Chromecast, a HDMI dongle that can \\"cast\\" content from supported mobile apps to your TV using WiFi. The other innovation is the ability to cast content from your computer's Chrome browser tab (assuming you have a decently powerful computer), such as Amazon Instant and Hulu.<br /><br />Note this just came out a few days ago, and it will be better with time as more developers create apps that can use this. This has huge potential and I believe that Google is going to rule the living room with this 2-inch low-priced device, Google has learned from the failure of the Google TV platform to become mainstream.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I tried the base version out first and it I a good program. I decided that I wanted it to do a few more things so I upgraded to the Pro version.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Eureka has always been one of our favorite shows.  It is apparently as good or better watching it a second time.
B00795P4EG|5.0|Great application for retouching your photos on the Kindle. Easy to use and helps dressing your pictures before sharing.  Telling friends to get this application
0062206044|5.0|The Series of Unfortunate Events is one of the favorite book series for my 7 and 12 year old children. The writing style is delicious and turn of phrase comical. The series uses a lot of large words and i would consider this an excellent vocabulary builder. The kids increase their vocabulary and are exposed to writing vehicles without even knowing it.<br /><br />As passionate as I am about these books, the plot does become convoluted and lose a little steam beginning at book 6, but I still consider every book worth the time to read it.<br /><br />Please be aware that not all of the value edition stickers come off the book, so if it is for a gift, your recipient will know how inexpensive it was. Lucky for me, my kids didn't car. We now own all 13 books in the series, the audiobooks, a journal, and are ready to read the Beatrix Letters.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|best app ever!! cant have android phone without this. iPhone users dream if having an app like this.  you can download any and all  YouTube videos even in  high definition.
B006PKQQJS|4.0|Definitely worth it.  The game is cute, fun and addictive. If you have some extra time to kill, it's worth it.  Even for adults.
B00973902K|5.0|I like to sing along with this one! I also workout to it and it has a good beat. I recommend it.
B000I8G594|4.0|Pachino is awesome, as is Depp.  Really nice work by both actors.  I recommend it highly.<br />You won't be disappointed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've used weather apps. So far AccuWeather has been the best weather app I've used beating both The Weather Channel app and even Apple's weather app for IOS. It has the detailed information I've always liked a weather app to have.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great film, lots of good people in it. Funny without being silly. Will be watching Red2 for sure. Recommended watch :-)
B001UTW7QU|3.0|I've always wanted to see this show. It started out good. I am still in the first season, and I keep liking it. I hope this will not turn out like X files -- went down the hill after the first season.
B00B8O4YKY|5.0|This is Buddy Guy at his best. Much better than his newer stuff, imo. We never tire of this music and listen to it sometimes several times a week. Just good, old, traditional blues, it can't get better than that.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was written very well and kept my attention. I've already recommended this book to all my friends and family. Such a great story!
B000002LSV|5.0|This is one of my favorite Cd's of all time. Converted them to mp3's and sent them to my player so I can listen anywhere any time.
068484267X|5.0|I had read this book after borrowing it from the library; however, I decided to purchase it so that I can read it again any time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was one of the best \\"escape\\" type games I've played.  A lot of thinking and visualizing .  I would recommend this to any puzzle enthusiast as well as escape game enthusiasts.  It is not the same old room puzzle door after door.  It has great visuals and a lot of different scenery!!  I hope I don't have to wait long for the next installment - what a wonderful piece of software!!
B005D63ICI|5.0|We're half way through this season but it's already got a great momentum, so much so, we're having a tough time taking a break from the tv once we start. We can't wait to see how this season ends.
1582701709|5.0|This is one of the most inspiring and helpful books I have ever read. I also watched the movie which is really well done. I have personally adopted the vision board into my life and introduced it to others. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a more fulfilling life. I find the philosophy really empowering, it has helped me take control of my life<br /><br />Annie<br />[...]
B00DFFHUUA|1.0|I was mildly excited for this movie - and boy was I not happy with the outcome.  The first G.I. Joe movie, The Rise of Cobra, came out of nowhere to become one of my favorite 'corny action thrillers'.  It had everything: Dennis Quaid, Channing Tatum in a love story/hero to be role, Channing Tatum's always corny side-kick, awesome training montage, high-tech weapons (nano nukes!!), a full back story of Snake Eyes and every imaginable fighting sequence.  The Rise of Cobra really did surprise me in its thoroughness and quality.<br /><br />Since my excitement going into the first movie was low and I came out wildly impressed, I decided to keep the same level of optimism for Retaliation.  This movie was awful.  First off, Channing Tatum dies within the first 20 minutes.  The only semblance of dialogue and actor chemistry in the movie came in the form of Tatum and The Rock.  Instead of letting this develop...they apparently didn't have the budget to allow it since it was spent on terrible CGI...Tatum gets killed and the main character role is left to The Rock - and unlike his muscles his acting was soft and weak.  Let's also not forget how they completely forgot to discuss the transition of the team used in Rise of Cobra and in Retaliation.  Jamie Foxx's look-alike is no where to be seen, nor is he even mentioned.  Heavy Duty is gone.  Scarlett is gone.  The lack of ANY transitioning was pathetic.<br /><br />I realize this is a different producer from the first...but they could have at least acknowledged the previous film and its characters.  After Tatum dies, the movie continues its epic free-fall into mediocrity and beyond.  The supporting cast is weak and no character development occurs.  Flint?  I bet you don't even know who that is (he's apparently a Joe, although I didn't see a single unique or special quality throughout the film. Perhaps he was there to help make Dwayne look better in his XS-Under Armour skin tight tee?).  As sad as I am to say it, Bruce Willis didn't even show up for this movie.  He just collected a pay check, read his 20-some odd lines and did some super slow-mo action shots that the viewer can tell isn't really that dangerous.  To top it off, Snake Eyes apparently got an apprentice?  No development here, again, and then a stunning lack of clarity on the characters purpose save for her looks.  The only 'touching' part of the movie, in my mind, was when Snake Eyes has to fight alongside his life-long enemy, Storm Shadow (who apparently didn't kill their master all those years ago, thus making Snakes Eyes look like a fool for his life a silence - again, really?).  But that wasn't enough to make the forced storyline seem natural or likeable.<br /><br />This review could go on an on about the movies pit-falls - but I'll keep it to three paragraphs.  Case end point: Do no watch this film.  Do not purchase this film.  Pray if there is a third installment it is produced by someone else and the original GI Joe flame manages to find its way back onto the screen.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Always been a big Final Fantasy Fan, so this App ROCKS! If you love the game, it is worth the $$$
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Another great read by Nesbo. I think Harry shows more emotion in this book than in the subsequent books. He's a tragic figure! Favorite phrase &#34;I'm going to (learn to) breathe under water&#34;.  I enjoyed this book. Sure the subsequent books are more developed and the &#34;who done it&#34; is more suspenseful. This is still a great read. Interesting, fast paced, and interesting beginning to the tragic Harry tat we le
B006Y5H74W|5.0|A great TV series. While the twist and turns were somewhat predictable, the show still captures your imagination and is definitely worth watching.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so worth the money. I love how you don't have to pay for updates and now the new update has a whole new variety for kindle fire! I can't wait to use multiplayer too. I highly recommend you getting this amazing app
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|I don't know why this film got a bad wrap. I thought Sean Penn nailed it, and Ryan Gosling was made to play that character. They all were really. A story that's been told before, but I don't tire of it.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It usually works perfectly but when it's not there are really bad glitches where the screen goes completely black then starts playing unwanted videos. So far my only resolution is having to keep redownloading it.
B000IZ7YMY|5.0|Did I never hear of this movie?  It is excellent both in story and acting.  Definitely one of Heath's best performances.<br />Few movies have a good story behind them, but this is certainly the exception to that thought.  Amazing that it slipped by good advertising.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book because it was my girlfriend's favorite. I never really read that often, but after she passed away, I decided to read it and it is by far my favorite. I would recommend to anyone.
B001DPDVE8|3.0|Probably wouldn't watch it again. Effects were so-so. Not a great story. Didn't add anything to the whole Galactica story line.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a very good calculator it's the best caculater app I've ever used plese it's free most cost money
B009JBZH54|5.0|My husband was thrilled with this! This series is definitely going down as a classic. The setup of this set is aesthetic and of course the movies are awesome.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|This is a classic city vs. country drama set in Great Britain.  When I'm tired of reality and bad news, it's fun to watch something nice and predictable.  The scenery is very pretty, too.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|good story lots of fun , all about growing up and believing in more than we can see with our own eyes
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Happy this came out in HD. Can't believe how many haven't seen this yet. Been enjoying it since it first came out, long before Capt. Jack Sparrow, Goonies win. Hey You Guys!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's addicting!!  When I can't find anything else on regular tv, this is my go-to.  I don't want to watch all of it too soon because then it will be over.  I don't want it to end!
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Like Dawkins' other books on Evolution, this captures the excitement and awe-inspiring nature of scientific discovery.  It provides a clear, irrefutable exposition of a large sample of the millions of empirical discoveries which together make the theory of evolution by natural selection one of the cornerstones of the vast edifice of verified knowledge built by the application of the scientific method over the past couple of centuries.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can understand, it's a triology and now there is going to be 5 books. I love the realationship Eva and Gideon have. Such a good read. I can't wait till the next book. I recommend this book if you have read the 50 shades of grey books. Similar concept but honstley I like these books a little bit more.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|Which, of course, is to be expected since The Hobbit was the prequel to the LOR trilogy.<br /><br />Jackson's film builds on the same type of scenes and direction he used in LOR - but the plot is slow and plodding, interspersed with various fight scenes with mythical creatures, that become increasingly unrealistic, and rather tedious. It feels more like an opportunity to recycle the Lord of the Ring marketing to generate new revenue from The Hobbit, rather than a fresh approach.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've always wanted a horse so a virtual one is pretty cool instead. If you have or want a horse I would recommend this app to you.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This product version, including the black &  white and colorized versions is contained in a quite nice colorful DVD  package containing two discs.<br />In terms of the movie, it has a long history and has been fondly remembered by many. For us, this movie is what is playing when the tree gets trimmed each year.  The talent  and charisma of the actors, the pitch-perfect tempo of the well chosen dialogue, the  rhythm of each scene flowing one unto the next, the satisfying resolution of the plot climax are all reasons to accept this film as the perfect holiday classic that it is.
B00BBRPRDG|5.0|Wow was I surprised! Ok I didn't buy this release when it first came out because well, I'm stupid. There I said it -it was my own stupidity that prevented me from enjoying this sooner.  I've been a big Poco fan over the years but without Paul Cotton's participation I was expecting a Rusty Young solo CD with maybe a little Jack Sundrud thrown in. When I downloaded it and listened to it for the first time I was blown away. All Fired Up picks up where Running Horse left off and takes it up a couple of notches. Rusty's songs are spectacular (my favorites being \\"Regret\\" and \\"A Little Rain\\") but I have to say Jack and Michael bring a whole new element to their sound. It's Poco with a hint of Great Plains and the Brooklyn Cowboys.  Jack's \\"Hard Country\\" and \\"Long Shot\\" may be the best two cut on the CD. Jack's vocals are reminiscent of a younger Don Henley only smoother and his song writing is impeccable. I never realized what a great talent he is. At first Michael Webb's songs didn't necessarily sound like Poco to me but after a couple of listens they slide right into place lending a change of pace. And his musicianship enhances every song. I love the organ throughout. I don't want to leave out George Lawrence he is a great drummer and the new \\"backbone of the group.\\" Sure I miss Paul not being there anymore but I have to admit there are benefits. Jack gets the space and accolades he deserves for his stellar work and Rusty is playing more pedal steel!  He truly is one of the very best at it. Are you sure you're not Neil Young's brother? There are times when I'm listening and swear its vintage 1970's Poco. So guys forgive me for my ignorance you surpassed my every expectation. Can't wait for the next one, I'm all fired up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game..really addictive game...I feel like a big kid...I just wish it was a little bit faster tho
B0063IH60K|5.0|good way to waste some time and the ads are easy to dismiss. all in all this is well worth the money you pay for it. who says free is never any good
B0041KBWM0|5.0|The acting was exceptional. Johnny Miller, now seen on the new Sherlock Holmes series, set in New York, shows his serious side in Emma. My wife and I really enjoyed the back story material that fills in some of the gaps in the original story. The amount of poetic license was acceptable and kept to the overall story line. We really enjoyed it and recommend it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I really like this game I even let my son play on it, he likes to fling them off the screen he laughs real hard.
0765322889|2.0|Been reading this book for about a month now and I am only three fourths of the way through I never take this long to finish a book.  I just don't give a damn about these characters.  Who's good and who's bad I sure as hell can't tell.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|From the moment a friend mentioned that Mark Russinovich had written a novel, I knew that's what I wanted to spend the next few days and nights reading.<br /><br />As it turned out, the novel has a Kindle edition and it took me just a day and a night of undivided attention to read through it.<br /><br />Russinovich is a legend in the field of security and forensics and the novel reflects just that. There are no punk hackers typing a few keystrokes and breaking into NSA, no \\"override granted\\" after 2 attempts at a password and none of the stuff that makes Hollywood cyber security movies unwatchable. The concerns expressed here are real, that motivations for destruction go beyond bragging rights, that the western world is more susceptible than we can imagine and that government ineptitude and bureaucracy trump all concern and reason.<br /><br />This is an excellent depiction of the challenges incident response and forensics personnel face in the real world. If you are a practitioner, read it to glimpse the challenges that lurk around the corner. If you are not in the computer security field, read it to see why these practitioners are doing all of us a great service. In either case, the novel is fun, action packed and thoroughly enjoyable.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|yum! What could be better than watching Clint Eastwood young and sexy! Enough said. This went right into my Clint collection.
1400052173|5.0|My book arrived in excellent condition. This is an amazing story! Rebecca Skloot skillfully weaves medical information and familial history, allowing the reader to move easily between procedures and passion for Henrietta's life.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|I hadn't read any of the reviews - hadn't read the book and so I ENJOYED this period piece and I thank Amazon for including it on the FREE WITH PRIME streaming list!
B009WUBERW|5.0|I enjoyed the many well know actors who played a part in the movie. For anyone who likes action movies this was fun to watch knowing that some parts would be beyond real but entertaining. It is fun to see all these people working together. It is not a Academy Award type of movie but that does not make waste of time but after years of watching these people make action movies you know up front what you will get and they delivered.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|This is probably my favorite app for my kindle. It's fun, it's easy and the ranking system gives it endless replay value. HOWEVER, the game freezes up like crazy! The only way to clear it is to force the browser to close, which causes you to lose your progress and any power ups you use. Despite this, the game is cheap and the controls are very responsive. Hopefully, Sega will release an update to correct the other issues and make this a 5 star game.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good show.  The premise is a little far fetched but the acting is pretty good and the story lines are entertaining.
B005LAIHCW|3.0|I was disappointed with this movie, the trailer had most of the interesting parts of the movie.  I would not recommend this one.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|Great blend of mystery, humor and romance with an on-going backdrop of serious drama as Castle and Beckett off and on investigate the conspiracy that led to her mother's death.  It's sort of &#34;Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum meets 'Murder She Wrote&#34;.  The show does a nice job of being serious one moment and offering laugh out loud humor. We chanced across reruns of the series on TNT a couple of months ago and got hooked. Already purchased Season 5, too.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Absolute gem of a movie with advice for all about how to grow old and still follow your passion. Skilled directing from Dustin Hoffman and glorious acting froma stellar cast!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|First off... I didn't finish the movie. I got half way through and decided to turn it off bc it was not keeping me interested. Kinda sad bc The Wizard of Oz is my all time favorite classic and Wicked was awesome as well. But in this one the acting seemed weird. Almost like they were trying too hard. The setting and plot seemed good but If only the acting was better maybe it would've been a new favorite
B004SBS8LA|3.0|The thing that bothered me the most was the caged birds in the smuggler's part of the game.  It would upset me when I couldn't get all of the birds free!
1401235425|5.0|Although a supporter, if not fan, of The New 52, this Batman story is very good. It's one of the top ten Batman stories.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|They did do a good job of setting up the Avengers characters for the future. After that it's just another action/adventure movie.
B00127RAJY|4.0|If you haven't worked out for a few days and you want to get back into the sych, this will work. The legs are easy but the upper body demands are not. I would like more attention to abs.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Max Larkin and Jesse Fairlaine are serious characters. I was reminded in \\"Time Killer\\" of one of my favorite all time authors ED McBain. In similar McBain fashion, Todd Thiede weaves a wonderful tapestry of intrigue and thrills that had me feeling like i was a third person observer on a nearby corner. \\"Time Killer\\" was an intense ride that I am glad that i thumbed a ride for.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|Imagine Professor Henry Higgins as a quadriplegic.  Or maybe Richard Gere in Pretty Women in a wheelchair?  Either way, this rags-to-riches story relies on tired stereotypes and trite sentimentality to communicate a message about humanity.  The conversation about end-of-life choices is a real and worthy issue that needs addressing.  Unfortunately, that bit of humanity was somewhat obscured by a story that was awkward and trite and implausible. I hate to be a literary wet blanket, but I have a hard time appreciating stories about handsome young men rescuing poor, uncultured women. That's a tired story line . . . even if the handsome young man is in a wheelchair.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I watched the whole season on one weekend, it's funny and sweet, I really enjoyed it and recommended to my friends.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|Don't spend money for this app.doesn't work like it should confusing.I deleted e-mails that I didn't want deleted. Thought there was folders for e-mails,couldn't find them. I deleted this app
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such a wonderfully entertaining show.  Well acted and so fun to transport back to a time so beautiful and different.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Different from the usual grisham books but every bit as good. Was fun to read and brought more than one smile.  Light reading but also a page turner. If you like his books you will love this one.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Very entertaining twist on the classic Jack and the Beanstalk tale. Great special effects, story line, and cast. Definitely a must see.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It was a great book. I could not put it down, it was another great book in the series.  I cannot wait to start the next one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it, except the last minute but ready for season 4. I watched all three seasons in about a week and I'm in love with the show and now speak in a British accent!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|I like but I can't talk to him and  plus there isn't a Mic to talk to him with I really don't get it
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|If a film can be elevated to such levels of greatness as the renowned operas of past, this one can do it. Far better than any heavy Wagnerian opera and not having the incest and patricide of said same, it strikes at wars' critical heart where military leaders may at times in our history remove the obvious answer to the problem at hand for the sake of command authority. Kurtz is right but Kurtz is crazy. The war itself was crazy but keep alive by the high level commanders even though the lower level officers and soldiers knew better.<br /><br />The most ominous poisonous effect of war is best exemplified by Martin Sheen's beginning narrative. The effects of the war destroys his marriage  (as many then and now) are not provided a way to decompress from the stress of war. So he returns with no family, no friends and no peace in mind,  only his duty. No winning of hearts, no peacekeeping and no mercy, he is an assassin.<br /><br />The drugs are there, the razor thin nerves and eventual tragic mistakes are there, all with masterful strokes of smoke, light and music produced by a crack team of analog effects specialists.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|enough said! I was hesitating choosing between FX Amd's and Intel. Finally, decided to go with i3 3220 and I am very pleased with my choice!
B005USZYDU|5.0|My oldest grandson, soon to be 12 loves the Theodore Boone books. I too enjoy the great stories with wonderful moral lessons. A must read for the kids in your family. Great birthday and Christmas gifts.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Great to see all those aging action heroes together in one film.  Entertaining to say the least; it certainly did not lack for violence.  I'm sure I will watch it again.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is an entertaining rather simple read that brings a new twist to the age old idea of class societies and government control.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Reva Aslan is a Muslim who wrote a book saying what Muslims have been saying about Christianity for hundreds of years. He is being lauded and his book promoted because his intention, and the intention of the promoters, is to undermine Christianity. Nice try, no cigar.<br /><br />Sure, he can read Koine Greek, so can I. However, his analysis is worthless because he replaces facts with Islamic opinion. He thinks we should dispense with the Gospel of Mark because it was written 40 years after Jesus's death. It too 150 years after Mohammed's death for the Koran to assembled. I trust Aslan will dispense with it.<br /><br />This book is a book of lies written with intent to undermine and to foster the Islamic claim that Jesus was just another man, and there is no god but Allat, the moon god.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I find it hard to get into a story when the author uses the same word three sentences in a row. I also find it hard to read when a character wishes for something and one or two paragraphs later it magically appears. Her favorite phrase is &#34;He couldn't believe it...&#34; Don't waste your money. There are better fantasy novelist out there...
B0083Z614S|5.0|Will be my favorite book. The magic in it is timeless! The story still applies today, maybe more importantly than ever.
B00846REIS|4.0|Was looking for something to fill the void from 50 shades of Grey. It did a pretty good job, even though it seemed like the main characters progressed rather quickly but it still hooked me in. But I do agree with another reviewer, everybody was overly good looking, it did take away from the 'realness' of the story. But all in all it, it had good storyline and I'm ready to read the next one!
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I love this author and this series!  I like this book very much, but he's written other's I like better.  The Sigma series thrillers should be read in order!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It would be more fun if it didn't constantly want you to purchase tokens so we just keep hitting reset and playing it over and over again that way.  We'll never advance but we're not buying tokens either (they're not cheap).  That's the only reason for 3 stars, otherwise it would be 5
B00C7NKPPS|4.0|I owned the LP version and almost bought one of the overpriced earlier versions on CD, but something told me to wait rather than spend upwards of $100 for a CD set that some claimed to offer questionable sound quality. So, wait I did, and I'm quite pleased with the sound quality of this newly released edition.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I am a Star Trek fan anyways and this series did not disappoint.  Neat how several of the people from this series were on other great shows like Trip shows up on Stargate Atlantis as Michael.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I am so glad I made this purchase.  I love Lt. Columbo.  Can't get enough of watching these episodes.  Rest in Peace Peter Falk........
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its so realistic. It feels as if I'm caring for an actual horse. just an amazing game and I hope it only gets better
B00BUWY74M|4.0|Overall a solid primer on multi-sport training.  The planning process provided is well thought out and logical.<br /><br />The book is slightly dated and needs to be revised with regard to the authors current stance on electrolyte consumption. I found the product placements (advertisements for a Endure and Training Peaks) a little repetitive biased.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Just when I find something to pin, the screen goes blank.  When I return to Pinterest the pin is gone.  Very frustrating.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is a great series. Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen are mesmerizng. The acting is subtle, which makes the story all the more intense (if a bit gruesome).
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|it is a show off I hate  it.it freezes up easy its a horrible game. And takes forever too load.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|works well lets you print pictures or documents with settings including double sided under settings  directly from tablet<br />also adds  share to printer
B00992CF6W|5.0|The realms name picker suck when you choose your name first someone has the name you picked then it says wrong stick with letters and numbers and -. if you're having the same problem I told you so
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I sincerely enjoy playing the weekly tournaments and also the story games.....thank you for the entertainment &#60;3 This game helps me vent!!!  LOL
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 5 and 7 year old love Subway Surfer, and as a mom, I like that they can play a game that isn't violent.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Like the series, there were times when I wondered if this would ever end but overall I enjoyed this book very much and felt it was an appropriate ending to the series.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|The movie was really slow and only about the 13th amendment.  It became redundant.  The screen was really dark, to show candle light I suppose, but it made it hard to see what was going on and was visually boring.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is fun!i like it but i give a four because its sometimes boring when you unlock all the things.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The actors in the movie told the story extremely well, making it better than the book, which is unusual.  Just seeing the scenes with the actors added details.
0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins is an enormously courageous man to publish the God Delusion, even have to endure vitriolic diatribes or perhaps death threats from religious fanatics. I find it hard to disagree with anything he says, but the book could have been more complete and exhaustive than it is. He should have mentioned Hume's disproof of the Design argument as a false analogy. Also offering more refutes to the argument that the Big Bang requires a god to initiate it. I dare say Richard Dawkins is a modern day prophet
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the struggle to make my way through the rooms.  Looking forward to more fun with new rooms in the future.  Enjoy!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I bought this after reading 4-Hour Body.  So I guess I am a fan.  So many great things in here that have nothing to do with cooking.  We can't all live the life of Tim Ferriss, nor do we necessarily want to, but we can benefit from the nutty things he does to himself.<br /><br />Can't wait for 4-Hour Next.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|I loved it, but then I am a trekkie and much prefer the original cast to the newer cast of Startrek.  Great effects!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I love the Sigma Force series!  I hope there will be more to come!  Rollins is superb in every way!
B005MMZ63C|4.0|It's easy to see why this movie is considered a classic.  If you can get by and laugh at some aspects that are clearly of a bygone era,  you will enjoy movie night with this one.
B00005QK3W|4.0|I never liked this album. I'm not sure why, but until recently it was one of my least favorite Paul albums, (Press to Play holds that distinction) Recently, after seeing Paul in D.C., I decided to give it another listen. I thought, \\"Hmmm, not as bad as I remembered\\", then another listen, and I thought, \\"Actually, it's pretty good,\\" then finally, \\"Wow, this album is fantastic!\\" The music especially is very muscular, tight, and honest. The vocals are all at least good, and often great. The album overall has a very unique sound, and maybe that's what put me off initially. Whatever the reason, I'm really glad I gave it another listen. Now I just can't wait for the new one in 2013, and HOPEFULLY the release of Let It Be on blu-ray.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|My favorite band has returned (be it with a new singer) but they are back or should I say reborn with new front man Todd La Torre.<br />It's been a few years since the band has put together a good album, this one is not good but great. This record takes me back to their early years. Can't wait to see them live.  Sorry Geoff and good luck.<br /><br />Jose
1455519006|5.0|What is there to say?  Baldacci writes an interesting and intriguing story no matter the genre he chooses.  I always choose his books.
159463176X|3.0|This was a good read overall.  I really liked the introduction and the flow of the beginning chapters.  Overall there were too many characters and not enough detail to their stories.  Unlike Kite Runner, where despite all the hardship and challenges, the book left you with hope.  This book left me with the feeling of \\"huh???\\"  There was no hope and not a real story line. I kept reading and hoping that I would read more about the sister that was left behind in the mountains.  Hosseini did a good job of keeping the story going but I didn't feel a bond with any of the characters, like I did with his other two books. I wish there was less characters and more depth to each story line.  Next book idea :) --Please write more about the sister left behind in the mountains...
B00CAUHF6U|5.0|I bought this book because I realised that I did not know that much about Nelson Mandela (I was only a kid when he was released from prison). This is is a long book but it is very easy to read and I could not put it down. This autobiography gives a great insight into a man who sacrificed his personal happiness to fight against the oppression that Africans suffered in apartheid South Africa. I cried when I got to where he was released from prison.<br /><br />Nelson Mandela is an inspiration to us all.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This movie is not your typical fairy tale . I bought this movie for the action but it turned out to have a excellent story line and some good acting.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This film showed a transformation in a man from a life of violence and greed to a repentant servant of God. The point in the film when this violent man is forgiven by those he hurt most is one of he best parts of this movie but there so many more.  It was so moving and inspiring and heartbreaking at times. the musical score moves you to tears.  All around wonderful film 5 stars!!
B00CFA222M|3.0|This movie showed great highlights on the commercials but lacked any excitement on screen. very slow and<br />did not get much better.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So affordable. $35 for a nice device and 3 months of Netflix (~$24). I'm looking forward to try this device out on my TV.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|It gives you the history of OZ and explains the wizards start in Oz. I was worried I would not be able to show this to the grand kids age 4 and 2  but it was not scary and all else made it a very entertaining movie for the whole family.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I love Eric Clapton's guitar playing, and Steve Winwood's Hammond B3 is out of this world.  A great combination of Blind Faith, Traffic and their respective solo careers.  I don't understand how I hadn't heard about this concert  earlier.  Highly recommend this to fans of good music.
1451695195|5.0|We all wonder what comes after we resign this life.  Eben Alexander had a unique experience that transformed his paradigm of life and eternity.  This well written account of his spiritual encounter will entrance anyone with even a passing interest in spiritual reality.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I just can't wait for Season 4 :)<br /><br />This series is so addicting!  I don't know what I will do after I catch up and have no more to watch!
B0038ZITIE|5.0|The comic book aspect of the movie could not be missed, with the bright colors...wide eyed innocence of Flash and leading Lady.<br />In the 80's it was ahead of its time.
B0031KC8OC|5.0|Amazing writing and compelling characters. Utterly believable dialogue and plots. Outstanding acting by the cast and some interesting guest stars in individual episodes. We're going to add Seasons 2 and 3.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Perhaps this game has an unfair advantage because I LOVE the Despicable Me movies?  Either way, I love those little yellow minions and this game is fun...and addictive!<br /><br />If you are also a fan and like Temple Run, you'll enjoy this game!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is an all around fantastic production. The set, acting and cast makes Vikings must see. Although the show is typically considered more Game of Thrones than Spartacus, it doesn't touch the complexity and character development of the former, rather employs great fight scenes similar to 300 and incorporates an impressively good looking cast (Travis Fimmel who plays Ragnar Lothbrok, the show's hero, was the most successful male model of the past decade). I admittedly binge-viewed this show and am left slapping my veins in anticipation for the next season.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just finished last book of trilogy THE HUNGER GAMES  .LOVED ALL THREE.  Expect to see all movies. I have not read so many books in years. Couldn't put them down . Always wanted more.

B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I want to love and support Colleen Hoover -- God knows lots of people do. And I'm glad. I'm glad that an indie author has established such a loyal following. I am glad that she has found such amazing success. I think it bodes well for other authors with stories to tell. I just wish that this book had been more carefully edited. I spend my life editing other people's words. And to read a book and find a popular author using phrases like \\"would of\\" and then misappropriating words -- saying that she was \\"deduced to tears\\"... it tears my heart out. HOW did this make it past an editor? And if it was self edited... doesn't this author have enough success (and income) behind her now to fix these glaring errors?<br /><br />I wanted to find poetry in these pages. I found compelling characters. And a lot of loose ends and questions. When the protag was utterly alone, where was Six? Her best friend in all the world? What about Breckin? (And what kinds of names are these?)<br /><br />The story was there. It was twisted and compelling - well plotted. But it fell apart toward the end. And where I think Holder was supposed to be strong, he came across as possessive, almost bordering on abusive. Where he was supposed to be complex, he appeared to me as twisted and dark.<br /><br />I wish this book had been better written. I wish it had been well-edited. But it wasn't.

B000ID37RM|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a must see for every American both because of the rich subject matters and excellent acting.  Gregory Peck is brilliant as Atticus Finch.  I watched this with my family recently and like Casablanca and a few other classic movies, it did not seem  too dated or hokey despite the age of the film.

B0067R0APK|5.0|Easy to download, easy to use and set up.  Very comprehensive - as much weather info as you would ever need!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|The stories catch you and the acting is good.  I love the humor and the writing, but I find all of the characters not just regrettably flawed but immoral and despicable!  There is not one character that I would be friends with in the real world.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim is a should be a classic example of the best of the '10s films in a few decades. It probably won't be, since it didn't have terrific box office returns. But it exemplifies everything a big summer movie should be: great action scenes, naturally, but also fun characters, teamwork, an easy-to-follow but still gripping plot, and a sense of high stakes. In short, it's a fun time.<br /><br />The characters cover plenty of different countries -- America, England, Japan, Australia, and Russia have all contributed characters to the international robotic struggle against the attacks of giant dimension-hopping monsters from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The comedic relief characters are refreshingly integral to the plot: two mad scientists who bicker with each other while figuring out how to stop the monsters for good. Ron Pearlman plays a great bit as a snappy-dressing Tokyo drug kingpin, too. The characters aren't fleshed out strongly, as there's too much monster-punching to get to, but what is shown isn't cliche. The film's plot takes an inspirational Independence-Day-style approach, as everyone bonds together in patriotism for their planet, bolstered by a rousing soundtrack.<br /><br />The plot expands beyond just an endless stream of monsters, allowing the film to build to a climax beyond just the typical monster flick's bigger and badder fight -- although the climax is also bigger and badder on top of that. It doesn't happen on the top of the Empire State building, but I'm sure they're just saving that for the sequel.<br /><br />The drama is high: since it's an ensemble cast, there's a higher danger that main characters can die, and a remarkable amount do. The apocalypse is nearing, too, and since they've been at war for a decade before the film starts, the possibility that humanity might be wiped out seems real, too. It's this drama, combined with the fun of all-out, fresh, non-cynical robot-on-monster battles, that makes Pacific Rim my favorite film of the year.
B000USU9L2|3.0|When I saw it advertised, I harkened back to the time when I watched the series<br />on TV.  When it arrived, it was as advertised by the seller (no complaint there)<br />it was somewhat lackluster compared to the movies I am watching now.
1554072840|5.0|I had this book as a child.  I remember being so fascinated by it because it showed real poop!  Now I have a 2 year old daughter, and she is just as interested in it.  She reads it at least once a day by herself, asks me to read it multiple times, and has memorized most of the pages.  The real surprise is that, after weeks of reading this book, my daughter has started potty training herself.  We went through a month or so of torturous parent-led potty training, only to give up. At that point, I bought this and 2 other books, and started letting her watch potty training videos on youtube.  And voila!  I think this book has definitely played a part in her being interested to start using the potty.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|It was standard, predicable action but when you consider the amount of<br />time arnold has been absent from the screen, it was good.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is pretty good. It is easier than some escape games but still a challenge. I think its more interesting than 100 floors.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie was Tarantino at his best.  Sure, it was nasty and racial but the only<br />way to correctly portray how stupid and moronic the people were then.  The story<br />was very good; particularly well cast.  This is on the must see list.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway suffers is a really fun game to play for parents and kids.But be careful sometimes it can be tricky. That is why I like it and you can play it with your freinds that idle why I say subway suffers is cool.-v

B004RKXHZY|5.0|\\"I blame it on his pants.\\"<br /><br />If that hasn't done me in a time or two before as well.<br /><br />I was surprised how much I liked Anna and the French Kiss and I wasn't sure that I could make a connection like that again with another YA book, it is hard to rekindle that type of magic but I felt it all over again in a different way for Lola and the Boy Next Door.  No two love stories are exactly the same but this one gave me the same happy feeling that Anna and the French Kiss did.<br /><br />Lola and Cricket are such interesting characters and funny.  Lola dressing in a different outfit/costume every day is so interesting and daring.<br />\\"I don't believe in fashion. I believe in costume. Life is too short to be same person every day.\\"<br /> I liked that she was who she was, flaws and all and she was definitely flawed but in some adorable ways.  She was also dating someone who was completely wrong for her in so many ways, but he was the older cool guy and who hasn't got caught up in that once or twice.<br /><br />I absolutely adored Cricket and all of his idiosyncrasies, the rubber bands, the notes on his hand, the Rube Goldberg machines and even his hair.  They are gave him such great depth I was pulling for him from the beginning.  The fact that he is brilliant, shy, speaks with his entire body and completely kind were all just bonuses.<br /><br />\\"People should say what they mean and not make other people stumble around.\\"<br /><br />There is a whole picture painted of Lola's life with her gay dads, absentee mother and super sleuth best friend.  I enjoyed the entire story surrounding her.  Sure she made some mistakes but who didn't when they were seventeen and she seemed to have a little problem with the truth for a while but her character really had some growth throughout the book.  The thing I liked the best about Lola is that after one boy is out of her life she doesn't just jump in with another to fill the hole that is left there.  It was done in such a great way, she wanted to be completely herself before she gave herself to another person and I loved that message.  Plus it didn't come off as preachy or anything else it just seemed natural to her character.<br /><br />And now a Segway over to Anna and Etienne.  I was so excited to see them show up periodically in the book.  I had dreams of where they went after AatFK but it was so good to have them peppered into the story with Lola.  I glutinously enjoyed looking at them through Lola's eyes and just how perfect they still seemed.<br /><br />The storyline of this is cute, adorable, tender and really touching at times.  This is a great read if you need or want a feel good book.  After finishing it I felt very good about life, the moon, the stars and everything else in the world I might feel good enough to bake a pie.great way, she wanted to be completely herself before she gave herself to another person and I loved that message.

B000UUF69A|3.0|My kids liked it. My son of 3 and my daughter of 6. The monsters were a little intense. I would advise to watch it with them.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Look, all the functions it can provide are exactly the same as many similar products, i.e. an Android TV stick, like MK808 Dual Core Android 4.1 TV BOX etc.<br />This Chromecast does not release its spec, we wonder what are the processor and memory?<br />You wont know until it is physically released.<br /><br />Look at the price, very similar to its competitors. I am sure it is manufactured in China, lol !<br />We would like to trust Google's product, and it just costs around one third of an Apple TV, go for it!!!
B002JOUNDY|5.0|This is one of the best performances ever for both De Niro and Branagh.  The movie is said to be true to the book and is a real joy to watch.

B0046B8GEQ|1.0|I was hoping this movie would be better since they decided to have a sequel. It is boring and unpleasant. There are no characters that inspire me to keep watching. It doesn't have a heart. I only saw a short segment of it and was totally turned off. It is a waste of money.
B000002KE2|4.0|Of the first six albums, this 1972 release always seemed to fall through the cracks for me. After listening to this album again for the first time in a (really) long time, I realize that most of my hang-ups have to do with the production quality and the disjointedness of a few of the tunes. In all fairness though, the music has enough of the Black Sabbath \\"spirit\\" that I enjoyed it - even moreso than when I listened to this on vinyl as a teen.<br /><br />Overall, Vol. 4 is a decent example of the Black Sabbath sound: a bulldozer-like rhythm section, heavily distorted \\"power chords\\" played at a bone-crushing volume, and the distinctive vocal style of Ozzy Osbourne. Wheels of Confusion, Tomorrow's Dream, Supernaut, Cornucopia, and Snowblind are great examples of this.<br /><br />On the other hand, Black Sabbath had started to experiment with their sound by this point and make use of different tone colors - strings, mellotron, piano-this likely reflects the guitarist's increasing interest in progressive rock. The experimentation was alternately thrilling; the mellotron (with string setting) drenched and melancholy track Changes is my favorite Sabbath track, and less-than-satisfying; FX amounts to little more than Tony Iommi fiddling with the controls on his guitar and an echo box. Tony did compose the pleasant acoustic guitar track Laguna Sunrise though - this is one of my favorites from the guitarist.<br /><br />The disjointedness of Vol. 4 rears its head on the first track - the instrumental track The Straightener is unrelated to Wheels of Confusion and should have either been omitted or fleshed out into a full-blown song (it really is a catchy bit of music). There is also the haphazard sequencing of tracks; there is not much in the way of natural pacing to Vol. 4. I blame the producer (Patrick Meehan) for this sort of thing though, not Sabbath - even though they partipated in the production.<br /><br />The sound quality of this CD reissue is horrific - unfortunately, I no longer have my old LP so I can't do a decent comparison.  As far as the sound of the CD goes, the bass guitar is barely audible, the cymbals and high-hat are \\"splishy\\", and there are noticeable (unplanned) shifts in volume. The liner notes provide the track listing, and a few notes on the recording of the album.<br /><br />All in all, this is a pretty good album by the group that endures to this day in spite of a few (minor) shortcomings.  My understanding is that many of the band members were suffering from substance abuse problems at the time of the recording, so we are lucky that we got anything out of them at all.<br /><br />Although I have a preference for the first three studio albums, any of the first six are recommended to newbies: Black Sabbath (1970); Paranoid (1970); Master of Reality (1971); Vol. 4 (1972); Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973); and Sabotage (1975).  If you are just curious about the group, the compilation We Sold our Soul for Rock `n' Roll (1976) does a nice job capturing the highlights of these albums and is pretty cheap - come to think of it, about half of the compilation is made up of tunes from Paranoid and Vol. 4. Enjoy., I no longer have my old LP so I can't do a decent comparison.

If you are just curious about the group, the compilation We Sold our Soul for Rock `n' Roll (1976) does a nice job capturing the highlights of these albums and is pretty cheap - come to think of it, about half of the compilation is made up of tunes from Paranoid and Vol. 4. Enjoy.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have read the Fifty shades of grey series and enjoyed it, but this series I have enjoyed much more! I have read some terrible reviews regarding this book and I have to completely disagree! I have enjoyed each book a little more than the last. Don't let other people's negative review influence you, read it for yourself. I am really looking forward to the next book!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was a great account from someone who was there.  The book also explains the challenges and sacrifices that our special operations forces make so that we can enjoy our freedom here at home.  Must read for Iraq and Afghanistan vets and all Americans for that matter!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I finished Ender's Game wanting to know more about the fate of Ender, Valentine and the Buggers. Speaker for the Dead didn't disappoint, and in fact the drama is only deepening in Xenocide.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|We've seen Before Sunrise and also Before Midnight so we needed to see Before Sunset.  I didn't feel it was quite as good as the other two but it was worth seeing.  Ethan Hawke just didn't see like the right match for Judy Delpy.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Enjoyed the Northern England, Scotland and Ireland way of telling tales. It was so wonderful, the characters portrayed with such humanness pull you further into the story, the mystery. The true history and dates behind the story at the end of the book...horrible and heartbreaking. I am recommending this one to my book club!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This is my 2nd time purchasing one of these backpacks; the first time was 7 years ago.  I am pretty tough on backpacks so I was surprised how long it lasted, I cannot believe a backpack lasted for 7 years.  My coworkers noticed, so they bought the back too.  I highly recommend this product; it's spacious and and very durable.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this was a good app till it decided it just liked to force close and crash whenever I try to use it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics of this game are great and the concept is very cute and very fun. It is fun for any horse lover or and one just looking for something fun to do.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|never heard of this movie. overall a pretty entertaining film<br />Plus it's based in Los Angeles so as someone who lives in LA, it's kinda cool to see my city in a movie
B002HL3PN4|5.0|entertaining for all ages.  Watched the movie with my wife and we both enjoyed it. Will be watching more of the films in the series.
B009WUBERW|2.0|pretty bad movie overall. Nice attempt to put a bunch of stars in one movie, but the action scenes were non-believable
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Loved all the characters in this movie.  Can't wait until the sequel!!!  Hoping he can eventually get back to Earth!!!
0544002318|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend and as soon as I finished it, I planned to immediately read it again. The training tips and recipes are all amazing, but the commentary on running (and therefore on life) was amazing. If I was going to annotate this book, every single page would have a post-it note stuck to it, it is THAT good!
B002KLOPF8|5.0|A great story about Vietnam and boot camp. Loved the actors included in this film such as Vinnie and Lee.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very good show. Harvey is a boss. Constant pop culture references and good mix of humor and drama. Great show
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven pulls you right in to an inspiring love story filled with suspense. This book is a page turner and left me wanting more.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|If you are a guitar player or fan of the great players like Clapton, this is a must have in your collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Don't start this book unless you have a couple of days to devote to the story. The first book was compelling but Catching  Fire way more.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love everything Gaiman does.  This one is spectacular.<br /><br />From the deeply personal connection he clearly has to this story (read about his childhood experiences with a boarder committing suicide) to the fantastic, mystical elements, he weaves a masterful fairy tale clearly rooted in reality.<br /><br />Love.  It.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|I bought Electric Ladyland for somewhere around 15 dollars from amazon.  It is a classic record that any Hendrix fan should purchase, especially for the price.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|As a monkey, you jump through the vines to try to get your diamonds and bananas - some diamonds are hidden and if you jump past them, you can't go back down, so grab them while you can!<br /><br />It's fun, give it a try :)
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Nothing like the book. Tom Cruise is totally miscast as Reacher. The book was my second-favorite in the series but it didn't translate into a good movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think its. Better then fruit ninja no other game like this is better and i love the video its nice{updated}
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This movie smashes a new story line with the story line of the last Jason Bourne movie. A great overall action movie with kick ass stunts!
0143122916|3.0|Can't imagine in this day and age something like this going on in the world! But then, most of us have blinders on and don't see what's really happening.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is super fun, though it is a bit challenging. I love Despicable Me and this game just became a favorite!!<br /><br />It does take a while to download it initially but once you do, it's quick to play!<br />Be careful! ITS ADDICTING!
0316056898|2.0|Tina Fey may be very funny to some people, but her sense of humor does NOT humor me at all!
B008JFUR10|5.0|This is one of the only Summer films in 2013 that I enjoyed.<br /><br />Superman 'Man of Steel'<br />Iron Man 3<br />Were nothing but a studio micro managed mess.  Looking at the films you could see a checklist of ignorance coming from the big studios.<br /><br />Pacific Rim was a blank check to Del Toro and he held nothing back.  This was supposed to take you back to the good old days of Voltron, Godzilla, early Kaiju films (your youth)....and Del Toro delivered.  Oddly enough the Studio only insisted this be in 3D....and I am glad they did because it was amazing in IMAX 3D.<br /><br />If you want a film catered to your childish side and you want to share it with your kids....this is a winner.<br />If you want a marketing checklist...go see Superman, Iron Man 3.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about this is that there should have been more Jaegers....1 or 2 more with fights in say... South America and Russia would have been nice.
B00C2C637I|5.0|I've long cherished this novel, and I've often spoken quite highly of it. In fact, I'd say it's safe to label my \\"speaking highly\\" of this one as more along the lines of gushing. That's something I cannot help, to be completely honest. Something Wicked This Way Comes stole my heart, squeezed, released, opened a window in which to see all the terrors of death, aging, and the struggle to find one's identity as he grows and matures. It's a novel that will always tear at my inner fabrics, and no matter how many times I read this story, I can't help but cry, laugh, and perhaps most significantly, learn.<br /><br />That's what Bradbury did for me. He taught me things about myself, and he taught me things about life in general... what to grasp, what to let slip by on the breeze; what to remember, always, at all costs.<br /><br />Something Wicked This Way Comes appears to be a story of childhood freedom pushed into precarious positions that threaten to steal away youth, and life. Cooger and Dark traipse about the world, their traveling Dark Carnival a means to syphon all happiness from unsuspecting townsfolk, only to ensure their sinister reign never ends, and time itself never grows weary. This is an evil spectacle through and through, and now, two ambitious, adventurous young boys, Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway have found themselves a target for the leaders of this carnival, as they've uncovered what so many have missed before: pure evil and malicious intent.<br /><br />Death, veiled by the guise of man stalks these boys, and there's little hope of survival on the horizon.<br /><br />As enticing as that condensed summary may sound, the sincere magic in this tale doesn't stem from the physical threats proposed by the novel's antagonists, but the exploration and deep emotional examination of Jim Nightshade, Will Halloway and Will's father, Charles. Each personality differs from the other on a pronounced level, but Bradbury manages to interweave an unmistakable connectionand likeness between the three. Isolating a shining personality in the story is difficult as each character is illustrated in such believable fashion that it's no challenge to relate to all of them, though certain readers will unquestionably gravitate to specific personalities. These individuals are so true to human nature that they mirror non-fictional characters to a T and that makes for a sensation rarely dealt in the form of fiction based literature.<br /><br />Those with a penchant for the fast life, eager to reach the stars before his counterparts, be it selfish or not, will be prone to adopt Jim as a favorite player in this fantastical tale. Those prepared to live life to the fullest, and adhere to each passing moment while maintaining high regard for fellow man will absolutely love the boy known as Will Halloway. And, for those of us aging faster than we'd like (the clock can be a cruel, cruel device), who deeply miss the emotions that swim through the brain, blood and flesh of the carefree, will unquestionably take on an affinity for Charles Halloway, the somber father who harbors guilt rooted in the fact that he's aged far too much to relate to his son (or so he believes). Sadly, while I'm still a relatively young man, it's Charles who tugs at my heart strings. The passionate burden he's hoisted upon his own shoulders is deeply distressing, and his melancholy demeanor still haunts me, having read this masterpiece too many times to count. You see, I'm terrified of becoming Charles Halloway, even as amazing as he truly is at the core of his being (which eventually surfaces in the novels latter pages).<br /><br />Yes my friends, this is just as much a dramatic coming of age tale as it is horror. But somehow Ray Bradbury fused the two elements, creating a timeless tale that will forever hold sincere relevance. Regardless of time, location, way of life, cultural backgrounds... Something Wicked This Way Comes is a figuratively true story. It's a story that we've all lived, on some level.<br /><br />While I don't plan on delving too deep into the story's specifics (those familiar with my writing know I am about as anti-spoiler as one could possibly be), I will illuminate some chilling scenarios. Understand that this carnival houses not an ounce of purity, but a showcase of genuinely vile individuals, actions and some unsettling contraptions. The time altering carousel is exactly the thing that nightmares are made of: a mechanical device with supernatural powers capable of restoring age, advancing it, or on an occasion or two, completely exterminating it. The story boasts more than a single sequence to feature this hideous piece of machinery, and trust me when I say that riding this attraction leads to far more sinister outcomes than not.<br /><br />Numerous creatures, of all different assortments clutter Bradbury's tale, including a few personal favorites like the Dust Witch; capable of reaching into the inner workings of man, and exterminating, heartlessly, as well as disfigured, lifeless corpses proficient in harboring enough electrical current to sputter to life, just long enough to terrify. A nightmare world of mirrors shows visitors what is, was and could be, and while that may not sound remarkably frightening, imagine drowning in that world of distorted imagery, never able to escape the boy, man or woman who entered. These concoctions are harrowing, and the last thing I can imagine is being forced to actually face them: that is true horror.<br /><br />Something Wicked This Way Comes may (for me personally) never be surpassed as the greatest work of fiction ever written. I only hope that those foreign to the story can find the courage to enter a world filled with tears, terror and triumph. To miss the train is to miss a numinous experience.<br /><br />Written by Matt Molgaard from Horror Novel Reviews<br /><br />Horror Novel Reviews does not receive payment for any reviews.

B00COO2D6O|5.0|fool as awesome cool the ever it is the awsomest thing ever it is so cool yes it is for cool sit Dave hi cool
B005LAIHY0|5.0|It just is a very well done sci-fi movie, period.  I have seen much printed about arguing the storyline. Really?  Anyone who can write a more satisfying script is welcome to do so. We all look forward to your masterpiece that you think Prometheus is not.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can play MKV 1080 P<br />Netflix<br />Hulu<br />you name it you can play it without any issue good Job google keep it coming an the best thing is SDK for the Chromecast lot of benefits.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I know several people who have had NDEs.  Never have I doubted they happen.  I am so glad a neurosurgeon was brave enough to write this book.  Someone with the right credentials needed to write a book for all the doubting Thomases out there.  I could relate to a lot of the things he said simply through experiencing out-of-body instances, and also holding the hands of loved ones going through the dying process.  It is a wonderful book whose rapid rise to No. 1 on the NYT's Paperback Books Best Seller List could not be more deserved.<br /><br />It is also available in electronic format which is what I read.  Awesome!
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I always tried to figger Catherine out, but couldn't. There were a few surprises at the end. I usually like closure, but see this series continuing.
B002IVLH60|4.0|Has the song from an episode of Castle on it.  Like some of the songs, love the one.  Shipped on time, but the writing is Asian not english
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|So I have no idea why Amazon decided to remove my 1500+ Helpful Review. I have had this product for weeks so I was able to give more than just a short term insight. In fact, I like the idea of it so much that I ordered two additional through Amazon yesterday before they sold out (Google only gave me one to test with).<br /><br />Anyway, I was contacted by fellow Amazon shoppers to repost it - so here it is:<br /><br />I want to provide an honest review with an actual understanding of what and how the product works having had it for a couple weeks, without violating my NDA.<br /><br />Look - you can give your \\"Review\\" once you have in your hands. Make assumptions based off an uneducated guess or incorrect information just looks stupid, I'm sorry.<br /><br />What it Is:<br />It's a HDMI dongle that is powered by Chrome OS that is designed for Streaming.<br /><br />How it Works:<br />You have to connect to the same Wi-Fi network for it to work. Once it's setup you'll see the Chromecast logo and a basic Home Screen with some of the first apps available for Chromecast. A lot of development is going into it, so expect to see more apps from the Google Play store work with your TV. See your phone/tablet/computer more of a remote, rather than an actual streaming device.<br /><br />I only tested on the iOS side (I don't have a Droid) and I can tell you that it works very well. It is NOT like Apple's AirPlay where your screen is mirrored, but rather uses \\"the Cloud\\" to access your content. It works smoother than AirPlay because it doesn't require buffering from your device, but rather directly to the TV. The only \\"syncing\\" that occurs is the Cloud communicating to the Chromecast where you're at. For example: I'm watching a Netflix movie and I'm at 1:06:17. I hit the Square button with the wi-fi looking icon called \\"Cast\\" and it syncs it to my Chromecast. This is only different for web-browsing through the currently Beta Chrome Tab Cast, where it'll show exactly what you're looking on Chrome, onto your TV. It's less functional than straight up mirroring like the Apple TV, but it works. You can't switch between apps and have that show on the screen. This is particularly useful in web-based presentations or while you check your email and your friends are watching Netflix.<br /><br />Battery Drain on Mobile Devices:<br />Because of the way Chromecast works, it's streaming information from the Cloud vs. from your device. I noticed very little increase in the usage of battery on my iPhone 5 and my Macbook Air running Mountain Lion OSX.<br /><br />Support for Streaming Services:<br />Right now, Streaming Service support is limited. Netflix, Google Services (Google Play, YouTube) and Web-based Streaming is allowed. I had issues trying to load Hulu the past couple days, telling me that my browser was unsupported, but I'll update once I get a chance.<br /><br />Power Adapter:<br />The power adapter is an optional requirement. In fact, most modern TV's with HDMI 1.4 or higher spec are supported. The Chromecast can draw power from the HDMI port it's plugged into. If your TV doesn't support that, there's also a USB cable and power adapter included in the box. I have a 2012 LG LED and a 2013 Lenovo 27\\" Monitor with HDMI input and the ports power it with no cable.<br /><br />All in all, I feel like it's still a huge work in progress. The SDK will allow for some exciting developments, and I'm happy to say that Google has committed to support this device for quite some time. It gives me piece of mind that this won't become out of date each year.<br /><br />That being said, it's only $35. What a steal for a device that really brings value to any TV.
B005CI0V2M|5.0|I have two copies of this book, one for myself and another in our guest room.  Each story is a terrific read, and the length of the short stories is ideal for someone just wanting a light bedtime story.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|As usual, she was wonderful.  Reminded me of the British comedy, Waiting for God.  The music was just  wonderful.....<br />Can't wait for Maggie's next one.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I like the game play, but for some reason after playing for a couple of months, I lost interest. I start it up every once in a while and play, but its doesn't have the hold on me that it did when it was new.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great, truly innovative, and I can't wait to see the future possibilities im thinking Wii-esque, game displayed on tv with phone acting as controller all thru chrome. Google has done it again!!!
1781162646|5.0|A throwback to earlier Stephen King thrillers, Joyland is replete with local color, oddball characters, a smattering of sex, telephathy, and atmosphere that pours over you like the chill of a fall wind in late summer. It's salty and hot and lonely at times; it's a cockeyed dictionary of carny slang and a murder mystery that's impossible to put down. And, most of all, it's pretty darn scary.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|Two of the most beautiful people on the planet ever.  And then there is Alfred Hitchcock!  The scenery and the storyline are pretty good too.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The story was busy (too many plot lines) which would be ok if there was a resolution to each but there wasn't. The book ended abruptly without telling what happened to the major characters. Besides being choppy it was overwhelmingly boring.
B00000F214|5.0|The first time we saw this film, we put it back in and watched it again.  Absolutely in our top 10.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|I'm not a fan of Selena Gomez, but this album is so amazing. Is like a boom, all the songs are so cool and catchy it get stuck in your head easily.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Second season is the perfect time to expand the characters personalities while they develop deeper friendships as they interact with each other.
B00D3XAA4M|3.0|We love Lonely Planet guide books, but this one is not very useful except as a teaser for their more detailed city and country guidebooks.  Only useful for a college student or anyone going to Europe for the very first time.
B003L77FYS|5.0|The progression of Castle and Beckett's personal interest is delightful to watch.  The seemingly flaky writer has the capacity to be serious when the need arises.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It frozen up on me and froze my Kindle within the first 2 minutes of play. I called Amazon, they were great as usual, and I did a &#34;hard&#34; shut down. Got the Kindle working and took the game off. Don't have any idea what caused the problem. I have plenty of other games so it is not a big loss.
1419702238|5.0|I ordered this book for my son.  I was hesitant because I had not purchased from this seller previously.  We were able to buy here (price plus s/h) for less than at the local bookstore.  The book arrived within the timeframe that was indicated with only a small (less than half inch) bend on the edge of the back cover (sort of like what you get if you bump a book's edge when putting it on a shelf).  This was probably due to storage as the seller indicated.  Overall, great condition.  My son was very excited when the book arrived and pleased with the purchase.  For me, that makes it an excellent experience!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I do not often review, but this game is so different, fun, and challenging, I had to put in my two cents.  I loved the game play, the star rating, so you could choose how well and far to progress.  It is clean fun, slightly irreverent, but I prefer that to stuffy overly clean self righteousness. I actually got it as a free App of the Day... but will be looking for more from the Pixelizers. Great game.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have been in and out of the hospital.  This has helped me to keep my mind happy. I would recommend to others.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is for everyone! My whole family loves it! Grandma, grandpa, sister and mom. It's really addictive and I like how long the episodes are
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Got to love this 90s animated MTV original classic! Daria reminds me of the days when MTV was not full of trashy reality tv shows, when they still played music and had great writers who were creative enough to come up with shows like Clone High and Daria! Daria is my alltime favorite cartoon - adults only. Plus at this sale price $20 where could you go wrong?!?!?!
B00013M6NK|5.0|I bought a Nikon coolpix p510. Having an extra battery is a must and this battery works great and it keeps its charge for sometime.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well paced, riveting.love the whole trilogy. I highly recommend this book for teens and older.  Long live katniss everdeen,splendid!  Can't wait for the next series .
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was very similar to the movie, sleeping with the enemy, but I did enjoy it!  I was happy I read the book prior to seeing the movie.  I think they did an okay job with the movie, but I liked reading the book much better.  I guess that is how it usually works out, doesn't it?!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|After downloading this app with my grandson, it worked for a few minutes on my Kindle Fire, then the screen froze, my Kindle Fire became very hot, would not turn off, and then no longer worked. THE APP DESTROYED MY KINDLE FIRE!!!<br />DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. Just the right amount of romance and just the right amount of action.  A bit predictable, but enjoyable!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best.you can do anything you want to. I think they don't need money for this app
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Great product
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun way to pass some puzzle time as I am getting to know my Kindle touch screen. I`'ll play again and look forward to additional rooms.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|This was the best horror movie I've seen in a long time very realistic when it comes to the Gore
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Really loved this film.  Entertaining from beginning to end.  Very British.  If you like English humor, you'll love this one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book.  Would recommend to all ages and all dog lovers.  The ending was great as some authors do not end their novel well.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great series. Easy to watch and full of fun characters. Each episode is self contained and still moves the season along.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I almost got the Google TV, and cables to connect my Nexus 7 and Smartphone to my TV ... this products eliminated all that.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|U don't realize how much effort and sacrifice went into our founding fathers writing our founding documents and standing up for the principles of this nation. Compelling.
B000FC130E|5.0|Highly enjoyable.  Neil spins a detailed fantastical world unlike any you have seen before.  A really great action adventure tale.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Cool twist on an old story. The kids liked it too. So it was a good choice for the whole family to sit and watch.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rolllins is just about the nicest, down to earth author you would ever want to meet.  HIs books are fantastic.  He goes into things that are real and some that are not.....excellent adventures.  Love you James Rollins  PS  He has a web site and is on facebook.  He runs contests all the time and it is really him - not someone retending to be him.  He is the real deal and everyone should read his  books.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|Lacking in specific directions for playing the game.  A tutorial would certainly go a long way in making this a better gaming experience.
B0060MYM7O|1.0|The shipping box was ok, but the sealed collection box was all damaged, like it was packed that way from the manufacturer, the booklet was all messed up, and all the corners of the box were peeled, definetely not a quality product, do not buy it.
B008KP6ENE|2.0|I lost interest in this game very quickly; I have also removed it from my device.  I do think this is a game a young child would enjoy.
B0090SI4OC|1.0|Wooden acting, insipid plot, predictable dialog, lousy special effects, and characters you could care less about. Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. (And for the record, I liked \\"Twilight.\\")
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Just what was looking for, being able to place it in my top desk drawer and not take up a lot of space. Sharpened my pocket knife with just a few strokes. Very convenient !
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Best album since Empire. No filler, been in my CD changer a month, listen to it every day with no skips! I highly recommend! And the three live numbers are an awesome bonus.
B005LAII4E|1.0|The first one was a whole lot better I have no idea why most of the actors in this movie agreed to come out in it, besides enjoying the action scenes with snake eyes all I got from it were a couple of laughs.
B002S43V3Y|5.0|Such a brilliant movie script and the acting is terrific. I first saw this in a theater as a kid. This time I noticed something I'd missed through the years, that Maude had a Nazi death camp tattoo on her arm. It's so brief and unmentioned, adds a fascinating twist to the whole story.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|One of Jack's best with a great supporting role by Faye Dunaway. Also based on the true story of how the growth of Los Angeles was fueled by taking the water from the Owens Valley, which is now a toxic, alkaline desert, causing major health problems in the LA Basin.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I thought the movie was well made and Tom Cruise does his usual competent job of acting. But I've read many of the books so Tom Cruise just doesn't fit my image of Jack Reacher. Too good looking, too young looking and too small.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|The closed caption was a clincher and having served on a submarine gave my the MAIN reason to order it.<br />As we say DBF,  (diesel boats forever!!)
B004WJRJ90|4.0|One of my favorite albums from college.  Great to have it reissued on vinyl.  Does not include a vinyl pressing of the bonus tracks.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such a delight! Every character has something to offer...maggie smith is superb. ..dan stevens....hugh...best series in a long time!<br />Watch and enjoy!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Oh come on, the book wasn't that bad. Yes, a few unnecessary drama was added and the sex/love talking scenes were a bit much and long but if this book was the last book to the story, more than half her readers would of begged for another book. Almost every book I've read, all the fans have begged for an additional book or in the male characters POV. I'm actually happy and excited there will be two more books. I didn't want the book to end yet. Keep it up, Sylvia!
B004J2TPSI|4.0|After a short charge up it paired right up to my Runaway bluetooth stereo headphones. The sound is good but it won't transmit thru walls. Took it outside and got about 25 feet away before the signal started to break up. It's a little larger than the other iPod transmitters but I guess that's because it has it's own internal battery. Plugged into my Ipod shuffle it takes up very little room in my pocket. Overall I would recomend the Kokkia A9.
B00DU73T08|5.0|This was much more than I expected. My sister told me that the book was excellent and the movie did not disappoint!
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I have always like this album but cassettes are of the past so I had to get a cd for my car
B001JIDE3M|4.0|Not one of his better movies, but it is entertaining for Sci / Fantasy people. I have this as well  as the original with Pat Boone in it,<br />I still like the older version, like so many other remakes.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've had my Chromecast since July 29th and I still find it to be one of the coolest gadgets I own.  I was so excited when it was announced and  ordered it as soon as it became available.<br /><br />It was a snap to set up. I just ran set up on the ultrabook and the rest of the devices recognized it as soon as I turned them on. It does work beautifully with the Nexus 7 as well as with the Nexus 10, my ultrabook, and my desktop pc.  It was interesting to see that I could not only use the Nexus 7 for something else while the videos were playing but I could actually close it and the video just keep running on the tv.  It's so easy to move the Chromecast device to another tv too.<br /><br />We do have a Roku but the simplicity of being able to project something from your mobile device right onto the tv just by clicking the icon can't be beat.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I keep reading people complain about sticking with Edgar Rice Burrows book. Well, this is Hollywood people. I've seen the Princes of Mars with Traci Lords, and that's two thumbs and two toes down for me. Disney did their magic with special effects and made this way more entertaining. But it does get a little hokey some times. Kinda like there is always 10,000 Orkes, even after the other 10.000 was wiped out by the Fellowship.
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|From the onset this camera was problematic. When it wouldn't connect properly with the computer and the company did not respond to e-mail or phone messages, we returned it. We purchased the V-tec and am amazed at it's performance.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|if you like angry birds your going to love this one. its chalanging and you keep going back to make a higher score.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story line filled with tons of action, drama, and even a little romance. Will read again soon and recommend to anyone!

B006SV2LWA|3.0|Was not amazed by the movie.<br />Liked the thorough and well-thought plot but didn't like the end and the pace of the movie.<br />People who like to see movies involving pandemics, world threats, renowned casting and lots of different scenery.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I was in the middle of collecting my sand dollars and algae and the whole game just shut down and I haven't been able to access it for several hours... keeps saying the server can't be reached. I'm kinda pissed about this.....  other than that it is a great game and I play it daily. If they fix whatever is going on, I'll change my review to 5 stars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so challenging and fun.  A feal brain game. Bring on more levels!  Level 8 was the hardest i found. Great game.
159463176X|5.0|I love the author's writing of anything...........of course, this is his third book and I thoroughly enjoyed his last two...........
B001RHOJSE|5.0|Hannah Arendt was one of the great geniuses of 20C political and social thought. Though Eichmann in Jerusalem is not her most profound work, this piece of world-historical reportage is certainly a masterpiece of insight into the ominous transformation of social being in our time. She should have won the Pulitzer Prize for journalism when this work appeared in the New Yorker. And the New Yorker deserves commendation for having dared to publish it in the form she originally wrote it. The book deserves 5 stars to be sure.
1401907725|5.0|I love these oracle cards.  I start out my day with them and show anybody who comes to my home what they;re all about.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Being an electronics engineer by trade I looked at the specifications for this unit which look great and definitely up to Hi-Fi/home theater standards, other units by contrast have no specifications so you don't know really what you're getting. When the unit arrived it worked first time with no problems, my unit runs cool and the audio quality is excellent, a few months on and the unit is still working perfectly so I'm glad that I purchased this unit. One hint for anyone using any unit of this type is to ALWAYS apply power to the digital to audio converter before turning on the DVD player, this is because if you don't there is the possibility of latch-up damage to the converter which would then cause overheating. To prevent this I have the converter and blue ray player plugged into the same power strip with an on/off switch so that it is impossible to apply power to the blue ray player without the converter. I highly recommend this converter.
B0036SSZIC|1.0|I hated the fact that I was NOT able to view this. When I tried to open this on my Vizio TV It said the movie had expired or was over the limit. I tried several times. I have ordered DVD from Netflix so I don't need a copy. I will look for a credit to my account of $3.99. Cathy Burton
B00C2VIA52|4.0|good game fun to play. reminds my of magic and other good card games. needs to just be a little easier to grow faster.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My daughter and I exclusively watch Downton Abbey together- we love it. I hope they come out w: many more seasons.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is the first in the Hopeless series<br /><br />I've read both books in one week (Hopeless & Losing Hope), that should tell you how incredibly addictive these books are! Dean Holder is one of the best characters I've read. He's my latest book crush, handsome, caring, and with a rough past.<br /><br />He met his match with Sky, and her heartbreaking past, that she doesn't even remember. Sky is headstrong, caring, and intuitive.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil the plot for those of you who haven't read Hopeless (and why haven't you?!)<br /><br />You need to read these books, fans of YA romance, adult romance, and basically all YA lit will love these books! They are raw and real and heartbreaking and uplifting! There's no emotion left unshared in these books, and no heartstring left unpulled. You'll be crying with Sky, laughing with Dean, and cheering for their love and the power of love.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Great book to help you build you Kindle e-book. If you want to learn how to build your Kindle book get this its a must.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I really enjoyed the latest Bond film, Skyfall.  This is the best in long-lived series, by far.  A well told story that gives us some rare insight to Bond's background. Terrific action/chase scenes. An incredible opening chase with incredible, over-the-top action.  Daniel Craig is simply the best Bond ever, and simply at his best in this one.  I don't know how they'll top this, but I look forward to the next installment.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and entertaining game. Fun for all ages, my children are all different ages enjoy this game. Would recommend this for just about any age.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I think this can sweep off Apple TV. The design, price are amazing. Looking forward to plug and use it.
B002CPD5LM|1.0|Super Old school Artists and music, outdated, think  liked only one song in whole DVD, Production Quality was good though if you like this genre of music.

B00AL6SM0S|4.0|According to the blurb in the box, these recording represent a &#34;golden age&#34; when all singing was fantastic, everyone was in his or her prime, and that nothing like it has been seen since.  The Mezzos and Altos are fine. When the tenor is Melchior it's a golden age, but when Wotan is sung in a pale, tired voice by Schorr, I remember that I was lucky to hear James Morris in the same role--with his Italianate warm sound and his great skill onstage as an actor.  I can't imagine that Schorr had as much skill or beauty of voice as Morris.  I have absolutely no criticisms of Melchior; he's the best singer imaginable in the rep.  M. Lawrence (whose leap onto the horse seems to have been her main claim to fame) sings every high note flat. Flagstad always had pitch problems, especially when those pitches were above the staff in her upper register.  Anyone looking for rock-solid high notes will have to listen to Nilsson of more recent fame, and the other great ladies of our time.  The booklet blurb sounds like a competent advertising firm wrote it. It's nice that they got the names right, but as a description of largely mediocre performances with desperate sounding sopranos and very fast conducting from Leinsdorf do not inspire me to think of the 30s and 50s as a golden age for anything except the usual ranting and raving from people who don't know what pitched singing sounds like.  The Old Met sounds great--much better, fuller, louder than the New Met--which is too big (same number of seats in twice the space).  The mere loudness makes for excitement, but the excitement fades when Lawrence and Flagstad sing one flat note after another.  People should remember that if Wagner wrote a B natural, and the soprano sings a Bb, then she has sung a wrong note.  The violins and the horns can't get away with this, why the sopranos? This review is good news for Nilsson, Jones and Rysanek. It's less good for the box.  Perhaps &#34;Legendary Mediocre Performances from the Metropolitan Opera&#34; would have been a better title.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Very good!  I have enjoyed most of Lee Child's books and look forward to the next twist and turn.  Each one seems to have a unique adventure for the reader.  Love his books.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Actually didn't get to play it on my kindle cause its not letting me download ,but i played it on my phone ,and ots a great ggame to have time pass
B005544TRQ|5.0|Clever, Fun, and the cast has some great chemistry! I usually don't like lawyer shows, But this show is a blast to watch!
0062255657|3.0|I enjoyed the first part of this book (book?). It gave me the chills. I was frightened for the narrator, a little 7 year old boy who sometimes sounded a lot older than that.I enjoyed the quirkiness of the characters also. Anyway, by the time I reached the second half, I said to myself, \\"Just too over the top.\\" I couldn't buy it even as a fantasy or fairy tale and wouldn't buy it as a book.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums by The Killers. I really like all of the songs and it's just a great album.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Omg i love this game so much i could play it for hours if i could anyway please buy it its worth the money trust me and the other reviews
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This lets me know where I am at any time.  When reading a book it lets me know when it is time to charge so I can finish when I am getting to the end and I don't want to put the book down.
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|I.  can  not  get enough of this movie I love Audry she is just  great. I watch with my son who know as become a Audry fan and has is only 13. Love old classics.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My daughter loves the Panda games and this one is a hit as well. She plays it everyday. I recommend this game.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Disappointed at how fast the diamonds run out. Graphics are good. Quests are too short. I would not pay for this game.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was the most epic and extraordinary first book of series it made me glad to have read action books today
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. The graphics for this game are unreal. However it doesn't allow me to sync with facebook. Any ideas?
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Oh. My Gosh.  I don't even know where to begin with this book.  It may be just as or better than the first one.  I'm starting the third book right after I finish with this.  This book is just amazing.  I can't even start with how awesome it was.  This book made me fall inlove with the characters that much more.  I personally thought that this book had more action and suspense in it.  I'm assuming it may be because there were so many more demons.  It just kept me right on the edge. You have to LOVE this series.  I know I'm sucked in.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This series is for sure going to be one of my favorites. It draws you in from the very beginning and then it just makes you want more. This is the first book I've read from this author and she is AMAZING! She has a great imagination with the details of this book. I will say... it has some shocking parts. Every time I think I have it figured out, it takes me for another loop. I am loving Jace, Alec, Luke, Simon, and Magnus. They are super awesome characters (definitely one of a kind). I would make Jace a new book boyfriend of mine too :) If you liked Twilight and Blue Fire Saga, you will love this series. I cannot stop from reading the next book. So much action, I want more. It was so hard to put this book down and I know it will be the same for the other books. This series is a MUST READ!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I'm pretty rough on my phone--this case gives all of the protection I need to keep it not only in good but in *pristine* condition! The audio quality is still great, as well. Better than without the case, even, since the case acts as a speaker box to amplify the sound.
B001NA6096|4.0|My husband and I were surprisingly happy with this little movie.  The acting is terrific and we could not wait to see the next installment, 'Before Midnight'.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I give this product 5 stars for both the fact that it does what is suppose to do and the documentation is superb. I use this device with a macbook pro laptop (OS 10.8) and was very impressed with how easy it was to set up and use with the great driver and documentation support that came with the device and is available on the manufactures website. Anyone who uses these adapters know that they can be finicky at times with questionable drivers and very little documentation.<br /><br />To sum it up this device works well, has good driver support, great documentation and a good price.
B00DU74U74|1.0|The fact that anyone found this movie anything other that awful is mind boggling to me. It made the Fast and Furious franchise look like a masterpiece. I'm not being dramatic when I say this was the worst movie I've ever TRIED to watch, and to quantify this, it was the only movie in my 31 years of life that was so bad, I couldn't finish it. I like Saoirse Ronan, the lead actress, so it was painful to watch her in something that was so thoroughly and outstandingly terrible. An hour of my life I wish I could get back...The story could've been written by an eight year old. The romantic aspect was extraordinarily corny and WAY too heavy handed...WOW this movie is BAAAAD!!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This series has just started the new season and it is as bright and witty as ever.  Will continue to follow.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Zac Brown Band is wonderful and this is a very good CD.  Love it.  Will continue to follow them anywhere.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It's been around for decades, now, but it still manages to keep me involved and re-reading (7th time). The characters and their struggles are the thrust of this work, the setting--a backdrop, the buggers--abstract menace and a poignant mirror. Coming back, I realized the children weren't as interesting as the adults (obviously, because I'm old now). I think my only true disappointment on returning to Card's world was the absence of more hard science to flesh out the fiction. Do not let that be a bar to reading this book, however. It is still a fantastic work, all the more because it has aged well.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|No go on the install.  Trired the solutions offered and they don't work.  I gave up as it is a waste of time.
0316056871|4.0|In true Tina Fey fashion, this book had me cracking up!  It definitely is a laugh out loud comedic novel.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Since the most recent update, the app is almost useless. The videos will not play and lock up the app. Still trying to figure the new layout and navigation.<br /><br />(Update. After removing and re-installing the app, it seems to be playing videos now. Would like a way to force it to my home location, as location services shows me 400 miles away. Had to turn off location services in the app, to stop showing the wrong location as my local weather.)
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was great!  Action and humor that never stopped moving.  Of course, the cast was packed with heavy hitters, so I wasn't surprised just very pleased.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app looked great and loaded my channels just fine but every time i click on a video it force closes
B001UV4XHY|5.0|My daughter and her family loves Harry Potter movies. I got this for her for Christmas.  She was really happy with it
B005PZ85SO|4.0|There were some episodes where the video player would skip forward by a couple seconds 1-3 times an episode. This was more of a minor annoyance than anything, but still something that should be investigated and rectified.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|After you see this documentary, you will never look at all the food in the grocery store the same, you will have an entirely viewpoint and it won't be a favorable one !  Seeing this makes one want to raise their own food, including beef / chicken / pork,1800's style !!!<br />No wonder their is a big &#34;back to the land&#34; movement these days !
B00023BLXK|5.0|It retells the story of the past. What happens betwen a young white woman and a young Cuban boy. Throw in some hot dancing and you've got another decent dance flick from my generation.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|If you like science fiction and you like war movies, you'll love this. It's amazing in both genres with an amazing cast and amazing action sequences as well with lots of suspense.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Always entertaining movie with non-stop action from begining to end.  Benji in the field brings comedy at just the right moments.
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|This was surprisingly a great movie to watch on movie night.  It had action, comedy and a little romance.  Something for everyone in the family.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|As usual Sylvia had me from page one.  So many twist to keep you rivoted to her stories. Can't wait for the next Crossfire novel
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much fun. It's not too easy but also not too hard. Logical and challenging -- it's lots of fun. Can't wait for more rooms to be added.
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|This epic is wonderfully directed by legendary film maker, Wolfgang Peterson. This film was way ahead of its day; inspiring other great submarine dramas such as Crimson Tide, U-571 ect. The whole movie is told from the German perspective of WWII, which is rarely seen in films today (especially in Hollywood).
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Creepers, Creepers, and more Creepers. Do you and/or your son play minecraft? Is your son addicted to blowing thing up? Well, I am, but when I went on Lego, I randomly typed in Minecraft without thinking and realized that this Product had popped up. I begged mum for it. Although it is small, it is customizable beyond horizons. I have one already but I hope for another 3 or 4 of them for they all join using technic pins. I do have one oversight to it, it is that it bad for kids who have big fingers for the pieces are so small. Apart from that, I love it.
0786838655|5.0|I loved the book so much that I was pestering mom to read it. Once she had finished, I asked dad to read it then I just read my favourite chapters over and over again. The best chapter is the one where they go to Las Vegas and stay at a hotel. I won't ruin it for you but I will say that it was so funny I had to read it at least five times a day 24/7 until I got tired of it.<br /><br />The book is all about Greek gods and goddesses. Percy Jackson is the son of one of the Big Three, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. When he is chased by the Minotaur he ends up at a camp. A Greek camp for half-bloods. The next book is just as good.[[ASIN:0786856866 The Sea of Monsters (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 2)]] which is about where Odysseus goes on his journey.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I liked this game a lot! I will play this game more than once that's for sure! Can't wait for the next one
B00DU73T08|4.0|Not as good as the book, but definitely a good movie. I would recommend it and definitely warch it again.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Listen to a lot of music of all sorts. Really like this song, however its starting to get played out by the radio.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Have always wanted to watch the series and then I saw I could watch it through my Prime account for nothing.  Started with Season 1--1st show was OK, 2nd show was more interesting, 3rd show I was hooked!!!  Watched all 3 seasons in a couple days and can't wait to see Season 4.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|All I can say is, an editor somewhere saw promise in this Norwegian writer.  Had I read this book of Nesbo's first, I probably would not have bothered reading any of his other work.  Which means I would have missed out on some good stuff.  Jo Nesbo has learned a lot and is (in my view) an excellent writer of police thrillers.<br />So I'm saying that The Bat is not very good.  For starters, why in the world did he set the story in Australia?
B008220D5K|5.0|This movie is very realistic to real life.  Funny but does take a serious turn towards the end, but overall great movie.
089898890X|5.0|Bought this on recommendation from a friend. Though I've been playing drums in the professional sphere for over 30 years, there is lots of new stuff to challenge me. It's also excellent for those just beginning their jazz drummer journey.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway sitters is fun.in subway surfers u can collect coins to buy characters and boards they go on a word your too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book explores the fundamentals of human psyche, parenting, formation of beliefs, and the list goes on.<br /><br />Staying basic in its themes, the book succeeds in making a deep connection with the reader and delivers powerful emotional blows at every turn of the plot.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a really good series. I enjoy following the characters as they go about their daily lives. Very interesting
B005V5WBFG|1.0|Amazon has this product listed as free but when you download it you discover that you have to pay for a subscription.

0671510991|4.0|Kissinger is of course a great expert on the practice of diplomacy and international relations.  He uses his personal experiences to illustrate the practices and theories that have historically been brought to the negotiating tables around the world.  The focus of the book is on Cold War diplomacy - especially the era of the Cold War in which he was a major actor.  The book contains several introductory chapters which illustrate the evolution of the international diplomatic paradigms, but these chapters are meant only to be a brief synopsis of how diplomacy developed in the years leading up to 1945.  It is not a thorough study of diplomatic history since the beginning of the Westphalian system.<br /><br />I would have loved for there to have been a lot more detail and information relating to the history of diplomacy throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.  As it is, he sketches the innovations in practice that the great masters developed - Richelieau, Talleyrand, Metternich and Bismarck especially.  The bulk of the book is about how these practices and theories were put to the test in the Cold War, and how the different approaches and theories stand up under an analysis of their effectiveness in the period 1945-1989 (with the heaviest emphasis on the 1960's and 70's).<br /><br />A very good study.
B004UPANAI|4.0|\\"I'm the best there is at what I do, but what i do isn't very nice.\\" Hugh Jackman was perfectly cast as Wolverine, Liev Schemer is equally perfect as Sabertooth in this Xmen prequel. Most of \\"Logan's\\" secret origins are finally revealed, even of his coat, and possibly some of Sabertooth's too. Lots of great comic threads turn up in no particular order like Weapon X, along with lots of legendary Mutants long overdue for film: Cajun X-man Gambit, Silver Fox, the Blob, Cyclops, even Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. I don't like the CGI sir Pat cameo at the finish but Over all an ok X-Film... Xceptional even
1781162646|5.0|Totally enjoyed this story.  As usual, King gives you characters you really enjoy spending time with.  I like that you can stop reading & then pick up again & fall right back under his spell.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|Flying Fords, Petrified Pets & Prepubescent Mages, Deadly Diaries and more Wizard Whimsy than you can shake a wand at... What's not to love? Harry's second magical mystery adventure at Hogwarts. Loads of backstory about the origins of \\"You Know Who,\\" Toby Jones as Dobby the House Elf is much less obnoxious a CGI character than  Jar Jar. Another one from director Chris Columbus... S'ok, pretty True to the Book, minus Nick's Death Day party... Digital FX was okay especially the pixies and Basilisk and Spiders are exceptional (certainly compared to the centaur in the first film).  Kids are clearly more comfortable here... John Williams music is great again ... Richard Harris is a great Dumbledore... Although clearly ill (he didn't live long past his part in this production).
B005HSL626|4.0|All my nephews and nieces like playing this game at the different levels. Definitie a G-rated game. Just remember to turn down the volume when out in public
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Finally the last update fixed some of the issues that kept happening.  The only thing that is frustrating is the game is based of having friends that are on facebook to help you level up your game and achieve challenges.  If you aren't into facebook or your friends don't liks the game then expect to play harder or spend real cash to get advanced.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|It would be okay if I could get register.  I enter My Zip code and it would not process it.  Plus, It is limited in info.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great series for anyone over 12 years old to read...wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger.  First movie was pretty true to the book.
B002GJI8PM|5.0|Great music, all of the soundtrack, especially about Helm's Deep and the Rohirrim.  Highly recommend for any fan as you can listen to the music and read the book at same time!
B005RZB65Q|5.0|An easy read with life changing implications. A must for anybody who wants to grow and make progress in life.
1847879071|5.0|Andy Field has a warped sense of humor which takes some getting used to but his explanations of how statistics work is right on target!  The first half of each chapter is all about what the process is, whether ANOVA or ANCOVA, etc, and then the second half has how to do it in SPSS with the program.  Very well explained and he has all sorts of extra stuff online for you to look at also.  He explains everything more than once so if you are confused, you get it eventually.  I really like that he has summaries all over each chapter with definitions of things so if you don't get something, you can look there.  There are also plenty of charts and screenshots of how the SPSS should look like so you can check yours against his when you are done with the computations.  At the end of course there are f-tables, t-tables and charts for significance.  I am taking a PhD course now and find that Field is so much better at explanations for half the price of the textbook that I HAD to buy!  Highly recommend.  I am keeping this one even after the course is over!
B004KA9VGA|3.0|I selected this book based on the number of reviews and the average rating which were quite high for both. I also read one or two reviews (obviously not the right ones) that were very enthusiastic about it and seemed to promise a smart book as a result my expectations were fairly high I guess. I am a very big fan of scientific facts and when the character of Matthiew Clairmont appeared with his researches I got quite excited. Unfortunately It didn't last. The whole book very fast became long and boring, full of useless scenes where the characters were just running, rowing, drinking, eating, doing yoga, riding horses and so on...But nothing scientific, boohoo for me! I remember asking myself how the character of Diana could drink that much, when they first dated with Matthiew, and still be able to speak coherently. Personally I think I would have been already dead to the world at that point, but  I guess that depends of your constitution. Another thing I found inconsistent was the fact that Diana, being an adult and independent woman, trusted and above all put her life into this man's hands and pretty let him manage her completely as if she was a child, after only a couple of weeks that they had met and worst of all that she chose to follow him to a foreign place where she would be at the mercy of his mother, which is probably the biggest enemy of her race according to history. Plus the fact that he didn't even want to have sleep with her, I mean come on! I'm not for sleeping with the first guy just because he's hot, but still they are not exactly kids anymore. I surely would find that very suspicious and offending if a MAN I'm DATING refused me for that long especially when I allow him to make so much changes in my life. Trust goes both ways or not at all, but it's just my opinion.<br />Over all I would say this book was alright but had absolutely nothing original and thrilling as you would expect at first sight and was probably way longer than needed. Sorry for that author, it was obviously a lot of work. I'm still going to read the second book though because now I want to know what's going to happen next.
1781162646|5.0|Good read but as with some of his books, one wishes that it was a bit longer, as the storyline was excellent.  I suspect King really enjoys these kind of &#34;potboilers&#34; crime genre books. A MUST for all King fans!

B006M9NJFG|5.0|Bought mine last year (I think) and had the chance to use it on a few weekend trips since then. The bottle holds a good sip of water, more so than the regular canteens you see at wal-mart and has a nice grippy texture that keeps it in your hand. The bottle is also pretty thick and I'm not worried it'll puncture by accident. The cup that comes with it has solid, insulated handles that haven't come lose one bit and the whole thing fits nicely in the sheath, which even has a drainage hole at the bottom.<br />If you're on the fence about this canteen you should go ahead and get it. It's big, solid  well made and I haven't had one problem with it. You can even bring it along to Disney World ( I did) although your friends might think you're weird.

140006922X|1.0|This book is not an historical tale of Jesus, it isn't even a truthful tale of Jesus.  This book is nothing more than Muslim propaganda.  Americans, particularly Christian Americans, are being sold a bill of goods.  We are being asked to toss aside our beliefs, truths and traditions and buy into this new Progressive, modern, Islamic view of our Sacred Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Don't waste your time.  There are many many other books out there that will give you the truth.  Still floundering, try reading the Bible.  The most popular book ever published.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I've seen many versions of Sherlock Holmes stories and just when I thought I had seen them all, Elementary comes by.  Love the acting, love the production and story line.  Jonny Miller and Lucy Liu are great actors and make you believe in the series.

B0057UA486|5.0|Among serious Stanleyphiles the most debated question has to be, \\"What's your favorite Kubrick film?\\" Barry Lyndon is mine.  I saw the movie when it was first released in theaters and, like my initial reaction to many of SK's films, it took a few years, and many viewings, to fully appreciate its greatness.  Watching Kubrick is not a passive experience; the director demands nearly as much commitment from his audience as he does from himself and his crew. Concerning Barry Lyndon, those less stout are likely to lose interest early on into the proceedings, owing either to the film's picaresque themes or, as in 2001, Kubrick's famously deliberate pacing.  Those patient enough to endure, however, will experience the director at the crest of his career, an artist in full command over every aspect of his craft.  Kubrick arranges each scene like a master painter bent before the canvas. Indeed, a painterly analogy seems particularly apt with Barry Lyndon, as Kubrick composes the first shot of almost every scene to mirror the idyllic stillness of an English landscape by Thomas Gainsborough or Antoine Watteau; it is only after slowly panning in that we are able to bear full witness to the ugly machinations of almost every character we encounter.  Kubrick seduces us with pretty pictures, then slaps us silly as scenes play out.  Wisely exchanging the flippant first-person tone of its source material for the observations  (written by Kubrick himself) of an omniscient narrator, brought to orotund life by the late Michael Hordern, the director still manages to stir our sympathies in favor of his flawed protagonist, delivered in a great, underrated performance by Ryan O'Neal at the peak of his prettiness. Barry manages to build a comfortable life for himself by taking advantage of nearly every person, and opportunity, he meets along the way; his quick wits and overall unscrupulousness give him the necessary means to overcome his humble origins and quickly ascend the social strata of his day.  Sadly, he has no idea what to do when he actually reaches the top, and his roguish nature ultimately betrays him and ensures his abject ruin.<br /><br />Kubrick is often dismissed by his critics as being technically gifted but emotionally detached.  In some ways, Barry Lyndon epitomizes this familiar grievance; indeed, there are moments when  the constant panning starts to feel too calculated; we may even share the urge to casually reject the film's  deliberate pacing and the relentless coldness of  Kubrick's characters.  To succumb to the brilliance of Barry Lyndon one must come to admire Kubrick's merciless thoroughness moving beyond all the greasepaint and mannered affectations of the era, so that he might return to his favorite existential theme of universal indifference. Barry is not a bad man, in many ways he is much to be admired, but his doom is as certain as George the III's--and ours.  In the realm of King Stanley, we are all equal in the end.<br /><br />Like all Kubrick films, the overall impact is made considerably greater through his use of a musical score, and Barry Lyndon's soundtrack is arguably the best of all his films.  Lush and elegiac, he uses a combination of well-known classical and baroque pieces to create a soundscape that is almost as vibrant as the images onscreen.  Barry's famously wordless seduction of Lady Lyndon looks nearly choreographed to the slow rhythm of Schubert's Trio in E Major; even more satisfying  is the inclusion of Vivaldi's Cello Concerto in E Minor during the film's more melancholic second half.his day.

B00COHIFQS|3.0|Thought this movie was enjoyable, but nothing amazing. I didn't find the movie to be scary at all but more of a thrill/ fantasy. The story was one thing I liked most about this movie, I kept me engaged and I wanted to see what was going to happen next. The visuals was what I thought was disappointing, awhile ago I saw the body movement test done by the actor and thought this was going to be a sick movie, but there was alot of cgi parts that I thought killed the horror aspects of it. Overall its a movie I enjoyed watching but would only watch once.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I love this book. Reading it for the second time now. If you want to get your diabetes or elevated cholesterol or triglycerides under control read this book! If you want to lose your \\"wheat belly\\" read this book.
B00A822VDY|5.0|This film was great for the little ones, as most Pixar films are but in addition to that adults can be entertained as well.  It tells the story of a collection of “monsters” that throughout their life have been taught one thing, which is awful for those affected by their actions but they learn to use the opposite action to make themselves better.  In addition to all other Pixar films, this one is a must watch as well.

B00DU77QP2|5.0|The world Cassandra Clare created is so complex, so imaginative and seriously kick-ass that it's no wonder why (almost) everyone in the reading community loves it. It's such a relief to have finally joined the wicked fan club that's been going on for ages since the release of this first book, and even more to have done it before the movie hits theaters on August 20th, I didn't want to be sitting there clueless not knowing if the movie stays true to the book or not (I just love doing that!)<br /><br />Anyway, I see why every girl out there fans herself at the mere mention of Jace's name. There's just something so lovable in him, despite his sarcastic, selfish and I'm-just-too-awesome attitude. Wait, I think that's what made me fall for him in the first place! Okay, he was also sweet, caring and overly protective even when he said things around the lines of love being your downfall (broken boy talking here).<br /><br />Honestly, Clary Fray didn't turn out like I expected her to be. I thought she would be some amazing natural shadowhunter who would finish off dozens of demons with a flick of her wrist. Instead, she slowly starts growing into this new world, taking in everything but using her mind rather than strength during tough fights, though she might throw a knife here and there when the situation arises. I know she will grow out to be an amazing fighter, but for now, I'm just glad she started off like this.<br /><br />My only problem would be the plot twist towards the ending. Seriously? I mean, it's good, but why? Why anguish the readers? I bet it was awful back in the day when you had to wait a whole year to get to the next book. Good thing I won't have to wait at all, there's a lot of catching up for me to do and I will gladly take up the challenge. Easy as taking out a ravener with a sensor, or so I've heard.<br /><br />*This book review first appeared at Book Travels*

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book enlightened me on the issues a control freak possesses and the mental and physical abuse they are capable of inflicting on their victims.  There were parts of the book I felt were a little slow but it kicked into high gear toward the end and it was hard to put it down.  The ending was super good and it just blew me away....I found myself just saying WOW!  I've only read one other book (The Lucky One) by Nicholas Sparks and this one was by far the best....I even sent a text to my cousin as soon as I finished it and told her to definitely get it and read it. Now, I'd like to see the movie and see how it compares to the book.  If you read this book, I really don't think it will disappoint you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best season yet!  Great character development.<br />A few surprises that I didn't see coming .  Can't wait for Season 4!

B009WUBERW|3.0|Well the title kind of tell you the value of the movie.  It is pretty expendable.  The best part is the actors using the lines from the other actor's hit movies like: I'll be back! and Yippee Ki Yay! etc.  if you do not take it too seriously, it is a nice romp of an action film.

B00000K2W1|5.0|I was heartbroken when my collection of CDs came up missing some time ago. I couldn't replace all of my Joplin collection so I bought the Greatest Hits CD. Mostly because I could download the tracks directly to my phone and HP Slate 7 tablet. For some reason Janis has always touched a place in my heart and soul. Listening to Janis always brings a smile to my face and a song to my lips. Who can resists singing alone with Mercedes Benz or Me and Bobby McGee.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Gives the general ideas behind the genius of the man who imagined all the conveniences of the 20th century. Very informative. Oh, and also, gives an idea of the power already in place then (sometimes through corruption and treachery) of the big names in fortunes as Rockefeller, Rothschild and Morgan Bank. Illuminating insight in view of the depression we're going thru right now (the 1% against the 99%).
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Another very good book by Mr. Hosseini.  An interesting and easy read for anyone interested in that part of the world, especially if you've been there.
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|Hosseini's latest novel weaves together a story that spans almost 50 years beginning with the bond between two motherless children in an Afghan village. To ten year old Abdullah, his three year old sister is more precious than anything. In different way her universe revolves around her big brother's love. When they are inexplicably separated, his world crashes. This tragic separation is symbolized somehow by the cutting down of an ancient oak tree in the middle of the village.<br /><br />After this rather charming but sad opening amidst the dust and poverty of an Afghan village, the scene shifts to an apparently diverse group of characters. At first, I was annoyed at Husseini introducing a distinctly different drama without bringing the first to denouement. Oh no, I thought, another of these modern, literary writers who seem determined to discourage readers. But soon I found that Husseini wove the second story and then the third and fourth together in some mysterious way that charmed me as the drama unfolded. The full integration of all these stories only comes to light at the end of the book.<br /><br />Husseini introduces a wide range of characters that include a wealthy but eccentric Kabul landlord, his man Friday, a Greek working for an NGO, a rebellious but gifted Kabuli woman, two westernized Afghans who returns to Kabul to touch base with their roots but show completely different reactions, a drug-smuggling warlord and his son, and a Greek family on the island of Tinos. Somehow all these characters are connected and their settings in Kabul, Paris, San Francisco, and Greece depict the complicated nature of the human family and the universality of themes of relatedness.<br /><br />The depth of insight into the characters of the book and the diverse locales is masterfully portrayed. All the themes are masterfully portrayed: love, loyalty, cruelty, honour, sacrifice, fanaticism, modernity, freedom, bondage and on and on. In a wonderful way these different stories dovetail together to form one whole.. It is a very human book about very flawed but likeable characters--for the most part.<br /><br />Highly recommended.dovetail together to form one whole..

140006922X|1.0|\\"Bold\\" one review calls Zealot.  Perhaps that was true in 900AD but not 1400 years after Islam was started suggesting that they 600+ years after Jesus walked the Earth were more reliable sources than the men and woman who heard Jesus speak and died to spread faith in a crucified savior.<br /><br />The line of thinking is simple: people believed Jesus was the Messiah and so when he was murdered they lied about the resurrection and were willing to die for this lie because they hoped for a rich and powerful  Church that they couldn't have imagined and which was 500 years in the future, which of course they would never enjoy.<br /><br />The real story here is hope naive, or just plain stupid, so many of this books reviewers are accepting Muslim anti-Christian propaganda uncritically. Or perhaps this book reviews the reality of anti-Christian bias in popular culture.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Had the DVD, then I got the DVD box set with the toy vehicle and the plastic origami unicorn.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|All the films, all the TV specials, some parodies, behind the scenes goodies, incidental info... it's all here. The picture is clean and the sound is perfect. They've also changed the original animal bellow the precedes the arrival of Ben Kenobi in Ep 4 with something far more ominous instead of the whistle like bird call they used to replace the original growl which was just fine in the first place. The packaging is a little much to futz with. I'm concerned that one of these days I'll accidentally tear one of the pages holding the discs in place. It's a very tight fit.

1451668945|5.0|I have read every single book she has written, with the exception of the children's picture books.  I think she was at the top of her game in the 90's.  Loved everyone of those.  In the past few years I have not enjoyed some of those books quite as much.  There just seemed to be a less interesting story being told.<br /><br />This book did have a lot of characters in it as some have said (and complained), but I enjoyed reading it and they all seemed to have some significance and tied together later on.  It was a little hard to remember and keep up with some of them, but I just have always love MHC and I am not about to stop now.<br /><br />I liked how the story resolved and there were little clues along the way to lead to this resolution, so I wasn't shocked by the ending but I also didn't quite guess what it was either.

1451695195|4.0|For anybody who is questioning the meaning of life after death, this book by a scientist is an interesting read because religion and science are in a constant clash.  Most physicians have trouble with the notion of an afterlife because of their background in science, but this speaker, a renown physician, gives a reliable account of what heaven meant to him in a \\"near death\\" experience when he fell ill one morning without any warning.  Coming from an educated scientist, this book is most informative and enjoyable.

B0008ENIAC|5.0|Joan Crawford is at her quintessential best in this title role \\"Mildred Pierce.\\"  Ann Blythe and Eve Arden are excellent supporting actresses as her daughter and friend respectively.  The movie is centered on the economic climb of a love-spurned housewife egged on by her selfish, greedy, and ambitious daughter, Vida, who will stop at nothing for status and money.  Even though the movie is dated and the soundtrack and bit old-fashioned, the message is the same--that money never buys happiness.  After her departure from a long-term contract at Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, this is the first independent film that Crawford made which won her an Oscar for Best Actress in 1945. This movie is excellent and belongs in the archives of the best pictures made in the mid-twentieth century.

B002YDRA22|5.0|This movie is not exactly a true story. Don't get me wrong. A lot of it IS true but there was some artistic licsence taken, also. For instance...Elliot WAS responsible for bringing Woodstock Ventures to his home town but he did NOT introduce Micheal Lang to his neighbor, Max Yasgur. These are trivial concerns. Watch the movie for it's entertainment value and you won't be disappointed. It's a charming and heartfelt comedy, that if you just let your mind go, will bring you right back to that wonderful summer in 1969.<br />One thing in particular, that I just HAVE to mention, is that there is one scene in the movie that is the most REAL depiction of an acid trip, that I have EVER seen, committed to film! And if you've ever taken really good acid, like what we had back in the 60's, I'm sure you'll agree with me. Nothing &#34;over the top&#34; or unbelieveable hallucinations, that are so often depicted in movies. This is just a great trip! Very natural. Ang Lee nailed it! (The scene takes place when Elliot first gets to the festival site and meets up with a couple of kids who are just sitting by their VW minibus. They drop acid, crawl inside the minibus  and...bye bye reality.)<br />It's not vital but it is a good idea to watch &#34;Woodstock: Three Days Of Peace And Music&#34;, before you watch this movie. Then you can appreciate little things, like the &#34;nun throwing the peace sign&#34;, &#34;Wavy Gravy walking around&#34; or the &#34;port-a-san man interview&#34;, etc.<br />For those who have never seen this movie, I'd like to add that there is NO re creation of the actual concert in this movie. So don't expect any. This is a story about how the concert came to be - period. Enjoy!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy to use and pretty straight forward. I've downloaded it in my phone as well and it helps both run much quicker. Also saves time by not having to go into each app and clear out cache and free up memory. It will also &#34;kill&#34; programs that aren't being used. Pretty impressed.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|Why this rating? = It's been almost 45 years since Woodstock happened! I THINK it's fair to say that everyone on earth knows what it was! Anyone who actually needs an explanation for my or ANYONE'S 5 star rating of this product should forever be banned from ever, ever, ever, EVER seeing, let alone OWNING this absolute gem of a documentary!!!!!! YOU people should really just put in your earbuds, go back to your Kelly Clarkson discs and leave the grown-ups alone!!!!!!! - Sadly, Justin Timberlake and Justin Beiber will forever be, YOUR rock gods.There is absolutely no help for you. Sorry.<br />Likes/dislikes = Absolutely everything/absolutely nothing. Mike Wadleigh and his team, summed up, not just the music but the whole concept of the 60's, in these 3 3/4 hours of film. A massive undertaking that was NOT without it's hardships and near misses! The Oscar for best documentary, which the film received, was well earned and deserved!<br />Recommended to who? = Absolutely everyone!<br />FYI - for anyone who bought the &#34;special edition&#34; of Woodstock in 2009, on DVD, with all the extra &#34;toys&#34; and is interested in upgrading your DVD's to Bluray, without spending an arm and a leg AGAIN, all you have to do is buy the 40th anniversary edition bluray, that Amazon currently sells for $13.49. Everything that's on the 3 DVD's IS on this bluray set!!!

B0067RQYNW|5.0|I just started high school and it helps me with my assignments a lot. I'm so happy I got it and it's free. Get it now
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|You should get rid of the glitch when you aim with a attached scope (except the default ironsight) it aims way above and you have to significantly offset to try to get a kill or you get killed. And get rid of hackers i mean wow. Hackers just ruin the game, speed hacks are the most so annoying.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The story is as riveting as the movie. I enjoyed the suspense throughout and loved the way each character was brought to life.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I think that the dictionary is really helpful to kids and adults when a difficult word comes by  . Thanks
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I wanted to watch all of Doctor Who (modern) in order, so I started here. Eccleston might have become my Doctor - and here I was thinking Matt Smith was the only one for me.<br />So many feels in this season.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This American  dictionary really helps because of the words and meanings and if it a noun or a verb. Thanks
0316044695|5.0|Incredible account of what it means to be a Navy Seal.  Eye opening information on the pitfalls of politics influencing war.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down!! I have to have the next book immediately and I can't wait for the movies!!!
030789701X|5.0|The book is an impressive tome, quality feels very good and the amount of information inside is overwhelming, only started looking trough it, but with all the information it will take a long time, seems perfect if you get stuck in a quest somewhere or like to know where a trainer is.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|My review title applies mainly to the Katniss of Mockingjay; the girl spends 90 percent of her time in the hospital, gets throttled by the love of her life, and is trying to fulfill the role of Mockingjay that was thrust upon her, but she is trying to make the best of. In Catching Fire, she is thrust back into the arena the second time, and realizes that it is because of her defiance to Snow and his regime that has resulted in the destruction of her home district and many people she knew all her life, and did truly care about.<br />However, since I'm posting this under the original Hunger Games book, I want to refute some of the claims that Katniss is a cold, unfeeling person. She volunteered to be a tribute for love of her little sister Prim, for starters. She has a close friendship with Gale, so close in fact that they are referred to as cousins and no one disputes that even if they know better. She formed a friendship with the Mayor's daughter close enough for the girl to present her with the mockingjay pin for luck. Her attitude toward her mother was a tough love attitude because her mother shut down when her husband died, and Katniss needed her to be strong for Prim in case she did not come back. And then there is her brief but genuine friendship with Rue, that resulted in the revolt in District 11. Yes, Katniss is tough, calculating and clever, but she is not heartless.<br />Forgive me for reviewing the books in reverse, but I had to justify the title of my review.
1936891026|2.0|Some parts of the book are good, but too much time is spent either with the attitude of &#34;I don't care what anyone thinks&#34; or &#34;I don't want to offend you in any way.&#34; My opinion: Lead, follow, or get out of the way!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I don't have an Android phone or tablet. Perhaps that's the problem. But, if you read all the marketing material about Chromecast, it is promoted as a completely cross-platform device. That's part of what was so appealing. The other part, was the price, particularly with 3 free months of Netflix ($24 value).<br /><br />I ordered online and picked this up at BestBuy this morning because Amazon was out of stock. My receipt lists the Netflix offer, but apparently that has been retroactively pulled. Lots of news stories about that, and I have not been given any codes. So scratch that aspect of the purchase decision. My $11 device is back up to $35.<br /><br />So for $35, what do I get? As far as I have figured out so far, I can mirror content being displayed in my Chrome browser on my Mac. That's almost it. I don't have Netflix. If you go to YouTube and play a video, you can flip that to the Chromecast, close your browser window, and the device plays it directly.<br /><br />Beyond that, although this device is presented as being \\"controlled by your phone, tablet, PC\\", it is a mirror. Think AirPlay or AirParrot. Beyond YouTube, and presumably Netflix, when you close your laptop, that's that, it's over. There is nothing else \\"there\\" to control; unlike Roku or AppleTV, for example, which have UIs, the Chromecast does not. I imagined I'd be controlling apps, on the device (or, more likely, in the Cloud), but that's not the case.<br /><br />Want to watch a video on your HD? Play the video in Chrome and mirror it. Want to show photos on the TV? open the phones, one-by-one in Chrome. This really is the problem with no remote control! With AirPlay, I can allow remote devices to be in control, so my AVR can flip through iTunes songs.<br /><br />At this point, I would not recommend purchasing the device. Unless you really like YouTube cat videos, and for some reason want to watch them on your TV instead of on the device that you must use to browse the videos you want to play. Theonly exception would be to Netflix-enable your TV. That would be worthwhile if the Netflix offer were still there; as-is, I think this $35 is better spent on a more robust Netflix-enabling device for your TV.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|The series is without a doubt amazing, and one of the few shows on television that anyone can appreciate. However, those with a higher intellect will find the science, theology and character dynamics far more fulfilling. The show can stand on its own with a five star review. While it admittedly ends with a few questions the whole point of the show is to get the viewer to question different ideas and concepts, not provide total conclusions. Think back to the white board, before it gets erased. If you want a full experience stop complaining and add also read the book. The author approved the show. When you read the book after watching the show it will all come together, assuming you are able to understand the concepts the author is writing about. The book will give you closure but the show should still be watched first.
B000002LMM|5.0|The best soundtrack to the best TV show in recent memory. Moody, yet beautifully uplifting music.<br />If you don't have this yet ... Get It!<br />The liner notes/photos of the show's cast are a major plus too!
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Too long and dull. The script was lacking and ineffectual. I wouldn't waste two hours watching this. Jennifer Lawrence is the only positive. ;-]
B00BOXZAJ8|3.0|They want to bill it as a love story - a Romeo and Juliet story.  If you can ignore that, and the silly (stupid) \\"fairy tale\\" narration at the beginning, and if you can ignore the other reviews about \\"stunning visuals (they weren't THAT good), then.... It kinda holds it's own as a mystery/suspense.  How is he going to pull this off using the weird (and completely arbitrary) laws of physics involved?<br /><br />Apart from that, I was not too impressed.  There were just too many instances where the physics, or continuity fell apart.<br /><br />In one scene, his tie is perfect.  In another, it's suddenly pulling a \\"Dilbert\\", pointing up.<br /><br />Dialogue between the two love interests: \\"What are you doing here?\\"  \\"I'm looking for my dog.\\"  (What?  On the top of a mountain? They are each on the top of a Mt. Everest type of mountain.  Your dog?  Really?)<br /><br />Wearing a vest of stuff that makes you light is not going to make your arms or your hair obey gravity.<br /><br />Stuff bursts into flames just because it's from another world?<br /><br />Gravity in the entire universe behaves exactly the same - except here?<br /><br />Meh.<br /><br />Overlook the weak love story, and the contradictory physics, and just focus on \\"pulling off the impossible\\", and you might get through it.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Holds up well with the original. Some referential stuff from the oldie but stands on its own. I intend to watch it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love to play this game on the go and I love how it is an endless game. It lets you be creative and you can fight the mobs. I enjoy crafting big mansions and castles. I recommend this to anyone who loves endless creativity games.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Now I need to see the others in the series. Next up, Iron Man! Thanks Amazon!
B00B3EJ292|1.0|This may be a very good movie, I don't really know.  There was no warning that it was in Italian with subtitles.  I do not enjoy a movie that I can't watch because I am trying to read what they are saying!
B004Q9TK98|1.0|I had to read this book for a project I was involved in. I don't normally choose to read Jodi Picoult books as I feel the subject matter usually sounds depressing.  Guess what?  It IS depressing! I read for pleasure and relaxation- this book provided neither.
B007V65R54|5.0|The book was very readable and entertaining, in addition to providing insights into how to improve predictions by staying clear of problems.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|These series are easy to follow and leave you wanting more. The charters are so likeable and you find yourself rallying for Thor and the others. Great reads.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I heard this group on Good Morning America & loved the 2 songs they sang . After I got it found out the grand children loved it too .  We all sing along in the car !
B007FG9LIE|1.0|Uninteresting characters and very bad plot. Why this became a series is the real mystery.  I was really looking forward to another book by Blake Crouch because I loved Run and the Andrew Thomas, Luther Kite series.  Sadly, this book was a bad read.
B00979CS50|5.0|Still breaking new ground creatively!  I saw them in Amsterdam, and they were fantastic.  If you ever get the chance, go see them.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Production is of the highest quality, Timberland is an amazing producer..Mirrors is one of my favorite songs along with Hold the wall, That girl, Tunnel vision and Pusher love girl
B0063M22QO|3.0|challenging and keeps my sons head out of the tv and video games. Would like to see more like it.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|Premise sounds boring but show is incredibly well written and characters are complex and nuanced. Highly recommended. Still hooked after 5 seasons.
1609611543|5.0|Since the mid 80's, the wheat your grandmother baked with has been genetically altered. Now it's addictive, makes you fat and is harmful to your health.<br /><br />Giving up wheat in your diet isn't that complex. There are a lot of gluten free products on the market now, some taste pretty good.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|after weeks of playing... it crashed my kindle &amp; now says i have to reinstall and now will not open... however during the time i did play... its fu  and addictive... tons of dragons to hatch! keep playing nonstop!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Just a phenomenal book in what maybe the greatest book series of all time. Book six can not come quick enough
B00B7Y0206|1.0|need i say more?  worked ok until yesterday, then i wasted my time for the last time trying to get videos to load and play.  Nothing but the spinning hole.  let me know when you get this app running.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Had a kindle and this app effortlessly transferred my existing library.  So happy this was available.  Since I carry my phone everywhere, having access everywhere without carrying another piece of equuipment is a huge bonus.
0525952926|1.0|The first 100 pages are so boring I could not go any further. I would like to remove all stars but it doesn't work.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|A good watch and I would watch it again if I am looking for something to distract me for an hour or two.
B00C33M2EE|4.0|I love the music but one of the CD's is damaged and won't play.  I like the choice of pieces they play.
B000I3SYEI|4.0|A big improvement over Star Trek: The Motion Picture. What more can I say? Six more words required for this.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This first CD was so good I bought their next one for me and a friend.  Nice change of pace.
B000I3UAJ0|2.0|All the long, slow shots of space ships and such really lengthen this movie.  I have heard that they did this to try and make it in the style of the movie '2001 space odyssey.' I couldn't even finish the movie, it was just awful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Boss coolest game ever I really enjoyed it thank you for such great game whom ever made this need more wor
B008Y73940|3.0|I was expecting so much more from this movie and unfortunately for me it did not come close to delivering it
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Its fun for me too. My daughter is 3 1/2 and I am 40 so I would think that all ages in between would enjoy. Im not a gamer really so I havent gotten very far but its definitely fun to play with my daughter
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I loved the book. The movie  stayed close to the story line and I felt the actors did a wonderful job. I can't wait for the next one.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I wasn't sure that it was all that fun at first. Fortunately I kept on playing, and I haven't been able to put it down . Please give me one free hero.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|so this is our chance to see what we missed and why everyone was so hooked by the time we started watching in Season 2
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|excellent cd. I am a cd collector and now I added this to my collection. I am a DJ and play mostly at  Biker Bars
1400164257|2.0|But the audiobook is freaking horrible! The narrator has the absolute wrong voice for this type of work. And the sound editor ought to be barred from working again. Worst part, it took me so far out of the story that I don't even really know if I liked it or not. And given how bad the narrator ruined this for me, I may never know!<br /><br />It reads like a Castle episode. They nailed that at least.<br />&lt;/grumbles>
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best Rick Riordan  book yet<br />5 stars just because<br /> Read the other ones first  or it won't make sense at all
B00C2C637I|5.0|Truthfully, Bradbury is probably more synonymous with science fiction than he is with horror. I know he spins a pretty good horror story after The Halloween Tree. Though this book is probably a better example of horror
B00AVFO41K|2.0|I haven't even been able to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing..I need some instructions or at least an example.
0307352153|5.0|Learning that you are an &#34;introvert&#34; can be as pivotal as learning that you are &#34;highly sensitive.&#34;  Elaine Aron's book, The Highly Sensitive Person, changed my life.  This book, by Susan Cain, adds further information, though, because I am an artist, I found her focus on the business world less interesting.  But, the message is invaluable.  If you suspect you are an introvert, get this book and actually label yourself.  It is an amazing relief!  It gives you reasons for why you are how you are and with those reasons comes empowerment!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Because of its title I just assumed that this was a child's game, but my daughter (grown) said that she loved it and was addicted to it. So I tried it and I, too, love it
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Lots of humor and smart remarks and go-getter business. It's hard to dislike any character of the amazing, best-law drama!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My two grandson's-ages 25 and 11 both loved it. My grandson put it on my Kindle and the two of them monopolized my Kindle for hours. I tried it and it really is fun, but a little challenging for someone who lets my machanic take care of parts I don't even understand.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Very funny, if you like family guy you'll like this, bunch of great jokes,<br />yes it's the raunchy comedy but isn't that what you want, laughed out<br />loud many times,
B005C0DHEY|5.0|People need to watch this!!  The public should be aware of what is really in their drinking water as well as the food they eat.  I am shocked with how bad this has gotten, but not shocked that profits of companies are more important than the lives of U.S. citizens.  Can't make profits if companies keep killing of their customers!
B005HI4LMS|2.0|I love the hot chick, but some of the comedy here is not that great, unless you like death,<br />I liked it at first but fast forwarded from half to the end, cause I wanted it to end, but man<br />that chick is hot
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good movie for Willis fans, not Die Hard but still good ole Bruce!  Worth a watch if you have the time.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It's a fun game to play. My only thing is rtf h as that with this new update my park got thrown out and I had to start over again!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|After reading this and being a Marine Vietnam combat veteran, 67-68 some of the things he mentioned I also encountered. War is war no matter what the government puts the next generation to task. See the same body parts, your buddies and those of the enemy. However. New killing products enter each different war and are better than the last. I highly recommend this book. Even though Kris is gone, his accomplishments cannot be denied. Vietnam grunts also had that don't shoot until shot at unless up by DMZ. We were the first to use M-16 or the mattey mattel special. What a piece of crap. I ended up carrying the M79 blooper that Kris talked about. It worked every time.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Like Tom Selleck and enjoy the Jesse Stone flicks. Sometimes a bit corny but still fun to watch. Helps pass the time when you are in the airport waiting on a delayed flight to take off!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Gosh, I've downloaded this thing twice. BUT, IT WON'T LOAD!!! And, my home bar madingus won't show up. This app was designed for devices with a button that you can push to get to the home menu. A Kindle Fire tablet doesn't have one of those. But, luckily, my brother got it to download on his device and let me try.<br />It's fun, but it may not download.
140006922X|5.0|A well researched book about the man Jesus, not the Christ.  Don't let a bunch of Islamaphobes deter you from a great, interesting, compelling book.
B0043UB0EI|3.0|You'll enjoy this. Not like a ton, but I didn't feel bad spending money on it. Oversexual and the blood is clearly CG at times. But its a fun show, and some good acting shows up along the way. Lucy Lawless surprises me with her range. Xena to BCG to a completely evil and conniving character in this show.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hunger games is a linear read, but grips you completely with the events that unfold. You can feel that you are a part of the districts and as one of the &#34;chosen ones&#34; to be a part of these games.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|Indie kids have a way to being overly pretentious, of valuing groups who are only marginally interesting. However, for all the fixie-riding kids who recommended me this group, it is one of the best bands I've listened too. This album is a bit pared down compared to the self-titled sophomore album, but nevertheless has excellent lyrics, and interesting and refreshingly new style.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun and addictive game.  Makes you use your brain at times and keeps you coming back for the next puzzle
B005C7MVC6|5.0|I've now played it even more than any Sigur Ros album.<br /><br />I once said to a friend that this album sounds like a forest of white pine smells on a wet fall morning. That is the best description I can come up with.
B00CQ8U5ZE|5.0|Update:  I received the blu ray.  The transfer is pretty good.  It's looks pretty solid.  The extras are a little skimpy, but the blu ray transfer looks pretty good.  Definite recommend.<br /><br />Here's my review of Death Hunt.<br /><br />1.  It's based on a true story (although it inverts the facts, but the film's story is great (as is the true story as well);<br /><br />2.  It is pulse pounding action in the snow.  Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson are brilliant.<br /><br />3.  The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed, and the movie is exciting as heck with hardly any let up.<br /><br />The story is taut and is a perfectly flawless action film, one of the best ever made in my opinion.  It is just a shame that it is not better known.<br /><br />Death Hunt is in my top 15 Action Films of all time, and definitely in my top 100 films period.  It is simply brilliant stuff, in my estimation. Buy it.  I think it'll become one of your instant favorites.
B003K07DUC|5.0|I thought this was a good movie.  I was doubtful at first because I hadn't heard of the movie but of course, Matt Damon is great and they did a good job of making the movie seem very realistic.
B005HSL626|1.0|If their would be a zero star I would put it. It was good at fist then glitches it froze my tablet it keeps turning off and on my tablet.  I'm very frustrated so please don't waste your time on buying it. And they ads are getting bad. If your thinking of getting it for a kid or child DON't it freezes your tablet and every device you have it on. Then it will soon break it.
B008Y73940|4.0|I like the movie overall.  They needed to wrap it up a bit better especially in the end.  It is like they needed one more cut or something.<br /><br />Otherwise entertaining.
