0143038419|3.0|\\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" is an argument in favor of the American Woman.<br /><br />Author Liz Gilbert starts out making an argument against the American Woman, against Liz Gilbert, and ends up losing it...to her benefit.<br /><br />If you follow.<br /><br />There is much to hate in Gilbert, especially if you're a writer - and you're not alone - because she hates herself while spinning her rather loathsome and self-indulgent tale of relationship angst while globetrotting on the publisher's dime.<br /><br />Those noble few who frequent my blog know full-well the extent to which the highway scribe dislikes self-referential writing; so much so he refers to himself as somebody else thanks to the double-edged anonymity of the Internet.<br /><br />So Gilbert's perpetual \\"I this,\\" and \\"I that,\\" were doing much to prevent him from finishing her self-story.<br /><br />Yes, yes, you're saying, \\"highway scribe, you pretentious, left-leaning weenie, you'd never approach this popular dross with any seriousness anyway!\\"<br /><br />Not true.<br /><br />Good writers read everything, because they are, or should be, good listeners to be successful themselves. The scribe is in the habit of finishing off a popular slab such as, \\"The DaVinci Code\\" - the ending for which he did not quite understand - and then washing it down with a little Tennyson, which he doesn't always get, either.<br /><br />\\"Understanding\\": that's another way of saying \\"truth,\\" because the truth is already out there, but you've got to decipher it.<br /><br />Gilbert is in search of truth, too. Actively fleeing a failed marriage and a botched follow-up relationship into what ends up being some very nice travel writing.<br /><br />Why Americans have to go overseas to heal is something of a mystery, but here you have it. Abroad, her own personal basket seems to shrink before the wonders abounding and those of you who've done an expatriate turn know this to be something of a rule.<br /><br />In Italy, she begins her transformation from neurotic, underfed wreck, to a well-stuffed denizen of Rome, where her yoga mat remains underneath the bed because, Rome, it turns out, \\"doesn't do yoga.\\"<br /><br />But it eats and eats well. In Italy, when you walk down the streets of a city or town, the scent of food mugs you, the sight of it attractively displayed in windows designed for the purpose of seducing completely.<br /><br />In a forgiving environment where everybody's on the same culinary tip, Gilbert allows herself to put on a bunch of pounds and settle comfortably into the fleshy cushion she has morphed into.<br /><br />She makes being chunky sound sexy and, as such, begins to win the reader over.<br /><br />And though there is no string of adjectives that can successfully convey the magic of the Italian cucina, the authoress manages to make us hungry through her writing.<br /><br />And that's no mean trick.<br /><br />In India, Gilbert settles into an Ashram, becomes a little thinner, and struggles with the regimen of chants; one in particular she can't seem to conquer.<br /><br />\\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" is the ultimate globalization sampler. Only in today's crazy culture mash-up could a guy named Richard from Texas, who refers to her as \\"Groceries,\\" do more to move the narrator's self-realization along than the absent Yogi boss-lady.<br /><br />The scribe is a sworn secular, a militant non-believer who has adopted Luis Bunuel's response to all questions about religion: \\"Still an Atheist Thank God.\\"<br /><br />Sneering and snarling at Gilbert's religious quest, the scribe found himself aligned with the author by the end of the trip's India phase, because in all that chanting and fasting she hits upon the power found in \\"resisting our urges\\" and unwittingly applies her writer's discipline to life's other areas.<br /><br />Writers will recognize these while watching Gilbert come to realize them for herself.<br /><br />Well-nourished, more spiritually balanced and happy, the the lady heads onto Bali, Indonesia, where she does some fine cultural writing. Perhap's it's just as good as that she does in the other two places, but Bali is an interesting study: a Buddhist isle in a massive Muslim archipelago with a strict social code where everyone operates from a strong clan base and shares the same name, or two.<br /><br />Here is where Gilbert won highwayscribery's heart. Her self-loathing over, it's hard to loathe her in turn. Confident after a year in other countries, she finds her American-ness in time to keep a woman whom she's helped in a remarkable way from turning the whole thing sour with a scam.<br /><br />In this new-found strength, she relocates her sexuality and nowhere is the American woman's sexuality more to be admired than in traditional settings.<br /><br />By way of related digression, the highway scribe can tell you he went off to Spain years ago both to write his novel \\"Vedette,\\" and land a Spanish wife.<br /><br />On earlier, shorter journeys he'd found the dated femininity of Spanish women completely winning, their Madonna-like (the virgin, not the singer) discretion a safe most worthy of cracking.<br /><br />But once committed fully to Spanish life he couldn't crack the safe without surrendering his independence and direction to the ladies' families. He could not pry them loose from their clamshells.

Here is where Gilbert won highwayscribery's heart. Her self-loathing over, it's hard to loathe her in turn. Confident after a year in other countries, she finds her American-ness in time to keep a woman whom she's helped in a remarkable way from turning the whole thing sour with a scam.     In this new-found strength, she relocates her sexuality and nowhere is the American woman's sexuality more to be admired than in traditional settings.     By way of related digression, the highway scribe can tell you he went off to Spain years ago both to write his novel \\"Vedette,\\" and land a Spanish wife.     On earlier, shorter journeys he'd found the dated femininity of Spanish women completely winning, their Madonna-like (the virgin, not the singer) discretion a safe most worthy of cracking.     But once committed fully to Spanish life he couldn't crack the safe without surrendering his independence and direction to the ladies' families. He could not pry them loose from their clamshells. It was all of them or it was...     ...nothing.     After a while it was shocking to learn how, in Andalusia, so few women had their own cars, how impossible it was to find a single one not being escorted by their brother, mother, or some other, how mothers beat their daughters with brooms into the house when he walked down calle Larga.     And so it is with Gilbert who tries a few shoes on before settling on the right fit, an older Brazilian fellow, who is an exotic choice chosen on an exotic journey.     Gilbert understands the rules of Bali, but is proactive in the most positive American sense, when she tries to infuse a little modernity into a situation that is working, and harshly so, against a local she has come to love.     She sticks her nose into things and, as an American, you like seeing her do it, because we'd like to respect local customs, if we only had some of our own to guide us.     Gilbert heads home finally happy with essentially the same person she left as, but one she understands better.     And while some of the hip gab and dated material work to the detriment of her tale's shelf-life, it delivers in the knowledge, fun, and wisdom departments.     And that makes for a Good Read.

B001KZVQJI|5.0|It will be interesting to see if this is the film for Blu-Ray that the industry hoped \\"The Dark Knight\\" would be - the one that will make those who are still on the fence about purchasing a Blu-Ray player run out and buy, buy, buy.  The way things are right now, I doubt any movie is going to give that kind of jolt, but if it's possible, \\"King Kong\\" might be the one to do it.      First, I'd like to comment on all the questions about which versions are contained on the disc.  The copy I received (from Amazon - pre-ordered and shipped on 21 January) had a sticker on the outside packaging that plainly stated both versions were on the disc (Both extended and theatrical).  Plus, as soon as the disc loaded, a screen came on allowing the viewer to highlight which version they'd like to watch.  Not wanting to miss a thing, we watched the extended cut the first time out, but I'm sure that when we watch it again, it'll be the theatrical version.  This is a loooong movie.  By the time it was ending, I could tell the kids were almost about to lose interest.    Just a quick note about family viewing: This movie is rated PG-13 for a good reason.  It is extremely intense at times, and there are several scenes where people are killed.  The scenes aren't horrifically graphic, thankfully, but the manner in which many of them are killed are certainly horrific.  I did preview this movie before I let the young'uns watch, but I started second guessing myself about half way through.  If you have sensitive viewers, I would definitely recommend previewing it before unleashing it on them.  It's certainly intense.  I decided that for us, this one was ok, but I still won't let them watch \\"The Dark Knight\\".      Now, a word about the Blu-Ray - Fantastic.  Unbelievable.  It's hard for me to envision how a picture could look any better, but that's what everybody thought when regular DVD's first came out.  We watched it using a [[ASIN:B001HBHLEY Samsung BD-P2500 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player]], and had absolutely no trouble viewing it at all.  The only problem we did have was while watching the extended cut, there was a 'bonus view' icon in the top left hand corner.  I could not figure out how to get rid of the icon.  Once the film was over, I started it over in the theatrical mode, and the icon was gone.  I'm guessing that this is an operator malfunction instead of a disc problem.  I hope so anyway - I'd hate to think someone did that on purpose.     The 'U-control' feature allows the viewer to enable other interactive features while viewing, but we didn't explore that area at all, and frankly, I'm not likely to.  The 'bonus view' that I mentioned before, once enabled, will bring up a PIP screen during play and show some behind the scenes footage concurrently with the film, but once again, we were really only interested in the movie.  I mention these things just for those who might care.      There are over a thousand reviews for the regular DVD release of this film, so I wanted to concentrate on the Blu-Ray portion as much as possible.  I will say that this is a very entertaining film - maybe not brain candy - but exciting and enjoyable in a blockbuster sort of way.  It does not condescend or patronize, and a few silly moment aside (and what's a silly moment or two in a movie about a 25 foot tall ape between friends, anyway?), I'd recommend this to anyone that I thought could handle the intensity.  Terrific effects, and regardless of their status, relatively unobtrusive acting.  I'd call it a 4.5, but the darn thing's more fun than a barrel full of monkeys, so I'm rounding up.
1573229725|5.0|So, I'm currently about a week away from taking the dreaded LSAT (law school admission test) in order to one day save the world with my environmental law degree (kind of an \\"i am the lorax, i speak for the trees\\" thing). that or study literature forever.  At any rate, I bought this book assuming I would use it to take the occasional \\"study break\\" from my terribly tedious LSAT homework....yeah, that didn't happen.  Instead I hardly slept for 2 days and raced through all 600ish pages, could NOT put it down, absolutely living in the book. When I finally finished it, I was literally out of breath.<br /><br />Sue and Maud are amazing characters because they are both so perfectly human.  So much lesbian fiction and TV drama tries to force lesbians into this bizarre dichotomy of either squeaky-clean good girls in order to prove that they are not \\"sinful people,\\" or on the flip side, evil seductresses who are trying to \\"stick it to the man,\\" (and usually turn out straight in the end) to prove the exact opposite of the first image and reinforce negative stereotypes.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but that is just not real life.  Fingersmith's depiction of powerful, beautiful female characters is so refreshing compared to the cookie cutter 2-D characters of The L Word or that awful movie Imagine Me and You where it was just too damn cutesy and too careful not to make anyone uncomfortable that it left an over-sugary account of lesbian life (not to mention they are only together in the last 30 seconds of the film). So why did i watch it?  Well, simply because the world has such a small selection of lesbian themed ANYTHING that it doesn't leave much of a choice.<br /><br />That being said, however, Sarah Waters is BY FAR the best bet we have for writing and/or film adaptations that show characters who are not just \\"lesbians,\\" but women, who have real struggles, and real desires, and real problems.  She seamlessly transcends an entire century and creates Victorian characters who resonateso strongly with 21st century women, not to mention the plot twists, deliciously evil characters, atmospheric nuances, sexy scenes, and overall victorian scandal that make Fingersmith even better.<br /><br />I also really appreciate that her characters never fall decidedly into the butch/femme duality, SO sick of that! Maybe it's just because I've seen so many examples that don't conform to this and breaking conventions is always a good thing!<br /><br />Thanks Sarah Waters, like the others have said, you are a goddess :)
B000092T6M|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Plenty of action, adventure and romance with beautiful scenery. Excellent preformance by Kevin Costner playing Robin Hood. Beyond excellent preformance by Alan Rickman playing the Sheriff of Nottingham. Truely makes you feel his madness. Morgan Freeman plays and excellent part as a Moor who befriends Robin.  Surprise ending with the only man that could play King Richard. Bryan Adams sound track is amazing. A++++ movie.

0316017922|3.0|This book is mostly a pleasurable reading. The author uses the same writing techniques of his former books. He likes to challenge currently held opinion and then to propose solutions towards a better and more successful society. Nothing wrong with that.    The big issue with \\"Outliers\\" is the data used and the conclusions made from that set of data. The author filters and interprets what suits his goals and then jumps to the conclusions he aimed at. It is not hard to do google searches to find out how unreliable his data and his conclusions are.  I will mention just a few here:    - The author wants to relate Bill Gates's success to the opportunity he had to be exposed to computers early in life and to his intensive computer programming practice at early age. This could well apply to Bill Joy, but not to Gates, whose business skills and vision are certainly better than his computer programming. And what happened to the other kids in Gates' school who had the same exposure? Steve Jobs doesn't quite fit with the picture (no intensive computer practice, no 10,000 hours put on the computer keyboard), so he is not mentioned often. And again, many talented people also had exposure to computers similar to Jobs but didn't come any closer to his achievements. The author seems to suffer from the so-called survivor bias.     - The author often mentions that the fact that Asian students work so hard is directly related to their cultural legacy in agriculture. He uses that as an argument for their strong school performance. But the high suicide rates among them seem to show a different picture.  Asian parents seem to pressure their kids too much to force them in one direction (the so-called Asian pressure cooker). Those many hours come at a very high price and may represent a different cultural legacy.    - The author often stresses that the more you work the better you get at almost any activity. According to him, Asia does better than America in school performance because theyhave fewer holidays. The author then ignores Europe altogether. Most, if not all, Western European countries grant longer school vacation to their students and have at least twice as many days of annual paid vacation for their workers as America. In the international PISA math, science and reading exams, it is Western European countries that lead the pack. As for another example, powerhouse Germany grants six weeks of paid vacation per year to its workers. In this context, it is sad to see how the author is happy to show a poor (in more than one sense) 12-year-old girl as a role model. She has to wake up at 5:45 am and go to bed at 11:15 pm, having only about 20 minutes to talk to her mother because the rest of the time she is either at school or doing homework. No play, not enough sleep. What shall she become? According to the author, a possible university student. At any cost? At the cost of depression, lost childhood? What is the ultimate goal? A frustating job with a university diploma that pays the bills but does not talk to the heart that never experienced the joy of childhood? A life-long adult trip to the psychologist?    The author cites Einstein very many times. He expected Chris Langan to be at least as successful as him. The author often implies that hard work and social skills are more important than raw talent. Yet, as Einstein said, \\"imagination is more important than knowledge\\". America should be proud of being a culture that fosters creativity and emotional development and not only hard work.
B000BBOUD6|5.0|Wonderful saga of a family of men growing up in Montana post civil war. Brad Pitt is unbelievably hot in this movie. Anthony Hopkins is execellent as the patriarch of this movie.

B001LF4IA6|3.0|Bruce Springsteen is one of rock music's best songwriters and in a class of his own as a performer. That is his legend and legacy. It is also why \\"Working on a Dream\\" is a disappointment, especially following in the wake of his previous release, \\"Magic\\". Here, Springsteen seems to be trying to extend some of his new-found \\"poppiness\\" into unbearably slight tunes that leave no lasting impression or memory. Springsteen, however, could not produce an album of completely bad music even if he tried; here there is redemption in 'Outlaw Pete', an interesting attempt at cinematic narrative; the catchiness of 'My Lucky Day'; the heartfelt 'Kingdom of Days'; the wistful sadness of 'The Last Carnival' and excellent bonus track 'The Wrestler'. Springsteen is at his best when he crawls into a character's skin and brings out the emotions, dreams and fears he finds there. As for the rest of the album, it is almost all disposable, filler-type material. One song in particular stands out in its utter mediocrity; 'Queen of the Supermaket'. The lyrics, better suited to minimal instrumentation (if anything), are given an utterly inappropriate  arrangement that results in one of the worst recordings Springsteen has ever done. I never thought I would so dislike a Bruce Springsteen song, but there it is. Measured against a magnificent career, this album is ultimately inconsequential.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this band.  This live CD makes you feel like you are right there with them in Chicago.  Everyone should purchase this CD.

I only think that teen-age girls who are into he said she said like ` omg ` would like it, so that's who I recommend it to. The book is more modern when it takes place in a middle- upper class suburb. It's really on based around a mystery girl named Alison. So I guess you could say that the whole book is a mystery. The rest of the characters were very similar, they were all best friends and they all lead secret lives. I guess you'll just have to read the book to find out the rest ......

0440237688|5.0|Name: Audriana Santoya  Period:2    The Giver          The book, \\"The Giver,\\" is a very interesting and highly descriptive book. The author that wrote the book goes into very detailed events. The book takes place in a small town where people keep their lives simple. They have one big ceremony for the birthdays. For every age celebrated they are given one present to represent how mature they are or should be. At age seven of what they call the group of sevens, they receive a new jacket with buttons to represent themselves a s pre-independence to others and themselves. At the ceremony of twelve's, each child is given a specific job that h as been chosen by the head chief. The head chief goes around town with her assistants and spend many minutes examining each child would be good at according to their potential.         Jacob, the main character was given the job to be a Giver, the most respected people of all and the most highly important job in the community. As the head chief was awarding Jacob she had also brought up that soon will come pain and hurt which everybody expected Jacob to know because they didn't. Jacob was given an envelope and was told to arrive at a certain place first thing the next morning. The envelope that Jacob had received was one paper with a list of rules that were to be followed or optional. The one rule that he did not want to follow was the one that said he had the right to lie. Jacob was always use to telling the truth as well as the rest of the community. As soon as the morning rose, The Giver started to training Jacob right away. The Giver had told Jacob that he would be known as, \\"The Receiver,\\" until he was given all memories and all power. The Giver would have Jacob lie down and close his eyes as the Giver sensitively stroked his hand along the back of Jacob and began giving happy memories like snow to Jacob. After a while of training, The Giver felt like Jacob was ready to become the new Giver, he had told Jacob to use his powers to leave the community as fast as possible without saying goodbye to anybody. This was because the community had to learn how to take control by themselves and learn more painful and confusing things sense they always relied on The Giver. So Jacob and a baby named Gabriel headed for another community. Jacob used his heating memories to keep Gabriel warm. Soon they arrived safely at the community.
B00007GZR5|2.0|Delivery was timely, and product was received in good condition, with what appeared to be original sealed plastic cover.  Video portion was fine, but audio is extremely uneven and required constant adjustment during playing.  I have not complained to the seller and probably won't - this is probably part of the risk in ordering DVD products.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|I like this album. I do agree with some things people said about Queen of the Supermarket & Surprise, Surprise.  After listening to this CD a few times, it's quickly growing on me. There's nothing like putting on some headphones and getting lost in Springsteen's music. Don't care for the song Good Eye.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|With his 16th studio LP \\"Working on a Dream\\" Bruce Springsteen is in surprisingly prolific form. The follow-up to October 2007's chart-topping \\"Magic,\\" the album shows Springsteen and the E Street Band mightily inspired, delivering tight, inspired anthems one by one with relatively few quiet moments. It is not a high-concept project or major departure, and it will likely garner Springsteen only a handful of new listeners, but those who have enjoyed his recent output will find much savor and play on repeat. It is also sure to win many previous fans back into the fold.<br /><br />One thing that makes \\"Working on a Dream\\" markedly different from the bulk of Springsteen's 2000s output is that it is not top-heavy on political declarations. Refreshingly, he returns to the art of lyrical subtlety. The guttural, harmonious title track and the more propulsive \\"My Lucky Day\\" exemplify this, showing Springsteen making more of a knowing nod toward the unstable American climate than a pointed examination. As on the bulk of the record, he is more interested in fond reminiscences and celebrating the great potential that lies ahead both personally and politically. More than anything, this album is a celebration.<br /><br />\\"What Love Can Do\\" is a particular standout, held over from the \\"Magic\\" sessions. One of the most instantly memorable, hooky tracks, the track is a chugging, guitar-filled anthem with the E Street Band working like gangbusters:<br /><br />\\"Here our memory lay corrupted and our city lay dry/Let me make this vow to you/Here where it's blood for blood and an eye for an eye/Let me show you what love can do/Let me show you what love can do.\\"<br /><br />The Boss also aims for the heart on more than a few sticky-as-Christmas-tree romantic odes. \\"As the evening sky turns blue a dream awaits in aisle number two\\" he sings on \\"Queen of the Supermarket.\\" \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is unadulterated sap, but it works from all angles and is worth repeated listens. The adventurous, highly melodic \\"This Life\\" and \\"Life Itself\\" follow suit.<br /><br />A stirring tribute to recently passed organist Danny Federici, \\"The Last Carnival,\\" adds further context to the reflective mood that colors the disc.<br /><br />In spite of the album's overall cheery disposition - it is without a doubt the happiest Springsteen record in eons - it will surprise few devotees that his more pensive, soul-searching selections inform the best moments, in this case the bookending duo of \\"Outlaw Pete\\" and the title theme from the motion picture \\"The Wrestler.\\"<br /><br />\\"Outlaw Pete\\" immediately ranks as one of the Boss' top story songs. His sprawling, other-worldly delivery, married with the band's inspired playing, is positively hair-raising as the song sways, peaks, growls and tremors over its epic eight minutes. \\"The Wrestler\\" ends the disc on a mellow, brooding high note as Springsteen channels the titular character of Mickey Rourke's Oscar-nominated performance. The track was surprisingly snubbed for the Oscar nomination for Best Original Song in favor of Peter Gabriel's quirky \\"Down to Earth\\" from \\"Wall-E\\" and selections from \\"Slumdog Millionaire,\\" but has nonetheless drummed up deserved attention and praise.<br /><br />A deluxe version featuring a DVD with studio outtakes and a 40-minute documentary is available.e Itself\\" follow suit.

B001E95ZI8|4.0|Argh! Curse you 20th Century FOX for your pricing structure.  I'd rate this film a buy-it in a heartbeat if the price was about 30 percent lower than it is (yes, I know that Amazon keeps their Blu-rays on sale regularly, so it's already discounted... what I am wishing is that the MSRP was lower so that Amazon's price could be lowered in which case I'd probably buy this without even pausing).  Thanks to the higher MSRP I'm left to say this one is at least worth a rental, but probably would have to be on sale to really pull the buy it rating.<br /><br />No, there's nothing wrong with the film in my book, in fact it's a pretty likable and entertaining comedy.  While critics gave the film a mixed reception (39 percent rotten), there've been plenty of films that are worse and which fail to deliver anything close to the entertainment value found here.<br /><br />The Rocker features a fairly talented cast that seem to fit the roles they were in, though star Rainn Wilson (The Office, Six Feet Under, others) and his bandmates don't necessarily look that young at the start of the film (20 years ago), and don't necessarily seem all that old so much later in the film either.<br /><br />So here's the story, in case you are not familiar with The Rocker: an up-and-coming rock band is about to hit it big, with the record company scout in the audience as they are playing to a packed house.  As the show wraps up the record company exec comes in and sends the band's drummer out to go get some beer.  Not just any beer, but the good stuff.  Imported even.  The band knows that must mean good news, and yes, it really does, though not for everyone in the band.  It seems that the record company president has a relative that wants to be a rockstar who just happens to play the drums.  You'd have to blind not to see where things are going there...<br /><br />Flash forward 20 years to find that former drummer Robert 'Fish' Fishman (Wilson) can't seem to escape the loss of his chance at fame and rockstar fortune.  One of his cubicle mates has purchased the latest CD from his old band and forces Fish (and the rest of the office) to give it a listen.  Needless to say Fish isn't particularly pleased by that idea :-/<br /><br />Fish winds up out of work, tossed out by his girlfriend and with no where to go but to his sister's house.  There he renews acquaintances with his nephew Matt Gadman (Josh Gad, formerly in FOX's short-lived TV series Back to You) and Matt's parents (Jeff Garlin of Curb Your Enthusiasm and others along with Jane Lynch of The L Word, The 40 Year Virgin and others).  It seems that Matt is in a band with a few of his high school friends: Curtis (Teddy Geiger, formerly on the CBS series Love Monkey), Amelia (Emma Stone of FOX's short-lived series Drive and others) along with a drummer that finds himself grounded for a few pranks he's pulled at school.<br /><br />The band has already been booked to play the prom, so as a favor Fish joins the band and takes up the role of drummer.  Sensing how talented Curtis is, and perhaps sensing another shot at the rockstar life, Fish promises to get a gig for the band and winds up doing just that.  Soon, through a happy accident involving You Tube, Fish has done more than just get a gig for the band, he's gotten them interest from a record label that wants to send the band on the road.<br /><br />The rocker doesn't always hit all of the notes it aims for, but more often than not it delivers fairly solid entertainment value for viewers.  Fish gets to have some of the fun that he missed out on while his old band was working their way to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Unfortunately some of that fun is a little too much for the parents of the band mates to live with, so Curtis mother Kim (Christina Applegate) becomes a chaperon on the tour.<br /><br />Be sure to look for a few cameos and small roles by a few notable individuals and also enjoy the short performances by Fish's old band mates, at least one ofwhich was barely recognizable until well into his appearance.<br /><br />Making the film a bit more enjoyable is a solid sound track with an enjoyable collection of rock anthems along with 'original music' from A.D.D. (the kids band).<br /><br />Video quality is quite solid, and looks quite nice for the concert type footage.  There's some nice shots of the Cleveland cityscape included too.  With the film being a recent release, the source material is all clean and was obviously ready for transfer to high-definition disc format.<br /><br />In addition to other bonus features, the Blu-ray includes Digital Copy, though again the price for purchase is still higher than I'd prefer.Making the film a bit more enjoyable is a solid sound track with an enjoyable collection of rock anthems along with 'original music' from A.D.D.

0307269752|5.0|I liked this book - I liked the story lines and how they intertwined, and I really liked the characters.<br /><br />The one thing that was a true surprise was the ending.  It's not your typical lovely ending.  Pick it up - read it, and you will find you are right there on the pages with the characters.
B0018CWEYY|3.0|Amazon quickly replaced a bad copy my Fourth Season, LOST, and even refunded my shipping costs! Sometimes stuff happens, but Amazon did not hesitate to help me correct a problem. I had a new set of LOST within a week.Amazon even sent me a return lable, post paid. Now I know I can trust Amazon to \\"make it right\\" if ever a problem pops up with my future purchases.<br />The replacement set is perfect. No missed pixels. Smooooooth!<br />Here is my flash back-<br />I waited a very long year before the delivery of my Fourth Season, LOST.<br />When it arrived I delved into it with great pleasure. I ignored the ocassional pixel misses, just enjoying the story. Finally on disk two it because impossible to ignore the problems, it wouldn't even load. I tried playing disk two on another DVD player. No hope left, I contacted Amazon via internet and used their easy to follow return/replace page.<br />Good service, no hassel, replacement is great.

B000JRYOPG|5.0|I first heard about this movie from watching the previews on DVD of another movie I was watching, so I rented the movie and was blown away!!    I now own my own copy of Shottas and never tire watching... each time is like watching for the first time.    The story is a powerful one! I can understand why this movie has quickly spread via the underground, but I do not understand why Shottas hasn't received the full recognition it deserves from Hollywood.     If you love ScarFace then you'll love Shottas even more is all I have to say.    I'm so glad there were subtitles...lol and the Shottas dictionary, there was no way I would've understood what some things being said were. I didn't know how one word \\"bloodclat\\" could have so many synonyms: bumboclaat, rassclaat and pussyclaat, lol.    I can't wait until the sequel comes out!!

0596522347|3.0|This was my first PowerPoint book so when I first read it, I thought it was fantastic.<br /><br />What it is:<br />A reference that offers great design ideas, guidance on presenting information, layout, content, PowerPoint and storytelling. Sure, applying all of her principles will take a lot of time, focus, and clients/higher ups that are willing to try her method. But applying just one of her principles is easy to do. Either way, formatting your slides the slide:ology way will shift your presentation from good to better.<br /><br />What is isn't:<br />This is not really a how-to book meaning it shows you the principles to follow but not necessarily how to achieve it. While I don't have a recommendation on which book to get, if you are a PowerPoint beginner, it would be wise to invest in a step-by-step guide as well.
0307346617|5.0|I tend to enjoy anything that slaps the word zombie into its title or premise.  Like many others out there I believe it is not a matter of IF the zombie attack will happen but WHEN it will happen.  Brooks won me over the first time with \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" but this surpasses that on all accounts.  It is far more than a simple fun book about a ficticous zombie war.  It is a harrowing tale about the strength of humanity and dispair and horror that can consume us when we are faced with the very real idea of eat or be eaten.  This book will scare you, make you laugh, and make you cry.  It never at any point felt like fiction to me and specifically the section detailing the family around the banks of the lake it felt very real and very scary.  Even if you are not a fan of zombie material this book offers so much more.
1400082773|5.0|A fascinating memoir that reads like a novel and reveals one man's search for racial, cultural, and personal identity. Wonderfully written, skillfully paced, and surprisingly candid with full-blown characters that live and breathe. Takes you from the author's boyhood in Hawaii and Indonesia to his young adult years on the south side of Chicago to the discovery of his extended family and ancestral roots in Kenya. A terrific book even if you are NOT obsessed with Barack Obama! But if you really want to understand the deep, honest, and brilliant man of integrity that we elected to lead our nation, this is a must read!
B0002PZVH0|5.0|Brian Eno's  \\"Ambient 1: Music for Airports\\"...where to start without sounding like a scatterbrain? Lets conspire for a moment, this is a man who believes he is not a musician, yet has crafted a musical genre for the free flowing, a genre collectively gaining interest ever since a resurgence in the 90's. This is a genre that can captivate you passively. Adding subtle intensity flairs without you hardly noticing. What is it that Eno did, to make this genre so appealing, and lastly what is this genre?<br /><br />This genre is called ambient and widely diversifies, but maybe not to the extent of rocks crevices. This is a genre that bends and goes with the flow. The music itself is highly conditioned to moviegoers and even gamers. It can be herd in some stores and even on your television. It's very much so transparent as much as it is apparent.<br /><br /> This is THE album to softly connect ambient, from a visual arts perspective, to an atmospheric style of abstract music. So before I sound like I'm rambling on specifically of the genre itself I just wanted to fill in a few readers on the premises. This album is fluently graced of gradient sounds that will flow in and out much like the listeners consciousness of the album. It was said to be more pleasurably at low volumes, just to warmly and atmospherically fill your room in, with wave after wave of sound it feels full yet oddly spacious. It's really a difficult album (and genre) as a whole to describe what it sounds like, as the notes are less important in comparison to the actual feel and mood it offers.<br /><br />Four tracks are at your disposal here. No superior tracks to stumble upon and kick the rest down a notch (at least in my opinion). The four tracks are all equally interesting (I tend to favor the two middle tracks \\"2-1\\" & \\"1-2\\"), but in terms of duration \\"1-1\\" (the first track) is noticeably the longest clocking in past the seventeen minute mark.<br /><br />Just to do a little homework, I researched the reason to why Eno called this style `ambient'. Apparently `ambire' is a Latin term meaning `to surround'. I believe this thoroughly fits. I hope this album will get you into this calm soothing experience ambient has to offer. If you're already familiar with this please pick this up.yle `ambient'. Apparently `ambire' is a Latin term meaning `to surround'. I believe this thoroughly fits.

B0016NF06O|5.0|It's a great band playing New Orleans traditional jazz, not just \\"two men with the blues.\\"  But I guess that's a better title.  Willie is declaiming more than singing, but that's not a bad thing because (1) he's Willie, not Frank Sinatra, and (2) he's doing the traditional jazz thing of setting up the melody for the players.  If you followed Willie here, you like and want to keep going in this direction, try Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Kid Thomas and Albert Burbank, as a start.
B001GQNZCC|4.0|Not as good as R30 (which should be out on Blu-Ray, it was shot in hi-def), but still entertaining.  A fairly good set, and you can tell our trio is still having fun on stage.  One issue, the DTS-HD Master Audio mix pales in comparison to the Rush in Rio and R30 DVDs.  It's not a question of quality, it's the mix.  The PCM stereo mix is much better.    Easily worth the price for any Rush fan (we have been for ages).
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|Seeing it on DVD with subtitles was almost like seeing a new movie - one that I understood a lot better.  Seeing it for the second time also helped.  The first time (15 years ago at the theatre) I was too busy being shocked by the incredible violence of the film (i.e. Joe Pesci).  I didn't understand why Pesci seemed more powerful than DeNiro.  Second time I got it - Pesci's character is a 'made guy'.  DeNiro's is not.  Perhaps all those Sopranos episodes between now and the last time I saw this film tuned me into things I didn't pick up on the first time.      I liked it the first time I saw it though not understanding why DeNiro's character let Pesci's run the show had bothered me.  The violence bothered me.  The second time, I was (a bit more) prepared for the violence and had time to notice other things - like DeNiro's character and some of the mistakes he made along the way - he wouldn't give in on little things - money issues perhaps.  These things cost him a lot more in the long run.  Take for example not letting the hick relative of a powerful politician stay on the job.  And not allowing his wife to get away with giving her ex-lover the $25,000 she seemed so bent on giving him.  Even when she returns to him he cannot let sleeping dogs lie and instead has to find out exactly how she used the 25,000 until their relationship has once again disintegrated.  While Pesci's character is wildly out of control and the  most obvious cause of what brings them down, Rosenthal's own quiet stubbornesses have enormous consequence in what later goes down as well.    I found this movie relentlessly fascinating/horrifying and hardly noticed it was 3 hours.  To say Casino is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean Streets and GoodFellas) is just a joke.  Mean Streets is nowhere near as fast-paced (or gripping) as Casino and while Good Fellas is considered Scorceses mob masterpiece I'd venture to say Casino is roughly in the same ballpark interms of greatness (and certainly fast-paced intensity).      In terms of DVD special features, the Anniversary edition (anamorphic widescreen 2.35:1) is double-sided with the movie on side A, and bonus features on side B including:     *Deleted scenes,    *\\"Casino: The Story\\" - how Scorcese collaborated with writer Pileggi,     *\\"Casino: The Cast and Characters\\" - a look at the real people behind the characters and how the filmmakers cast them,     *\\"Moments with Scorsese, Stone, Pileggi and more!\\",     *\\"Vegas and the Mob\\",     *\\"True Crime Authors: Casino with Nicholas Pileggi\\"      This is a fairly jam-packed single dvd for special features and well worth the 4 or so bucks it's going for on Amazon.  I think I enjoyed it more on DVD than I did at the movies.
0345495004|3.0|The idea of fashioning a novel based on historical events, and using that technique to delve into what the people may have been thinking, is clever. This novel does not take full advantage. The action is repetitive, the questions the same throughout, the struggles the same over and over, so that the reader is left wishing that the novel were 100 pages shorter. The novelist's task may have been harder given that both of the main characters are often exasperating. Nancy Horan writes a few memorable paragraphs, including one that eloquently captures the soul-mate connection that occurs when two people first fall in love. Other than that, I found the book boring. Time to re-read The Fountainhead.

1400067936|5.0|Overall I give this book five stars despite what I might view as a few shortcomings because I found it to offer a unique way of looking at randomness and risk.  I thought it was even more interesting to read this book ex post the recent \\"subprime meltdown\\".    Pros:  - Contains a wide bredth of thought-provoking ideas.  - Provides a unique perspective on how to look at the role of randomness/risk, specifically but not limited to the area of finance.    Cons:  - At times it felt like the writing was just a flagrant assertion of Taleb's intellectual depth in areas such as mythology, philosophy, and a few other subjects he appears to be well read in.  However, I suppose most people tend to discuss ideas in terms of relating them to what they already know.  - I would have found it interesting if Taleb went further into the mechanics of his options trades--ie. describe the actual execution.  Rather he just tells you \\"I always take positions in which I lose almost nothing under normal circumstances, but make an enormous profit when a rare event occurs\\".  That's great; give me more detail on how that works.  - I wouldn't go so far as to say that the book was repetitive, but I would say that I think some of the ideas could have been better consolidated.
B00003CXDV|5.0|\\"Galaxy Quest\\" is a fantastic satire on Star Trek and pokes a little fun at Trekies too, but all in good taste.<br /><br />Staring Tim Allen as Commander Taggart, Sigourney Weaver as \\"Lt. Madison\\", and Alan Rickman (\\"Snape' in the Harry Potter movies) as \\"Dr. Lazarus\\". Well more acurately, they play actors playing those parts.<br /><br />No spoilers from me, but the movie has a strong plot, good special effects, and is very well acted. The best parts of the movie are the scenes where the writers \\"nailed\\" the Trek actors (Shatner comes to mind :-) and the convention crowds.<br /><br />This is a seriously funny movie! Highly Recommended!

B001DTPZNY|2.0|Indiana Jones movies are supposed to be a little silly. However, this plot with the aliens just drags. The big revelations are lame and the end is silly. Are the extra-dimensional beings good or evil? They help start civilization, but they seem pretty careless about all life when the ship took off.     The stunts were a hit and miss. Harrison Ford was great as Indy again. The relationship between Jones and his son was ok. I thought the relationship with Jones and the old girl friend was pretty good. However, the plot itself became so silly that I didn't care after a while.

I must say it describes the \\"place\\" these songs can take you quite well.  When I die, it'll be these songs playing.

Thanks, Lisa you did a great job! To many more books!
0312263120|2.0|Digital Fortress is a book that gets into the plot almost right away, unlike other fiction where the author narrates a whole lot before getting on the real story. I am certainly not a very patient reader who will read/wait forever for the plot to start and get interesting. But this book had me hooked on almost instantaneously. This was one and probably the only positive aspect of this book! The rest of the story has been heavily weighed down by lots of factual errors and the thoughtlessness of some characters (who are supposed to be the smartest blokes on earth).   Some examples:   1. NSA, which in many ways is an authority higher than CIA and FBI, doesn't seem to have any employees working on weekends;   2. NSA's Cryptography department and building seems to constitute of only about 5-10 employees;  3. NSA doesn't have its own translators!? Does it employ some college-language professors on contract basis!?  4. Emergency services seem non-existential in NSA although the 2-billion dollar computer TRANSLTR is undergoing a melt-down - no one ventures around NSA's cryptography department throughout the night of the proceedings;  5. NSA employees can take devices home!? Hale took the keyboards home to add a chip in them and trap the password entered!  6. The databank doesn't have a backup!!! Turning off the databank takes 30 mintues!!!  7. Susan never questions the fact that there is a printout lying by Hale's side when the rest of Node 3 office is out of power; And the fact that all the while before he died he was trying to impress upon her how he is innocent and then suddenly he has this bout of remorse;  8. It takes ages for the head of cryptography department to realize that there are 16 blocks of 4 characters and that 16 x 4 = 64 and that its a perfect square! It takes a language professor to make her see that! Further it takes even longer for her to realize the PRIME DIFFERENCE in ELEMENTS of the atomic bombs... blah blah blah! How dumb can she be!?   9. Cant believe that NSA has a personnel like Jaba working as their chief sys sec - an impatient nerd who cant stop wagging his tongue in the moment of crisis!!!  My take on this book: borrow it to read, but don't buy it!

B001L5SXQG|2.0|Being a big fan of Bruce it is hard to listen again to such an awfully produced album. The sound is boxy, the backing vocals arrangements are lacking; what a waste of the great music the E-Street Band can produce. The songs will certainly sound better live because they are so bad on the record.  The songs writing is better compared to the last effort (Magic) but well below par compared to the Rising or Bruce's earlier effort.  Last but not least, the new tour is priced sky high with some tickets 20% more expensive compared to last year in Europe. Bruce had a great and long career thanks also to his commitment and respect for his fans; releasing one un-inspired album every year with an expensive tour to follow in big stadiums might be good for Sony but not for fans.

0440244870|5.0|This book is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it for a light funny read.  If I were working with Rebecca, I would tell her to go to Debtor's Anonymous before she lost everything.  But this is a novel, not real life.  I think we can all identify with a girl who loves shoes, handbags and all the other material things life has to offer.  I cannot wait to see the movie.   If liked Sex and the City or The Devil Wears Prada, you will love this book.  Great \\"Chick Lit\\" to escape from our problems.  Let's face it, now in the economic downturn, it is time to have a laugh and enjoy ourselves by watching someone who has a worse spending problem than we do. [[ASIN:1604941987 Power Path to Love]]

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just found this series.  I bought the whole thing when the price fell.  I bought it on reputation alone, and I must say it is excellent.  It's not Babylon 5 or the new Battlestar G.; however, there is a new Browncoat....me...and my wife!  What brought me to the seires was all the hype the fans have put out and the price.  We have watched the first disc and my wife and I are watching an episode each night or so.  I am loving it and so is she.  I will be \\"converting\\" all my sci-fi pals as soon as possible.  NOTE:  My wife is not really a sci-fi fan and really likes the series.  I am excited because she likes something that I do and we can share it.  Awesome show.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The purchasing went very well.  The movie is extraordinary.  I had not had a chance to view it all in sequence before, and it is a powerful portrait of war, of brotherhood and both love and loss.  It is a great cast, great music and excellent photography.
0307455874|1.0|This 'One' who is setting himself up as a 'Messiah' gives me the creeps.He is setting himself as a savior of the    world.His articulateness and the media propping his enormous popularity reminds me of a 'sheep' Hitler.Just    because he has no bloodlust doesn't make him any harmless.I feel his legacy would be ending America's gre-    atness and I think of that not in racial terms as I myself isn't Caucasian.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This movie is for anyone who has ever loved to hear a story as a child, for anyone who has lost what seems irreplaceable... it is a story of the will and strength that is in each one of us to really live, no matter what. It is a visual, musical and artistic masterpiece.
B001EO748M|5.0|I love this television show!  And getting it through amazon.com was so easy. =]

B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Maybe some people did not like this movie.  I had never heard of it until I rented the DVD.  Mostly I do not buy DVDs, since I have NetFlix, can watch free videos on there, cheap ones right here on Amazon, and on hulu and numerous other sites. However, that movie is one of the few I ever bought on DVD--the story is good and is very enhanced by the music.  Liam Neeson is one of the stars, as is Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and numerous others.  I am writing this the end of January 2009, and both Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson have movies that have just started playing in San Diego.
0385338732|5.0|I could not put this book down. I'm a huge Sophie Kinsella fan, maybe that is why I loved it so much. I thought it was funny and I was happy with the ending.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you like musicals,are a comic book nerd, love Serenity, Firefly, Joss Whedon, or just Neil Patrick Harris...you will definitely enjoy this dvd. I saw it when it first showed up online but the dvd is definitely worth it just for Commentary the Musical! I recommend this...everyone here is top notch.
0440241413|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with the main character. The book was funny and I couldn't put it down. When I finished it was on to the next in the series. I love Sophie Kinsella, a great series.
031606792X|5.0|Amazing series that created mass hysteria and attendant movies, tie-ins and all the mass consumer phenomena that is standard now with such successes - would Dickens gone through the same thing in his time if the big media houses were around? At least, it would have helped him with his money troubles.    What new thing can be said about the Twilight books? I resent the fact that every review pigeonholes these books as targetted at teenage girls.  Good literature is universal - for all ages and nationalities and for all time!  Twilight taps into universal needs and emotions - everyone is lonely, not just teenage girls - and everyone is looking for the perfect companion.  Alas, only a vampire can be a perfect companion - or so the series seems to say.  This might not be the best book in the series - isn't always the first book in any series the most exciting? But, it continues the amazing story and will not dissapoint fans of this series!
1844137872|5.0|If you have a taste for subversive art that seeks to redress the dominant discourses of our times, then the work illustrated in this book will give a taste of an important player. 'Wall and Piece' documents Banksy's visual opinions on so many live issues in a manner that will leave you tossing in your bed. He claims that,'I'm going to speak my mind, so this won't take very long.' True. It's only a half hour flip through this generous picture book. But what you experience, as with any strong art, will linger much longer. Herein are his ripostes to 'the people who truly deface our neighborhoods...the companies that scrawl giant slogans across buildings and buses trying to make us feel inadequate unless we buy their stuff'. Pithy texts underscore pithier photos..'a lot of people never use their initiative because no one told them to'. His visual conundrums target those who hold the reins over piece, justice and freedom. So its a vast charter; from corporate capitalism through zoos, police, soldiery, governments,royalty, and to signeage itself. Be empowered; stencilling advice available on the last page.

B000NDIAWY|4.0|Heard her \\"Story\\" in a commercial during the Olympics and searched a lot to find out who sang it.  Just could not get that song out of my mind!  The rest of the album continues with her good voice.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|I loved this film on so many different levels. First off the actors were amazing, especially Gemma Arterton in the lead role as Tess Durbeyfield. I am not sure why some reviewers prefer Justine Waddell's performance from 1998. The clips that I have viewed of it on YouTube show a very subdued almost wooden Tess, whereas, I loved Gemma's voice and feistiness. Perhaps that is not what Mr. Hardy had in mind for the heroine of this tragic tale, but it works  beautifully in 2008. I thought the musical score by Rob Lane was incredible as well as the cinematography and the wardrobe, this in spite of a mysterious fire that  destroyed most of the costumes before filming started. I will definitely purchase this DVD for my collection.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|This was an amazing movie:  from the effects to the plot to the acting to the directing.  Just a great movie from start to finish. Also a must on blu-ray, the color's and sound are perfect. This is not a huge hollywood blockbuster, but they made it seem like one.<br />As with all blu-ray disc's, if you can find it cheaper than your BB store, which should be easy, then get it.
031606792X|5.0|This book was great. I was, however, sad that it had to come to an end.
0061139378|5.0|What a disturbing, delicious and wonderful story!  This is the type of book I'd have devoured as a little girl -- the type of book that would have kept me awake half the night listening for \\"rustling, scratchy and dry\\" voices that makes one think of \\"some kind of enormous dead insect\\".  However, it is also the type of book I'd have read over and over and over again and would still proudly own as an adult -- page-worn and abused from multiple readings.  It is beautifully written and just as the imagination starts to explode with some seriously frightening images, Gaiman inserts a bit of droll wit that has you laughing at the absurdity of it all.  I highly recommend that you read this book aloud to your children -- preferably during the night of a full moon.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly - The Complete Series is a campy, sometimes serious and sometimes cheesy TV sci-fi series filmed with a feel of a Western, that was cancelled after one season and one movie (Serenity).  I never watched it when it ran, but after discovering it have watched it over and over with ever improving glee.  The Dvd features help bring closure due to the premature cancellation of the series.
0743277457|5.0|This Book is excellent it provided me with a path to greater understanding of getting more out of myself.  I really liked his chapter on making smaller circles which I have used.  Some reviewers have discussed the book as been a bit vague but I have found that digging deep and using the concepts in our own way has provided me with a new understanding of how to move to better and better levels with myself.
0671799320|5.0|The Prize is a very facinating history of the oil age. It tells of the origin of all the major oil compaies that are here today. Some times it gets a little tedious with incidents in history but really gives a picture of the ruthlessness of the big time oil men.
0312383320|4.0|I have to say, I enjoyed this book.  Everyone of her books has me laughing out loud (which is a little embarrassing on public transportation).  I go into these books knowing they aren't Pulitzer Prize winning pieces; just pure entertainment.  Besides, these between-the-numbers books help tide me over until the next full novel comes out.  I found Carl the monkey cute.  I wish there was more with Joe and Ranger but I know this is Diesel's time to shine.  No matter what, Lula is a hoot.  I can hardly wait until June with the 15th book comes out.

B00000FZQ8|1.0|I have only walked out on two movies in my lifetime -- this was one of them.  Absurdly bad acting from Bruce Dern, whom I have generally liked in movies and TV.  I like sci-fi, love movies, but couldn't suspend my disbelief for this.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|I found the turntable and connections work well, as do the improvements in sound quality.  However, I have had problems using the software. I can't seem to get the songs into new files without losing old ones.  They need to have clearer instructions on where to put the music on your computer, and still have them in your iTunes library.  I am also having issues with monitoring the record while it's downloading.  I am sure I will eventually solve these issues, but the software needs to be more specific about files and iTunes.
B001GQACGO|1.0|Her songs are horrible... period. There is no meaning and honestly all her songs contain about 10 words repeated over and over again. It's a shame her voice has to go to waste like that but at least she has good movies to provide her with some good music.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|A well made movie and funny to boot. I bought this to show my friends and play in the background when the mood suits me. The video is great and the Audio is well above my expectations. Even my 6 year old son knows all the words. There are a few unexpected moments that I'd rather my son not watch (even though \\"the hammer is my penis\\" is the funniest joke in the movie) but other than that it's great. The special features are good, but the meat and bones is the show!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|My hands are constantly clammy, so naturally they're even worse when I'm using the Dual Shock 3. For some reason Sony decided to make convex L2 and R2 triggers, and once pressed, I find  my fingers slowly slipping off. It's not a huge issue, but quite irritating.   RealTriggers completely fix the problem. They add to the experience of a fps or racing game and barely bulk up the body of the DS 3. Installation is mind numbingly simple, so you're up and playing in seconds. The transition is a little weird (going from without to with them) as there's some extra plastic to contend with, but you adapt quickly.   The build quality of these is great. They look like they're made of rubber in the picture, but they're virtually the same plastic as the shoulder buttons of the Dual Shock 3, so the controller feels like it came from the factory that way.  Buy these, you won't be disappointed.
0553381687|5.0|True literature for those who appreciated it.  Comical, Tyron is my favorite character.  Violent as a real man's novel should be.  Real world dynamics in terms of character development.  This series is a must read.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|For those who say this is a boring album, it sucks, Tweedy lost it.....etc. You are fools, this is a great record. It's sad and beautiful, bittersweet. Wilco is a jam band, and jam they do on this record. You can still hear remnants of Wilco past, however they definitely have progressed. Wilco is a band that is still around making greeat records and not selling out or following trends. Impossible Germany is by far the best song on this album, you cannot listen to it and not be affected by the emotion of the track. If you're still not convinced check them out live, and forever be converted.
B00000G3AZ|1.0|[[ASIN:B00000G3AZ Emma (1996)]]<br /><br />The DVD was really poor quality. Even on maximum the volume was too quiet. The colour was terrible, and the picture was very dark.  Acceptable quality could not be achieved by adjusting the picture. Looked like it had been recorded off a dodgy TV.
B001LF4IA6|2.0|I read a Springsteen interview once where he noted that his fans don't seem to like his music when he's happy.  I thought then - and I think now - that even his serious albums have music that makes me happier than anything else I've ever heard, and I don't mean just Thunder Road or Born to Run, but Open All Night (Dublin Live) or Maria's Bed (Devils & Dust).    So I'm sorry to say that I'm yet another one of those long-time Springsteen fans who's disappointed in this album.  The Bruce I love seems to sing directly to the audience, but in this CD, as in Magic, he sounds about 10 miles away, with a lot of noise between us.  I have to say I think this album is worse than Magic, however, because there's not a single song that makes you want to get up and rock, and only the Wrestler genuinely touches your emotions.  Are we having fun or do we care when we listen to this?  When the answer to both is no then the album comes nowhere near Bruce's usual standards.  Outlaw Pete is the closest we can get to enjoyment, but Supermarket Queen and Surprise Surprise are so cheesy that I'm embarrassed to listen to them.  And the album is unusually unvaried (read:  boring), with nearly every song at a similar volume and tempo.    Bruce still has plenty of energy in concert - I saw him last in August when he was outstanding - but he sounds pretty tired here.  And, as others have mentioned, the E-Street band might be credited, but I can't hear them.  He's always had ups and downs, so we can keep our fingers crossed for Better Days...
B000O75VSK|5.0|I love symphonic metal and I love commercial rock. This CD fulfills both those qualifications. I also believe that This woman could sing anything she wanted to. I'm glad it's for After Forever. Great songwriting, excellent lyrics, dynamic and skilled musicianship. I was a complete Within Temptation addict but I have been converted by the voice of this young lady. Powerful, beautiful and rockin'. (NOTE: After Forever, Please come to Colorado, I was so disappointed you missed us last time around.)<br /><br />Buy this CD, you will NOT be disappointed. You will however will have to shell out more cash, because once you fall in love with this band, you will want every CD they've released. I now own everyone and I have yet to be disappointed with a single release.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|As many have mentioned David Cook is versatile enough to cover virtually any type of music with the ability to make it his own. My wife and I where afraid the younger audience of American Idol would select David Archuletta (SP). Not that the other David is bad, but in our opinion the right David won the competition.    Anyway I was pleasantly surprised when I heard this compilation and even here he crosses a couple of music boundaries creating an album that I don't seem to get tired of listening too.    My wife and I listen to classic rock for the most part, and honestly he's found a solid place in our play lists. I would recommend this CD to my best friends with no hesitation.     Finally I'm glad American Idol is actually bring out talent to the public that has such mass appeal in the past few seasons.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Personally, I found \\"Train of Thought\\" to be an amazingly brilliant album from Dream Theater, and it's also the heaviest album they've ever released, even heavier than 1994's \\"Awake\\". This album is also Dream Theater's most underrated and harshly criticized release in their catalog. I know alot of fans who enjoyed the band's older material have strongly criticized \\"Train of Thought\\" for being \\"too heavy\\" and \\"too metal\\", and stuff like that. I seriously don't find anything wrong with this album, I mean, I own every Dream Theater album (except for \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\"), and I don't even remember that last time they ever released one bad album. Each album of theirs is different in it's own way, and ToT proves that Dream Theater are never afraid to try anything different without forsaking their progressive sound, and that's what made them one of progressive metal's best bands to begin with.<br /><br />Now onto the album, \\"Train of Thought\\" is nearly 70 minutes of pure, menacing, monstrous, progressive metal brilliance that will totally assault your senses. There are seven epically, masterful songs (most of them clocking in at between 10 and 15 minutes long) that will take you on an awesomely epic and unforgettable ride you'll never forget. The band's musicianship is in absolute full force throughout this album. James LaBrie delivers an awesome vocal performance as he usually does on any DT album. His vocals can range from melodic and soaring (\\"Endless Sacrifice\\" and \\"In the Name of God\\") to fierce and angry (\\"As I Am\\"). Guitarist John Petrucci truly steals the show on this album. His riffs are just heavy, crushing, chunky, monstrous and very technical, and his solos are just absolutely sick and wicked, yet very virtuoistic. I've said it many times before, but I'll say it again, Petrucci is without question one of the BEST rock/metal guitarists ever. Jordan Rudess also shines as he shows off his awesome keyboarding skills with dazzling effects and solos of his own, while bassist John Myung powers his way throughout with strong, humming, muscular basslines, and of course Mike Portnoy does an awesome performance behind the drums as he usually can, and he also shows his great double bass skills as well.<br /><br />Now we'll take a look at the songs.<br /><br />Kicking off the album, we have \\"As I Am\\" which is a solid, heavy hitting opener that is highlighted by awesomely fierce singing from James, a great catchy chorus, crushingly heavy riffage and a wickedly mindblowing solo by John, as well as some hard, solid drumming from Mike. Next up, we have \\"This Dying Soul\\" which is my personal favorite song on here, and it's also a continuation of Mike's Alcoholics Anonymous suite (parts 4 \\"Reflections of Reality\\" and 5 \\"Release\\"). This is without a doubt, one of the heaviest songs that DT have ever written. The guitar riffs are just savagely heavy and brutal, the changes in tempo are amazing, the drumming is fantastic, and Petrucci's soloing is just amazingly crazy, stunning, and off the hook especially in the beginning as well as near the end of the song. There's also a stunning keyboard solo by Rudess at 9:38 as well. The third track \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" is another fantastic song that starts off soft with some nice acoustic strumming, and some hearfelt melodic singing from James, and the chorus is just fantastic with heavier, crunchier riffs backing it up, until the opening section is played again, which is followed by the chorus, and then before you know it, the song breaks into a heavier instrumental section with several solos, including a mindblowing trade-off section between Rudess and Petrucci. Following that is a bludgeoning, classic heavy metal style section that is reminiscent of Iron Maiden which will give you no other alternative but to bang your head in unison. James's vocals in this part are also very reminiscent of Bruce Dickinson as well.<br /><br />Track four \\"Honor Thy Father\\" is another heavy, visceral and bludgeoning song that is highighted by some angry and fierce rap like vocals from James (yeah I know it's a bit uncharacteristic of James to rap, but it actually has some good results), and there's also some more awesome drumming by Mike especially in the intro, and there's some nice double bass work as well. John's riffing is just dare I say blisteringly heavy and monstrous, and track five \\"Vacant\\" is a short, yet beautiful piano driven ballad with some cello parts added, that gives the album a short needed break from the heaviness.<br /><br />The aformentioned song then kicks into the epically addicting instrumental \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" which is 11 amazing minutes of pure, epic instrumental wizardry that starts off soft and mellow, then the song suddenly gives way to heavier, thundering riffs, but that's just the beginning. This song also features stunning keyboardwork by Rudess, fantastic drumming by Portnoy, awesomely catchy and affectious riffing, and of course some absolutely stunning solos by both Petrucci and Rudess, including a ferociously, mindsweeping guitar solo by Petrucci around 3:50, which is followed by an awesomely dazzling keyboard solo by Rudess at 4:29. There's also some nice groovy bass by Myung in the middle part of the song. We also have more fantastically mindblowing solo breaks during the latter part of the song, including an awesome classical style keyboard solo by Rudess around the 9 minute mark, and it's followed by an addicting and melodic guitar solo by Petrucci. This is definately the best and most epic instrumental that DT have ever done in my opinion, it's just amazing, period.<br /><br />Finally, we have the epic 14+ minute closer \\"In the Name of God\\" (which is the longest song on the album). After the song starts off gloomy and mellow, it suddenly explodes into a creepy middle eastern-esque style riff, and after the drums come into play, the song then goes into an addictingly awesome groovy, chunky main riff. James's vocals are just amazing and they soar with passion throughout this song especially in the chorus. There's also some more fantastic solos by Petrucci and Rudess with some nice, humming basslines by Myung during the solo breaks, before kicking back into the chunky main riff, and there's also some fantastic and heartfelt piano keys by Rudess in the end.<br /><br />Best songs: This Dying Soul, As I Am, Stream of Consciousness, Endless Sacrifice, and In the Name of God.<br /><br />Despite being harshly criticized and the most underrated album in DT's catalog, \\"Train of Thought\\" is an epic and monstrously mindblowing masterpiece from the progressive metal masters themselves. But, I must warn you, that if you're new to Dream Theater, you might not want to start with this album. If you're a fan of the older Dream Theater albums especially \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Awake\\", this might not be for you, but if you're a fan of Dream Theater through and through, then by all means, buy this album. Highly Recommended!!some angry and fierce rap like vocals from James (yeah I know it's a bit uncharacteristic of James to rap, but it actually has some good results), and there's also some more awesome drumming by Mike especially in the intro, and there's some nice double bass work as well.

B001PJ1QF8|5.0|I love JT and his early work particularly. So Sweet Baby James, Mud Slide Slim and a few others are stand outs for me. Not that his newer material is lacking, but for me there's a certain bond to his earlier work and where I was in those days. If I had to own just two JT albums this would certainly be one of them.
0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer is based on the true story of Chris McCandless's tragic death alone in the Alaskan wilderness. The author tells the story through information he has gathered from people who had spent time with McCandless while he was on his journey to Alaska. The story starts with a letter about how, after writing an article for Outside magazine on McCandless's death, Jon Krakauer finds himself intrigued by the young man and is driven to discover more about his life and friendships that becomes the basis of Into the Wild. The rest of the story is told through pieces of information Krakauer has gained from people all over the United States who spent time with McCandless while he was on his journey. Some of these people include Wayne Westerberg, a man who employed Chris and became good friends with him as well as Chris's parents, Walt and Billie, his sister Carine, high school classmates, and friends he met on his journey, Jan Burres and Ronald Franz.  In the summer of 1990, immediately after graduating from Emory University with honors and giving his $25,000 of savings to charity, Christopher Johnson McCandless left his family and began his journey across Northern America. Disguising himself as Alexander Supertramp, McCandless hitchhiked to places such as Atlanta, Georgia, Needles, California and Topock, Arizona. He even traveled to places like Lake Mead, the Cascade Mountain Range, the Columbia River basin and Mexico. After finally making it to Alaska in April 1992 and living off the land for two months, Chris finds himself unable to cross back over the Teklanika River to civilization. Four months later, Chris McCandless's body is found in a discarded city bus that he had been living in. Twenty-four year old Christopher Johnson McCandless died on August 18, 1992 from accidental poisoning and starvation.   We will never really know what motivated Chris McCandless to leave his home, family, and friends, but we do know that he loved the time he spent on the road. He was idealistic and loved nature. He was not materialistic, and he believed that he could live off of nothing but the land and his own intuition. The book reveals that he had some conflicts with his father and mother, but we do not know if that was the reason that he left everything behind. No one will ever know his true motivation but it appears even at the end he was happy. McCandless's last note said, \\"`I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD. GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL!'\\"  I enjoyed Into the Wild a lot and found myself turning page after page, being unable to put it down. Krakauer's writing style tends to be somewhat chaotic. At points in the story, I found that Jon Krakauer skipped from Chris McCandless's tale to stories of his own journeys as well as other men, such as Everett Ruess. To me, this was confusing. Towards the end of the book, however, I realized that the stories Krakauer had incorporated in Into the Wild did in fact tie into Chris McCandless's. Krakauer was drawing parallels to his and others' experiences. Most of these stories were told by Krakauer due to similarities between the two main characters. In Jon Krakauer's letter to the reader in the beginning of the story, I really liked how he ended it by saying, \\"I will leave it to the reader to form his or her own opinion of Chris McCandless\\". Instead of forcing his opinion on the readers, Krakauer allows us to come to our own conclusions. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the journey of an interesting young man as well as people who are just looking for a compelling book to sit down and read.
B00006AFF5|5.0|Bought this movie for my grandkids , they just love it! had not been able to find it at local stores( Walmart, Target. exc.) so I came home ordered it on Amazon. Always there when you need them without driving all around town looking for it in different stores!!<br />This movie is Awesome Jim Carey is GREAT! Good humor for the Entire Family , would highly recommend it to everyone! Among the best in holiday movies.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Fantastic! I learned so much about our early history as a country. I can see why the cast and producers have won so many awards.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|This is the best, most diverse Springsteen Album ever made.  It plays like a mature sequel to The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle, and the band has never played or sounded better.  Those people out there who claim to be fans and think Bruce should retire should retire themselves.  Ridiculous.  Bruce and the Band seem reborn with this brilliant, great album.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Terminator, The Sarah Connor Chronicles is one of the most beliveable, exciting and enjoyable Science Fiction TV series ever produced.  The actors are very good and the premise is so close to the Terminator movies it is quite scarry.  Only one episode was out of place and that is where the writers put a bed scene into the episode.  The story gets along quite well without this kind of garbage needed by other series to keep the audience watching.  We SF fans watch for SciFi, not sex, that can be seen on any channel, on any series.  There is nothing SF about sex!
B001KZVQJI|5.0|King Kong is one the best blu-ray,,, this is a must have    the sound is a 10+ and the pic is a 10+
B0017JKEL8|1.0|This is the dumbest show ever. I dont know what all the hype is about this show.I was very dissapointed. HBO did a very good job by passing this show up.
6304884419|5.0|I just saw Chazz Palminteri perform this story live in a one man show...brilliant!  He captured the entire movie, charctaers, theme, and lessons in a one man show..absolutely brilliant!
B001LF4IA6|2.0|I have been a Bruce fan since I can remember. The first time I saw him live was The River tour and have been to 40+ shows since then. I can't say how sad a disappointment this album is. The album is more over produced than the terrible production of \\"Magic\\". There is a not a cohesive moment on WOAD. I consider \\"Queen of The Supermarket\\" one of the most laughable lyrical efforts Bruce has ever done. It does offer few highlights, such as The Wrestler (added as an afterthought, without which this would be a one star review), Good Eye, and The Last Carnival. The E-Street Band seems like they are almost non-existent here. Should have named this \\"Human Touch 2\\".
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|In the era when double-live albums were all the craze, Jethro Tull showed that they could mean more than an inexpensive means to keep a top band in heavy rotation on FM radio and successfully tour without new material to promote.<br /><br />Recorded during the May-June 1979 dates of the \\"Heavy Horses\\" European tour, it demonstrates the power of storytelling from Ian Anderson; it is like sitting around a hearth and hearing tales from the town poet. And Anderson's hilarious introduction of organist David Palmer is worth the price of admission. Released in September 1978, it peaked at a respectable #21 on the Billboard album chart.<br /><br />During the U.S. tour to promote the album, Anderson got into a verbal tiff with several fans near the end of the October 27, 1978, show in the Richfield (Ohio) Coliseum. It led to an incendiary device being thrown onto the stage, which was quickly extinguished by members of the road crew.<br /><br />The band was beginning to crest artistically, while being a solid headliner for major arena tours. With substance and style, the music retains its vibrancy, while remaining a gem from this \\"Golden Era of Rock.\\"
B001LF4IA6|5.0|I like this.   Not that I matter.  The reviewer who recalls \\"Human Touch\\" gets it, I think.  This isn't a \\"concept\\" album, but rather a songwriter's album.  I have to take each song on its own terms, and before the Kinks invented concept albums, that is what we heard.  Songs for songs sake.  No shame in that, if the songs are all good, and these are.    The playing here is always inventive, the atmospherics are pretty incredible, and the songwriting is fierce.   I would politely disagree with the reviewers who don't like \\"Queen of the Supermarket,\\" because it's a very brave way to approach a pedestrian moment, realizing that beauty appears in the most unlikely of places.  Pay attention, folks, to those gorgeous souls who serve you every day, the ones you catagorize as \\"workers\\" or lessers.  To me that's the theme.  And it is as profound as it is simple.  The random stranger with whom you fall in love and then cannot express that love.    Here's one thought for musicologists.  Do you not think that this in some ways is an analog of McCartney's latest Fireman CD?  Two master songwriters going through their influences and their own pasts, finding those core songs and using them as inspiration for a new era.  My thinking.      There are worse ways to proceed into middle life, one might think.
1595141979|5.0|This book, the third in the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead, ended very sadly...<br /><br />Rose has been feeling more and more dark and depressed ever since her friend Mason died while he, Rose, Eddie, Christian and Mia were trying to escape their kidnappers.  Rose had managed to get them all out and was facing the two Strigoi herself but Mason came back for her and got killed in the fight.<br /><br />Rose managed to slay the Strigoi captors and now bears the molnija tattoos, but nothing can take away the pain of his death.  Worse, Rose fears she's going crazy when she begins to see Mason's ghost around campus.<br /><br />Rose had a theory or two about why that was happening.  And Adrian and Christian seem to have a few theories about her many violent outbursts lately.  They surmise that with her bond to Lissa and being shadow kissed that she is able to pull the darkness away from Lissa.<br /><br />More trouble comes when the Strigoi attack the school leaving several Moroi and dhampir dead and many more captured.  Rose helps the other guardians (including Dimitri) come up with a plan of offense to get the kidnapped back.<br /><br />I can't tell you how it ends; I don't want to spoil it.  But it is well worth reading even if it did make me terribly depressed.  I have a theory about what will (hopefully!) happen in the fourth book that will put things to rights and I can't wait until it comes out to see if I'm right.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|I always find one or two songs extremely beautiful on any McCartney record, but this is the best since \\"Flowers in the Dirt,\\" and that sure says a lot.  The song structures are intricate without being cloying or annoying, the melodies haunt, the playing is superlative, and the production and density of sound are just what the doctor ordered.  This is something else.  I also think it's a lot of fun that McCartney only took a generation plus to discover what the heck John and Yoko were doing all those years ago with sonic landscapes.  Guess we all follow our own path to Yoko.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Being Retired Army myself, I feel that the younger generation should all watch this film to give them some idea of what so many brave and willing individuals went through as soldiers so we can live in a country called The United States of America.
B000F4MLZ8|1.0|I tried hard to like this CD but I just don't. This CD is extremely boring and monotone, it sounds like one long song with pauses. I don't think if any song on this CD will be memorable. I bought this CD based on the reviews here. I really don't understand what many of the reviewers here are hearing. If you had only heard one of these tracks you might think it's not too bad, but eleven that sounds the same ? I love music and I have a variety of taste but this CD is weak and not a keeper. I would give it free to anyone that wanted it if I could. Sorry if my review is negative but this CD is horrible.<br /><br />P.S. - I rated it one star because there's no way to rate it lower.
B0009NJFPE|5.0|Naysayers are quick to point out their perceived shortcomings of this film (i.e. inconceivable/fake weaponry, over the top special effects, predictable storyline, et al). Bare in mind people that this endeavor is aimed at entertaining the public (not to portray reality). I urge you to watch this film and draw your own conclusions. Do not succumb to the distorted/delusive perceptions of others. I would definitely recommend this film for it entertains and succeeds in taking viewers away from our sometimes dull realities (if only for an hour or so). Nos vemos.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|The movie was shipped and received quickly and in excellent shape.  I was very pleased with this purchase and the vendor involved.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The only bad thing about these headphones is that they are a little too bright sometimes but with ear pad modifications or an EQ they sound amazing.  If properly amped the bass will vibrate your head.  You won't find a more accurate headphone for under $500.  Compared to the $250 Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro's these sound MUCH better.
1592402690|3.0|The review by Terry McManus (below) is so spot on that I want to make sure it is highlighted. I have posted a commentary in his review that I want to share here (in lieu of writing a whole new review):    Wow -- a very succint, yet very excellent summary of this book. I have owned the book for awhile now and have read it multiple times. I am a Beatles fan and I certainly find the book to be \\"fascinating\\" as McManus writes. However, I have the exact same impression that McManus does that much of Geoff's \\"memories\\" are unaccountably petty and, in some cases, seem fabricated for either personal reasons or to conform to Beatle folklore (think the post-India conversation). Geoff also rarely passes up an opportunity to deflate the Lennon legacy (it's clever -- but he always manages to drop in little asides like (paraphrasing) \\"Tommorow Never Knows wasn't planned genius, but it kind of fell into place\\" -- or \\"John's lead vocal track on A Day in the Life was actually a compilation of several takes\\" -- both of these items being highpoints of the Lennon legacy). At the same time, he never passes up an opportunity to inflate the McCartney legacy - ever! Honestly, I am not anti-McCartney nor anti-Emerick, but this is a VERY biased book. Can you imagine that Geoff essentially states at one point that \\"I am the Walrus\\" would have been one of the weaker tracks on Sgt. Pepper's (had it been included). Really? Weaker than \\"64\\", \\"Rita\\", \\"Fixing a Hole\\", \\"Getting Better\\"?? Oh, wait, those are McCartney songs! And \\"Walrus\\" is a JOHN song. I see...
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Maybe I'm just a fanboy, but I don't think the Boss has recorded a bad album, and that includes the \\"duds\\" that were Human Touch and Lucky Town.  Once you get past the No-E-Street and the thin production, there are some decent songs on both those releases.    As far as this new effort, I'm glad to see that he's having fun again.  If you get over the past and quit expecting Springsteen to rehash the legendary Born to Run or Darkness on the Edge of Town, you'll see that this new era of his music has plenty to offer.  Indeed, The Rising, Magic, and this new album contain songs that rival at least half of Born in the USA and The River-- the rest of the songs are at the very least listenable/good.    Working On A Dream is Magic with brighter production and a softer overall subject matter.  It's also very good-- just let the man strum his acoustic guitar and quit expecting another \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"Badlands\\".
B001HXG8PK|4.0|4 stars for the music itself, almost everything from the movie is here, but not many of the tracks are in the right order of the movie, so it loses a star, and instead gains a fail at life
B001PPLIFU|4.0|To the many people who didn't like this movie... I don't know what to say. I think a major appeal of this movie for me is that it isn't the \\"normal\\" James bond. after watching Casino Royale and then going to see Quantum, I rented all the previous bonds. what a terrible mess! not a single one of them approached the level of movie goodness that Casino Royale or Quantum had. one of my favorite movies, and my second favorite bond.
B00011D1OA|5.0|I love this movie and have wanted my own copy for soo long! This was a great price and I received it fast! I definitely recommend this seller!
B000NJVWTQ|5.0|What a finale! Every song is rich musically and lyrically...and the remastering of the album is so satisfying... thank you Alan, Eric and Co!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I don't know why Sony couldn't have rumble in the first place, but I'm glad to know that It's here now. Both of my Sixaxis controllers have had flaws, but the DS3 is unstoppable.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Glad to see all the 5 star reviews... but why is Bono so quick to discard this album as just a rushed-project that didn't live up to what U2 wanted it to be -- I have no idea... well I can understand that you can always improve your work, but I think if they would've spent too much time on this one in particular then it may have sadly turned into a conventional pop album! So quitting early perhaps preserved this for what it is, a stand-out artistic masterpiece. Every time I listen to it I try to agree with Bono but I just can't. Sorry, but you guys are absolutely brilliant here!
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|[[ASIN:B001A4LVYY Sony BDP-S350 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player]]    This was my first experience with Blu-ray and Mama Mia my first Blu-ray Disc and I couldn't be more pleased with these two items. The improvement to my dvd discs was unbelieveable. Setup of the player was straight forward and intuitive. I hardily recommend both.
B000J234RA|5.0|Highly underrated album. A daring electronic venture by U2, high marks on creativity, a sonic soundscape vastly different than anything they'd done before, exploring new sounds and mastering alternative ways of musical expression --- but having said that, if you're not open to hearing music that's not played on the radio 1000 times a day, polished & overly-commercialized, then you likely will not appreciate the brilliance of this album and should pass on it...but boy would you be missing out on what music and art are truly all about!
055358894X|5.0|This is a very good book. I would suggest you purchase Red Skies at the same time because you are going to want more as soon as you finish book one. This is a very interesting world Lynch creates.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Up there with the best of the best. Sadly most people these days don't even know who Alan Parsons is, an album like this deserves the same type of attention as Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon... truly, this album is a gem.
B000DN5W4I|4.0|I bought this DVD after reading the reviews on AMAZON. Great concert , the band is so good. My problem is with whoever engineered this DVD. There is too much zooming in & out ,weird camera angles .Repeated pans to the back of the venue where all you can see is the bald spots on many of the crowds heads. Then when he zooms in on to the band , it is on Joes face for long solo shots . Mate the guitar is played with his hands & if I was at the concert thats where I would be looking . It should be simple It's a live concert , pretend your eyes are the camera ,If you come up with whats on this dvd you have to be on drugs . I want to see & hear the band not a lot of wanking with camera tricks .

1582701709|5.0|Someone gave me a copy of The Secret and I read it immediately.  While I have read a slew of books devoted to metaphysics over the years, The Secret somehow captured for me the essence of how to create what I want in my life.  Perhaps I just needed to read yet another book on the subject but things started clicking.  I remind myself daily that we are magnets and attract to ourselves that which we are thinking about.  The other reminder that I needed - in a world of negativity - is that we should focus on what we want and not on what we don't want.  The Universe does not understand, \\"I do not want to be cold.\\"  The Universe hears \\"cold.\\"  Instead if I think, \\"I want to be warm,\\" then I can attract warmth.    In the spirit in which it was given to me, I bought 3 extra copies and gave them to friends - people that I heard making frightening statements about how they are doomed to Alzheimers because their parents had it; statements about moving into retirement with no money because they cannot envision how money or wealth could come to them. We are all on our individual journeys but I certainly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in taking the trip in the most positive way possible. But I have to add that I struggle with these concepts as much as others - but I'm determined to learn the proper way to frame my thoughts.  \\"I am a successful artist that sells her work in galleries, art shows and to individuals.\\"
B000IZJZLM|5.0|What wonderful voices and what fun to listen to.  I don't even care when it is English or not, the sound is just great.  My favorite group and I have purchased nearly everything.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Don't expect any spectacular special FX (low budget stuff, people) or serious acting. Do expect addictive music (even my Dutch five-year old son cavorts around the house every day, singing \\"A man's gotta do, what a man's gotta do...\\"), lots of high-quality cheese, and laughs. But don't forget  the touching moments, as well. Even with the little time they have, the actors and writers manage to firmly glue the characters to your heart.        If you're a Joss Whedon fan, then this DVD is a must. Even the extras are hilarious.     (Nathan Fillion, we will always love you, but do excuse the naughty gleam in our eyes when we think of Neil)
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Anyone who loved Pink Floyd already knew what to expect when you  saw them in concert... and you were never disappointed.  BUT, if you  weren't lucky enough (or old enough) to have seen them live, then  this DVD is perfect!  It cannot give you the awestruck feeling you  had sitting in the arena, watching this live, but it is still a  spectacular performance to witness and hear.  No DVD could ever do  the laser show justice or any of the special effects Floyd is known  for... but since they will probably never tour again (certainly not  now that Richard Wright has passed on...) this DVD is the closest thing  you will ever get to watching Pink Floyd do all their best works and  (I think) the first time the entire Dark Side of the Moon album was  played live...    It still gives me goosebumps every time I watch it!
B0007OY2MG|4.0|It works.... Thats all I really wanted. It was in good condition and didn't skip when my girlfriend watched it. That's all that really matters when you buy a DVD right? Overall, good buy.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|This is a very nice CD. Well done and easy to listen to. Not his best, some of the lyrics are rather cheesy, but I still like it a lot!
B0007TKNII|4.0|this is a classic..and one of my favorite movies ever! (until twilght comes out) its great because there is a little bit of color and and most of them its just black and white so that was nice!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|My husband is a huge Led Zep fan - he seems very happy with this item.
B001ED7C58|5.0|im in love with twilight! i absolutly adore this! i listen to it all the time! its great! i cant wait for the movie to be released!
B00129H7VS|3.0|The BOB series is incredible. Excellent from start to finish. However, the blu-ray transfer is not as great as one would expect. The DVD version I have, when upconverted, looks exactly the same as the blu-ray to me. Not worth buying another copy if you already own the DVD version IMO.  This should have been a 5 star review but I am subtracting 2 stars for the fact that the DVD looks the same as the blu-ray.
B000063V8T|4.0|i grew up with Star Trek:  the Next Generation.  At some point in my life, i have probably seen every episode, whether on it's original broadcast date, or some late-night syndication.  That being said, a couple of years ago, i was the recipient of season seven as a white elephant gift.  Since then, i decided to revisit the series, only backwards.  So far, i've found that season five is the weakest of the three i own.  It seems very much like a soap opera, featuring some overly dramatic material that i don't think the cast (aside from Patrick Stewart, of course) were prepared to handle.  This all aside, though, i eagerly await Season Four.
B0000E5PEE|5.0|I recently came across this album! I am glad I did! it is incredible. I am a singer and studied voice for year...and fortunately work with some great artist over the years! I have always admired singers who I consider heart and fearless singers. Dulce sings from her heart and is undoubtly fearless. I love IT! As for the other review not liking the album. Insight and feelings for music can range all over the map...I applaud them for taking the time to review. However, when you start to compare singers (ex: Celine Dion and Dulce Pontes) you immediately loose my respect for the review! Morricone's music soars and to have Pontes interpetation is simply awesome!
B00195BM3Y|5.0|Popular media would have you believe that the 80's were all about third-rate synth pop, overproduced flat-top soul, big hair and Madonna. But while the fledgling MTV was busy handing music back to the rich and pretty a subversive indie scene was quietly blossoming all over the UK, Europe and North America. Back in '83 and '84 The Chameleons were uniquely poised to win the hearts and minds of listeners who wanted the sound of guitars and REAL drums (as opposed to overly syncopated click tracks or trash can lids drenched in reverb) but weren't yet ready for hardcore and needed something more satisfying than pre-punk 70's poodle rock and hair metal. So why weren't they HUGE??? Because they weren't rich, pretty and videogenic? This is a GREAT album, as are 'What Does Anything Mean...' and 'Return of the Roughnecks...' ('Is it Any Wonder' is a personal all-time favorite). Don't let the media make up your mind for you: there was A LOT of great music released in the post-punk years ca '78-'84, and this is but one example. It's great to have some more live tracks I suppose, but this edition has little else to recommend it over the original Statik or (better sounding) Dead-Dead Good versions from some years back, if you can find them...
B001B7CNXI|3.0|This is an excellent movie and I recently purchased the Blu-Ray version of this software because I liked the movie so much.  Previously I had purchased and watched the DVD version and I was expecting truly great video in the Blu-Ray version.  Sadly, many of the night scenes in the Blu-Ray version are just too grainy.  Buy the regular DVD version and save the extra bucks.
B000000HXK|5.0|It's great to see this back in print. I'd been recommending it for years while regretting that it was nearly impossible to find. If you enjoyed 'Spirit of Eden' era Talk Talk, O'rang, Red House Painters, Low or the wispier end of the early 90s shoegaze thing like Slowdive, then this will grab you from start to finish. If your tastes run more to classic rock, then you might find that 'Hex' is not a million miles removed from where Pink Floyd might have headed had they not run out of ideas after 'The Final Cut'. The songs unfold slowly and veer slightly into progressive jazz territory. Music for sleepless nights. Amazon has done you the favour of letting you sample the tracks, so give it a listen...
B001KL3GZO|5.0|\\"Kind of Blue\\" is an album that all collectors with even a passing interesting in jazz should own. No need to review the core album as most listeners would be familiar with it by now and there are tons of testimonials for the original.<br /><br />So why the special \\"Legacy Edition?\\"<br /><br />This is not for everyone to be sure, but for listeners who really love this album, Miles Davis, and jazz of the 1950's and early 60's, \\"Legacy Edition\\" will give more insight into the material and help the listener appreciate more of what went into making \\"Kind of Blue\\" the great jazz standard that it is.<br /><br />While it might overkill for some, true jazz lovers and \\"Kind of Blue\\" fans will not only get some nice second helpings from the album, they'll also get an idea of how Davis and his all-star cast created this gem.<br /><br />One other note, those having old CD copies of \\"Kind of Blue,\\" the ones with the animated profile of Miles on the booklet cover, not the recreation of the original LP cover, should definitely ditch their old CD and get the new remastered release. It is a huge improvement. Instead of sounding washed out and slightly off pitch, the remaster sounds fresh, with very high resolution, warm, and intimate, just the way Miles Davis and his stellar side kicks recorded it.
B000RL0WM8|5.0|Acoustic soul is the first of list of amazing cd's it's also the best. She is the voice of many independent young women. Trying to heard and demanding to be respected. This CD helped shape my life. I named my daughter after her. A great addition into any music lovers library
B001M5UDGS|4.0|I had downloaded and watched (multiple times) Dr. Horrible when it was on iTunes. So I was not expecting to be surprised by the DVD content when I bought it on Amazon. Imagine my delight when I discovered such deliciously fun extras as \\"Commentary, the Musical\\" (yes, they have a musical made entirely of faux-commentary....in addition to an actual commentary track), and the Evil League of Evil audition tapes. If you like the bizarre and witty comedy of Joss Whedon, this is a must for your collection.
B001I8C498|5.0|[[VIDEOID:31092921]]
B001ED7C58|5.0|A very cool soundtrack. The music is diverse and swings your mood from from excited, to thoughtful, to sexy, back to excited, etc. in one fell swoop. I didn't find any of the tracks bad at all. I was particularly interested in hearing Robert Pattinson (aka Edward) sing and play guitar on the CD and as I suspected, he did not disappoint. The highlight of the CD for me (and many others) however, has to be the opening track Supermassive Black Hole.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have not seen a Bond film in many years.  I assumed Sean Connery was the only actor that could play 007 , but I was wrong.  I found Daniel Craig to be the epitomy of the true character of Mr. Bond.  His acting, his persona, his sex appeal was all that was needed for this most   exciting film. The action was superb and the scenery spectacular. This film is very worthwhile watching if you are a Bond Fan.  I think this is the best oo7 film I have ever seen, not only because the story is terribly exciting,sophisticated, but Graig steals the show.  Recommend it to all.   Ann from Boston& Florida
0385340990|5.0|This was chosen by a member of our book club & I was intriqued by the title.  I found the style of writing to be delightful.  It was easy to read & I have done much research on the content; learning about the actual occupation, the islands & the population.<br />To learn the author was there in 1971 & never returned was also interesting, because there is so much detail.<br />Good Book!
0375714669|5.0|All due respect to the ALA Alex and YALSA committees, there should also have been a great deal of serious consideration for some of the higher profile major literary awards for this book, one of a pair of volumes that make up Persepolis, The Story of A Childhood and The Story of A Return. As a long-time devotee of the Graphic Novel, I have no hesitation saying these two volumes are the most effective, and affecting examples of the genre I have yet encountered. The narrative is in itself a masterwork, and none the less for being simply the true autobiography I assume it is. The relative amounts of concern given the numerous occurrences is precisely right. The author/artist moves briskly through countless episodes yet leaves in each case a most thorough, profound and lasting impression. The characterizations, especially of Marjane herself and her immediate family are palpable to an extent rarely achieved in what we normally deem \\"serious literature\\". Each  depiction elicits our deepest concern as hideousness follows hope follows respite follows tragedy follows turmoil, chaos, and humor.   It is impossible to separate the art from the text. Each is so precisely crafted in each other's service. It is not since Walt Kelly that I have seen such imminently \\"readable\\" faces, postures, and gestures. While on the other hand, one will have no doubt as to the sound of the voices speaking the content of the dialogue balloons.   Sadly, the most lasting and, perhaps as intended, the most profound impression one will take from these volumes is an unshakable sadness we must feel on behalf of what might have been a remarkable nation, were it not for man's fascination with fanaticism and the mindless tinkering of the \\"Super Powers\\". Persepolis is literally a great mourning bell tolling the tragedy of Iran, albeit ringing out through the thoughts and experiences of a child and then a young, sensitive and phenomenally articulate woman.
B001KL3GY0|1.0|With their new album, Franz Ferdinand has gone from indy-rock to pop. This new album is extremely synth-heavy, leading to a very boring, dancy sound that lacks the depth and general rock elements from their previous offerings. If you want to hear a vapid, mechanical departure from Franz's first albums, by all means buy this album, but if you liked their previous works, this is one to avoid.
B00001OH7V|5.0|The second of Bowie's Berlin trilogy, and the only of those three albums recorded entirely in Berlin, is brought down only by two almost-very-good instrumental pieces, one of which (\\"Neukoln\\") is saved by saxophone.  Side One is almost invincible in its urgency; that same urgency makes this record more attractive to me than the languid \\"[[ASIN:B00001OH7O Hunky Dory]].\\"  And though Side Two is brought down a little by the slightly-portentous but enchantingly foreboding \\"Sense of Doubt,\\" the fantastic dreaminess of \\"Moss Garden\\" (it's all in the koto) and the fabulous \\"Life on Mars\\" sequel \\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" pick it back up.  On top of that, the title track is as good as anything he's ever recorded.
1423113497|5.0|I bought this set for my 8 yr old daughter. But even my husband & I loved it so much that we were fighting over the books! In the end, we also rented some copies from the public library, so we could all read it at the same time. Now I'm done with the first 3 in the series & moving on to #4. These books sure are addictive. They are about mythological figures, but set in today's world, so would appeal to today's kids even more. The writing is humorous and characters are very interesting. Rick Riordan is a wonderful writer and I would be looking into his other books as well. My 8yr old daughter reads high school level books, but she gets easily scared by monsters and other scary things. So it actually gave her nightmares a couple of times and she has stopped reading after the first book and says she will read the rest \\"later\\". But she did love the story over all. Just wanted to mention it, to those parents whose kids are like mine. It depends on the child, I guess. These books will probably be made into cool movies some day.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is my first workout DVD. The other reviews were right when they said that it wasn't easy.  I knew I was out of shape but I thought that I could last longer than 10 mins the first time.  Boy, I was wrong.  I did last 20 mins. the second time.  I am not going to give up.  I am getting married in May & I am going to keep at it.  Wish me luck (I think I may need it).
B001LRJH0U|1.0|This is possibly the worst movie ever made. For a group of such fine actors, this movie was undeveloped, unreal and painfully boring. Ed Harris is NOT director/producer material. Viggo Mortensen did a fair job with the awful script provided, but Rene Zellweger was terrible. She looked like someone had punched her until her face was swollen and bloated like a dead fish. The scripting was laughable throughout. \\"I've known you a long time, long as you've known me\\" Total crap. Save your money and time.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Lady Gaga's music is the perfect mix of Pink, Gwen Stefani, Madonna, Natasha Beddingfield and Fergie.  I love it!      My only complaint is that at least one song I wouldn't let my kids listen to.  I guess the innuendo is too much...she wants to take a ride on your disco stick in LoveGame.
0618918248|4.0|Dawkins is one of four key authors on this topic.  I highly recommend reading this in conjunction with Sam Harris' \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" and \\"End of Faith\\", Chris Hitchens' \\"God is Not Great\\" and Daniel Dennett's \\"Breaking the Spell\\". In my opinion, all have excellent points, but Sam's argument for speaking up about where organized religion is likely to bring our species is the pinnacle of the greater argument.  Dawkins and Hitchens, in true english form, are smart for the sake of being smart.  Dennett is the wise old man that pulls back the proverbial curtain to reveal man, not god, represents the wizard.  Harris however motivates.  If we give credence to ANY organized religion, we substantiate ALL of them.  And there are religions and people out there that want to do harm to others, because of what their books tell them to do.  Sam's point is that we all need to wake up and walk away from these stories before we find our species and the globe in serious peril.
0316017922|2.0|I first heard about this book    while  driving and listening an interview the author gave to NPR.  When he used the rice culture argument to explain the   performance in mathematics of Chinese students I felt I wanted to   stop and yell out loud: that is one  really stupid idea.    I am a mathematician by training, and I have been involved for more than two decades  with  mathematically gifted students  in US and  in  Eastern Europe.       Eastern Europe has produced and produces talented people  in  larger proportion  than the Chinese  education system, though  there is no rice  involved in the process.    Rice culture as described by the author cannot be an explanation for the particular success of the Hungarian or Russian mathematical schools, which far outshine the   results of the Chinese school.      It is not something genetic,  it is part of the collective culture  that decided that attracting    young minds to science is something worth doing, and their successes are something worth celebrating.      There is an amazing pool of talent here in US  waiting to be discovered, and a system  that seems to be impotent to do this.  There  is also something about the popular media  that celebrates   brutish memorization (think Spelling Bee), but  when one of the local  kids is awarded  a  prize by the  Academy of Sciences,  they  neglect it completely, and label the kid a Geek (I swear to God, this  happened twice in my fair city.)    The Rice Culture argument     may suggest that the situation here in US is hopeless and I believe this is not the case.  I  cannot  give a definite explanation  of successful   mathematical talent, but I can  list some  of the common  features of  people like these that I have met in  my career: talent,   an environment  where they can discover,   hone  their gifts and be celebrated for their achievements,   a restless mind,   and lots and lots of work.     Rice is good for many reasons, but  boosting   talent in mathematics is  not one of them.    I am very disappointed by   his shallow analysis of   the causes of success in mathematics.
0446691437|5.0|This is really a book about procrastination. I have read a book or two on procrastination and they did not help that much. What is different about this book is the angle he takes. Sometimes you can hear the same thing over & over and then someone comes along and puts it in way that changes everything and it makes perfect sense.<br />  Pressfield calls it \\"the resistance\\"(the things that stop you from completing your true life goals). This book is full of useful nuggets, phrases that you could write down and put on your computer or on the refrigerator. You could spend a fortune  on a sports psychologist and not get out of it what you get from this book for 10 bucks. He makes you ANGRY at the resistance. This anger gives you energy.<br />He names the enemy,describes it, gives it a face and makes you want to kill it. A little more aggressive approach. This book should not go on a shelf but be kept out and looked at again and again until it ingrained in us. It it a must for a writer, songwriter or any creative occupation.  Entrepreneurs to someone who can't face cleaning out their garage would benefit, anyone wanting to improve in any area of life. I could not put this book down. The first 2/3rds are really the useful parts. People are complaining about the last third but if your tore that off it would still be worth it. It is hard in a review to explain this book, but if you want to quit making excuses and need a kick in the butt then get just it.
0312567448|5.0|If only real men were like this. But Great ones were and are. What a wonderful idea for a book, beautifully executed with introductions which are illuminating and engrossing. Too often we're guilty (well, me anyway) of assuming that men just can't, don't, won't express themselves in loving, romantic and intimate ways. How wrong we/I are/am. And a Great title.
0805211063|5.0|Just what is the castle? Is it simply (as commonly believed) a symbol of the pervasive bureaucracy everyone gets inured to in civilized society? Is there a religious connotation as Kafka's editor and friend Max Brod believed? Does it represent God, salvation, or a spiritual truth the agnostic subconsciously strives for in an outwardly unfathomable existence? Can it represent the futile, or hopeless acceptance that the \\"outsider\\" seeks in a generally indifferent and frequently hostile world? Is it any, or all of the above, or something entirely different?<br /><br />In much of his work, Kafka poses questions that have no pat answers. He is simultaneously the most alien, and the most human of all authors. The protagonists of his novels and short stories each have part of their darkly brilliant but troubled creator within them, but the psyche of each living being inhabits them as well. All of us at times, peer out of the eyes of Gregor Samsa, Joseph K., or the frustrated land surveyor of THE CASTLE, known simply as K. I think the key to understanding THE CASTLE is to understand the primacy of the individual, and of his or her personal, subjective thoughts, actions, and responsibilities, as opposed to those dictated by the collective and represented by incomprehensible rules, absurd procedures, and organizational hypocrisy.<br /><br />Kafka's parable BEFORE THE LAW tells of a man who comes to a partially open gate through which he must pass to gain admittance to the Law, and meets a gatekeeper who won't let him pass. He is told to wait and maybe he will eventually be let through. He waits for years on end, at times trying to bribe the keeper, all to no avail. Finally as he is about to die, he asks why all this time no one else sought admittance, and is told that the gate was meant only for him and the gatekeeper then shuts it.<br /><br />The above parable was included and expounded upon in Kafka's most famous novel THE TRIAL, but it has resonance for his unfinished novel THE CASTLE as well. We can substitute the Law for the Castle and come away with similar thoughts. Kafka searches in vain for an explanation..a reason..a meaning..to an outwardly incomprehensible existence, and comes away frustrated at every turn. K. keeps trying to reach the Castle, keeps looking for answers, while people around him just accept the absurdities only he seems to see. This failure in the continual search for reason in an unreasonable world can only lead to a kind of self realization..the recognition that all meaning is subjective. K. is doomed to fail, but we the readers, who look through his eyes, are the beneficiaries of the process. We must come to the conclusion that it is only what we think and do as individuals that has any meaning, or gives purpose to life. To Albert Camus, THE CASTLE is fundamentally an existentialist novel. Kafka gave up on finishing THE CASTLE, and even had he survived the disease that ultimately lead to his death, it would have remained unfinished. Just as well that the writer who refused to supply easy answers, or come to simplistic conclusions, in this case did likewise with the ending.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|The cast seamed fabulous. The trailer was funny. I had great expectations then the movie started. Bad taste, not funny jokes. I zapped it because I got bored of this non-sense.  The two strong points are: Ben Stiller's fabulous biceps and Robert Downey Jr's acting. The rest is just not good.   I honestly don't see what people who gave it good ratings found in that movie but maybe I just don't get the Hollywood's inside satirical critic?  I wish I could give it a zero star!
B001LF4IA6|3.0|That's what Rolling Stone magazine says. I'm not a Bruce fan and probably won't listen to this record but I was struck with the mixed reviews of fans while Rolling Stone - who rarely gives 5-star ratings - said the album is one of the all-time greats.
B000GUJHD0|5.0|A few yeares ago, I reviewed a book by Gareth Morgan, \\"Images of Organizations\\". For me and the last 5 years of 2oth century, it was one of the best, but seing his images as perspectives that managers needed to have to analyze all their problems.  This book by Dan Pink, continues the work of Morgan but with a twist. In the 21st century, in the Conceptual Age, managers must analyze their world from the perspectives of six senses: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play and Meaning. Then they will have success in their professions and personal fulfillments. Pink also gives a portfolio of exercises to master the new senses.  It is a must for every manager who wants to succeed in the Conceptual Age. It is a must for every professor of management who teaches management to practicing managers.
0156027321|5.0|This book is very entertaining.  It is the adventure of an Indian young man, called Piscine Molitor Patel (Pi), who happens to lose his entire family when the boat they are in, towards Canada, sinks.  He survives 270 days at sea with some of the animals of his father's zoo which were on the boat.  Those animals are wild.  Only one survives, with Pi, a tiger, called Richard Parker.  By the way, Piscine Molitor is a public swimming pool in Paris.  The book is full of hidden symbols that you may or may not pick, or pick later, or which can transform with time.  It is inspiring and looks like a real story although it is a fiction.  I recommend this book.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Woody Allen doesn't make great movies anymore, but he does make good ones once in a while, and \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is a fun little romantic comedy that brings a sexy sense of adventure to the sun-drenched Spanish coast. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are twenty-something women, best friends since college, who spend the summer in Barcelona while Vicky works on her master's thesis on Catalan identity. Cristina's flirtatious nature encourages a local painter named Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) to invite the ladies on a spur-of-the-moment romantic tryst in Oviedo. Vicky, the sensible woman with a staid fianc&eacute; back in the States, is taken aback by Juan Antonio's effrontery. Cristina, a woman who thrives on passion and new experiences, is intrigued, setting in motion what will be an uncommon and unforgettable summer in Barcelona.<br /><br />Penelope Cruz gives a nice performance as Juan Antonio's volatile, talented ex-wife Maria Elena. Cruz is always much better in her native Spanish than in English, and here she speaks both. It's nice to see her playing this jealous, slightly scary woman instead of her usual protagonist. Vicky is torn between her plans for a sensible marriage and her capacity for spontaneity and romance. Cristina is unconventional, throws herself into her passions, but her restlessness won't allow her to be happy with anything for long. Neurotic on both counts, but played more for light irony than drama. Javier Bardem doesn't have much to do except be charming and generous with his affections, but he does both with flair. \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is just good bohemian fun at a jaunty pace with an attractive cast in an exotic locale. Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish.
0765350386|5.0|I highly recommend The Final Empire.  This book is well written, descriptive, and extremelly enjoyable.  Brandon Sanderson (the author) takes you into a unique world of his making and tells the tale of a very unique young women.  An excellent read.
B00005221M|1.0|Strangely I was watching this last night on tv,  and I wasn't aware that it was a director's cut, it's been a while since I have seen the movie and I have some fuzzy memories.  I thought that I was going crazy, some of the lines I remember weren't in the movie, the beautiful song was missing and the incredibly moving score didn't seem right.  As the movie came to a conclusion I was wondering what happened to the stirring movie I remembered, apparently Michael Mann happened to it.    Most of the time I love the new director's cuts of movies I have seen, usually they add to the movie explaining things that might have been left out.  I cannot recall a movie that l liked so much in theaters and watched to death on VHS that I like less as a DVD.  Truly a failure on the part of Fox and Mann, I will take the advice of another poster and get a copy from England.
B000SW4DV2|3.0|We use our xbox as our dvd player.  I guess because they added an extra feature to the dvd (an xbox game), it won't play the actual dvd on the xbox.  Haven't ever had this problem with a dvd.  Should be a warning or disclosure.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This movie is one Of The Best Love Stories I've ever seen. Great acting and humor in a situation that is heart warming. A good lesson too for anyone who has ever lost a loved one. I recommend it for everyone.
0143034901|5.0|I got this book for my summer reading for school. At first I thought it was going to take a long time to read (it's almost 500 pgs. I think) and it was going to be boring, but that was not the case. I started to read it and could not put it down! I finished it in 3 days!!! I don't know what drew me into this remarkable story; it was one of those books that you know is good but can't really describe why b/c it's that good. It left me speechless. I'm really glad that I read it and I think I'm going to read it again.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Many years after her stunningly mature, soul searing debut;  Renee Olstead finally returns to the music scene with a charming 13 collection set \\"Skylark\\".  Wrapping her velvet pipes around David Foster's swinging production, Ms. Olstead again proves that this genre of music is easily enjoyed by listeners of all ages.  Opening with the romp \\"Midnight Man\\", the CD continues to present all clearly direct collection of jazz/pop standards; \\"My Baby Just Cares For Me\\", \\"Hit The Road Jack\\", and \\"When I Fall In Love\\".  But don't let that fool you, two stand out tracks \\"Hold Me Now\\" and \\"Nothing But The Blame\\" were co-written by Renee and David Foster.  The results produce a fruitful collaberation and makes the listener yearn for more originals from this young chanteuse.      A wonderfully solid collection of songs that will hopefully find its way to mainstream listeners worldwide.  A definate must have.
B001LF4IA6|2.0|I am a die-hard Bruce fan and I generally fall in love with anything he writes...but this is quite possibly the worst of all his albums. There are some pretty good tunes on here - \\"The Wrestler,\\" \\"Working on a Dream,\\" \\"Outlaw Pete\\" - but there are many awkwardly bad ones. I want to like \\"My Lucky Day\\" and \\"Queen of the Supermarket,\\" but the lyrics are irrevocably hokey, something you don't expect from Bruce. \\"What Love Can Do\\" and \\"This Life\\" are just flat and boring. \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" is one of the worst songs he has ever written. He says he worked on this album quickly, and it shows. I'm certainly disappointed.    UPDATE: Here I am months later in May and I still think this is the worst album Bruce has ever put out. I can appreciate everything he's done from Before the Fame right up through Magic (the list of my ten favorite Bruce albums includes an even mix of 70s, 80s, and his modern stuff)...but I can't make it through this album. I'm going to see Bruce in New Jersey this week (my 5th concert) and I'm SO grateful that he only seems to be playing 2-3 songs a night from \\"Working on a Nightmare!\\"
0684853523|3.0|I've never found much enjoyment in reading about good sentence structure, the difference between verbs and adverbs, and the other nuts-and-bolts of writing....I generally find these kinds of dissertations quite boring, no matter who is doing the teaching. So I wasn't expecting a fun read when I picked up Stephen King's ON WRITING: A MEMOIR OF THE CRAFT. In his defense, King does provide some enjoyment as he dishes out the lessons....but the real reason to buy the book is the sections that bookend the writing lessons. The book starts with brief anecdotes from King's childhood and early writing career, and ends with the 1999 accident that nearly killed him, detailing both the incident and the painful recovery that followed. I would have loved to read more of the memoir material, but it is a book about the craft of writing, after all. And on that front, King does an admirable job...His enthusiasm for writing and his belief in the redemptive qualities inherent in the act of putting words on paper is a thing of beauty.
031606792X|5.0|As the mother of a teenage daughter, I purchased the whole saga of \\"Twilight\\" on the promise that she would read them.  Well, all I can say is that she read the whole series (plus saw the movie) and she was sad to get to the last book as she did not want the story to end.  You will not be disappointed in buying the book or the series.  My daughter LOVED it - as a matter of fact, I'm reading them as well and so far am not disappointed.  HAPPY READING! This series ROCKS!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|...but I bought this one after listening through it once.  I don't know why, I just really liked it.  It reminds me of Battle of Evermore.  I haven't ever written a review for anything on this site either (that I can remember) but wanted to throw my rating in with the others.
0316017922|4.0|I've become a fan of Gladwell's from his other books and this one takes the cake. It is a very creative look at what makes success in some very different fields. When you take the time to read through this, and it does take some patience, you'll get your bubble broke on what we generally thinks makes one successful.<br /><br />Gladwell draws on a study of Canadian hockey players and traces their success from the little leagues to the NHL; then he takes you through NYC lawyers and you learn a little different take; then airline crashes and what causes them and I wouldnt have believed that one but it makes sense.<br /><br />A great read if you're interested in what drives success in many endeavors and you're open to change your mind. Really enjoyed this book.

0143038419|5.0|I'm in the \\"Pray\\" part, and i'm savouring it, reading it very slowly so that it doesn't end. I like it, like it A Lot...
0316017922|2.0|Ok, so the secret to success is...relative birth month.  No!  It's...how hard you work.  No!  It's...how you're raised.  No!  It's...that you've put in the requisite 10,000 hours learning to get good at something.  No!  It's...    It's depressing, is what it is.     For starters, Gladwell buys into a pop-culture definition of success, and considers the genius living with his beloved wife on a horse ranch in Missouri to be a failure because he hasn't sold a book to a major publisher.  Whereas depressed, miserable people who are wealthy or well known or at Harvard are successes?      How about if the genius in Missouri is smart enough to know that he's in great company with his wife and his horses, and if he needs some cash he just goes on a quiz show and makes a quarter million dollars to keep him going for a while.  What's not successful about that?    Gladwell's thinking is all over the map, disguised by the fluidity and glibness of his prose.  His research is anecdotal and shallow.  I wish *he* had put in the 10,000 requisite hours of accumulated wisdom before coming out with another bestseller under the Gladwell brand.    But, what am I talking about?  He's a success...an outlier!
B0017MO10U|4.0|Unlike Ark Of Truth this movie was very good, I loved the story line, the acting was great and seeing Jack again was the icing on the cake.  If you know a bit about Stargate but never really watched most of the episodes you can still really enjoy this movie as it is a self contained story.  Unfortunetly it still has Ben and Claudia in it but this time they somehow manage to not be so dominating and distracting.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars if they could have changed the timeline even more so that Ben and Claudia where still doing Farscape and the SGC was back to it's orginal cast.
0545128285|2.0|As many of the other 1 and 2 star reviews written here, I found the book a bit of a waste of time.  I also really HATE all the footnotes.  Definitely not up to the quality of Harry Potter.  I thought this was a desperate attempt to squeeze more money from the series.  I was right in a way.  At the end of the book it describes the charity that it is benefitting.  So, for the benefit of charity I can give it two stars.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|Initially, I was fagged by this film even with Gerard Butler's pretty mug looking into the cameras, but as I caught the hang of it, the lay of the land, so to speak, with land swindles and all, finally the combo of humor and violence grabbed me, you know. It was \\"RocknRolla\\"--some serious playing, going-down-kind-of-stuff. So I go along for the ride.<br /><br />It was like watching a kind of weird fairy tale about an ogre, Lenny, who owns the entire land, the underworld land. He is in control. If he says it, everyone says it. He is THE ruler until another ogre comes in. Ogres can cast special spells. The second ogre comes from Russia, you know, the land of ballet and hopping music. This ogre is younger and more handsome and tougher, although he is smooth with his beautiful young accountant (Thandie Newton). She arranges not one, but two heists of millions of his money. He knows it, but since he admires her brains and her beauty, he allows it--that is until his lucky painting comes between them.<br /><br />This is a complicated story no matter who tells it. Two trolls that Lenny dupes decide to get even. They work with Thandie. Later One-Two (that's the gorgeous Gerard Butler) and Thandie mix it up in bed. That Guy Ritchie is a sharp director--who thought a sex scene could be funny and un-sexy?<br /><br />Remember that nice-looking ogre from Russia? One-Two and two of his buds take the money from two of the Russian's trolls who come after them. Cars wreck, train tunnels are involved, a chase scene on foot--it's a case of which trolls have more endurance. Pretty funny stuff.<br /><br />There's a water dipping scene with some scary crawfish. There's a gay dancing scene. Then comes famous singer Johnny Quid, playing dead because--hey, he almost is dead from so many drugs. But after his \\"death,\\" his records take off. You know, RocknRolla.<br /><br />Oh, yes, a painting gets passed around and causes broken legs, a sado-sex scene, and other mishaps. It's a real comedy of errors. Meanwhile, Lenny learns that power is not permanent and that his foster son, Johnny Quid cleans up real well. RocknRolla!<br /><br />Guy Ritchie--as they say, he the man!wer is not permanent and that his foster son, Johnny Quid cleans up real well. RocknRolla!    Guy Ritchie--as they say, he the man!
B001DD63UO|5.0|This is easily P!nk's best album.  The songs are a perfect mix of slow, thoughtful songs (such as \\"Mean\\") and upbeat, fun songs that make you laugh (such as \\"Funhouse\\", and \\"Bad Influence\\".)  I would highly recommend this cd for any Pink fan and any girl who just wants to listen to good, fun music.
B001B1UO6W|4.0|My review of the included Special Features found on the 20th anniversary edition:<br /><br />- Commentary track with creator/writer Don Mancini and producer David Kirschner.<br />**The commentary from these two was very informative and descriptive about the technicalities that went into the making of the film. They would get to the point on specifics with each scene shown and would rarely carry on into the next with their conversation. Mancini and Kirschner gave an insightful and surprisingly detailed account of how the Chucky doll was operated throughout the movie, no longer leaving fans of the franchise stumped on how Chucky came to be. This is how Film commentary should be done and kudos to the official announcement of the 'Child's Play remake' they reveal at the end of the film.<br /><br />- A second track with FX guru Kevin Yagher, Catherine Hicks, and now-grown-up Alex Vincent.<br />**This commentary included the main character's point of view and the FX Wiz of the film.The 2 stars, Hicks and Vincent, discussed their rememberances from filming the movie such as the record-low weather of filming in Chicago, their interactions with the Chucky puppeteer crew and the doll itself, working with the real-life stand-in for Chucky, amongst many other non-technical topics. Special Effects expert, Kevin Yagher gave much more information about the creation of and work that went into making 'Chucky' for the film, as with Mancini and Kirschner, but maybe a tad more in depth. Katherine Hicks and Kevin Yagher feel the need to announce that they met and later married while working on the film about ever 5 minutes or so(say what you will, but it became cheesy after the first 4 times they mention it)<br /><br />- A third track with Mancini and Chucky (Brad Dourif voicing in character).<br />**Select scenes are chosen for Mancini and 'Chucky'(Dourif in character) to discuss. Chucky details the scenes as if he were an actual character filming the scenes. Vulgar language(surprise?)is found in this commentary, but either way, it's hilarious and entertaining.<br /><br />- Making-of documentary blending archival footage with new, on-camera interviews with Mancini, Kirschner, Yagher, Hicks, Vincent, Chris Sarandon, John Lafia and Brad Dourif.<br />**The Cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of special features found on this disc. In-person interviews discussing alot of what was said on the Director/FX/Actor commentary but with excellent production footage from the film.<br /><br />-Definite purchase for Horror film buffs and fans of the franchise alike.

B001KO3FFW|5.0|I haven't bought a CD is soooo long, but was excited to purchase this one because I loved David's style on AI.  I am happy to say I love it.  I would never have considered buying an album from any of the other AI artists, but had to get this one and am happy I did.  I agree that \\"Light On\\" was not the best choice for a first single and don't let that song dissuade you from buying the album.  I think almost every other song is better.  It has a good mix of rock and ballads.  Even the ballads are not the typical sappy songs but have a good rock edge.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and look forward to more from David.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I bought this game for our son and his girlfriend at Christmas. The four of us played it so much that I had to order another one for my husband and I to play when we returned home. We have since played it with others and they have enjoyed it as well.  We love this game, its easy to learn, fast and a lot of fun. Great for family game night.
0375703764|3.0|In college, I first became interested in the idea of reading House of Leaves when I friend flipped through the pages, and showed me pages of spiral text, and other odd shapes one doesn't normally find in books.  Rather than ask what the book was about, I asked her opinion on the book.  Two years later, needing a book to read, I decided to but this one.  When I receieved the book, I read the prologue, which opens with Johnny explaining his 'condition.'  I immediately thought that this book would be a roller coaster of exciting horror, or something that I would finish within six months, at the very least.    Unfortunately, my initial hope was lost.  I think I read the first 90 or so pages in a week.  The text, written by Zampano, reads like a Government textbook, and contains multiple footnotes on every page.  In fact, Johnny's story in the footnotes gives the story a flavor, and breaks up the monotony of the survey of the film, The Navidson Record.    But herein lies the brilliance of House of Leaves.  The book is so thourough, that it does become plausible in it's special sort of way.  It documents it's character and events so complete that the book comes to life in a way that has never been seen.    About 2 months after I initially put the book down, I started gradually reading it again.  The rewards for doing so come very sparingly.  Most of the book is setting up the events so perfectly that it takes away the momentum that it could have.  I don't know if that makes sense, but I'm trying to say that less than 10% of the plot in this book captivates me.  There are moments that are rewarding, but they are so far apart that I'm currently finishing this book out of spite.    Today, I wouldn't recommend this book solely on the text patterns.  If you're looking for a recommendation, I cannot offer one, so I've just posted my feelings about this book.  It is what it is: revolutionary, slow, and ever so often rewarding.
B001HZK8FO|5.0|I think everybody has covered the movie itself in their reviews so I'm not gonna go into it in mine... mine is all about the packaging.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the packaging of the limited edition Blu Ray is awesome, i loved it but, it's too big!  I hate it when movie boxes are of all shapes and sizes.  I hate it even more when there's no title on the side of the boxes (not the case with this one) making it hard for others to find a movie when they're looking for something.<br /><br />I bought this edition out of haste and didn't realize it had all the extra stuff inside until it was too late. I think it's a nice bonus to get all this but I could have done without it.  I would've preferred an additional disc with extras.  You might say I should return it or exchange it but it's too much hassle... so I'm keeping it.<br /><br />I wish all movies would follow The Godfather's steps.  I mean, they managed to put all 3 movies and an additional disc with extras in a slightly wider Blu Ray case.<br /><br />I'm still giving it 5 stars because, despite the fact that it comes in a huge box, it still is a beautiful big box with nice extras.

1401307450|5.0|This is one of those great books that u just can't put down, it actually makes u excited when u are reading it. Anthony Kedis definetly has had a wild life, and it feels like u are on this wild ride with him. One of the great things about this book is how down to earth Anthony is. Many people see him as this wild rock star, but his main girlfriend throughout the majority of the book was a girl named Claire who he just asked out at a restaurant on a impluse, not an actress, not anyone famous, just a regular girl and he treats her like gold even though she is mean to him back. Thats one of the great things about him no matter how fu*ked up he would get on drugs he would still treat people well and look after them, including buying his dad a car and a house!<br /><br />This is a great read and I highly recommend it
B00012FXAE|5.0|I can never get enough of this movie, I don't know what else to say. I like everything about it. From Ripley to face huggers, to Hudson to the Queen. If you're a sci fi buff you're gonna love this movie. There aren't many movies out there that compare. There's action, drama, monsters, weapons, Marines, humor, space ships, action, an android, bigger monsters, did I say there was action?
0439598427|2.0|I did not read the description thoroughly enough to note that this was not the version of this terrific book that I wanted to order.  Maybe a more prominent description would benefit others.
0465043577|2.0|In his characteristically obnoxious style, Mandelbrot spends the first half of the book explaining why he disagrees with the Efficient Market Hypothesis: That is 150 pages to say that market returns are not normally distributed, but show \\"fat tails\\". One thing is clear from the book: he was the original, misunderstood maverick that authored or co-authored (or somehow was related to the author) of every single paper and theory that proved that returns are not normally distributed. Hell, telling from the book one would have reason to think that Mandelbrot, himself, invented the question mark.<br />His overuse of the first person pronouns is so prevalent that after a while, it makes reading the book intolerable.<br />His explanations against the EMH are, however, sound, understandable and convincing, albeit clich&eacute;d. His writing style, patronizing in its shallowness may have to do with the author's desire to make the book accessible to a wider audience, but I find it hard to believe that his \\"co-author\\", a well-regarded Wall Street Journal writer had any editing input. This is clear even from the apologetic tone of the preface.<br />The second part of the book is even worse. Mandelbrot fails to make the logical connection of how rejecting EMH implies his (let's call it) Fractal Market Hypothesis. In fact his explanation of the theory is so shallow (trying not to alienate non-scientists) that it is useless. It is impossible to get more than a vague idea of what his theory is, much less to be convinced by it.<br />The two redeeming values of the book are the technical notes at the end of the book, which add that needed meat to the hollow skeleton he paints and his \\"10 heresies of finance\\".<br />One thing is clear, though not new, to those who have thought about finance: Market returns are not normally distributed and not strictly efficient as the simplifying theories need them to be. It does not follow, however, that they are \\"fractal\\".

B0015XASFS|5.0|This is an excellent set.  You get a CD and a DVD.  Josh has such a powerful and pleasing voice.  I'm always amazed at the richness of his voice.  It was nice to see him a full concert as I've only seen him previously on some TV specials.  This is a must for Josh fans and bound to delight all who hear it.  He's defintely one of the beautiful voices to be with us for many years to come.
0802136834|5.0|I love Alison Weir so my review might be a little biased. Since I have read a great deal of her other works I jumped at buying this book. It covers all six of Henry VIII's wives using a great deal of research. Predictably, Ms. Weir focuses the majority of the book on his first two, most famous wives Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. The rest of the book somewhat flies through the rest of the wives, especially his third wife who died shortly after childbirth so her reign was quite short.<br /><br />This is a long book and it is heavily laded with facts and dates but I love that. It is very informative and entertaining. It is not a boring book by any means. If you want a comprehensive study of all of Henry VIII's wives, then pick up this book.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I first heard of the Celtic Woman from a PBS broadcast the Celtic Woman - A New Journey.  I became captivated by their voices and smooth style of singing.  All five woman are incredible performers.  The four vocalists, Chloe, Lisa, Meav and Orla are beautiful to listen to as they are to watch.  Even when they sing in Gaelic the pure quality of their voices are breathtaking.  Mairead, the fiddler, never speaks, but you will delight your senses as she glides around the stage playing her fiddle.  This DVD concert is beautifully produced with a good selection of songs that highlight their powerful voices and personal styles.  All the music has a Celtic quality even when the song is not of Celtic origin.  It's a very upbeat and happy DVD which I hoped would never end.  I originally purchased the Celtic Woman - A New Journey  and was so mesmerized by their performances I just had to have more and this DVD was perfect.  I found behind the scenes very interesting learning more about these woman and their background.  You'll not be disappointed.

And if my wife is correct about my \\"guy status\\" in this world you can tell Stephanie that there is a 4th hot guy who has it bad for Stephanie Plum.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|It's very surprising to see a Springsteen album,nevermind a new one getting the kind of lousy reviews this one is getting. Maybe it has to do with what his audience is listening for at the given moment. Especially considering The Boss's socially moralizing lyrics that have gained him some reputation in recent years he does here,as another reviewer stated seemed to be in a happier mood.As of this CD's release American just celebrated not only a new year but a new era as the election of Barrack Obama as president shocked the world. So history is being made around Bruce so he really doesn't need to worry about making it on his album anyway. He and the E Street Band (in absolute FULL THROTTLE I may add) really mix it up on this album with a dash of orchestration here,a dash of pop there and plenty of that classic Spectorian rock n soul Springsteen has made his signiture sound for over 25 years. He starts us off with \\"Outlaw Pete\\"-now musically this doesn say it all for the whole album but it's definately a classic outlaw tune that builds into this huge orchestrated sound;very much in the classic Springsteen but vocally a bit more world weary.The title tune,\\"Surprise Surprise\\",the imaculately crafted \\"This Life\\" and the almost blue grassy \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (NOT the Beatle classic by the way) are easy candidates for pop singles. Interestingly enough that honor so far seems to have gone to tunes that are a bit different;\\"My Lucky Day\\",which is noisy even by Springsteen standards and....well not my FAVORITE cut on the album even though I like it.\\"Life Itself\\" is personally more to my liking but it's just slightly darker and more musically ambitious and it is a bit more radio friendly.I suppose you can say the same of \\"Queen Of The Supermarket\\" although in that case there's a far poppier aspect to it.\\"Good Eye\\" is fairly raucous blues but the sound it a little harsh at times.The albums ends with two folksy tunes in \\"The Last Carnival\\" and \\"The Wrestler\\",the lone bonus track.Taken together nothing here is fully dark no;musically it's all very upbeat or reflective and the lyrics focus more on story songs and Bruce's classic character sketches then anything with a social agenda. But it flaunts every quality that Springsteen's audience seem to find in him and it does it very well. So just because it's not the Springsteen some people were expecting doesn't mean it isn't great in another context.I just hear it for what it is and there are certainly no complaints.the lone bonus track.Taken together nothing here is fully dark no;musically it's all very upbeat or reflective and the lyrics focus more on story songs and Bruce's classic character sketches then anything with a social agenda.

B001M5UDGS|3.0|** Dr. Horrible isn't your typical movie short. In fact, it isn't your typical anything. What it is, is Joss Whedon. It is a fun little thing he created during the writers' strike, and it is fun to watch. It's corny, and it's hokey, but it IS fun.  ** Joss Whedon may not be a genius, but anyone who could create Buffy, Angel, Firefly, and (coming soon), Dollhouse, is as close as you can come without the actual title. I enjoyed \\"Dr. Horrible\\" on the Web, and enjoyed it even more on the DVD.  ** Considering that it is reasonable cheap, and that there are some good Extras, I would recommend than any fan of Joss and his other creations buy this DVD.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret was the Beginning.  It was good , but it did not give the whole story. It did not show what to do AFTER you think what you want. I can not wait until the follow up to the secret comes out.  \\"Beyond the Secret\\" comes out in April.  [...] .  I saw the preview, and it is a lot like the secret.  It just goes on to \\"what is the next step?\\".  I know several people who are in the movie, and what they are saying, is what they live.  The Secret was a great start, Beyond the secret was needed.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Loved this movie. Although I prefer movies that have high action and good explosions this had an element that just pulled me in. Charles Bronson was a perfect pick for the loner on a trail of revenge. And Henry Fonda as a bad guy? Who would have thought that would work? But it did. I love the line he uses \\"People scare better when they are dying....\\" Just seems so wrong and yet so evil hearing this come out of the mouth from the man who starred in Spencers Mountain and On Golden Pond. Like Santa being a bully!<br />Highly recommend this movie!

B000AADYUI|4.0|I thought there was something wrong with \\"Mau Mau\\" when it gets to the part \\"in the midst of\\" it sounds like it skips..Well, it does purposely! hat's right! Why? Cause RCA forced Kantner to edit out a curse word there..I had the vinyl copy back in the day, but never really noticed it...Years went by, and I boought the 1996 version (without the bonus tracks) , then really noticed it...I returned it and got something else , after playing it in the music store for the clerk,,(He heard it too)    A year goes by and I read in a magazine about that edit and felt bad I returned it..I now have the remaster with bonus tracks and actually love that part now! LOL! I lool at it as a minor flaw on a masterpiece of music! Enjoy it!
B000002GI0|5.0|A perfect album, showcasing one of the greatest American singer/songwriters ever.<br />John Hiatt is a national treasure. The depth and breadth of this record is astounding. Such a magnificently varied group of songs are given the treatment they deserve. Hiatt's lyrics and vocals are truly unique and full of human emotion. The musicians are all superb, particularly the inimitable Sonny Landreth, whipsawing, squeezing, coaxing and conjuring all those incredible notes from his guitar.<br />This one should go in a time capsule.
B001LF4IA6|2.0|A very disappointing new album from Bruce Springsteen. I am sorry I pre-ordered it.
B001AEF6D6|4.0|....I just don't know how to describe it. But it makes me want to watch this movie, and several other Coen's films, at least once per year. And I'm not a guy who typically does that. Every year I laugh almost to the point of nausea by the antics of the Dude, Walter, Jesus, the Germans, etc., and marvel at the performances of these talented actors. No one does it like the Coen's. Their sardonic vision, razor-sharp wit, uniquely cracked story lines and incredibly caustic take on just about everything makes them THE most exciting American filmmakers working today.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Faulty Towers is humor at its very best.  This video series features British actor/comedian John Cleese,who not only writes the material, but is the lead character, \\"Mr. Faulty\\".   He and his wife, Sybil, own a bed and breakfast in England.  The stories revolve around them and their servant \\"Manuel\\" (a native of Barcelona, who is learning English), their housekeeper/waitress, Polly, and permanent resident called \\"the Major\\" and the various guests who stay in the Inn, which is named Faulty Towers.   We have watched this series over and over and it's just as funny the last time as the first time.  We have found that this series is a wonderful gift and highly recommend it.  First class comedy !!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire is a film that overwhelms you with its energy, vivacity, joy, hope and love of life. It shows the extremes of Indian society; the poverty of the slums with the exuberant joy of Bollywood films. Yes, there is brutality and violence, but like in real life, the scenes of pain are balanced by the sheer vivaciousness of the story.    Danny Boyle shows modern India as a constantly moving and evolving place, and that is reflected in the changing destiny of its main character who will do anything to reach his goal. There's a scene involving a toilet that basically sums up the character of Jamal, that he will literally go through crap to get what his heart desires.    The performances by the actors are amazing, especially from the child actors, the cinematography is eye-popping, zooming you right into the experience of Mumbai, and the pure strength of the story of a persistent underdog, makes this film without a question the best of the year. There is not one boring moment, and you will be moved to tears by the end of it.
0571202284|5.0|As someone who received a bachelor's degree in animation, I can say this is the best book on the subject I have found. Williams learned from the masters and he passes that on to the reader. Other books tell you how to do a walk cycle; Williams spends a hundred pages on walking with personality. This kind of knowledge and expertise is useful regardless of what technique you are using to animate; a computer animator still needs to know how the characters move, the right timing, how to show weight, personality and so on. Williams rambles a bit about the old animators he learned from, but the lessons are valuable enough to tolerate it.

B0018QPPXW|3.0|\\"Risky Business\\" seems to be making a gentle crack at the corrupt and materialistic adult world. Tom Cruise plays a high school kid and reluctant \\"future enterpriser\\" who sets up a bordello in his parent's house while they are away on holiday. His materialistic parents seem more interested in their stereo, Porsche, holidays, and what college their son gets into rather than the feelings of their own son. The pre-AIDS sexual zeitgeist date the film somewhat but Cruise's star quality is plain for all to see. He turns the film into something far better than it deserves.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Woody Allen has written and directed another European based film that feels like a view across the pond toward America: Allen is still Allen, but with the comparison of European attitudes with American narcissism makes this little film a bit more bitter than most of his others.  As with most of Allen's movies, as fine as they are there are usually some annoying elements.  In VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA that element is in the presence of an unseen narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) who provides the bridges among the various aspects of the film, bridges that in the presence of such a fine cast are unnecessary in fleshing out the characters and their odd situations.<br /><br />Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who have elected to spend a summer in Barcelona: Vicky intends to pursue her studies of Catalan art and architecture while Cristina needs to recover from her completion of a disappointing 12 minute film.  Vicky is a pragmatist engaged to a 'good prospect' named Doug (Chris Messina)  while Cristina longs for the unusual - something that will fill the gap in her perception that she is without talent.  The two girls meet a famous artist Juan Antonio Gonzano (Javier Bardem) who, recovering from a strangely abusive marriage to the flamboyant Maria Elena (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz), puts the make on the two girls for a m&eacute;nage a trois. Vicky is disgusted, Cristina is fascinated and somehow the trio is off for a wild weekend that turns into a strange interplay of even stranger personality types. Juan loves both, beds both, and problems arise - especially when his still beloved tempestuous Maria Elena arrives on the scene.  Just about every variation of relationships is explored during this film with the audience more than willing to go along with the twists and turns that never cease to surprise and entertain.<br /><br />Once again Javier Bardem proves he is one of our strongest actors on the screen and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz lights up the story like a rocket.  Watching them both is reason enough to see this film.  As for the script, Allen allows each of the characters to reference an aspect of Allen's own quirks, and in the end we have indeed heard yet another diatribe of how Woody Allen sees himself and the people who enter his sphere.  The film is colorful, rich in fine music, and blessed with an impeccable cast.  If it just didn't superimpose that narrator as a tour guide....Grady Harp, January 09them both is reason enough to see this film.

The Contract is well done with  a mix of tense action scenes and emotional connections with Ray and his son. Freeman and Cusack take the film to the next level. If you like either of these actors, get this Steelbook. It looks awesome!

031606792X|1.0|Clearly I am late to this discussion, but I just finished reading all 4 of Meyer's books at my 16 year old's insistence. She really loves this series but I cannot recall when I have ever read a set of books that have evoked a similarly negative reaction.     I need to thank ML for her lengthy review at the beginning of the one-star reviews since it saves me an enormous amount of time cataloging my objections to this series. Since I know that ML was not writing a novel, but rather detailing her objections and issues with the book, I am amused at the number of people here who rejected her views because of typos and the length of her review. I thought this was a forum to share opinions, but sadly, like everywhere else in our culture,  people cannot seem to differ in their opinions without taking a different POV personally and then attacking the other.   I agree with so much of what she had to say. That said, I would really like to thank those LDS readers who posted and clarified that Meyer's storytelling does not convey accurate messages about Mormon teachings. While I appreciate that Meyer told her story without the more graphic sexual content often found in vampire lore, I also agree that her messages about women and sexuality, as displayed by Bella's behavior throughout the series,  does not portray attitudes that readers should link to the writer's faith tradition.     Unlike ML, my objections to this series started with the first book. The writing, the shallowness of the characters, the unreality of the story line all bothered me. Yes, I know this is a fantasy series and that I should not be taking the book literally. On the other hand, I don't want plot lines and issues to be so far-fetched that they make my brain sore trying to read around the utter ridiculousness of some of the problems the author created and then insufficiently address or ignored.     I was happy to see my daughter so engaged these past few months with a book series she enjoyed. I think reading is valuable for whatever purpose, even mere entertainment,  and I know she gets a fair share of substantial reading in school. But as I read the Twilight series I could not help but cringe at the shallowness of the story line and the kinds of messages this book sent to my daughter and other readers.  My only consolation for the waste of her and my time on this series, is that I extracted a promise from her to read some Austen this summer.     I have noted in many, many reviews the comparisons between J. K. Rowling and Stephanie Meyer. IMHO, the only fair comparison is that both women have sold an enormous number of books. Both can tell an engaging story (or clearly neither would have sold books in the millions) but judging by the strength of the writing, the substance of her characters, the morals conveyed in the story lines, only Rowling's works will stand the test of time and become classics. Meyer has produced pulp fiction which will diminish in its impact as time and reflection will allow a reasoned appreciation of its deficiencies. Over time, these will outweigh its present enormous popularity. I just wish there were some kind of \\"love shield\\" for the creepy messages and the bad writing my daughter and others had to endure.      OK, fans, I am ready for more hissing and growling....

B000FS9MV0|5.0|I pre-ordered Skylark, received it today, and have spent the afternoon listening to it over and over again. My dad was a trumpet player and had his own band for years in Richmond, Virginia so I grew up with music and have full appreciation for her talent. When I purchased this CD I did not know that I would hear Chris Botti's trumpet on \\"When I Fall in Love\\" and that, of course, was special for me. This CD is a must for those who yearn for the good old music along with the freshness of a new voice, new songs, and outstanding arrangements by The Hit Man, David Foster. An array of talented musicans back her up. What a terrific tour of styles, changing tempos, and three new songs co-written by Renee with David Foster.     Jerry Radford (author)  Virginia Beach, VA

Had it been first the other tunes would have sounded even weaker than they are.  I liked the Magic album before this and clearly most of this stuff is true leftovers that probably only a real die-hard BS fan is going to like.
B001KVZ6C0|5.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is an entirely neoteric movie, extremely suspenseful with fantastic views of Mumbai especially film of one of the world's largest slums. The Taj Mahal hotel and Victoria Station are featured as are many other aspects of this vibrant city. I visited Mumbai(formerly Bombay)and can attest to the frantic, frenetic rhythm and energy of the city you see in the movie.<br /> Three or four levels of suspense are going on simultaneously in this story which will mesmerize you. The life of the poverty-stricken boy-protagonist who is a contestant on a millionaire game show with its huge stakes, the police interrogation, the missing girl, the hardships and manipulation of slum life--all cry out for your attention. It's a multi-layered, very intense movie. The acting is topnotch. Everything about the movie is done with meticulous care. I think it'd destined to be a classic.<br /> It's fascinating to realize how the moviemakers get you drawn into the movie. But stay for the credits because they are in the old Bollywood musical extravaganza tradition. They put you into another world and are sensational.<br /> There are excruciatingly exciting chases, gangsters, extreme poverty, humor, and always the slums and the slum mentality. The survival wiliness of the two brothers as they grow up is fascinating to watch. The three musketeers is a theme that gallops through the movie. It's triumph and tragedy. The protagonist becomes a chai wallah, a delivery boy of chai, spice milk tea.<br /> The editing is done so superbly you cannot take your eyes off the screen full of vivid imagery and non-stop action. It's a portrait of a city and a boy on their headlong dash toward destiny with ferocity and velocity. India is a place where one in a million can hit it big, but for most people can barely survive in one of the world's countries with the highest rate of poverty and intractable slums. This is a Dickensian story about a lad who may be able to make it to the big time by the skin of his and our teeth and by the luck of the draw! Caste? Karma, anyone?and our teeth and by the luck of the draw! Caste? Karma, anyone?
B000024D4R|5.0|Wow! Having a bit of an adolescent longing vibe going and completely replaced my home entertainment equipment....speakers, amplifier everything. Wanted to get some stuff to listen to and got this and was transported back to my teen years. Cant enhance like I used to...:) but this record is my favorite pink floyd. What great guitar work
B00005U11Z|5.0|My favorite song on this DVD is Separate Ways. It introduced Journey fans to Steve Augeri and Deen Castronovo in a big way. Journey rolled the dice big by coming into Vegas without Perry to a concert-savvy market. If you do that - you better bring your A game and they did. Augeri shines with his confidence and poise. He is so smooth. Close your eyes and you'll find that through this dynamic wall of sound, rises the electrifying, mesmerizing power drumming of Castronovo. He truly is the star in this concert opener. He was magnificent.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie since I LOVE Jane Austen movies and books so much.  Other people tell me those are boring, but if you understand the language and enjoy subtle wit and romance, they are very enjoyable.  This movie however, was a complete disappointment.  It was profoundly dull and boring in the extreme.  There was next to no musical sountrack and the actors were exceptionally unattractive.  Not just the main character who is said to have \\"lost her bloom\\". I was quite taken aback by the utter scariness of all of the actors in this film.  I was all ready for an enjoyable Jane Austen ride into the past, but was supremely disappointed.  The movie never picked up and hardly made sense at all.  There was no interesting dialogue and you never really got into the characters or the story enough to feel for them.  Very flat.  Don't waste your time.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, maybe more so because it seemed such an understated story, but still with a strong balanced cast, inspiring settings and exceptional cinematography.  The Illusionist is a motion picture work of art, and the sense I got from the filmmaker and cast was that they were purposefully aware in the way the presentation was made.<br /><br />Even if the ending was in my sights before the story concluded, the way it was concluded was so tasteful and still with some surprise that it made me smile, just as the Inspector did.
0800141660|5.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of the book.  Kate Winslet played such a wonderful Marianne!  Emma Thompson, and all of the actors were wonderful in this film.  One of the very few where Hugh Grant is not the rogue.  I was so moved by Marianne's heartbreak.  I completely identify with her character and the situation she finds herself in.  Very moving.  A beautiful film overall.
B000A2UBN4|4.0|Though I still prefer the original version, I do like Scorsese's re-make almost as much. It's a decent update w/ some added violence, sadism, and perversion to make Max Cady (Robert De Niro) all the more detestable. He is truly human slime. We can fear and hate him without guilt! Nick Nolte (The Deep) plays attorney Sam Bowden as a flawed man w/ a few problems of his own. Jessica Lange is Bowden's redhot wife, and Juliette Lewis (Kalifornia, Natural Born Killers) is their incredibly innocent daughter, Danny. It's also fun to see Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and Martin Balsam (all from the first version) in cameo roles. Plus, we get Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall) as the ill-fated P.I.! This is De Niro's movie all the way. His Max Cady dominates every scene w/ malice, menace, and apalling arrogance. Great stuff w/ some nice surprises...
B00005MP58|5.0|I love, love, love this movie!  There is something new to appreciate with every viewing.  The witty comebacks and subtleties make the film so enjoyable and intriguing.  You will find yourself falling for Mr. Darcy right along Lizzy!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I am an Enya fan and have been for some time.  Her music is different and a pleasure.    I don't understand earlier reviews that complain that her music doesn't change and this is more of the same.    Duh!  That is why I buy her music.    If she sounded  like the other CDs that are a dime a dozen, why bother.    Please don't change Enya. You are great as you are.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|Nice  to  remember  the  old film  but  change  a  bit
B000J0NIIW|5.0|The Ontel Swivel Sweeper is a first-rate product.  It does a very nice job on both bare and carpeted floors. It's relatively quiet and I can operate it late at night when others are sleeping. It's lightweight and easy to operate - including emptying the dirt tray.  I was sold on this item when I saw a three-year-old - my nephew Nicholas - do it. I also like the fact that you'd don't have to keep the whole thing attached to a wall plug to recharge.  The battery pack detaches and that is the only thing that gets plugged in.  You can store the sweeper where ever you please.<br /><br />One problem - if you have a long-haired dog that sheds (as I do) you will spend some time pulling those hairs out of the sweeper brushes.  If you don't, the sweeper won't work.  Threads and string also get wound up in the brushes.  The Swivel Sweeper comes with a special brush-cleaning tool to assist with hair and string removal.<br /><br />Assembly takes just a few minutes.  I love it. The only thing I don't like about it is that this sweeper is made in China.  I prefer to buy American-made products.<br /><br />Shopping on line, you'll find the Ontel Swivel Sweeper priced anywhere from $34 to $50.  The best price I found was at Amazon.com.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I rarely write reviews of anything on any site, but I had to comment on this.    Some of the greatest players alive, playing some of the most memorable and industry-changing popular music ever written, with outstanding production, a wonderful tribute to both of George's musical worlds (east & west)... this is one of the most treasured DVD's in my collection.  It is touching, beautiful, and could not have been done better IMO.    I suppose I could've done without the Monty Python bit, but that's just me.
0060578793|5.0|I originally bought this book as a reference for a story I'm working on. After receiving it, I discovered that it went way beyond what I was expecting. I found that a lot of the information, which is laid out in simple language, is as much common sense as anything. What Mr. Wiseman does in his straightforward style is make it easier for us to be prepared for almost any situation. This book will definitely be among my necessity items whenever I travel from now on.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I had purchased the DVD version of this several years ago, and as my review of that version says, rated it highly. I bought the Blue Ray version to compare it to my older DVD and see if it was enough better to justify buying BlueRay versions of some of the DVDs I already owned. I did a 3 way comparison, switching back & forth among the 3 modes as I watched. Mode 1 was the DVD in non-upconverted form, 2 was the DVD upconverted to 1080, and 3 was the BlueRay disk. Although the greatest improvement was between modes 1 & 2, mode 3 was noticeable better than 2. Mode 3 had much sharper detail, especially in the darker areas.     For new purchases, I would certainly recommend buying the BlueRay version where it is available even if it cost more, although upconverted DVDs are almost as good and in most cases I would not spend the money to replace DVDs I already had with the BlueRay version.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I had heard that this was a great movie from friends and family and since the book was written by an author I loved and they had done a great job on Wives and Daughters by the same author, I took a chance and bought it without watching it first. In my first review I said it wasn't as enjoyable as some other period dramas I've seen, but after watching it for the second time have revised my opinion--it's excellent! Good character devlopment, brilliant sets and staging, engaging characters and situations--thoroughly enjoyable. I think I liked it better the second time around because (plot spoiler--maybe--) I knew the two main characters WERE going to get together in the end (in a very nice way :^)) and I was able to sit back and enjoy the ride more instead of getting annoyed with all their misunderstandings. :^)
B001G5ZKZS|4.0|This DVD shines a light on the best things about Rush: musicianship, energetic and exciting live shows, and their sense of humor.  You get closeups of the band members exhibiting their prowess on their chosen instruments, and you can see that they are having a great time running about the stage (at least Alex and Geddy-Neil is kinda tied to the drum set). You also get the great, hilarious little movies at the beginning and after intermission.  The DVD also has out-takes from their movies, as well as other performances. It is a great value, even if you didn't get to see them on this tour.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I still, after seeing this movie, can't believe Phillipe Petite walked on a tight rope between the Twin Towers. How could someone be so crazy?<br /><br />Even if you don't enjoy documentaries you should enjoy the footage at the end of the film of him accomplishing this amazing task. Here is a man practicing a skill his entire life he was so confident of he was able to walk a tight rope a quarter mile in the air. I love the shot of the airplane flying overhead when he's on the rope, seemingly right over his head. The footage is breathtaking.<br /><br />It's also nice to see the Twin Towers in a positive way as the last reviewer mentioned.
B001KEHAI0|3.0|BluRay disk would not play in my Sony BDP-S300.  I spent 2 hours downloading and burning a CD of a Firmware update.  Installing this firmware update allowed the BluRay disk to play.  How many people could update the firmware with Sony's confusing instructions?  How many would return the BluRay disc as defective?

B001LRJH0K|2.0|Appaloosa was a good Western movie. Ed Harris played a great role and I was throughly entertained throughout most of the film.<br /><br />I believe I expected a bit more, with todays technology in film making. There were some really slow areas where I almost lost interest.<br /><br />Was it as good at 3:10 to Yuma? No, not quite and I was not all that impressed with that movie either.<br /><br />Was it as good as Tombstone with Kirt Russell & Val Kilmer? Absolutely not, Tombstone is my all-time favorite Western.
B00000EH6T|5.0|Songs Include :<br />1. Burning Heart - Survivor<br />2. Heart's On Fire - John Cafferty<br />3. Double Or Nothing - Kenny Loggins & Gladys Knight<br />4.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|\\"Open Range\\" - and, maybe \\"Broken Trail\\" in between - at least because Boss Spearman - sorry, Robert Duvall, repeats in the later.   Reasons because I liked this movie other reviewers wrote about them already.   Just want to point that I happened to have watched Vigo's \\"Capitan Alatriste\\" just few weeks before and I can't help it but to think that the great actor Vigo brought to \\"Appaloosa\\" a couple of things from the Captain Alatriste character. The way he walks carrying the big rifle, the high boots, the hat, even his pointing beard, all of that resembles the XVII century Spanish \\"Arcabucero\\" - arquebusier, sort of musketeer - character he develops in that movie.   And, in the final gun duel against Jeremy Irons, Vigo definitely stands with great style, looking more a gentleman ready for a pistol duel in old Europe than a late XIX century american gunman.
1594481717|3.0|Pink makes a compelling and cogent argument: that the future lies in the hands of people who embrace both their L-Directed thinking and R-Directed thinking. Pink argues that in the future a doctor who simply diagnosis an illness won't suffice in the medical profession, since much of that work can now be done by computers. But something computers can't do is empathize with their patients, and provide solutions that will treat the patient as a whole, and not just as some particular infirmity.<br /><br />The truth is that Pink's point can be seen in everyday activities - like shopping.  Why did I buy this bottle of ketchup instead of that one? Probably because some designer made a more appealing label design that caught my eye, and may have invoked some particular feeling inside of me, which in turn propelled me to purchase it. In the age of abundance, the difference will be in the design of the products we buy, and this is the area in which the right brain excels at.<br /><br />It is an interesting read with a powerful message. I thought some of Pink's suggestions were a little cheesy and too \\"New Aged\\" for my liking, but overall the book was well worth the purchase.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I pre-ordered this when it came out last year and was very diligent with it immediately when it arrived.  It's the most effective work-out approach for me and I noticed a huge difference within just a few days.  I combined these workouts with the diet plan in her 30-day Making the Cut book and within the 30 days, I was \\"shredded\\"!  Before starting this regimen, I already worked out regularly and ate well, but had hit a huge plateau for a long time, but Jillian got me past it.  When I went to the beach for vacation, I was bikini ready and not ashamed to bare a little skin!  Her routines burned off the fat and toned my muscles beautifully.  Even people at work noticed a big difference and I got a few people to order their own copies of this DVD.    During the holidays, I had an extremely hectic schedule and so I did very little working out and ate lots of fast food.  Needless to say, I lost my bikini body, so I started back on Jillian's routine again about two and a half weeks ago and am almost beach ready again.  This workout works if you're committed!  Jillian is tough, but effective.  My husband says she's mean, but that's what works for me.  The only complaint I'd have, and I've seen several other reviewers said the same thing, is that Jillian talks a little too much.  Most of what she says is helpful the first or second time through each routine, but after the 4th or 5th time, it's a little annoying.
031606792X|5.0|After inadvertently reading a 'spoiler' review, several rather negative reviews, AND not caring much for Book 3, I put off reading this book for months.  Now that I've finished it, in a few short days, I couldn't wait to give it a 5 star review!  It was great!  Don't listen to naysayers!  This book was a little drawn out at the beginning, BUT...what a great finale!  I really enjoyed Book 1, and now Book 4 restored my faith in the author.  I enjoyed the individual books within this book, and how the story was neatly tied up.  The end of the book has a Vampire Index, which helped with the finale.  Don't pass this book up, it is the best or the series! Could not put it down!

B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift is a very talented and beautiful young lady.  Her voice is just beautiful and I love how she handles herself.  Its nice to have someone like her for kids to look up to.  I am also impressed how she has taken a hand in writting the songs.  We love this album and reccommend it to everyone!
159448385X|5.0|Having just recently read The Kite Runner, I was very eager to see if this second novel could stand up to the latter.<br /><br />Not only is the story equally captivating, but Khaled Hosseini succeeds in telling a story through the eyes of women as few male authors can.  And through the two women in this story, we learn of the incredible strength that human beings can exhibit.<br /><br />Be prepared to weep, this is a very sad story, with tragedy upon tragedy.  It also affords the reader a unique look, albeit via fiction, at a nation besieged by troubles for over 30 years.<br /><br />It's hard to fathom how Hosseini will be able to top these two masterpieces.  It is my hope that the wait will not be too long!
B0009S8H0I|5.0|Along with TV on the Radio, this band is doing the most interesting work in contemporary music. By turns, it is joyous and melancholy, and consistently emotive throughout. The first time I heard them, I wasn't particularly impressed. After a few listens, they became my favorite band. I rank them among my all time favorite musicians: David Bowie, Television, The Pixies, Ween, and TV on the Radio. Truly musicians' musicians, they are. I've yet to acquire this oop Japanese set with the 4 bonus tracks, but I can attest to beauty and ferocity of the album itself. It makes me glad to be alive.    Seeing them live was a remarkable experience. These guys know how to put on an entertaining show. The entire stadium went BERSERK with adulation for the entire 3 hours! It was quite something to behold.      Here is the review from Pitchfork ...    How did we get here?    Ours is a generation overwhelmed by frustration, unrest, dread, and tragedy. Fear is wholly pervasive in American society, but we manage nonetheless to build our defenses in subtle ways-- we scoff at arbitrary, color-coded \\"threat\\" levels; we receive our information from comedians and laugh at politicians. Upon the turn of the 21st century, we have come to know our isolation well. Our self-imposed solitude renders us politically and spiritually inert, but rather than take steps to heal our emotional and existential wounds, we have chosen to revel in them. We consume the affected martyrdom of our purported idols and spit it back in mocking defiance. We forget that \\"emo\\" was once derived from emotion, and that in our buying and selling of personal pain, or the cynical approximation of it, we feel nothing.    We are not the first, or the last, to be confronted with this dilemma. David Byrne famously asked a variation on the question that opens this review, and in doing so suggested a type of universal disaffection synonymous with drowning. And so The Arcade Fire asks the question again, but with a crucial distinction: The pain of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne, the enigmatic husband-and-wife songwriting force behind the band, is not merely metaphorical, nor is it defeatist. They tread water in Byrne's ambivalence because they have known real, blinding pain, and they have overcome it in a way that is both tangible and accessible. Their search for salvation in the midst of real chaos is ours; their eventual catharsis is part of our continual enlightenment.    The years leading up to the recording of Funeral were marked with death. Chassagne's grandmother passed away in June of 2003, Butler's grandfather in March of 2004, and bandmate Richard Parry's aunt the following month. These songs demonstrate a collective subliminal recognition of the powerful but oddly distanced pain that follows the death of an aging loved one. Funeral evokes sickness and death, but also understanding and renewal; childlike mystification, but also the impending coldness of maturity. The recurring motif of a non-specific \\"neighborhood\\" suggests the supportive bonds of family and community, but most of its lyrical imagery is overpoweringly desolate.    \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" is a sumptuously theatrical opener-- the gentle hum of an organ, undulating strings, and repetition of a simple piano figure suggest the discreet unveiling of an epic. Butler, in a bold voice that wavers with the force of raw, unspoken emotion, introduces his neighborhood. The scene is tragic: As a young man's parents weep in the next room, he secretly escapes to meet his girlfriend in the town square, where they naively plan an \\"adult\\" future that, in the haze of adolescence, is barely comprehensible to them. Their only respite from their shared uncertainty and remoteness exists in the memories of friends and parents.    The following songs draw upon the tone and sentiment of \\"Tunnels\\" as an abstract mission statement. The conventionally rock-oriented \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" is a second-hand account of one individual's struggle to overcome an introverted sense of suicidal desperation. The lyrics superficially suggest a theme of middle-class alienation, but avoid literal allusion to a suburban wasteland-- one defining characteristic of the album, in fact, is the all-encompassing scope of its conceptual neighborhoods. The urban clatter of Butler's adopted hometown of Montreal can be felt in the foreboding streetlights and shadows of \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\", while Chassagne's evocative illustration of her homeland (on \\"Haiti\\", the country her parents fled in the 1960s) is both distantly exotic and starkly violent, perfectly evoking a nation in turmoil.    \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" is a shimmering, audacious anthem that combines a driving pop beat, ominous guitar assault, and sprightly glockenspiel decoration into a passionate, fist-pumping album manifesto. The fluidity of the song's construction is mesmerizing, and the cohesion of Butler's poignant assertion of exasperation (\\"I went out into the night/ I went out to pick a fight with anyone\\") and his emotional call to arms (\\"The power's out in the heart of man/ Take it from your heart/ Put it in your hand\\"), distinguishes the song as the album's towering centerpiece.    Even in its darkest moments, Funeral exudes an empowering positivity. Slow-burning ballad \\"Crown of Love\\" is an expression of lovesick guilt that perpetually crescendos until the track unexpectedly explodes into a dance section, still soaked in the melodrama of weeping strings; the song's psychological despair gives way to a purely physical catharsis. The anthemic momentum of \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" counterbalances Butler's plaintive appeal for survival at death's door, and there is liberation in his admittance of life's inevitable transience. \\"In the Backseat\\" explores a common phenomenon-- a love of backseat window-gazing, inextricably linked to an intense fear of driving-- that ultimately suggests a conclusive optimism through ongoing self-examination. \\"I've been learning to drive my whole life,\\" Chassagne sings, as the album's acoustic majesty finally recedes and relinquishes.    So long as we're unable or unwilling to fully recognize the healing aspect of embracing honest emotion in popular music, we will always approach the sincerity of an album like Funeral from a clinical distance. Still, that it's so easy to embrace this album's operatic proclamation of love and redemption speaks to the scope of The Arcade Fire's vision. It's taken perhaps too long for us to reach this point where an album is at last capable of completely and successfully restoring the tainted phrase \\"emotional\\" to its true origin. Dissecting how we got here now seems unimportant. It's simply comforting to know that we finally have arrived.  - David Moore, September 13, 2004
0385340567|2.0|When I first stumbled across the Jack Reacher series a couple of years ago, they were exhilarating.  The old Reacher was a great anti-hero, a bit ruthless, kind of cold, but eminently likable.  The plots of the first few books were clever, dark, and supremely entertaining.<br /><br />The last two or three books, however, have quickly dropped off in quality and originality.  Reacher has become a cliched cross between Rambo and The Terminator, utterly flawless in his tactics and able to defeat bad guys without breaking a sweat.<br /><br />\\"Nothing To Lose\\" is easily the worst entry in the series.  Even the names of the two towns, Hope and Despair, demonstrate a shocking lack of originality.  In case you couldn't guess, the people in Despair are up to no good, while the people of Hope are angelic and helpful.  And Reacher will - have no doubt - take the bad guys down.<br /><br />There's not a single surprise in the entire book, every key event is either telegraphed in perfect clarity, or simply a deus ex machina to unravel an otherwise unsolvable problem.<br /><br />Lee Child needs to take a holiday from the Jack Reacher assembly line.  We know he can write great, interesting, thrillers.  But what he's been putting out lately has been flat and uninspired.  Maybe it's time to put Reacher away and try something else.  Until he gets back into form, I suggest readers do the same.
0812979656|1.0|If you think your life is miserable, read this book, and you'll realise that you're not doing too bad (or at the very least, everything will appear better once you finally finish this travesty of a novel).     Our book club recently read this as our book of the month. Everyone in the group found it difficult to get through. Although the story has some interesting parts (namely the last paragraph - although few people managed to get that far in the novel), the overwhelming and excruciating verbosity drags the already depressing story (and reader) down even more.     If the Booker Prize is awarded to the novel which wastes the most space on a bookshelf, then The Crap of Small Things is a deserving winner. There can be no other justification for why this novel received such a prestigious award. Do yourself a favour and avoid this novel at ALL COSTS! Alternatively, if you're chasing a painful way in which to waste a major part of your life, then read this novel and enjoy the compelling twists and turns that make this novel a spectacular way to punish yourself for your wrong-doings.    Eight people attended our book club. The average rating was 2/10. Read this book at your own risk.
B000SZLSB2|2.0|I find that James Blunt is a good singer/performer, FOR HIS FANS ONLY.<br /><br />Simultaneously, he's also a complete musical disaster, as singer, performer and/or composer FOR HIS DETRACTORS.<br /><br />By now, I find out that both groups are almost in a draw (I don't consider myself, to be among any of those groups).<br /><br />His songs are either good and simple... Almost all of his songs are!<br />But he's certainly not a 'complete musical disaster'... If he was so, sir Elton John wouldn't have accepted him as support artist in his recent Latin American tour.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|I am clearly in the minority here, I know. But is it me, or can this girl not sing? She really has no voice. Her voice is pleasant, don't get me wrong, but that's about it. The songs here are catchy so that's why this gets a 3 star review from me (for whatever that's worth). Leanne Rimes and Carrie Underwood have much stronger voices and could NAIL these songs in their sleep. I'd rather see Jessica Simpson's album get the rave reviews that this is getting. At least she can sing.
031606792X|4.0|I was not sure if I was going to read this one, I heard it wasn't good and not worth reading cause it just messed with the series.  But I have to say after reading the book, I liked it, not as much as the first three but it wasn't half bad.  I do hope she does write another to just finish out the story.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I love the Doctor Who Series. This is a great DVD set. There is some funny behind the sences information. There is an interview with, Christopher Eccleston, the 9th Doctor and a on set with Billie Piper that is funny. If you like Doctor Who, you will love this set.
B000067J1Y|1.0|This is at least one of the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen. My parents brought it over, and it's the first time I've fallen asleep while they were here in a long time. When I got up my mom yelled at me, because she said I made her stay up and watch that freaky gory dentist movie (The Dentist 2) one time. This movie is supposed to be a comedy and I didn't laugh once. Charlie Sheen is a jackass. I hope his house catches on fire. Jackass #2 from that awful show Two and a Half Man is also in this movie. This piece of crap is selling on amazon for $0.01 and that is way overpriced if you ask me. The best is people left comments like \\"extremely funny\\" and \\"what more could you want?\\" what more I could want is a knife in my penis head instead of ever having to watch just 15 minutes of this again. It even made my dreams suck. I don't remember what I dreamed, but I woke up with a lot of self doubt.
B00000IL67|5.0|Nice to hear some songs from the late past.
0066620996|5.0|I will make this as short and sweet and to the point as possible.  As a business and sales consultant since 1983, I have always recommended excellent books to read to my clients.  Many times I would give them a copy of a particular book.  Once Good to Great came out, I read it through and then went back again with a highlighter.  It turned out I have more yellow than white in this book.<br /><br />Every new client I have taken on since I read the book, receives a copy of Good to Great, if they do not already own one (which is more and more common since it was published).  There are many critical success factors Jim and I agree upon and the number one CSF is you must get the right (great) people, in the right place, on your Bus and quickly remove those that do not belong there.  As Jim Collins says (and I will paraphrase.... \\"People are not the most important asset of a company.  It is having great people on your Bus, in the right place.\\"  I have written other reviews in the past and neglected to write one about Good to Great.  The only reason I can think of for this oversight is this GREAT book with the red cover is so much a part of my daily consulting, I just took it for granted.  STan Barnes
B001O6W9QC|4.0|I don't know how they did it, but this movie avoids all the potential pitfalls and landmines that could have caused it to fail miserably - A wacky plot, over-the-top acting, offensive material etc. etc. Yet it totally succeeds, having many very, very funny moments and an unusual mix of clever dialogue and low brow slapstick humor. Very enjoyable.

0553381687|5.0|In spite of its extreme patriarchical viewpoint (women have literally NO power in this world -- making medieval England look mild by comparison.) this is such a good and well-written book I have to love it anyway.<br /><br />It's hard to find something that hasn't already been said about this novel. It's gritty, it's violent, it's dark. And every one of those things adds to the realism and depth of this novel.<br /><br />Bad things, very bad things, happen to good people. I don't think it resembles that much the War of the Roses, though. Martin may have started there but he's veered very far from that starting place so I suggest not reading for any possible historical references. Instead he has created his own very fully realized world.
B001GKJ2DO|3.0|I hadn't intended to waste time watching this. (Meryl Streep in a musical? Gimme a break.) But my wife wanted to see it so I joined her. And I have to say I was more or less pleasantly surprised. No one had told me this was the \\"ABBA musical.\\" The plot, as befits a musical, is pretty simple. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of an American hotel-owner on one of the Greek islands, is about to be married. Her mother, Donna (Streep), was a hippie chick back in her youth, sleeping with whomever she liked whenever she pleased, and when she got pregnant her own parents barred her from returning. She's not even sure which of three different guys is the baby's father. But Sophie has found mama's diary and culled the three names, and has invited all three now middle-aged potential fathers to the wedding. So Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgaard turn up and the games begin. It's all lighthearted and fun, but the real enjoyment for me was in the fact that every single number is an old ABBA tune, from \\"Chiquita\\" and \\"Slipping through My Fingers\\" through the boisterous production number, \\"Dancing Queen.\\" It's also a relief to know that even I am a better singer than Pierce Brosnan. There's not a lot of the actor-character chemistry necessary to hold a successful musical together (think John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John), but it's worth watching for the music. Once, anyway.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|Dear Bruce:  How can such a crew of sound engineering and mixing experts (Brendan O'Brien,Toby Scott and Bob Ludwig) come up with such murky, wooden, screechy, thin and unmusical sound for The Rising, D&D, Magic (one of the worst sounding cds ever recorded) and Working On A Dream. The record would be better if is sounded like music, not sludge. THIS IS NOT WALL OF SOUND. This is bad sound. Please, please--Bruce. Buy a good stereo (I know you can afford it and I also know that you cannot possibly own one) and play your last 4 studio cds. Then play Tunnel of Love, Human Touch, Lucky Town and especially, one of the greatest sounding albums of the last 30 years, Darkness on the Edge of Town. Well???  Please make your music sound like music. I know you and the band are playing musical instruments underneath all that super-compressed polluted sludge. Listen to any record by Dylan, Van Morrison, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Jackson Browne and numerous other artists of your generation and the generation before ---their albums over the past decades continue to sound uniformly musical. You got the chops, you got the band, you got the music, let it out--let's hear it.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is one our my favorite movies, had a black & white VCR version of it so we got this colorized DVD for our daughter for Xmas. It is wonderful!  I did not think I would like the colorized version of this classic, some things are better left the way they were, but I was wrong!  The color is great, especially the parade scenes, and what a nice treat to see how things really looked when they were making the movie instead of just in black and white!  Highly recommend this to all fans of this movie, you won't be disappointed!!
B000FGGE6I|5.0|I watched the movie many times and find it very engaging.  The action scenes are as expected (futuristic) and the theme is understandible and makes sense.  The touching part is the bond Ultraviolet develops with the child named 6.  The music is very complementary to the action.  The whole movie flows beautifully.
0205313426|5.0|This has been my favorite and most trusted reference for more years than I care to admit.  My paperback copy was falling apart, held together by rubberbands.  This book is timeless, the best, and I'm glad to have another sturdier copy which will last me the rest of my career.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|[[VIDEOID:31117281]]I totally enjoy this cd and here is my video review.
B001J53X9U|5.0|I bought the limited edition because of the nice reproduction of this cool motorcycle that Batman is using in the movie. The little extra is worth it if you are into Batman and comics related collectibles. Anyway, the movie is amazing and a must have in blu-ray!!
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Being a long time McCartney fan, I was at first a bit apprehensive about purchasing this CD - I like McCartney's style, including most of his classical work, but I was not sure what to expect.  Needless to say, I was most pleasantly surprised at the musicality of the entire work.  I guess I expected a lot more experimental music here, and while you can observe Macca stepping out of his comfort zone, he never gives up his tune-smithing for the sake of just making noise.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed \\"Highway\\" and \\"Light from your lighthouse\\".  I was encouraged to purchase this CD after listening to the samples of each track on Amazon's site (thank you, Amazon.com!), and I am so glad I took the plunge.  The CD continues to grow on me, and I would recommend it to both longtime Macca fans and those new to his music.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I am happy about the quickness of the delivery.  The video was for my grandson and was in very good condition.  I made a mistake on my daughter's address and sent in a correction and there still was no delay in sending the product to the right address.  Thank you
B000FS9FCG|4.0|This movie is a chilling portrait of what may happen in the not-too-distant future in a society that gives up its liberty for the assurance that it will be \\"safe\\".  It shows how corrupt politicians can use false-flag attacks to force the population to kowtow to them and give up liberties under the pretense of gaining safety and security, when really what is gained is slavery.  This is a highly stylized story that tells a cautionary tale to all of us.  Be careful what you believe - things may not be all they appear.  Entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time.  For Sci-fi fans and fans of the novels of Huxley and Orwell, it is a thumbs up.
045122499X|4.0|I had a hard time getting into this this one at first, because of all the medieval names, the complex family relationships and the organization of medieval society. However, after drawing myself the family trees and connecting who's-who, I got into the book completely. It's a very entertaining story of life in medieval times during the 1300's. Not since \\"Robin Hood\\", this neglected genre of adventure tale seems to have been rediscovered by Follet.    Follet reminds me of John Jakes, because he isn't afraid go all the way, describing the smelly and bodily facts of real life. Like Jakes, he is able to very convincingly describe how people think and their motivations, from the perspectives of both men and women. He's a great story teller.    Follet has a passion for architecture, especially churches and cathedrals. Through this book, and \\"Pillars\\", we get a sense of how it may have been like to be a medieval architect and builder. Engineers (which I am) and architects should especially like this book. It's not very often that we read books describing people working in construction who have such exciting lives!
B001N26GFM|4.0|The only way to ensure we can evolve past such outright hatred and prejudice is to take a journey to such horrible realities in history; what better way to travel than that of cinema.  We follow an innocent 8 year old boy that just wants what all boys want at that age, to have a friend to play with.  His father is promoted and he and his family move to a home in the country.  He is lonely and he happens upon this other boy his age wearing strange pajamas who is confined by a large wire fence.  The beauty of this movie is how truthful it is that children see other children as automatic friends.      This film is a very thought provoking film and I strongly recommend it.  I do caution that the content is disturbing on so many levels as is the actual events within the history of WWII and concentration camps.

B0017R5UAA|2.0|This album would be great, dandy - beautiful even - if it wasn't completely saturated and dripping in completely unnecessary reverb. The reverb on this album makes My Morning Jacket sound like they're playing in a 6-year-old's blanket fortress. Were the songs thinking beings, they would be forever crying for simple, naked, analog-style mastering. Man, I would love this album if I could differentiate the voices and parts...it would be like neo-folk rock: retaining all the good elements of '60s folk greats (like CSNY) and improving upon them with even more beautiful melodies, complex structures, and diverse instrumentation. As it is, it's just mud with occasional hints at something pretty.    Also, I love how they cropped a Bruegel painting, slapped it on their record, and got \\"album cover of the year\\" from some music blogs.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|I greatly anticipated this movie because my husband's great uncle became very wealthy around this same time period participating in the Los Angeles turn-of-the-century oil boom,(he owned Wilshire Oil, Polly Gas and a few others)so I was looking forward to a broader view of the zeitgeist of the era.  Instead the focus was on the power struggle of two polar opposite individuals, neither being - to me - very likeable.<br /><br />The title refers to the inevitible (and surprising!) clash between these two men, but I guess I just missed the whole point of the movie.  While there were some fairly good moments (like the oil well eruption), I found myself looking at the clock waiting for the end.  Afterwards, I just couldn't figure out what all the hoopla was about.<br /><br />For me, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" should have been retitled \\"There Will Be Dud\\".  (D'oh...sorry, I couldn't resist.)
B00003CX9W|2.0|Arrived in poor condition, the dvd case was smashed, and broken into pieces. I have ordered many dvd's in the mail, and the senders usually use the same packaging: a padded envelope. This sender also used a padded envelope, so it may have been broken before it was shipped.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|I was psyched when a friend loaned this to me -- I'd read a lot about the series and was looking forward to checking it out. Sadly, I was bored to tears before I got to the second disc, and quite halfway through that one. It was just dull -- badly written, badly paced, poorly acted. In particular, the central character of Jack Harkness is played with one of the worst Brits-doing-an-American accent performances I've ever seen, a stiff, unconvincing, pale imitation of Tom Cruise-ish macho cool... Which is weird since Great Britain has no shortage of fine actors who are perfectly capable of doing spot-on Americanisms. Anyway, this series is not very good -- the sci-fi concepts, such as they are, can be seen in much more engaging versions in almost any other medium -- movies, tv, books, comics, you name it. This was disappointing and rinky-dink... not worth your time, really. (Axton)
1401300529|5.0|This book has a great balance between education and entertainment.     It covers everything from the political background to personal histories.    Comprehensive but focuses on key elements to paint a broader picture.    well-written and fascinating insights.
B001JRB16U|4.0|One of Disney's very best musicals, Mary Poppins is an unforgettable children's classic. It combines memorable songs that get stuck in your head with the forward and sarcastic dialogue of the unsurpassable Poppins, and a psychedelic story that employs superbly integrated traditionally animated characters. Part fairy tale, part daydream, and all magic, the sights, songs and laughs propel this Academy Award-winning picture (Andrews took home the Oscar for Best Actress, and the film was nominated for a whopping 13 golden boys - the most of any Disney film) to the top of the lists for the greatest family films ever made.<br /><br />The story begins with Bert (Dick Van Dyke) playing the role of guide and narrator, ushering the viewer to the home at 17 Cherry Tree Lane (as if inexperienced in the technique, the camera cuts on several occasions during the trip, taking the viewer out of the notion of following Bert). The sixth nanny in four months is about to dash out the door, upset at the constantly preoccupied Winifred Banks and her two misbehaving children who have once again gone missing. When Mr. George Banks (David Tomlinson) comes home, he's furious at the disorder, blames the kids and his wife, and insists upon personally hiring the next nanny. The two children, Jane and Michael, create their own list of requirements for the prospective woman, but George scoffs and throws the paper into the fireplace.<br /><br />The following morning, dozens of elderly ladies line the front yard, waiting for an interview for the newly open position. But with a powerful gust of wind, the lot of them is replaced by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), who descends from the clouds with her umbrella and carpetbag and, mysteriously, the children's list of preferences. Banks is all seriousness and professionalism, but he's no match for the tricky verbal wizardry of Poppins, who not only hires herself, but initially agrees only to a trial run. After dismissing the befuddled man of the house, she slides up the staircase (in a peculiarly reverse Exorcist-like manner) to meet the children, and unpack her empty carpetbag (pulling out a hat rack, mirror, lamp and more).<br /><br />Poppins uses magic and singing (starting off with the very famous \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\" song) to tidy up their room (tables, toys and doors all flap about in another playful scene reminiscent of The Exorcist), and the trio departs for the park. There they meet Bert, who is creating chalk masterpieces on the sidewalk, and with a little more magical help from Mary Poppins, embark on a fun-filled adventure into his artwork - firstly on a jolly holiday in a picturesque English countryside (the kids are curiously absent for the first two lengthy sequences with dancing penguins and barnyard animals) which segues into a merry-go-round horse ride through the park that transforms into a fox hunt and then a derby.<br /><br />At first it seems that practically perfect (and rather vain) Mary Poppins is there to straighten out the wily kids; as the film progresses it's evident that Mr. and Mrs. Banks are the ones she's there to fix; George is a well-ordered man absorbed with his work, and rarely has time for his children and their unseemly hullabaloo (or the sugary female thinking of his wife), while Winifred is leading women's rights movements - an act contrary to her subservient attitude toward her husband.<br /><br />A cheerful creativity surrounds the whole film, from the laugh-filled tea party on the ceiling of Uncle Albert's home, to the senile but punctual admiral who commands a ship atop his house, to the tongue-twisting silliness of \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\\" The songs are some of the best in any of Disney's films, the mixing of traditional animation with the live action characters is fantastic, and Andrews' performance is (spit) spot-on. Although the running time is noticeably lengthy for a family film (the following year's The Sound of Music was, of course, even longer) and the scripting of Poppins changed drastically from the original story by P.L. Travers (for the better), it is one of the most memorable and delightful musicals from Walt Disney - one that hasn't aged and remains universally entertaining.<br /><br />- Mike Massietically from the original story by P.L. Travers (for the better), it is one of the most memorable and delightful musicals from Walt Disney - one that hasn't aged and remains universally entertaining.     - Mike Massie

B000JLQSW4|4.0|Continuing to elaborate what would be one of the more expansive ranges of pop as it entered the electronic age, Parson's sophomore release is a delightful and sometimes eerie retro-future celebration where masterful pop songcraft collides with expert, unpretentiously innovative production.

006135323X|5.0|My review title insinuates that these two books are of the same premise--which is certainly not the case.  However, in that they both look to prove economic and social hypothesis with controlled studies, they are similar.    Predictably Irrational is a great read and drives miles to illustrate just how easily we allow ourselves to be steered and mislead in life.  For example, we really do drink 4 dollar coffee just because of the fancy packaging! That's completely irrational.  However, there are hundreds more examples that lead us to predict we will fall prey to that irrationality again and again...and again!  The author chooses his language carefully to maximize understanding for the audience.  Anyone who picks up this book can easily comprehend the arguments, experiments and outcomes--but still leaves room for the busy brain to extrapolate the results further.  I have been recommending this book to everyone I see in the past couple weeks.  It's one of the few books that will become \\"required reading\\" for my employees.
0312383320|5.0|EXCELLENT!!  This was not a small 'between the numbers book'  it was more like a the regular 'numbers' book.  Too funny.
0312383320|3.0|I'm a big fan of Ms. Evanovich's Plum books, both \\"numbered\\" and \\"between the numbers.\\"  Plum Spooky won't rank in my top five, but it was a fun read. In this economy, I was happy to escape to a world of complete silliness.  Carl the monkey amused me, I admit.  And Deisel is always fun to watch.  Only an established, mega-author like Janet Evanovich could meld three genres (romance, paranormal, mystery) into one book - frankly, I think it makes a good mix. I wish more books could straddle the category shelves in a bookstore.<br /><br />One thing?  There's no self service gas in NJ so the argument over who is going to pump gas didn't work!
B001ED7C58|3.0|I went to see the film with my daughter, having never read the book. Film was kind of fun. Read the book, loved it. Bought the soundtrack. Went to see the film again to see better how it compared to the book (and to really get to watch the film without someone giggling behind me), and to my amazement found that the Robert Pattinson song was clear and crisp in the film, but mumbled so badly on the soundtrack CD that I had to look up the words online to find out the lyrics. If I am not mistaken, I think I also heard Pattinson sing another song in the film (that would make two total) that is not on this CD. I could be wrong on that, but I don't think so.     Some of the songs are pretty good, but I think the CD is poorly produced in and of itself. Too bad one cannot buy a clearer version.

1600243916|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. Gladwell, in his own way, describes that succes doesn't come to anyone just like that. He takes very far fetched examples and makes it clear cut that it all seems to be connected. And it is. The implications on what he writes however go further then what he defines. If you open your mind to it, it seems there is so much we never thought about out there.     He does however in the end go on and on with maybe a little too much detail. This book (or audio book as I listened to it) is also not for the clear cut people. You need to be able to make links between examples you normally don't. It doesn't give a how too guid or clear cut examples. Only people able to have their own ideas and not need others to explain it all in detail will be able to understand his line of thought.
0385339682|3.0|I usually adore Grisham.  To me, he's the king of plot.  But this one is a bit disappointing.  The rhythm is sometimes painfully slow --even if we are in a small town here-- and the writing almost static.  The fact that the book is presented as a thriller is not helping.  Whoever handles the promotion of this novel, please don't try to full the reader!  Grisham readers are not stupid, and this is a far cry from a thriller.  The chronicles of a small town would be a better definition.  Any small town. I live in a Northern small town, Clarion, which in many ways resembles Grisham's Southern Clanton --and not just for all the letters the two towns have in common.  There is no better background to describe the human condition, which Grisham attempts to do.  I do appreciate the Balzacian efforts, but all along the reading, I felt that Grisham was not totally comfortable in this territory.  Still, he's the author of A PAINTED HOUSE, a brilliant novel in my view.  So what went wrong here?

B001230JXC|5.0|One of the most influential bands to come out of the eighties, no one has ever quite equaled their mix of electronic, synthesizers, and guitars. This particular album was the culmination of a direction they had been heading since Black Celebration, and I believe it was Martin Gore, Alan Wilder and Flood's master piece. The B sides on the singles from this album were particularly spectacular, including remixes and possibly some material that may even transcend the official album - and they are almost all on this digital download.<br /><br />This is a particular steal considering you get the remastered versions plus all the B side singles, as the first reviewer stated. This is a great introduction at a great price to some of the best material Depeche Mode ever produced.
B000093FLA|4.0|dvd was in faircondition, had some problems starting the movie but after that is ok
B00104W8T6|4.0|I haven't seen the movie \\"Juno,\\"  and barely know the outlines of its plot, but keep bumping into it because of the continued and overwhelming attraction its music has to girls in my son's high school. Every time they get the chance, they pull out a guitar or two and sing one of the film's signature songs, like \\"Anyone Else but You.\\" Hear these infectious and lilting tunes a couple of times and you start to wonder about the movie that made them so popular.<br /><br />The songs on the album all sound (deceptively, it turns out) like they could be written and sung by ordinary kids on a slow afternoon after school. The music is simple, mostly acoustic, and has the unmade-up attractiveness of a freckly teenager. But some of the selections here are hoary indeed. Mott the Hoople's \\"All the Young Dudes\\" was pulled from the dusty back shelf of 1972. And The Kinks' \\"A Well Respected Man\\" -- from way back in 1966 -- really is reaching. But these old tunes, in the context of the album's artless strumming, sound fresh and relevant. An exception is the Sonic Youth's deliberately creepy and riveting and remake of the Carpenter's \\"Superstar.\\" It's easily the eeriest piece on an otherwise sweet album.<br /><br />The Juno soundtrack is full of seemingly innocuous, but complex and evocative music. I have to see the movie, to see how closely the images in my head match the story.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|I swear I'm becoming a fan of these types of films!     Once the whiners finish with their laundry list of \\"Why I didn't like's\\", what we are left with is a reasonably decent remake of the obviously dated but campy Corman original. Corman also had a hand in making this one, as well, so it's no wonder the film comes off the way it does.    I'm not one for Jason Statham (he's just too UGLY), but he does well in action flicks. He plays well off the other principles even for a guy with as sparse dialog as Statham had.    The story is spare as is necessary for action films of this type, but not totally lost amidst the carnage, I think the real stars are the cars. It's one of the few (VERY few) times that guns were bolted to cars in a semi-believable manner. I also liked the nice touch of bringing back David Carradine to reprise his role as the original Frankenstein at the start of the film, even if it was only a voice-over.    There are so many things in this film that cannot be taken seriously by ANY measure, but the film IS exciting. So it doesn't have a story, the characters are two-dimensional, the premise is TOTALLY unbelievable, but hey, the death and destruction are more than just on-par. I mean, you have to admit, there are some pretty unique and novel ways to die in this film.    Blood, guts and carnage. I'm popping some popcorn and am going to sit back and watch \\"Death Race\\". I've paid my $99.00 for stage one!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Movie - 4.5    I first saw the movie in theaters with zero expectations. I never followed the comics, let alone pay any attention to the fact that Robert Downey Jr. was starring in the lead role. Thank goodness that happened, because I was blown away by the end. The whole guilt and redemption angle on the character of Tony Stark struck a very deep resonance with me, as I'm a big fan of \\"comeback\\" stories where the protagonist falls so far off his high horse, only to realize his mistakes, then use those events as a learning tool and lead himself to do greater good. Nowadays, it's hard to see the good in most people because of how lost we are in the desires and routine ineptitudes of society. More often than not, our lives revolve around either money, sex, or some other kind of self-indulgence. Granted, it's not a bad thing to wanna' be happy, but I thought this particular story put a certain kind of perspective on the corporate and war profiteering elements that exist in today's world. And what better an example of how to explore the truth and consequences of this by having a billionaire weapons manufacturer have a a change in character and try to make a difference from the heart instead of the wallet? I really enjoyed the movie's plot and characters from beginning to end. Downey Jr. plays Stark down to a T, and the supporting cast is fun to watch from Pepper to Rhodie (too bad Howard won't be back, though), even to Jarvis. If anything, my only problem is the lack in depth of a true supervillain. While Jeff Bridges does a great job as Obidiah Stane, the movie iss missing that extra sense of ambition that really separates the ideals of most bad guys. As a setup movie, however (for the supposed trilogy), I rank this in the upper echelon along Batman Begins as one of my favorites. And if history has dictated anything, it's that the 2nd act of a trilogy has always greatly outdone its predecessor. Can't wait till the next one comes out.    Video - 5.0    Colors are very vibrant from skin tones to backgrounds to all the shiny versions of the Iron Man suits. Paramount has done a spectacular job on the transfer, making this instant demo material for friends, family, or business alike. In particular, the cave break and liberation of Gulmira (including the jet chase) scenes are worth watching over and over again just for the flashy lights and sleek cinematography. Black levels handle extremely well during cave, night, and other dimly-lit scenes keeping most, if not all, kinds of object detail looking crisp and sharp. Contrast is equally suiting and really helps the overall photography adding a complimentary sense of depth and dimensionality between people, objects, and backgrounds. The only slight problem one might have is with the darker cave scene. They used a different camera for those shots resulting in a slightly noisier presentation, which is what happens on a normal basis with darker shots anyway, but that's about the only possible imperfection and may not even effect your own personal score if you're not being picky. But other than that, show off your Blu-ray setup with this movie.    Audio - 5.0    Accompanying the flawless video transfer is an equally flawless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track. Ramin Djwadi's score, while a tad underwhelming composition-wise, is displaced well-enough to help create just the right amount of immersion for each scene, and dialogue is clear through the center channel. Directionality and separation are especially notable during scenes of gunfire or jet-propelled flight. Again, refer to the cave break and liberation of Gulmira with the jet chase to hear what I'm talking about. Maybe even thrown in the Mk. II's test flight for good measure. LFEs are astounding in terms of bass depth and other low frequency presence. I personally like to use Stark's takeoff to Gulmira and jump into supersonic speed during his run from the F-22s as go-to showcase material. So make sure your theater system has all the right settings, then crank that baby up to wow your guests.    Extras - 5.0    Thanks in big part to the hours of extras on both the feature and additional 25GB disc, I actually learned quite a bit of informative things about the Iron Man franchise as a whole and the respectable hard work that went into producing this summer blockbuster. Ironically enough, I now see Iron Man as a sort of Marvel parallel to DC's Batman, only with less of the dark psychology and grimness involved with Bruce Wayne's tragic childhood. On top of being presented completely in HD, the special features are loads of fun to watch in themselves, and I don't think I've ever been as thoroughly entertained by just the making of portion. If you like the movie, you'll really like these extras.    Overall - 5.0    For a setup of an eventual trilogy, I rank this as the top tier with Batman Begins as the other best of its kind. The characters and script are highly entertaining, and the story has just the right amount of depth to bring about my empathy. Throw in the demo quality video and audio and a largely informative array of special features, and you've got yourself one of the years best Blu-ray packages. A must own for comic book fans.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This \\"Ultimate Edition\\" is a fitting homage to the 1979 release of George Romero's second zombie film, Dawn of the Dead, a film which \\"expands upon\\" rather than supersedes his previous effort, Night of the Living Dead. In this pre-digital film, we are treated to the latest analog gore. I remember first seeing it at its first release, sinking into my seat and cringing at the gore. At the same time, the deadpan humor and heavy irony keep the brain cells alive.    What I notice now is the dramatically different style Romero uses in DD compared to NLD. Eschewing the documentary style of NLD, DD is much more conventional in its cinematography. However, as noted in the generous commentaries, Romero was developing his ideas through fast \\"cutting\\" (the old montage approach). NLD is, in my opinion, spookier, while DD is more of an \\"in your face\\" experience.    So, no digital effects, no outrageously flying bodies or weapons, no bodily transformations...just old-fashioned \\"down-to-earth\\" gore. The commentaries -- by Romero, producers, and actors -- are fun and informative. In the end, this DVD release provides a rich context to appreciating DD as an important juncture in film history and, perhaps, as an important cultural event.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|This was one of the first blu ray discs I got when I got my HD television. I've been watching this movie since it came out. I've probably seen it 30 times over the years. The step up from DVD to blu ray is as pronounced as the DVD was from the VHS recording off of television. The picture on this new transfer is stunning. By now I've seen enough HD sources to know that this stands out in the crowd. You can almost reach out and touch the Overlook. It's like you're inside the hotel. The sharpness and detail and quality of the light blew my mind.
1439102813|5.0|This is a heart wrenching story, but contains a lot of information about early onset Alzheimers.  The story is fiction, but was well researched by the author.  A great read!
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I loved Batman Begins, so I was eagerly anticipating seeing The Dark Knight! Especially given all the hype it received.     After watching it on DVD, I felt very mixed about it. Heath Ledger was great, he definitely deserves all the praise he got for this role. The main characters are fine as well.     The problems I had with the movie is that it's way too long, for one thing. Dent's character wasn't needed in this series yet. The editing wasn't as good as the first movie in that there were parts that made no sense and should have been cut.     For instance, Gordon fakes his own death to keep his family out of harms way. Nice idea by itself. But then once he's back \\"alive\\" again his family gets taken by Harvey Dent anyway! So much for that plan.     I started to get bored in some places. Again, it was just too long and unfocused for me. It had some great spots, but not enough for me to recommend this as anything better than a so-so movie.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This is my first dive into Ken Follett, and it was an excellent ready.  The book is a great spy novel, and there is very little of what I call \\"down time\\".  Suspenseful at every page turn, it kept me reading deep into the night.
B0019EXZYE|4.0|Movie - 4.0    Something I've always noticed since watching Jason Statham is that the differences between his Hollywood and British movies are very distinct. His Hollywood titles are usually mindless action entertainment fluff, whereas his British (aka BETTER) movies are a lot more dramatic and/or whimsically written. Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch (the only two I've seen) are great, great pieces of film full of quirky characters, plot twists, excellent scripts, and a very dark style of comedy. The Bank Job is a slightly faulted return to form, portraying yet another heist gone bad, but with our protagonists coming out on top at the end. I liked it. As typical of myself and British scripts, I took a liking to the dialogue and subtle frankness that Brits have in their language such as their accents and colloquialisms (I find it funny to call someone a wanker or say the word \\"bollocks\\"). On top of that, the film itself did a very good job of pacing all 3 acts: the setup, the job, and the getaway. Drama and thrills abound in this movie with good writing, decent characters, and a retro feel to the '70s. I was rather impressed by the staging, set designs, and costumes, having been born in the '80s myself, and thus not as familiar with what was. The one complaint I did have, though, was with the tone of the film. Of the 3 British gangster/heist movies I've seen (Lock, Stock, Snatch, and Layer Cake), I found Bank Job to be just a tad lacking in terms of a strong screenplay. Guy Ritchie put a great deal of quirkiness into Lock, Stock and Snatch, while Matthew Vaughn put a lot of grit into Layer Cake. However, I simply felt Bank Job fell short of this by not putting enough emphasis on any particular aspect of the story or characters. But regardless, it's still a very good movie for what they had to work with (being based on a true story and all).    Video - 4.0    What a strange and fickle job of cinematography. I saw so many instances of reference video, but then other scenes would be too high in contrast or too saturated in hue. It's a good transfer, don't get me wrong. It's just a damn inconsistent one from shot to shot at times. Black levels are solid, and there's very little, if any grain present from what I saw. Sharpness is pretty high quality as well, but getting back to those contrast and hue problems, it had a tendency to make skin tones look a bit smudgy every now and then. But some up close shots were amazingly detailed. It was so clear you could see every line, wrinkle, and pore in a person's face as if they were standing right in front of you. Too bad it just didn't stay that way the entire time.    Audio - 4.5    Being a drama, dialogue takes up a majority of the sound stage. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well discrete sound effects and music were placed throughout the entire length of the film in this DTS-HD 7.1 track. The side and rear speakers actually had quite a bit of directionality in terms of very subtle dings, taps, and other various background noises, which may seem like overkill for a drama, but impressive, nonetheless. Overall sound is very crisp, and I'd even say it's just short of demo'ing a 7.1 setup. I subtract that extra half point because, well, dramas aren't really demo quality material anyway. Great effort by Lionsgate, though.    Extras - 2.5    Only two segments are presented in widescreen SD, one about production of the movie, the other about the actual story. They're interesting to a degree, but hardly worth watching aside for a little trivia.    Overall - 4.0    The Bank Job is a very good heist movie that better showcases the acting abilities of Jason Statham. It's not quite on par with other titles branching from the Guy Ritchie/Matthew Vaughn mold, but there's enough drama, thrills, and even some sensuality in this particular one to keep you entertained if you're looking for a refreshing change of pace to get the absurdities of Transporter 2 or Crank out of your head. The video is a bit finicky, but the audio is excellent, making The Bank Job a solid recommendation for heist/thriller fans.
B00005JPKE|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A movie essentially without blemish, Letters from Iwo Jima is not only far superior to Flags of Our Fathers but a great war movie in its own right that portrays World War II much differently than most movies do and is all the better for it; with a fine sense of tactics and deft direction from Clint Eastwood, Letters from Iwo Jima is a stellar film.
B000EULJLU|5.0|My cousin once described the boys in Tool as being \\"off in their own little world.\\"  And while this can be seen in any of their albums, it is never more true than in 10,000 Days.<br /><br />The album starts off strong with \\"Vicarious\\" as the band shows its metal side.  It features the syncopated (off-beat) rhythm Tool is known for and gives you something you can rock you head to.<br /><br />The next song is my least favorite on the album.  I still like it, but ever album seams to need to have at least one song I just don't care for.  The rhythm moves a little too fast for me, and the syncopation is just a bit more than  I can take.  Still, it is one of only two or three Tool songs I've heard played on the radio and my brother maintains that it's their best so- to each his own I guess.<br /><br />The next two are part one and two of \\"Wings for Marie\\" and together they clock in at 17:25 making them easily the longest song on any Tool album.  At first I didn't really like these two, but they grew on me.  Part 1, \\"Wings for Marie\\", starts with about a minute of a quiet, building guitar riff.  The bass (possibly a keyboard) comes in with the low tones that drive the rest of the two parts.  As with most of Tool's work, the depth and open-endedness of the lyrics is pinnacle of this song and all the others for that matter:  \\"Feigning all the trials and the Tribulations, none of us have actually been there.  Not like you.\\"  I'll admit, the songs on 10,000 days are a little easier to interpret then on Lateralus, but that in no way diminishes their beauty and intelligence.<br /><br />Now we're on \\"The Pot.\\"  Maybe it's a drug reference, maybe a reference to the old saying \\"The pot calling the kettle black.\\"  Having heard it a couple dozen times, I can tell you, it's probably both.  Interesting delay on the vocals which are almost unnoticeable without listening carefully through headphones.  Great lyrics once again: \\"Liar, Lawyer, Mirror, Foyer.  What's the difference.\\"<br /><br />One of Tools' trademark \\"filler\\" songs, Lipan Conjuring is actually quite enjoyable to listen to.  This is one of those songs I still have no idea what the meaning is... or if there is a meaning at all...<br /><br />The next pair is of \\"the conversation song\\", Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann), and Rosetta Stoned.  Easily the funniest song title on the album, whether that's good or bad I don't know, but despite the humorous lyrics: \\"a slow-mo matrix descent,\\" I interpret this song as being a very serious message about the influence of media on our culture, like \\"Vicarious.\\"  Or possibly, the message is people who do drugs are funny, I'm not sure once again.<br /><br />As the album winds down, the somewhat conjoined songs \\"Intention\\", \\"Right in Two\\", and \\"Viginti Tres\\" finish off another of Tools' masterpieces.  Much more mellow than the other songs, these seam to feature a progression of humanity from the beginning on time (whenever that is).  A unique guitar riff and industrial drums coupled with a Tabla-like instrument (Indian Drums) make this my favorite of the three.  And, despite being mostly ambient, Viginti Tres has a lot of creative value to it.<br /><br />Last of all, I would like to mention the album art.  Tool, in keeping with its tradition of having amazing and unique packaging for their albums, included a built-in stereopticon.  This is an instrument from the mid 1800s that makes a 3-D images from two, slightly different images.  The pictures included are pretty weird, like the rest of Tool's art, but it is fun to look at and completely unique.<br /><br />If you are a Tool fan, or not, \\"10,000 Days\\" is a must-have.  Even if you just get it to look at the packaging.gs, Lipan Conjuring is actually quite enjoyable to listen to.

B000N4SADC|5.0|A true fusion album in the best sense of the word, even more - it's almost an instrumental progressive rock album, containing extremely complex, tight group interplay, over some real killer meters and progressions. Reminds me of the best moments of Return To Forever, Mahavishnu, King Crimson and Yes. Like those guys, Hiromi has the chops of steel and then some. The compositions have a tendency to move along in weird, unpredictable directions, making this an exciting listen - you just never know what's around the bend, something might just drop on your head. On the other hand, there is enough thematic material to latch onto, and make the pieces memorable.     Hiromi is equally at home on the piano or the synths, which she uses with taste and humor (think Chick Corea, but a lot more tongue-in-cheek), without over-indulging in solos, which are usually short, intense and quirky. Her jazz solos are breathtaking in precision, expansiveness and expressiveness. It's definitely a composition-driven, group record.     The backing band is amazing, especially the explosive rhythm section. The guitarist does some interesting things on fretless guitar, which sometimes sounds like an Indian instrument, and other times doing some hot, key-transcending shredding. This may be one the best fusion records of the decade. 10 star effort!
031606792X|5.0|I'll start by saying that I read alot of books, all kinds, but not a big fan of classical literature. But I, like many others, love a good story. The entire saga captivated me(my 16 year old son said I looked like a junkie trying to get a fix)and by the time I read Breaking Dawn I wasn't ready for the end. I hate when people give away a story with a review so I'm not about to do that. What I will say is that, when it comes to a series of books, it all depends on how I feel when it ends. Do I feel like I've been left hanging, waiting for more, or do I feel like I can put it down and tell myself it's over. I don't want it to end but I feel good with how it finished. I loved this entire saga from Twilight to Breaking Dawn.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The Passion of the Christ (2004) is a great movie by Mel Gibson. He personally contributed close to 40 million dollars for this film. It depicts the final twelve hours of Jesus' life. It's a movie with a two hour ordeal of Jesus' torture. It is a must see. If you desire more of Jesus' Passion...
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Movie - 4.5<br /><br />Prior to seeing this reboot I only liked Tim Burton's renditions, but more so for them being Tim Burton movies rather than actual Batman movies. I didn't see Batman Begins in theaters and never even considered watching it till the DVD came out because I was so embarrassed at the debacle that is Joel Shumacher's Batman & Robin (though I will say Forever was decent, despite its inclination for campiness). So I blind-bought this on DVD and was blown away by its epic storytelling, characterization, and wonderful production quality. The story starts out with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a Bhutanese prison meeting a man named to Ducard (Liam Neeson) who works for one Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe), the leader of the League of Shadows. In meeting Ducard, he recruits Wayne and mentors him in the ways of the League, instilling and debating philosophies of good versus evil, the power of will, and the arts of deception and theatricality. In becoming one of their finest students, though, Wayne must complete his rite of passage by taking the life of a man who murdered his neighbor in a territorial dispute. But in being who he is, Wayne decides not to take the man's life, and instead, destroys the League's base of operations. He then returns to his home of Gotham City deciding to transform himself into a symbol of justice to fight crime, protect the innocent, and bring down the corrupt, in which he dawns the masked persona of Batman. And through his initial journey, he's assisted by the likes of his long-trusted butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), an old family friend at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and the one good cop left in Gotham's police force, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman).<br /><br />As many times as it's been done through Batman (or any other kind of comic book/fictional writing, really) what draws me to this film the most is its presentation and symbolism of Bruce Wayne, his inner conflict with himself over the responsibility of his parents' death, his willingness and fortitude to act upon that tragedy, and his continuing efforts to be Batman and live his life for a greater cause by continuing to fight for Gotham City. My favorite aspects of the film are its dark and gloomy atmosphere, the especially wonderful cast, and an extremely well-written script that manages to amaze and inspire for both the characters and overall narrative. For an origins story, I really like how it fills in the gap of Bruce Wayne's time away from home, the lessons he learned, and how it slowly molded him into the eventual persona of the Caped Crusader. In addition to some excellent plot development and character exposition between him and his one-time mentor, I also thought it made for a great climax and clashing of ideals between two similarly-minded people, but with completely different approaches. However, being only an origins story, there's just so much depth one can expose, as this is just the tip of the iceberg until the real meat of the story shows itself in The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Some people say HD-DVD is to blame for the apparently weak presentation seen here on the BD, but I disagree. While it's true HD-DVD does have its technical limitations in terms of disc space and attainable bit rates, their have been some pretty good ports of other films including 300, Blade Runner, The Departed, I Am Legend, The Matrix, or Troy, just to name a few. This transfer for Batman Begins is more a result of video-tinkering from the people at Warner Bros. And after seeing The Dark Knight Trilogy in IMAX, I believe I can now give a more accurate assessment to how this BD faithfully preserves the theatrical presentation. To start, let's talk about detail. From what I saw in the theater and what we're given on the BD, it's not \\"softness\\" in the picture, so much as it is a\\"subdued\\"look. Despite the image not having razor-sharp detail, Wally Pfister's photography is duly represented here and is as sharp as I saw in the theater. Very intricate weaving in the costumes and fine texturing in facial features and skin look excellent.<br /><br />Colors are about as bold as they should be, while blacks are almost perfect. The problem, however, lies in two factors: contrast and saturation. In seeing the SD-DVD, the BD, and the IMAX versions of the film, I've determined that the main color palette is supposed to be somewhere around a \\"Fall, seasonal orange.\\" The IMAX version looked best with a very balanced dose of orange/tan, whereas the BD appears to have a more reddish/pale appearance. And because of the slightly-boosted contrast and de-saturated skin tones, it seems as if everyone is either blushing, coming down with a cold, or just got angry and is trying cooling off. It's not a bad presentation by any means, but I distinctly remember (and admired) the darker, more dreary look the film had in its IMAX presentation. And as a result of the minor tinkering, colors aren't quite as striking, and blacks aren't as deep and inky. Nonetheless, it's a much better job than what they did to The Dark Knight. Unless Nolan just really feels the need to remaster this himself for some kind of anniversary edition down the road, don't let the stigma of \\"HD-DVD port\\" fool you. It's still a pretty good transfer.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1<br />- English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- Japanese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin (Traditional)<br /><br />The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track may not show much in terms of numbers averaging around just under 2Mbps, but the sound quality is deceptively top-notch. Dialogue is clear and never distorts through the center. Everything from the various voices of Bruce Wayne, to his Batman growls, to Lucius Fox's echoes down in R&D, to Dr. Crane's synthesized voice are reproduced perfectly. Separation is stunning from the get-go of the opening sequence with the immersion of bats flapping around, and especially later on during the discovery of the Batcave and breakout at Arkham. The Bhutanese prison fight does a good job of a \\"silence and isolation\\" effect between Wayne's beating up of the prisoners and when Ducard confronts him with the proposal for joining The League of Shadows. Directionality is also well-placed to the rears during action sequences in the form of (more) bats, a scene of rainfall where all the drops are nicely-divided, and of course the final battle sequence on the monorail.<br /><br />The score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard keeps up great pace and mood between all the action and drama, though not nearly to the effect of their work in The Dark Knight, but that's for another review. Low Frequency Effects, by the way (as per the score), are booming. The crackling ice on the frozen lake is the first example of subtle, but good, bass levels, while the Batmobile chase, and the various explosions at the end of the movie all make for reference material with some excellent fidelity and dynamics in oomps and thumps. Part of the difference between what I thought I heard the first time and now, though, lies completely in the newer home theater setup I have. In fact, it makes a big difference in a lot of the movies I watch these days, so make sure you're somewhat up-to-date on your gear. My favorite scenes for reference are any of the bat immersion scenes (opening title, discovery of the Bat Cave, or when he's breaking out of Arkham), the training sequence on the frozen lake (awesome directionality and bass in the ice cracking), and the Batmobile chase (lots of booms and a great chance for the music to shine as well).<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />-The Dark Knight IMAX Prologue (HD; 6:36)<br />Presented in MPEG-2 and Dolby Digital 5.1, this is easily the most attractive feature on the disc. Back when I bought this BD I must've watched the Prologue a good 7 or 8 times before the The Dark Knight even came out in theaters a couple of weeks later; it was that awesome. But yes, fans of the Nolan franchise had every right to be ecstatic, as the movie itself in its entirety is beyond any real description with this being just the opening sequence. And while it was only encoded in MPEG-2, the picture quality actually looks a lot better than what they give us in Begins (then again, it's an IMAX shot with absolutely zero tinkering, outside of the aspect ratio).<br /><br />- In-Movie Experience<br />A rather chopped up Picture-in-Picture commentary that takes most of its content from the other special features and splices them into different parts of the movie. Some of the material is exclusive to this mode, but none of it is really that insightful as a lot of the interview segments are only 1 or 2 minutes apiece on average. The presentation of said material also feels very disjointed, 1) because the audio mixes in and out of the movie's soundtrack going from a 2-channel field for the commentary into the boisterous 5.1 lossless track of the movie (which can be a bit jarring), and 2) there's not even a lot of material in the first place.<br /><br />Topics discussed include: the writing, Liam Neeson's emphasis on scripts, filming in Iceland, a brief interview with Ken Watanabe, the costuming of the opera scene, interviews with Katie Holmes, Tom Wilkinson, another Neeson bit about the sword training, a blurb with Emma Thompson on the ninjas being shorter than Neeson, an interview with Michael Caine about playing Alfred, Nathan Crowley and how he built the Bat Cave, an interview with Rutger Hauer, some character analyses on Lucius Fox, Jim Gordon, Alfred, and Bruce Wayne, an interview with Cillian Murphy and talk about the Scarecrow's mask, how Christian Bale approached the role of Batman, how the music was composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, and a couple of other things I don't care enough to remember. Overall, since Maximum Movie Mode wasn't around at the time I would've liked a full-blown audio commentary instead, as Nolan is very good on those. But the actual special features are still pretty informative about the production itself.<br /><br />Note: The extras menu has everything lined up kind of weird with the \\"Additional Footage\\" being aligned on the left side all by itself for some reason instead of on the right where it should've been. The more important features (outside of the Tankman parody) are straight down the middle. Aside from the Dark Knight Prologue and theatrical trailer, everything else is presented in SD.<br /><br />- Tankman Begins (SD; 5:12)<br />MTV's lame attempt at trying to be funny for their movie awards show thingy starring Jimmy Fallon, Andy Dick, and Jon Heder. A couple of parts are funny, but the rest isn't so much.<br /><br />- The Journey Begins (SD; 14:16)<br />Shows how the concept and story were developed, then eventually written, and how they went about casting. Nolan actually approached Goyer, which I thought was interesting because Goyer said he was set to direct and I never even knew he did (actually, looking at his résumé I see he did Blade: Trinity... Yeah, he's a much better writer, definitely).<br /><br />- Shaping Mind and Body (SD; 12:49)<br />A look at Christian Bale's preparation for the role of Batman. Previously, he had lost 70 lbs. for The Machinist (weighed about 120 at the time), but then had to gain around 100 lbs. back for Batman Begins the following year. He says he took Nolan's words to heart to just \\"gain as much weight as you can,\\" and apparently got a little too plump for the role. But they eventually toned him up by the time filming started. Big props to the guy for dedication, though I'm sure that kind of drastic change in that amount of time won't be good for his health later on.<br /><br />- Gotham City Rises (SD; 12:48)<br />Shows how they made some shots of Gotham City from CG and others from scratch on a studio lot. Nathan Crowley talks in particular about how they built the Bat Cave, Arkham Asylum, and the Narrows from the ground up, which is actually pretty amazing when you consider a couple of those sets were right next to each other.<br /><br />- Cape and Cowl (SD; 8:18)<br />A somewhat short, but informative look at the design of the batsuit by costume designer Lindy Hemming, who I'm just now noticing worked on a handful of James Bond movies (good for her!). In particular, she mentions how she wanted to make the suit more mobile in the neck and head area so as not to give it an awkward turning motion like previous the Batman suits had.<br /><br />- Batman - The Tumbler (SD; 13:40)<br />A very interesting look at the Tumbler/Batmobile. It's pretty cool that they also built this from scratch after initially going though a few different designs in Christopher Nolan's garage. This feature focuses a lot on the actual design, mechanics, and practicality of the Tumbler itself and how they were able to get some great shots of it for the car chase sequence thanks to the amazing talents of stunt driver Chris Cottle.<br /><br />- Path to Discovery (SD; 14:13)<br />Covers the filming in Iceland. This was actually around the beginning of filming and, interestingly enough, they had to shoot the training sequence on the frozen lake almost immediately because the ice was supposed to melt pretty soon after their arrival. And from the looks of the terrain, it's pretty amazing they got what they did with so little time to prepare.<br /><br />- Saving Gotham City (SD; 13:01)<br />Shows the work they put into the final battle sequence on the monorail and how they wanted to make it look as real as possible with very little CG. The fight between Bale and Neeson was just the two of them with no stuntmen and really goes to emphasize the personal touch they wanted to put on it by getting the timing right. The derailment and explosion of the train itself was a miniature, and they show a few different angles of those shots.<br /><br />- Genesis of the Bat (SD; 14:53)<br />A look into the comic book origins of the Batman franchise. Specifically, they attribute Batman Begins to a combination of the Year One and The Long Halloween graphic novels. It's sort of generic whether you actually read the comics or not, but it tells you enough that if you don't know about them, you should check them out anyway.<br /><br />- Stills Gallery<br />Pictures.<br /><br />- Confidential Files<br />Pictures with text.<br /><br />- Reflections on Writing (SD; 1:57)<br />A quick story on David S. Goyer's writing endeavors and how the guy at the comic book store eventually busted him for writing a Batman movie after the large amount of graphic novels he ended up buying.<br /><br />- Digital Batman (SD; 1:06)<br />Reveals that the Batman that dropped down and walked out of Arkham was, in fact, completely CG'd.<br /><br />- Batman Begins Stunts (SD; 2:30)<br />Shows the Tumbler tests, wire work, and stuntman Buster Reeves being lit on fire.<br /><br />- Theatrical Trailer (HD; 1:13)<br />A pretty bad trailer considering how epic the movie really is and how much of a better film-maker Nolan has become today.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />By now, I'm sure anyone that loves this movie already owns it. The thematic depth here is just the beginning; and the new direction Nolan takes the franchise in is truly a sight to behold compared to its predecessors. It's literally and figuratively dark with excellent writing from the screenplay down to the script, possesses an all-star cast of actors, and is arguably the best representation of the Batman mythos to date (well, outside of its sequels). While the video quality is a little short of excellent, the audio is reference and the extras are as meticulous as its director. Unless Warner Bros. just decides to totally remaster the video for a double/triple-dip down the road, this is at least worth owning for now and a must-see for Bat fans.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|Metallica has successfully returned to their original sound.  Complicated, skilled, and Garage-Band-ish.  Not there's necessarily anything wrong with that, but Death Magnetic just didn't do it for me.  It made fine background music, I just couldn't actively listen to it more than a few times.<br /><br />There is one gem here I would like to talk about: The Unforgiven III.  It's a little on the long side, coming in at 7:46, but is a remarkably well composed piece.  The piano introduction is beautiful.  The way its tempo speeds and slows reminds me of Tool's \\"Wings for Marie\\" and the cello (pretty sure it's a cello) sets the rest of the song up with its mournful cries.  The best song on the album in my opinion.<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Unforgiven III is the only song I really liked from the whole album.  I would recommend getting Metallica's other albums first before getting Death Magnetic.
045122499X|4.0|After finally getting around to reading this sequel to one of my all time favorite books, [[ASIN:B0017TA6RU The Pillars of the Earth]], I can't help but to be somewhat disappointed. While this is by no means a bad book, and was thoroughly enjoyable, it just doesn't live up to the inescapable (and maybe unmeetable) expectations it had as the follow up to Ken Follett's greatest work (IMO). Whether or not it is fair to judge this book by comparison to the other, that is what most readers will do, and that is the primary reason it receives 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />Similar to THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH, this book is a roller-coaster of emotion. Constant (and usually devastating) surprises change the flow of the story so many times that you'll be hard pressed to guess the final outcome. Certain victories are unmercifully reversed while impending doom is suddenly relieved by happy chance throughout the book. The result is a read that will keep you riveted to the pages, expecting the worst, but hoping for the best, at all times. All of the characters go through intense episodes of heart-ache and of jubilation, and all of them are changed from their experiences as the book progresses.<br /><br />The characters in WORLD WITHOUT END are superb, rivaling those of PILLARS OF THE EARTH, and following them through practically their entire lives results in very real empathy and understanding of them by the reader. Certainly not one-dimensional as some reviewers have complained, these characters display believable and intense emotion and are far from completely good or bad. Follett makes an effort to show the mental processes and self delusion of the 'bad' guys and allows his heroes to make ill-advised and irrational decisions. You'll feel their pain and their happiness, making the characters perhaps the most admirable aspect of the book.<br /><br />My primary complaint about WORLD WITHOUT END is the glaring lack of focus. Unlike PILLARS OF THE EARTH, where the building of Kingsbridge Cathedral represented the primary plot line, this one doesn't have an obvious central story arc that ties it all together. I guess you could say that the story of the characters' lives is that focal point, but it doesn't serve as a uniting theme in the same way as the building of the cathedral. Each character has certain aspirations, and this is a story of their journeys to achieve them, but they are for the most part very disparate, leaving the book as a whole with a sort of random-seeming direction.  While it never looses the reader's attention, it doesn't progress in the orderly and focused way that its predecessor did.<br /><br />As a historical fiction, this book is excellent. Extremely vivid and detailed accounts of medieval Europe bring the time to life like no dry history book could. By putting these very knowable characters into such desperate and painful times, Follett gives the setting an uncomfortably real feel. Accurate seeming, his account of what life in 14th century Europe was like is some of the most provocative I have read.<br /><br />As many reviewers have already pointed out, there is a very noticeable overabundance of sex (both consensual and not) throughout this book. Every other page seems to have some sort of sexual descriptions, from the almost-constant breast-grabbing to the more-than-necessary love scenes to the only-frequent rape. Try not to let it scare you away though, for frankly, you'll reach a point where it stops having much of an effect on your sensibilities as you become inured to it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great effort by Follett to recreate his masterpiece, but it doesn't reach the nearly impossible mark. Very enjoyable, but certainly not as captivating as its predecessor. I'm glad I took the time to read it, but couldn't help being a bit disappointed.epresented the primary plot line, this one doesn't have an obvious central story arc that ties it all together.

B001LPWGE6|5.0|(Update 08/11/2012: Knowing what I know now, I've completely rewritten my reviews for the box set and individual titles from scratch, which might make some of the comments obsolete. But in exchange, I hope this review seems more in-depth now).<br /><br />(Note: Since I can't fit all 3 individual reviews into one entry, I've essentially condensed it down to a general overview of the plot, A/V specs and presentation, and only a list of the special features for each. The numbers you see don't necessarily equate to technical perfection, but those are the average numbers based on each movie and rounded up to the nearest whole or half number. To read the individual reviews, use the links below).<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R35Y9M58QPFCXE/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm<br />http://www.amazon.com/review/RFJDO2K5251W2/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm<br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BYXHJU8KPQFN/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm<br /><br />Movie - 5.0<br /><br />The first time I ever saw this film series was from a total blind-buy. Previously, I never even wanted to touch it because I had this stupid, unexplainable bias against Matt Damon. To this day, I still can't remember why I had such feelings, but I'm glad I got over it, because The Bourne Trilogy is a masterfully-executed story that has changed the face of spy-thriller movies forever. The Bourne Identity starts with the discovery of a man found overboard. He has two gunshot wounds in his back, a Swiss bank account in his hip, and no immediate recollection of who he is. Coincidentally, upon reaching the mainland it seems that he's a master in firearms and fisticuffs when he instinctively disables a couple of poor police officers that just happened to mess with the wrong guy. When he gets to the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport and his name: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). But to his surprise, there's a slew of other passports with the same picture and different names, in addition to lots of cash and even a handgun. Upon setting outto Paris, he meets a woman named Marie (Franka Potente), and the two of them would go on to face assassins and conspiracies while uncovering answers to who he is.<br /><br />In The Bourne Supremacy, we find the two in Goa living a life of peace after managing to escape pursuit. Meanwhile, an operation in Berlin to uncover a mole amongst the top CIA brass, led by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), goes south when a Russian federal agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the deal and takes out the informant while leaving a fingerprint of Bourne to cover his tracks. When Kirill attempts to find Bourne and assassinate him, Marie is killed in his stead. And in a rage of anger, Bourne decides to aspire vengeance on all those who had been chasing him. But in the process, he would discover a few more things about his past that would change him for the better.<br /><br />And in The Bourne Ultimatum, after a British reporter named Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) discovers a new Treadstone replacement agency called Blackbriar, led by Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), Bourne figures to find the source of Ross' information so he can finally get the answers he'd been searching for, as well as putting an end to these agencies. Upon Ross' assassination, Bourne instills the aid of former Treadstone handler Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and receives the benefit of the doubt from Pamela Landy as he makes his way back home to New York and discovers the truth to everything he had forgotten.<br /><br />The Bourne movie franchise has made quite the name for itself. In the hands of Doug Liman, he not only managed to introduce an interesting character with a lot of mystery and intrigue to his background, but also a character we were able to sympathize for. He was a character that lost his memory, re-discovered himself, then tried to leave his dark past behind and escape a corrupt system. After Paul Greengrass took the reigns, he improved what Liman left on the table, further exposing the humanistic side of this character as we see him lose the part of his life he cares about the most. But despite that loss, his humanity would prove to be stronger than his vengeance as even more memories started to surface, making his journey for revenge turn into a search for redemption. And after finding his inner peace, he takes pursuit of those responsible in an effort to destroy the very system that had created him and brought about so much pain and suffering, not only to him, but to many of those involved throughout its history. At this point, I think it's safe to say that Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne has really cemented itself amongst the iconic spy heroes (next to James Bond and maybe Bryan Mills from Taken).<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1, 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />The video quality of the series is pretty much perfect aside from the first one. In my initial review a few years ago, I said I wasn't pleased with Identity, but did a pretty crappy job explaining it. After reading up on the technicalities of film-making since then, I've gotten a much better grasp on how to explain and describe these things. That being said, Identity looks very good in terms of black levels, colors, and sharpness. Looking at a lot of the outdoor shots, especially, and a few indoor, the picture retains enough detail that it makes for a pleasant image for the trilogy's initial entry in HD. However, it does suffer from low contrast, giving it a somewhat murky look, and there are several occasions when dirt and a couple of scratches from print damage pop up. It's not terribly distracting, but it is noticeable.<br /><br />Supremacy, on the other hand, is a major step up. With the changing of director in Paul Greengrass, he gave the image a much more vibrant look that better accentuates all of the aforementioned qualities. Blacks are darker, colors are much more vivid, contrast is better-balanced, and the sharpness is even sharper. Just looking at the beginning scenes in Goa, there's a tremendous amount of color that really adds more life, and the rest of the movie follows accordingly. Some people say the saturation is a little too high, but I'm in the belief that it was intentional since Grengrass is such a visualist. And there's also a good amount of film grain as well, which again, I believe is intentional. So unless you don't like the color timing or are a grain-hater, then those are about the only problems you might have. Finally, Ultimatum has the same kind of photography, only with a difference of intensity. Supremacy ran a little hot in terms of color, but I feel it added to the overall tone of the film itself (Bourne getting hot and angry for revenge, hence the hot look to the picture). However, Ultimatum is essentially where things come full circle and the adventure ends. Because of that, this is probably about as \\"normal\\" of a color level as you'll get. So there you have it. Aside from the first movie, there's not much else to complain about.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Again, aside from Identity, the audio is just about perfect. All three movies use the DTS-HD MA codec, and all of them sound fantastic. The only problem with Identity isn't so much the quality, but the quantity. As in the film itself just isn't as heavily-mixed as the others. In his commentary, Doug Liman stressed how he wanted to make Identity a drama first and an action movie second. Because of this, I think it reflects in the sound mix. The actual depth and quality to the track itself is pretty buoyant in terms of separation and directionality and gets especially aggressive during the fight with the first Treadstone agent. Rear speaker activity also gets a really good workout during the car chase sequence when cars start turning the corners. And dynamic range is excellent in the scene where Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character outside the farmhouse.<br /><br />Additionally, when Greengrass takes over as director for the sequels, the audio gets a tremendous upgrade, just as the video did. Even for as low-key as the opening scenes are in Supremacy, the dynamic depth alone is noticeably louder and more precise. Action sequences offer up even more aggressive mixing such as the fight between Bourne and the last remaining Treadstone agent. This scene in particular displays a very exact design that has no music and does a great job isolating its sound effects into the confines of that small, compact area, adding an extra layer of ferocity and tension to it. And the car chase in Moscow towards the end is brimming with activity as the vehicles skid, crash, and break all over the place. But even still, Ultimatum manages to top that. Immersion is outstanding from the crowd noise for the scene at Waterloo Station, isolation is more intense in the fight between Bourne and Desh, and the car chase in New York is a sonic masterpiece of mayhem and music. By the way, John Powell's score is another big factor to the overall sound of these films. His string and percussion works really help to compliment the storytelling that even exudes a subtle amount of LFEs through his awesome drum pieces. Outside from the one minor issue with Identity, all of these films sound superb.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />There are quite a bit of extras, but if I were to highlight just one feature from each movie, I'd say at the very least(!) give the audio commentaries a listen. And if you like technical stuff, the U-Control Picture in Picture for Supremacy is well-worth a watch as well.<br /><br />The Bourne Identity:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Doug Liman)<br />- The Ludlum Identity (SD; 12:49)<br />- The Ludlum Supremacy (SD; 12:41)<br />- The Ludlum Ultimatum (SD; 23:57)<br />- Alternate Opening and Ending (SD; 10:46 altogether)<br />- Deleted Scenes (SD; 6:58)<br />- Extended Farmhouse Scene (0:58)<br />- The Birth of the Bourne Identity (SD; 14:31)<br />- The Bourne Mastermind: Robert Ludlum (SD; 5:44)<br />- Access Granted: An Interview with Co-Writer Tony Gilroy (SD; 4:03)<br />- From Identity to Supremacy: Jason & Marie (SD; 3:37)<br />- The Bourne Diagnosis (SD; 3:25)<br />- Cloak and Dagger: Covert Ops (SD; 5:31)<br />- Inside a Fight Sequence (SD; 4:42)<br />- Moby \\"Extreme Ways\\" Music Video (SD; 3:38)<br />- U-Control<br /><br />The Bourne Supremacy:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)<br />- Explosive Deleted Scenes (SD; 10:46)<br />- Matching Identities: Casting (SD; 5:23)<br />- Keeping it Real (SD; 4:58)<br />- Blowing Things Up (SD; 4:00)<br />- On the Move with Jason Bourne (SD; 4:45)<br />- Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training (SD; 4:21)<br />- Crash Cam: Racing Through the Streets of Moscow (SD; 5:58)<br />- The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action (SD; 6:49)<br />- Anatomy of a Scene: The Explosive Bridge Chase Scene (SD; 4:40)<br />- Scoring with John Powell (SD; 4:46)<br />- The Bourne Mastermind (Part 2) (SD; 4:42)<br />- The Bourne Diagnosis (Part 2) (SD; 5:39)<br />- U-Control<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)<br />- Deleted Scenes (SD; 12:22)<br />- Be Bourne Spy Training<br />- Man on the Move: Jason Bourne (SD; 23:58 altogether)<br />- Roof Pursuit (SD; 5:39)<br />- Planning the Punches (SD; 4:59)<br />- Driving School (SD; 3:23)<br />- New York Chase (SD; 10:46)<br />- U-Control<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />So there you have it. If you've read my individual reviews for these movies, there's not much else I can say. The Bourne Trilogy is one of the best in its genre, and I'm really thankful for its influence in a lot of other recent entries (the Daniel Craig Bond movies and Liam Neeson's roles in both Taken andUnknown). It refreshed the genre with a mix of mystery, grit, and emotional depth that has really raised the standard. This box set is a very good deal, and I'm glad I made that blind-buy when I did. The A/V specs are essentially perfect outside of the first film, and they're all chock full of meaningful special features. If you haven't seen these films yet, make the time. You won't regret it.

B00004RF9B|5.0|This film is misleading, in so much that the graphics used in the packaging to solicit the buyer or viewer is not commensurate to the actual content of the film, in both nature or plot. The film is exceptional, the acting is not typical of a mid century film, it is phenominal, the plot is intelligent and bordering the profound, altogether a superb film. The aforementioned is said in relevance to a context most science fiction fans would understand, however, this film goes beyond science fiction, and is worthy for any 1950's or 1960's cinema fan.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Movie - 4.5    When I first saw this movie some years ago, I admit I didn't like it.  I was against the general concept of military establishments because of the violence and brutality that incurred within the endless cycle of human existence and didn't see the point in continuing it via the implementation and intervention by the U.S., U.N., and other nations.  Since then, I've come to realize that the world is so f'ed up and misconstrued politically, religiously, and socially that the military is just one of those by-products that has now become a necessity to the way the world works.  Prior to this subsequent viewing, a few other films have helped in changing my impression about the military: Tears of the Sun, Rambo (2009), and Body of Lies.  In viewing these movies, I've discovered two major themes that have ultimately given me a new perspective on the military and a third that enables me to empathize for those who serve.  First is the power to make a difference, as in the power for the strong or able to potentially change things in the course of life, be them for better or worse.  Seeing this has helped me understand some of the motivations that drive the ideology of military force and the sort of mindset one could be taking into such a scenario.  The second theme is the comradery shared between soldiers.  They've obviously sacrificed a great deal to put their duty before all else already, but in doing so gain this kind of trust and friendship with their fellow comrades-in-arms, essentially becoming the one absolute they can depend on.  It's almost bittersweet in a way, but just goes to show that despite how ingrained they may become within the machinations of the military, they are in fact, still real people with real feelings.  And finally, the last theme concerns the inconsistent, jaded, and near-incompetent ability of power hierarchies to effectively run the military.  The intentions from higher up may be helpful, but there often turns out being lapses in judgment accompanied by bad decision-making that ultimately end up unfolding into events like the one shown in Black Hawk Down.  This movie itself is a testament to many variations of these issues and I have a new respect for such depictions which, given space constraints, I will just leave at that.  Kudos to Sir Ridley Scott for a fine adaptation, expression, and enlightenment of these aspects.    Video - 4.0    Sony presents Black Hawk Down in an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 via the now-outdated MPEG-2 codec.  Surprisingly enough it doesn't look too bad at all.  The muted color palette of the movie carries over very well, as do the deep blacks and varying levels of contrast.  Skin tones are immaculately realistic, even with all the dirt and grime on the soldiers' faces.  The fine layer of grain does the film's gritty and harsh atmosphere justice and never appears intrusive.  Overall detail is also pretty sharp, though probably could've been much better or near-perfect had it utilized today's MPEG-4 codec.  But with that being said, the only other minor hiccup is the presence of artifacts here and there, so minus another half point for that.  As popular and successful as the movie has been, one can only hope Sony might consider a double-dip to possibly improve an already great video presentation and make it guaranteed reference-quality someday.  The excellent cinematography would definitely benefit from such a boost.    Audio - 5.0    While the video could use re-encoding and just a tad more restoration for artifact removal, the LPCM 5.1 track at 4.6Mbps is definitely fine the way it is (save for maybe a re-encode to DTS-HD to save disc space for video and extras, perhaps).  As expected, war movies will obviously come with a lot of sound effects including gunshots, explosions, vehicles, citizen, by-stander, and background noise, Black Hawk helicopters (duh), and a good deal of radio static, dialogue, and other discrete sounds.  All are represented perfectly, further showcasing the benefits of a lossless audio track and practically putting you right in the middle of all the action.  Dynamics have great variation between the kinds of objects on screen ranging from the size of bullets fired to the kinds of grenades used.  Separation of the sound effects and yet another commendable Hans Zimmer score is spot-on as well.  Directionality is also flawless with placement of sound effects being put where you'd see them on or off camera.  LFEs vary from subtle to booming, with the Black Hawk choppers being the most dominant element in presenting these.  But most notable is that even amongst all the action, dialogue levels remain clear and coherent all the time.  Black Hawk Down won an Oscar for sound, and rightfully so.  Consider this another piece of reference material.    Extras - 4.5    I've not experienced the 3-disc DVD edition, but for what's on here, I found the extras to be quite poignant and very detailed in their explanations.  In addition to commentaries from Sir Scott and the veterans of this event, there are about two and a half hours of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with cast, crew, and all the people involved in both the making of this movie and the true story behind it.  With my newly-found respect for the military and its deserving personnel, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the work and research that went into this film.  Culturally speaking, history has normally been passed down the generations using more typical methods like books and education.  But if there was ever one of the many movies to choose from to chronicle something as controversial, yet thought-provoking as war, I think the overall presentation of Black Hawk Down itself with these great special features should be one of them.  There's a lot of information here that will definitely provide for some interesting perspective.    Overall - 4.5    With this sudden interest and intrigue I'm now starting to develop for war movies, I can't wait to delve into the library of other greats like Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, and Saving Private Ryan.  In addition to what I've seen most recently and to this followup viewing of Black Hawk Down, I've learned to appreciate the efforts and sacrifice put forth by the men and women in the military establishments all around the world.  It's a sad fact that we, as a people, have indeed resorted to using war as a means of operation, but it's a fact, nonetheless.  And Sir Ridley Scott with his great director's prowess continues to create captivating tales and interpretations that manage, not only to entertain, but to often get a message across that there is more to something than we may think.  Black Hawk Down is another one of his movies that effectively shows us the sheer brutality, and yet melancholy necessity of what war is.  While just short of an up-to-date video presentation, the Blu-ray version of Black Hawk Down still possesses reference audio and a good amount of extras that make this film highly recommended until a possible double-dip.
B000063UR1|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The special effects are still impressive and the movie definitely has moments of power and achievement, but Bruce Dern doesn't have the chops to carry the movie when the other humans are gone and the middle section lags as a result; it's worth a look if you like sci-fi but it's less than stellar.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This was an absolutely fantastic watch.  I can't say enough about the production value of the series.  What really takes this Blu-ray version above and beyond is the extra features.  I watched the entire series with the interactive timeline feature running alongside the video.  Having the extra bits of information popping up throughout the episodes added a whole lot of context and historical significance to the events transpiring onscreen.  From animated maps to soldier bios, there really is no other way to watch a historical piece for which such incredible attention to detail has been paid.    If you have a blu-ray player or PS3, you owe it to yourself to pick this up.  It also goes on sale regularly :D

031606792X|5.0|I just want to say that yes i agree it isn't all that exciting hen they all get what they want in the end but i loved every second of this book; i always wanted to love jacob but was fighting it so hard because he kept trien to take bella away from edward and well i am completely in love with the character of EDWARD CULLEN he is the best male character ever to me the only one who ever comes even close is Tristan from the Tristan and Isolde. I do not believe that edward is too perfect like lots of people have said but he is incredible in all that he does and just because of what he is and how he and all his family work so hard to be so good to have some humanity, but edward is just great beyond that even carlisle thinks so.  anyway back to the point i was very happy that edward and jacob bonded and became like family that way i could love jacobs character they way it deserved to be loved.  i loved how bella and jacobs relationship and the ties they felt for each other were never really more than friends it just seemed it to keep them with each other until renesmee was finally there, jacobs true other half.  thats they way i took it anyay, cause not just jacobs feelings for bella went away when he imprinted but bellas for him too.  IT WAS FATE!!!!!  it wasn't like that with sam and leah when sam imprinted emily he didn't love leah like that anymore but she still loved him.  Anyway yes everyone got what they wanted and no one died butthey all deserved it.  Especially Edward and Jacob.
0780622650|4.0|This film will invite viewers that remember the original series, however, the film is superior to the original series, as it approaches the same subject matter and objective of the original series, however, in a much more intelligent manner. The characters are not so much embellished, as they are enhanced and refined, and sometimes somewhat dumbed down. This film is highly entertaining, and William Hurt does not let down, the film is also child friendly, albeit, it is fairly intelligent. There are some cameos by the previous series actors, several of them actually, and this does not let down either. The film touches everyone, fans of the original series, and persons who have never known or seen the original.
B0010358CG|4.0|Movie - 3.5    No, I've not read the manga. No, I've not seen the original Appleseed OAV, but yes I have seen the first Appleseed movie made in '04, and yes it's been a while and I don't remember much. Regarding Ex Machina, however, I got what I expected after hearing John Woo was attached -- an action movie. The plot reminded me of so many other stories that tried to illustrate humanity's over-reliance on technology and how it almost led to their own downfall. But where something like an I, Robot or WALL*E succeeded, Ex Machina faltered by diverting too much attention to art, animation, and action sequences instead of a consistent plot or even a little more characterization, which resulted in a somewhat underwhelming feature. Granted, I, Robot was more of an action/thriller than drama, but even with a few more minutes in run time, it managed to tell a similar story much more effectively. In Ex Machina, I felt there were a lot of little things crammed in such as the interactions between Deunan and Briarios, Briarios' conflict with seeing himself in Tereus, or even Deunan seeing Briarios in Tereus. I felt it tried so hard to establish the characters in such a short amount of time that it ended up losing presence to concentrate on the message or at least tell it in a more poignant narrative. Regardless, though, the actions sequences definitely have that John Woo-ness to them. So if anything, this could probably equate to a decent summer blockbuster if ever produced and cast well enough by Hollywood.    Video - 4.5    As perfect as CG should be on a BD, I'm actually not sure if this was a perfect transfer. Colors, blacks, contrast, and sharpness are all pretty sleek on the very intricate character designs and backgrounds, but I could've sworn I noticed maybe 2 or 3 instances of macroblocking within the very thin lines of some characters. It may have just been some kind of light transition from a dialogue part to an action sequence (one particular scene kinda' lit everything up), or it could be that disregarding a large majority of the fluid animation, the crew may have actually slipped up. Other than those minor flaws, though, Ex Machina would probably make for a reasonable demo choice if you wanted to show off something animated not by Pixar. As stated before, the gunfight/action sequences are pretty cool to watch.    Audio - 3.5    As typical of Warner, they decided this was a less than worthy title to give any lossless audio to. And while the regular Dolby Digital 5.1 Japanese track (I hate ADV, so no I don't care about the dub) did enough, I can't help but wonder how much better it COULD'VE sounded had it been bumped up a notch to a Dolby TrueHD encode. Directionality and dialogue are pretty good for what it's worth in the front sound stage, but I felt the surround channels were vastly underutilized, especially given the bombastic action and gunfire scenes that definitely would've given this entire feature that extra oomph. But for whatever reason, Warner, even with a 50GB disc, didn't feel the need to do it. Idiots.    Extras - 4.5    I actually watched the special features before even watching the movie because I was eating dinner and am not very adept when it comes to grabbing food while reading subtitles. But I have to say that thanks to that, I actually enjoyed the film a little more than I might have initially. All extras are presented in HD and cover various topics ranging from the atypical production notes to the history and study of Masamune Shirow and the Appleseed franchise to even some cultural factoids and observations about Japan, anime fandom, and its carryover/reception into the U.S. Being an anime fan since I was around 10, but being out of the loop for a little over half a year, I found it to be refreshingly informative to see these people discuss the cultural phenomenon that most Americans are probably alien to. It was a good watch for the new, old, and uninformed, giving great perspective on the whole thing.    Overall - 4.0    Appleseed: Ex Machina had the right concept going, but as most anime movie features go, there just wasn't enough time for everything. I can respect movies that are supposed to be a straight dose of whatever their intended genre like actioners (Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, or Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture), mind trips (anything by Satoshi Kon), or dramas (anything by Makoto Shinkai). However, you get the feeling some times that a movie can be so much more. Unfortunately for Ex Machina, while full of some great action sequences, it was short on a good screenplay, concentrating a little too much on subtle character interactions and less on the themes and story at hand. If you can get past that, though, the rest of the disc is good enough for a recommendation

B0010YSD7M|3.0|This film is a worthy attempt to capture the ongoing saga of the Stargate SG-1 phenomena, however, it does not reach the height that Stargate Continuum did. It is still worthwhile science fiction and both employs and contains marvelous visual imagery, definately worth the special effects represented.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|Movie - 4.0    I haven't seen Ang Lee's Hulk as of this moment, so I can't compare it to this reboot. However, I'm always up for a well-made superhero movie, and Louis Leterrier's revision is quite entertaining to say the least. Growing up I never really followed the Hulk. His character just never interested me with the whole duality struggle between Bruce Banner and Hulk. Admittedly, if you think about it in the long run there could be some really good potential for some interesting theme exposition, but I've yet to actually witness it through the comics or other forms of media. This particular movie, however, is still very enjoyable as an action flick. You've got chases, drama, smashing, more drama, more chasing again, and finally an epic battle between two behemoths in the film's finale. I was very surprised at how well-choreographed all the action is. But because the majority of focus is on that action, I feel the movie falters a bit in character development. I like Edward Norton a lot. He's a great actor when given something good to work with. Unfortunately, they don't do much to build Bruce Banner as any kind of real character, other than what we see in the opening credits. I like how Banner was trying to suppress/control his Hulk self throughout the film, but it's always in spurts and they never really utilize that to convey anything to the narrative effectively enough. I remember hearing a rumor of a potential Director's Cut that was supposed to have 70 extras minutes of footage, but I don't know what happened. If Universal should ever decide to double-dip, though, I'd certainly consider it. The Incredible Hulk is a very good movie, and I'm anxious to see more cameos in future Marvel productions.    Video - 5.0    Colors and flesh tones look outstanding, especially greens. I really like the cinematography at the beginning with the shots of Brazil and other landscape environments. CG integration of the Hulk and Abomination also looks seamlessly perfect. I didn't detect any signs debris or artifacts through my viewing, nor did I see any signs of image manipulation. There is a fine layer of grain to the photography, but I think it actually gives the film an extremely gritty look, which fits the thriller-esque nature very well. Contrast levels never falter, making all sorts of shades feel like you were right there in front of the camera yourself. Black levels are deep as well, and detail is particularly sharp. Everything from the blades of grass in the park to the wrinkles on Liv Tyler's pouty lips look.. incredible. This is easily the best the Hulk has ever looked in the film medium.    Audio - 5.0    Universal presents The Incredible Hulk to us with a DTS-HD MA 5.1 track. And yes, to be cliché, you can take whatever Marvel superhero adjective you can think of and apply it right here -- incredible, amazing, spectacular, uncanny, fantastic. The sound design and audio placement is flawless. Directionality is very impressive during the action sequences; bullets, rockets, explosions, propellers, sonic cannons, roars, tearing metal, shattered earth; everything is perfectly placed throughout the entirety of the movie, and all with absolutely zero loss in dialogue quality. Speech, sound effects, and a surprisingly good soundtrack by Craig Armstrong are all as crisp and dynamic as you can get. And of course, LFEs are rightfully booming. The Hulk's and Abomination's thunderous footsteps will give your subs a thorough workout.    Extras - 4.0    As I mentioned before, I was never a big fan of the Hulk. But after watching the special features, I have to say I'm a little more intrigued now by the whole concept and central theme of \\"duality.\\" I guess you could look at the Hulk as representing two sides of ourselves. You've got the normal, controlling, happy-go-lucky human side that we see in the mirror everyday that does his routine, wants to be happy, goes to work, comes home, and repeats. But inside, there's a part of us that's a bit of a savage, some kind of hedonist that, if fully unleashed, can amount to any kind of potentially destructive force controlled by rage or whatever kind of negative emotions we're keeping inside. Granted, this movie didn't emphasize it enough, but I wish it did. I also find it interesting that Norton almost turned the movie down, which I'm most certainly glad he didn't. Also of special note is the alternate opening, presented in full 1080p and with DTS-HD. It's a nice twist to start the movie with. It's just too bad they didn't make that Director's Cut that was rumored.    Overall - 4.5    I didn't know what to expect. I really like Leterrier for Danny the Dog, and even a little for Transporter 2. Both were entertaining in their own respective rights, though I'd be lying if I said I didn't want The Incredible Hulk to carry over the same kind of writing/directing as his first effort. Regardless, though, The Incredible Hulk is still entertaining enough to make up for the loss in actual character development. With a reference A/V presentation and some pretty good explanatory features, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone of the comic book genre that's looking for a quick fix in action.

0385340990|4.0|Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows come together to bring life to the pages of a book. I read The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society while I was still living in London. The book really brings you into the characters lives, focusing you on the feelings and conceptions of the channel islands that were occupied during the war. Not only is the title brilliant, the way these ladies wrote the book out is exceptionally brilliant. Letters are written from and to a female author Juliet Ashton who was tired of writing fluffy articles about the war even though her pieces were wildly popular.<br /><br />The book also has the undertones of an amazing love story featuring Juliet, she ends up in Guernsey researching more of these fantastical stories of the occupation, like how the Literary and Potato Peel Society began in the first place. For a London native Juliet became enthralled with the smallness and the quirks that the Guernsey citizens have.<br /><br />Shaffer passed away in 2008, leaving us this humorous book that took her years upon years to research. The pace of the book is fast and very urgent, it stems a need in the reader to finish reading in one sitting. It is a fun insight into how tragic the occupation must have been for channel island citizens, while at the same time furnishing you with a love for the main character and how she deals with all the information thrown at her. As I said before there is a bit of a love story but it doesn't take over the book or inhibit the story or the history of the occupation in any way. The book inspired me to learn more about the history of the channel islands in general not just what happened to them in the war.<br /><br />The book is quirky, smart, humorous, and sad all wrapped in a nice neat little package with an amazing eye catching title. The letters from the citizens and Juliet really show the personalities that these characters posses in an amazing way.<br /><br />However, the book does seem to have a hard time settling on one specific plot line to the story. That can be easily overlooked or not noticed at all with the elaborate way the book itself is written. I really think it is a shame that Shaffer passed in the aftermath of such an amazing work. I really looked forward to future novels from this author.ettling on one specific plot line to the story.

B001H5X7KC|5.0|Movie - 4.5    When I first saw this in theaters, I thought it was funny. Not hilarious, but funny. However, the beauty of having a copy to watch at your own leisure makes for a much more comfortable and self-paced approach, which in the end did wonders for this comedic gem. I've always liked Ben Stiller. To me, he's a somewhat more refined version of Will Ferrell and uses a bit more \\"satire-goofy\\" style as opposed to \\"juvenile-goofy.\\" In Tropic Thunder, we see a hilarious self-parody of actors acting as actors who are also.. acting. No, it's not as whimsical or intellectually jabbing as a Coen Brothers or Larry David project, but the degree of absurdity is still every entertaining to watch if you find just the right balance between all these quirky characters. Stiller does his usual thing with the insecure, thick-brained fellow just trying to find himself, while Jack Black makes for a very convincing heroin addict going off and on his highs and withdrawls. But the two performances I enjoyed the most were Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus and Tom Cruise's Les Grossman.  Downey Jr. continues to amaze me with his various performances, and this after making Iron Man of all things.  And as crazy as Cruise is off camera, I've liked him as an actor for most of his career, and he does a splendid job playing the fat, hairy, hyperactive, money-grubbing, Diet Coke-ing businessman. The story is silly, yet addicting, and the dialogue is full of great one-liners you can recite to yourself or around friends. Watch it for what it's worth and enjoy.    Video - 4.5    Being a sort of comedic-action movie, I was actually surprised at how great the video looked. Cinematography in particular shoots many a beautiful landscape, expressing lots of lush greens during daytime scenes, accompanied by great levels of detail and depth upon action sequences (especially on the foreground). Some of the indoor shots and night time scenes were a bit grainy, and I think the colors were just a tad softer on a few scenes that involved closeups of the actors, detracting this from a perfect rating. But given that this is more so a comedy film than action, it's definitely a well-efforted transfer by the people at Dreamworks.    Audio - 4.5    While presented with a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track, keep in mind that this a comedic-action movie (more emphasis on the \\"comedic\\" part), so it's important to remember how this can effect a movie's sound design. Thankfully, though, it doesn't make much of a difference at all, and they did a great job anyway. Music and helicopter effects in the opening sequence are reference quality, in my opinion. Dialogue throughout the entire film is easy to hear and understand (yes, even Downey Jr's ebonics), but I do wish they had given gunshots and explosions a little more oomph. Overall directionality is quite immersive placing every sound where you think it'd be coming from. But again, some of the action sounds were a bit more underwhelming than I wanted. If you're friends can't tell the difference, though, tell them it's reference and see how they react.    Extras - 4.5    While not high in quantity (perhaps an additional 25GB disc would've helped?), the special features presented are pretty fun in their own right with commentaries, \\"making of\\" featurettes, and deleted/extended scenes. I had no idea this film was 10 years in the making until they said it, but I would have to say the dividends really paid off after all this time. I also liked the Les Grossman dance test and found it hilarious to a see a half-costumed Tom Cruise booty dancing to no music. It's a fairly good amount of quality extras for just a single 50GB disc and gives you a bit of insight from all the cast and crew and should be watched at least one time through.    Overall - 4.5    It's not a perfect movie with perfect technical specifications, but it's close. To this date, it is by far the funniest of Stiller's movies that I've seen, and it's full of laughs all over the place. If you like quirky characters and an equally absurd storyline to suit them, then definitely give this a watch, if not at least for the faux movie trailers at the beginning.

0525951113|5.0|I finished this book, which was recommended to me, a little while ago, and I have a feeling it will be with me for days, or weeks, as I continue to replay the story in my mind.     Daniel Suarez' novel, Daemon, opens with an obituary (several key words and phrases are highlighted) and launches into a murder investigation. A key developer at CyberStorm Entertainment, the company that created two of the most popular games on the internet, has been found dead. That death is followed quickly by another, where an important employee of CyberStorm is electrocuted in spectacular fashion. Detective Sebeck, with the assistance of Jon Ross, a computer security expert, determines that the killer used the internet for both of the deaths. But the trail keeps pointing to a dead man, Matthew Sobol, whose obituary starts the novel, as the one responsible. Could he have created a daemon, a computer program that lies dormant until a specified condition occurs, that is now active on the internet? Further, what is the purpose of the daemon? Detective Sebeck's beliefs are tested, as he is not a gamer nor very technical, while he investigates and attempts to stop the daemon before there are serious global implications.     Suarez has written a thrilling and technically accurate novel that will appeal to people inside and outside of computer circles. If you are a fan of MMORPG, then there is a lot in this book that will interest you.  Be patient as you read, as the first several chapters setup the characters and you will be introduced to quite a few. But then the story really picks up the pace, the characters become more familiar, and the story pulls you in. If you are worried that you won't understand the computer jargon, Detective Sebeck is in the same boat and the characters will explain the technical aspects to both Sebeck and you. This technique really adds to the book, as you realize that even veteran computer professionals aren't versed in all aspects of information technology. Daemon is Suarez' first novel, but it doesn't feel that way. Fast paced action, excellent premise, well developed characters, and believable dialog add up to an exceptional read. This is an excellent debut, one that deserves your time and attention. He weaves a tale that is based on fact, and may even motivate you to double check your wireless access points and the security on your workstations,  While 2009 is only a month old, this book has made my list of Best Books for the year.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Movie - 5.0    I really had no expectations at all prior to seeing this for the first time ever (and on Blu-ray, to boot). But I was pleasantly surprised at how cute, charming, and socially commentative the entire film was. I'm sure most of us can either empathize or at least cheer from the perspective of a shy, lonesome creature yearning to love and be loved by someone, and this is exactly what WALL-E's character is all about. And as many a review has already stated, it's not just the act of falling in love, but the way it's presented in this particular film. Sure, we've all seen humans go through the usual hoopla that accompanies the act of romance and courtship, but to achieve and present it in a style that uses almost zero dialogue, and instead utilizes sound effects and music is simply astonishing. And then you have the symbolism and social commentary. To me, the vision of this movie goes to prove several things: A) the social disconnect we're slowly leaning towards as represented by The Axiom. Why bother actually interacting face-to-face, going out to play, or for that matter even getting up to walk? It's a frightening, albeit comical and intelligently-written, testament to how I believe we'll eventually come to depend on technology so much, that it will run our lives in another form of autopilot. And who wants that? But also B) with this dependence on technology and the current consumerist mentality most of this world is living with, I have no doubt that Earth may inevitably become as trashed as in this movie and that society will, in a way, bring about its own destruction, if not through war, then through catastrophic environmental negligence. And then finally C) despite all of this negativity, the human spirit is less breakable than you'd think. Change is the nature of universe, and while some change may be for the worst (like the ones that trashed the planet), it's still good to see those intangible characteristics like hope and optimism counteract and balance it all out at the end. The writing for this film is amazing, indeed.      Video - 5.0    Being another direct transfer of CG to BD, it's easy to see how perfection is the only expectation. With that said, WALL-E looks fantastic. Colors are all over the place, even through all the trash he's digging up on Earth. Shades and hues of various palettes showcase the level of detail flawlessly. Black levels and contrast compliment each other leading to an exuberance of image clarity and depth. In particular, I love how you can see so many of the lines within the compacted blocks of garbage WALL-E stacks up. And scenic views are shimmering when looked at from afar to really give the viewer an awe-inspiring effect of the cinematography. Also as expected, there are no signs of image enhancement or manipulation, aliasing, macroblocking, color banding, or bits of artifacting and debris. WALL-E is yet another A+ video presentation by Disney and should be a no-brainer for reference material.    Audio - 5.0    Having a DTS-HD MA 6.1 track, you get what you paid for in this fine, fine audio presentation. Dialogue stays clear and centered with no dropout or distortion. Directionality stays mostly in the front sound stage with the busy whirring and buzzing of mechanical equipment, though not to be denied is a great mix of additional sound effects and a wonderful score by Thomas Newman from the front side and speakers. Separation is equally astounding with every single sound being as crisp as you could ever want. The rear channel is mostly music, but on occasion manages to instill some excellent immersion with sound effects as well. High and low ends, and there are a lot, are handled brilliantly considering the amount of work sound designer Ben Burtt put into the project. And finally, LFEs aren't too frequent, but when they engage the subwoofer, they pack quite a punch through the forms of rocket ships, heavy machinery, and a couple of lighting bolts.    Extras - 5.0    On the feature disc you have two very entertaining Pixar shorts: Presto, about the quarrel between a rabbit and his magician over feeding arrangements, and Burn-E, about that service bot that was left outside the ship during the movie. Both shorts are quite funny for such.. \\"short\\" presentations (about 5 and 7 minutes respectively), but that's the magic of animation (achievability through small amounts of time). Meanwhile, disc 2 (a 25GB BD) contains a plethora of its own cool features (all in HD) such as mini games, behind-the-scenes featurettes, etc. The \\"making of\\" material especially caught my interest showing the extremely high level of work and commitment it took to build this movie from the ground up (4 years!), starting with production design, sound & music, CG layering, and all of that other mind blowing hard work. It really gave me a higher sense of appreciation and respect to see just how much effort these people put into the overall project, and I really thank them for doing the diligence.    Overall - 5.0    I haven't really watched any Disney/Pixar movies since Toy Story, aside from Ratatoullie (my fave of the company, right now), but they seem to really have taken a chance with WALL-E, and it paid off greatly. Some people may not be as in to the speechlessness of the main characters as myself or others, but it certainly struck a high and joyful chord with me, enough to warrant it a full-fledged 5-star rating in every category possible. Video and audio are no-brainers. And if you liked the movie as much as I did, the special features will only prove to show how much greater the effort in making it was. This is a must own for anyone with even slightest cutesy/romantic/light-hearted side to them.

B001L5SXQG|1.0|I'm a longtime Bruce fan, and I own every last one of his albums on both CD and LP. Other fans have pretty much summed up what I'm thinking as well: This is, by far, Bruce's worst album. It does not come anywhere close to the excitement I felt after \\"Magic\\" was released just two years ago. Everything about \\"Working On a Dream\\" seems rushed: the songs, the lyrics, the art work, and, yes, even the title of the album.    Seriously, let's talk about the album cover--is this the worst album cover ever or what? Terrible. The songs seem \\"average\\" at best and \\"embarrassing\\" at worst. \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" is the worst song Bruce has ever written, and I am embarrassed it was even released. That song should be banned for all eternity. \\"The Wrestler\\" is good. \\"Good Eye\\" is good. I think I like \\"Life Itself.\\" I would really like to like \\"Lucky Day\\" and \\"Working On a Dream\\" but the endless repetitional lyrics ruin them for me.    That's another thing: It seems Bruce didn't want to spend any time writing good lyrics, so once he had his catch phrase, he just decided to repeat it over and over. All the songs on this album keep repeating themselves. A perfect example is \\"Surprise, Surprise,\\" which also has the worst line Bruce has ever written in 30+ years. (\\"When the sun comes up tomorrow, it'll be the start of a brand new day.\\" AWFUL.)     In conclusion, I'll be forced to crank up \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" today and hope to forget about this disaster. I'll get over this. I hope.

B000VBJEFK|5.0|Movie - 5.0    Prior to viewing this movie, I hadn't seen any Disney/Pixar films since Toy Story. I know, I'm out of the loop, but thank goodness I found this gem in Ratatouille. Never had I been so brought back to the joys of childhood where I could watch a movie and have it bring about so many forms of sheer joy and innocent emotion and feel like I actually was a kid again. But at the same time, I found a very subtle maturity to the story and characters of this movie as well. The amazement of cooking and food, the exotic backdrop of Paris, the silly, yet serious interactions of a rat and his handler, then the denouement of a hard-nosed food critic who rediscovered himself and reasserted the happiness of which only food can do to a person; all of these elements make for a very light-hearted comedy about what it means to find something in life that you can dedicate yourself to, pursue, and enjoy to your heart's content. In particular, I was every impressed with the script and screenplay. Remy's conscience being played by an imaginary version of Gusteau was brilliant in studying his overall character as the audience gets a clear, basic understanding of what Remy is thinking to himself. Linguini is a \\"lovable loser\\" archetype that tries so hard, but always manages to bumble things. There's a sort of coyness that makes him fun to root for and his \\"ambitions\\" are commendable, kind of like an \\"everyman,\\" so I really enjoyed watching him as well. Then, there are all of the other supporting characters in Chef Skinner, Anton Ego, Collette, Remy's family, etc. that ultimately make the film one very enjoyable experience. Top that off with a great soundtrack by Michael Giacchino who captures much of the same exoticism that makes Paris so intriguing, and you've got this lovely Oscar-wining feature.    Video - 5.0    Being a direct digital transfer of CG to BD, the result is flawless. Colors are vibrant with lots of yellows and golds accentuating the color palette of the kitchenat Gusteau's. Black levels and contrast are perfect in revealing all the fine detailed lines from the hugeness of Linguini's nose down to the tiny hairs and whiskers of Remy and his clan. Images are always sharp, and the image itself provides for some great example of depth and dimensionality. There are no signs of aliasing, color banding, or any other hiccups making for some beautiful shots of photography amongst the backdrop of Paris, and even some of the inner housing of Linguini's apartment, the kitchen, and the sewers. There also appear to be no signs of artificial enhancement or manipulation, making this a transfer as perfect as you can get and ready to be showcased for all.    Audio - 5.0    Using an uncompressed PCM 5.1 track, Ratatouille is equally as stunning as it's video counterpart. Dialogue is clear, and directionality is particularly precise during kitchen scenes with the clanging of pots and pans, whooshing of flames, and dribbles of liquid all over the place. Music accompanies the sound effects perfectly and immerses the viewer with some wonderful and adventurous melodies that really compliment the story telling, never overdoing itself or intruding over the dialogue. LFEs are most prominent during musical numbers and when things are being chopped up. There really are no flaws with the general sound design and placement and should be enjoyable by the ears of any.    Extras - 4.5    Personally, I found the extras to be very fun and informative. But the only gripe I have is that they didn't put the \\"making of\\" featurettes on as separate 25GB disc by itself. Instead of SD specials, they could've well been HD. Other than that, though, they're all very enjoyable. The Pixar animated shorts are always a nice addition, while the \\"rat history\\" as narrated by Remy and Emile served as a cute parody of how rats could be thought of under a different light (not that it'll ever happen since rats aren't as smart as this, but the effort is appreciated). Then of course there's the production segments, which continue to amaze me in how hard it really is to produce films of this caliber. I highly respect and give thanks to all the people involved in these types of projects.    Overall - 5.0    The only thing that would've made this release any better is an extra disc specifically reserved for the special features. But other than that, it's an extreme delight to have watched this film for its cheery and lovable narrative about personal passion and the following of one's dreams. With immaculate A/V quality and an excellent set of extras and special features, I can't recommend this title enough for both kids and adults.
B000FGG60C|4.0|Friday Night Lights has a more refined development of the key characters than what you usually see in HS sports movies.  It does a great job of exposing how they deal with challenges and setbacks, with some memorable scenes.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie is fun for the whole family.  It is funny for adults and children.  We watch it over and over.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I've always enjoyed movie soundtrack music, and I have a partial soundtrack of FOTR, but I wanted to hear it all. I absolutely love it! Three CDs with all the music (plus one audio DVD with all the music), and a booklet with commentaries, explanations, and some measures of the music itself! It was definitely worth what I paid for it!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|this is a excellent seller..the dvd was in excellent condition and came super fast.thank you for a wonderful easy transaction..
031606792X|5.0|I wish there was more books to this series to read, absolutely love this series.
0156027321|1.0|I was drawn to this book because the author made the protagonist a native South Indian - a place where I resided for 2 years in my early adulthood.  I'm always willing to try a book with such a nostalgic setting.  Initially, I found the premise of \\"228 days at sea with a tiger\\" to be an interesting one, but quickly found myself bored with the lengthy zoological descriptions. (I felt manipulated, too... as though the author was using a work of fiction to try to convince the world that animals are really better off in a zoo - !?!)  The clincher for me in putting this book down was the apparent worldview of Hinduism-Islam-Christianity all mixed together.  Sounds like utter confusion to me.  My time can be better used elsewhere.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|The songs of the new album are such a delight to listen to! Well, it took me a while to really get into all of the songs, but now - maybe with the exception of 'Life itself' - each song is pure enjoyment to me, with the emotional peaks of 'Last Carnival' and 'The Wrestler'. What a flow of melodies (Tomorrow never Knows,...)!! And what a variety of styles - I could't believe to hear the Beach Boys sound in 'This Life' and the Byrds sounds in 'Surprise'.  For all who express their disappointment here, I want to tell you to give the album time to grow in you. Tonight I was playing chess with my wife - with this album at full volume in the back - hey, it was just great!! Thank you, Bruce, I love about all of your songs, and what you did in this decade with your 5 albums (with The Rising still the peak) is simply awesome!
3795753384|4.0|This is a full vocal score.  It also has an orchestral reduction for rehearsal.  Excellent for section leaders, choral conductors, and rehearsal accompanists.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Wow! This is fantastic! I received it very promptly as well. The condition is next to none. Wonderful buying experience!! Thanks!
B000VSBX34|5.0|ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! What fun for even my children, who missed Beatle-mania... very quirky, very clever, with all those great tunes. Not to be missed.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|My son and I have been watching this movie on a VHS for about a year now, needless to say that the sound and video quality is much better on the DVD...sorry to say, we haven't made it to the special features yet.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This version of Jane Eyre is a great movie. I had rented one other version of Jane Eyre and did not enjoy it nearly as much as I did this one. The movie is long, but is interesting so the viewer never minds it's length. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes any of the Jane Austen movies. However I never read the book Jane Eyre, so I do not know how true the movie is to the book. It could be really accurate or not accurate at all, unfortunetly I do not know. The only thing I would liked to have seen more of is Jane's relationship with her childhood friend and her relationship with the little French girl she governesses for at Rochesters house. I think we do not see as much of that because this particular movie focuses more on Jane and Mr. Rochester's relationship, which they did a great job on!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|this box set i purchased from amazon was amazing! it was 9 discs. the item was band new and in perfect condition. i am 100% satisfied..
B001GZ6QBU|2.0|i never got my product, the seller stole my money and never sent the item.
1932907009|5.0|First of all, let me start by saying that Blake Snyder's Save the Cat is genius.   A true \\"Bible\\" to carry with you at all times.  I have been a screenwriter for over ten years and have acquired quite a few \\"how to\\" screenplay books.  Syd Field's Three Act Structure,  Lajos Egri's The Art of Dramatic Writing, Viki King's How to Write a Screenplay in 21 days etc. and so on.  All of them had little diamonds in them - but as a whole were a chore to get through.  When a friend told me about Save the Cat - I thought \\"oh sure, another book to add to my dusty collection.\\"  When she insisted this one was different, I broke down and bought a copy.    Guess what - it is that good.      First of all, Blake breaks down the information in a conversational, non-condescending way that is really refreshing. And the movies he chooses to back up his theories are all easy to recall, which makes jumping on board with his ideas a cinch.  The way the chapters are broken down also makes it a breeze to read. Definitely not one of those books you open and then wonder if there is a CliffsNotes version of it.  This book is a CliffsNote.  All this insightful stuff is explained in an easy breezy concise and fun way.  Who wants to be overwhelmed with too much information?    One of my favorite parts of the book is what Blake calls The Promise of the Premise.  If you come up with a hook for your movie you've got to exploit it and remember to pay it off.  It's so easy to veer off course when writing a script and forget all about what initially drew you to wanting to write it.   These insights are great reminders.  Like little post it notes above your computer to help keep you and on track.     I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys movies and is interested in becoming a better storyteller.  I guarantee you will experience an \\"a-ha\\" moment.      Dianna Ippolito
B000008I4Z|5.0|Like most Marillion albums, I think Brave is amazing. Marillion is one of just a handful of bands putting out decent new music these days. I realize that Brave came out in the early nineties, but what band has emerged since then that has put out anything even remotely comparable to Brave? I can think of only one band, and that band is Radiohead. Radiohead is like the Beatles for the new generation and Marillion is like The Who or The Rolling Stones. They are every bit as good as Radiohead, but they won't ever get credit for what they have achieved. I absolutely love Radiohead, but I am equally fond of Marillion. Marillion is the most underrated band of all time. When are people going to recognize the genius of the Hogarth fronted Marillion? Hogarth's lyrics are amazing. Brave is a great example of his genius. Every Marillion album is brilliant, regardless of whether the singer is Fish or Hogarth. The awesome musicianship is consistant throughout the band's existense. It is truly a travesty that this band is not recognized as one of the truly great musical phenomenas in rock history.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|The movie itself is pretty good and now this two-disc set in blu-ray makes the package even better which may or may not be worth the premium charged for blu-ray. The only con I have, which is technically and not related to the film itself, is the lack of a spanish soundtrack. Although most people don't need it I have to use it sometimes and the thing that bugs me the most is that all the other DVD and Blu-Ray versions of the film do have a spanish language track. Wonder why the most expensive variation of the film does not have it. Other than that I recommend this movie to anyone who likes this genre.
0375757856|5.0|Other reviewers have noted two things which I will put briefly here: this book is extremely well-written and has unforgettable characters.  More than that, the story is intriguing --- even enthralling.<br /><br />My personal favorite is the old man who opens the story with a magnificent 200-page portrait of everyone involved.  Miss Clack is also memorable, and I am sure Wilkie Collins enjoyed every minute of skewering her through first-person narrative --- an endlessly hypocritical and pious spinster, who is also the \\"poor relation\\" of the family which the novel is about.  It is especially delicious to witness Miss Clack telling off the heroine, Rachel --- who is an honest, beautiful young woman worth ten of Miss Clack.  Miss Clack denounces Rachel (and everyone) as \\"heathen\\" and \\"pagan.\\"<br /><br />Of course, this only scratches the surface.  I haven't even mentioned Sergeant Cuff --- a memorable, honest, and intelligent character who has been the background model for many subsequent fictional detectives, including Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />The only warning I have is this: if you have the Modern Library edition, you would be well-advised to skip the \\"learned\\" introduction by Carolyn Heilbrun, a tendentious and tedious piece worthy of Miss Clack herself.
0321544080|5.0|I am now a Joe McNally fan. Watched the Nikon DVD, read this book. Entertaining. Informative. Good for learning what types of products he uses and enjoyable to look at the pictures with the stories of the shoot. Funny, sometimes pompous, sometimes self-deprecating, sometimes regretful, sometimes proud. I enjoyed the book very much. I found it inspiring in many ways.
031606792X|5.0|The direction of this book was really not what I expected but it was a really good book! If you are expecting an epic novel then this book (or series for that matter) probably isn't for you. However, if you just want a cute story that is entertaining and keeps you interested this will do the job!
0385340990|5.0|I could not put this book down. It revealed so many things about the British to me, and that era (WWII). I highly recommend it.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|This movie was one of our favorite movies. I had it on VCR tape, but wanted to purchase the DVD because it will be more permanent.  It was a beautiful love story, well acted and directed. It is sad that true love was discovered after she becaame a war bride. We even visited the home in Madison County on a vacation, and had our picture taken in the bathtub!!
0375842209|5.0|I found this book to be simply amazing, and recommend it to adults and young adults alike. From its intriguing and abstract beginnings, the book pulled me right in, and I felt an immediate connection and sense of compassion towards the characters. The book itself is narrated from Death's perspective, which gives us a unique point of view and insight on the events. I do not wish to summarize or give any part of the book away- and I do not dare delve into the incredible imagery and complex plot. The writing style that Markus Zusak implements is almost poetic, although definitely not sugar coated. It allows the reader to glimpse what German life was really like during the time of Hitler's reign and during the Holocaust- without simply casting all German's as Hitler lovers and Jew haters. It is truly moving, with timeless themes such as coming of age, good and evil, innocence, war, love and hate. Watching Liesel, the main character, develop ideas, morals, and relationships made me think upon the way I tend to judge others or follow the crowd when it may be easier than standing up for others. The images the author creates will echo in your heart and mind long after you put the book down, and will cause you to think profoundly of the value of friendship, family, love, and human life itself. It is a gem among fine literature.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|Bruce Springsteen has a problem (altho more musicians should have such a  problem).  His body of work has set such a high standard that a \\"decent\\"  album would be a lot of bands greatest achievement.  Having long since paid his dues, Bruce is entitled to do pretty much whatever he wants, besides which, what is wrong with making pop music (don't get me wrong, I'm not raving about this disc)?  On to the songs:  \\"My Lucky Day\\" is an irresistibly catchy rocker (best song on the disc), while \\"Surprise,Surprise\\" is an almost power-pop sound that grows on you (we'll forget about the lyrics).  \\"This Life\\" has some of the best harmonies the band has ever done, and is above average lyrically for this disc.  \\"The Last Carnival\\", while one of the better songs, fondly & sadly rembers Danny Federici.  \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" is a lilting, keyboard dominated lovesong.  While some fans may be quick to dismiss this one, how many of us would think of the grocery-store as a place to find beauty (just an observation) ?  I've seen the band every tour since  1976, and while this is not the caliber os some albums, cut the guy some  slack--he sounds happy, content with his age & is still the best live act  on the planet.  Bruce fans have faith!  These songs will take on a MUCH  better life on stage!!  The tour starts soon!!!  Catch it!!!!                     Frosty Prim                     veteran live music goer
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|We've loved this movie for years and wanted to purchase a DVD and get rid of our VHS copy. It's still a classic and great fun to watch!
B001LPWGE6|5.0|To open the case was a little tricky, just a little. I watched them last night. Excellent! I waited a long time for this. its so sick! a must have.<br />jason bourne does not F around, and you know this.....man!!!!
B000T05R90|5.0|INCREDIBLE!  I bought this for my son who is 27 and he loves it!  I would recommend this for any Pink Floyd fan.
0385340990|5.0|This is a great story about a part of World War II I knew nothing about- the German occupation of the Brtish Channel Islands.  Besides painting a rich and vibrant portrait of life at the time, the psychological observations are well done and the character studies are haunting.  These people come alive through the words on the pages.  The material is often heartbreaking and you can almost touch the anguish.  What a bitter memory for the human race -- how important it is to keep it alive to avoid a repititon.  Reading the history through the lense of a correspondance works well and allows the author a wide lattitude of topics to explore.
B000K7VHH8|4.0|Very good movie.  I've seen this before on TV.  The Blu-ray version is great.
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|You will be surprised if you are expecting a similar concert video as their Syendy Australia performance.     This concert has more of an intimate setting. The melodies and sounds generated by these music geniuses are phenomenal.    The acoustical intro to Hotel California is an instant classic. If you appreciate fine music by gifted musicians then this is the video for you.     Music today does not compare nor have the staying power of THE EAGLES!!!!!    Ram Hernandez  San Antonio TX.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|I just discovered Tommy Emmanuel (Tony Enamel as he says people mistakenly call him) on YouTube. I had no idea this guy had been around so long. Man was I missing out!  I've played guitar for a long time and have a strong appreciation for real musical talent and ability developed and executed on it. This fella delivers nothing but that! He and his music are both amazing. And what makes it all the more enjoyable to watch is how much fun he has doing it. He really loves playing, is full of energy and seems like a wonderful guy. Still, if you have no concern for that part of the picture, Tommy's music and playing skills are a wonder to hear and see. He makes it look so easy you sometimes think you should be able to do what he's doing. So you pick up your guitar and... land right back in the real world again.   Anyway, the DVD picture and sound quality is great! 5.1 surround sound with a crisp, clear digital image. I hope they make more of these with Tommy before he retires (which hopefully won't be for many years!!).    God bless you Tommy. You've blessed us with the miracle of your music and personality. I wish you the absolute best.

B0002OERI0|5.0|As American Punk Rockers(tm), we finally realize that we must grow up.  Or at least mature little.  The path of our aging plays like a movie.  But this film is not yet rated, and \\"American Idiot\\" is the soundtrack.<br /><br />We used to try and escape this aging process and walk the streets at night, or stroll through rows of cubicles, or drive upon freeways in our hybrids.  We have come to realize that denial is no longer a strong enough river to guide us on this path.  Loneliness, despite our suburban-grown isolation, does not apply anymore because we know deep down that others feel the same way we do.<br /><br />The world around us is falling apart, and we want our ideas heard, goddamn it!!<br /><br />So, raise your skinny fists to heaven.  Or your fat fists.  Or your gay fists.  Or your gender-confused fists.  Problem is: we don't believe in heaven.  So, raise your fists up and punch a redneck in the nose.  Billy Joe would be proud.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|I have to agree with another reviewer in feeling somewhat ripped off by the special edition features.  It was basically the same stuff you could see on HBO when they were doing a special on the movie.  Where are the interviews with Heath..?..Why don't they show Heath filming the scenes...?...etc. I can only assume they didn't include anything in respect to his family (?) but I don't understand how that would be disrespectful. The other reason might be that they are waiting to release ANOTHER special edition so people buy the movie again for the new special features which would tick me off.<br /><br />The movie itself as everyone already knows is great. I would have liked a bigger scene for Cillian Murphy (scarecrow) but his character wasn't really necessary in this movie.<br /><br />I give this 4 out of 5 because the movie is awesome...minus 1 for the LACK of special features.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This dvd is fun and challenging, which is always key for me. It's hard to find dvds that provide a thorough, tough workout. My complaint, and it's a big one, is that the workouts are only 20 minutes! It would be okay if you could easily customize the workout to add on a second workout. This is great for some people who only want 20 minutes of exercise, but I can't do just 20 minutes and maintain cardio fitness and a low weight. I eat too many cookies to do that!
031606792X|1.0|I wanted to give this book zero stars, but Amazon wouldn't let me. This book is atrocious. So bad that I couldn't read more than half of it. The story line is absurd and disturbing. It ruins all the other books in the series. Reading Twilight and the other books in the series, I fell deeply in love with Edward and the Cullens. This book destroys anything positive I ever felt about any character Meyer created. I wish I never read one single line of Breaking Dawn.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|We loved \\"Horton Hears a Who\\", adults and children alike.  It was refreshing to have such a funny movie with no objectionable language.  We give it 5 stars!
B00006CXSS|5.0|arrived in great shape - much appreciated - exciting material to look at over and over again
B000005JA8|5.0|Given all the ink spilled over this particular record, it is doubtful that I can add anything worthwhile.  Despite this, I feel compelled to add my two cents. Yes, Trout Mask Replica is strange, off-putting, and to many ears, unlistenable.  But I, for one, can't get enough of it.  How many albums, forty years after being released, still sound like nothing else in the Western rock canon?  Not only that, but Trout Mask Replica doesn't sound dated in the least.  Pick any random album from the late 60s, and chances are, most will know when it was recorded.  However, the good Captain and crew created an album that sounds like it could have been recorded last week, or eighty years ago, or a hundred years hence.  That, at least, marks Trout Mask Replica as a notable entry in the rock canon.<br /><br />But what really endears this album to me, and many others, is the fact that despite all of its inherent strangeness, its still fun and intriguing.  I've personally listened to this record dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and am still finding nuances I hadn't heard before.  Also, different aspects and layers of sound become more apparent while listening on headphones, or hi-fi speakers, or even car speakers.  The music here is so layered and textured that one could spend a lifetime listening and still discover new aspects.  In some ways, TMR is more akin to modern visual art, a school to which Don Van Vliet belonged.<br /><br />If you've made it this far, you have an idea of what's being offered here.  Free-form jazz, the rawest electric blues, and a myriad of unconventional musical ideas coalesce into one of the most intriguing and unique rock albums ever committed to wax.  If you are tired of the banal mediocrity being passed off as rock and roll these days (and really, throughout all of pop music history), then Trout Mask Replica is worth your while.  If, however, you want to, as Moondog (one of the few artists comparable to Beefheart) put it, die in 4/4 time, then steer clear and embrace your Top 40.  As for me and the other converts, we'll be groovin' fast and bulbous.e your Top 40.  As for me and the other converts, we'll be groovin' fast and bulbous.
020530902X|5.0|English is my second language, but I have used it a lot in many different ways; school, university, informal e-mailing, chatting, journalism. I can't believe I haven't read this book before now.<br /><br />A friend of mine at school showed it to me once but I forgot all about it. But when I was in New York during the Christmas holiday I met a guy with a guitar at Bar East on 90th and 1st who said, \\"If you write in English, there's one book you need to have: The Elements of Style.\\" So I went home and bought it right away.<br /><br />I read the book from front to back in a few days and loved it. Strunk's direct, yet caring and humouristic style made me smile and think at the same time. I felt a certain bond to this man, and he lived a hundred years ago!<br /><br />I recommend this book to all people who write. Letters, articles, surveys, essays, term papers, books, comics, scripts, whatever.
0143035711|4.0|Chickenhawk is the author's personal account of his experiences as an army helicopter pilot during the Vietnam War.  The book chronicles his experiences from his entry into flight school until his discharge from the army four years later.  Mason gives a detailed accounting of his experiences and his feelings, relating the events and holding nothing back.  His storytelling gives an impression of the war as long days of boredom and monotony, punctuated by various brief and extended periods of pure terror and brutal warfare.<br /><br />Mason presents himself as a thinking, feeling soldier caught in a hellish war.  He sees and feels the suffering and inhumanity the war inflicts on his fellow GIs, enemy soldiers, and on the people of Vietnam, and he relates the bravery and cruelty of both combating armies with an even hand.  He also pulls back the curtain hiding the bureaucratic underpinings of the army and gives us a glimpse of how some men suffered under the inhumane indifference of army rules but other worked the system to their advantage.<br /><br />Mason only touches tangentially on the political reasoning behind the war, and focuses mainly on his personal experiences.  But he feels the futility of the war, the irrationality of fighting a foe that blended in and out of the jungle shadows seemingly at will, and of defending a people that didn't seem to appreciate US involvement in their affairs and actually may have been the enemy, hiding in plain sight.<br /><br />All in all, a harrowing, insightful story, and a good read.
B001M4YZ90|1.0|I RENTED THIS MOVIE AND AM SORRY TO SAY IT WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY.  IT IS DISGUSTING AND NOT WORTHY OF A GREAT ACTOR SUCH AS GERARD BUTLER. YOU ARE A TOP BOX OFFICE DRAW AND SHOULD BE DOING FILMS THAT DESERVE YOUR NAME. THIS MOVIE IS A GAY PORN MOVIE WITH  VIOLENCE AND AN ATTEMPT AT COMEDY. NOT A WHOLESOME UNDERSTANDING OF HOMOSEXUALITY. I AM A GREAT FAN OF MR. BUTLER BUT WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS ONE. TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. IT DOEN\\"T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|It is kind of funny when you read what people have to say about this movie.  Like anything else in pop-culture, for every ten people who love it there are ten more who think it's terrible, or boring, or too violent.     The movie is not terrible.  It is fast-paced and entertaining.  Nolan starts with a number of threads at the beginning and brings them all together by the mid-point of the picture.     \\"The Dark Knight\\" is faster paced than \\"Batman Begins\\" but that is to be expected because with any good comic-book or superhero adaptation...the first movie should always be about the backstory or how Batman came to be Batman.  Sometimes it is done well like in \\"Iron Man\\" or \\"Batman Begins\\" and sometimes you get \\"The Fantastic Four\\"     These movies are almost like the James Bond movies in that the movie is only as good as its villian.  In this regard it is Heath Ledger that takes this movie the extra mile.  Many in here have said that if he didn't die soon afterwords there would have been no big deal over his performance...that could not be more untrue.  His performance has nothing to do with his death.  He delivered the most chillingly real picture of evil on the screen since Hopkins in \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\"  The performance was picture perfect, from the designer suits, to the unkept hair, to the tick of sticking out his tongue like a serpent.     Helping balance the chaos on that side are real grounded performances from Christian Bale and Gary Olman (I defy anyone to find a movie in which he gived a subpar performance!)     The special effects are fantastic, but they never become a crutch for Nolan because at its heart this is a character study.  Some would probably have liked 2+ hours of mayhem, but those are probably the same people who hated \\"3:10 to Yuma\\" because there were not enough shoot-outs.  These movies are about the men behind the action, not the action itself.     I am dissappointed by the lack of features.  If a company is going to market a special edition and charge you more for it, it should be bursting with extra stuff...but in the end, you buy the movie for the movie.
0783240236|4.0|Having heard a lot about this movie I decided to check it out. The plot is Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) decides to bring some lovebirds down to Mitch (Rod Tayler) a bachelor whom she has just met in a pet shop. Melanie is a rich socialite who we get the feeling doesn't have a whole lot to do. She goes to Bogeda Bay about 60 miles from San Francisco. That's when the fun starts- if you can call it that. She is attacked by a sea gull and meets Mitchs's family- his mother played by Jessica Tandy and his kid sister. There is a love triangle going on between Mitch, the local school teacher, and Melanie.   So Melanie meets Mitch's family- the overprotective somewhat needy mother and cute sister. So now come the bird attacks... The attacks are very realistic. Not to spoil it but there are some horrific attacks on a kid's birthday party and at a school. There is one part were the birds are massing in one spot behind Melanie who is oblivious to it. No one does suspense like Hitchcock.   What I like is the dynamic between the characters. Mitch and Melanie form an attachment, we get to see the motivation behind Mitch's mother's actions, and all of the main characters throughout the attacks form a bond with each other by the end. Overall, an excellent movie and one I would watch more then once.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|&egrave; un film bellissimo con musica, ambientazione e fotografia eccelse.........Edward Norton a dir poco favoloso e anche Giamatti bravissimoooooo...peccato che abbiano scelto la Beal come interprete femminile (&egrave; comunque un bel contorno)... vada retro ai detrattori e, per favore, non paragonatelo a The prestige(che personalmente non mi &egrave; piaciuto neanche un po')
B00005JKG9|5.0|Having spent years in direct sales including selling door-to-door, this film really had a hold on me.  It's a window into a world of fear and desperation caused by stale leads, shattered self-esteem and lurid opportunity.<br /><br />Classic David Mamet dialogue may as well be machine-gun fire with this brutal group.<br /><br />Jack Lemmon is heartbreaking as the sad sack.  Pacino turns in his always-solid work.  And Alec Baldwin steals the show with his cameo performance as the ball-buster sent in from \\"downtown\\" to slap these guys around.<br /><br />Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey... what a cast.  And no one hits a false note.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor.  Check it out.<br /><br />This is powerful stuff.
031606792X|1.0|SPOILERS or SPOILED ROTTEN in Breaking Dawn's case!    -Why did THIS book conclude what up until this point had been an enthralling series?    -Why were we teased through all the make out scenes in the first 3 installments, just to have the first actual love making chapter begin with the line, \\"the sun, hot, on the bare skin of my back, woke me in the morning.\\"  Don't be alarmed.  You didn't blink, there was just nothing to miss.    -Why after getting married, did Edward suddenly become a pansy?    -Why couldn't we have even more chapters declaring Edward's beauty in hopes to make up for the idea that he had no real personality?  At least he didn't from Bella's perspective.  Unless of course, HOT (though not literally) can be considered a character trait.    -Oh and while we're on the \\"not literally hot\\" topic, why is shivering in  the arms of the man you love sexy?  Moreover, ladies, can you imagine being intimate with an icicle?  Tempting, I know.    -Now back to perspectives, why even bother having 2 books from Bella's point of view, when she was alot less interesting as a vampire than she could ever dare to be as a human?  Perhaps we can blame Edward's BORING venom?    -Oh and why a needle injection?  If the transformation really HAD to happen, couldn't the scene have been more romantic, where he ripped her throat out with his fangs? (well, that would've been my happily ever after at least).    -And although Jacob is my favorite character within the series, why did he get a book devoted to him and not Edward?    -And WHY did Jacob suddenly become too boring to even be considered annoying or even BE considered for that matter?    -Resume or whatever it's name was, um, just WHY?!    -And if Jacob imprinting on her wasn't disgusting enough, WHY did the author have to take it a step further by saying, she will be a full grown woman at seven? Seriously?!     -Why was Charlie more concerned about the score on the football game than the fact that his daughter was now afreak?    -Why did the author wait until the last few chapters of the book to introduce 70 more characters, just to have their purpose be meaningless in the end?    -Oh and even more importantly, why did we have a couple of chapters devoted to Bella obtaining documentation for Jacob and Resume, if in case she and Edward were to die during the infamous fight, just to have them not only live, but there to be more talking than actual fighting in the end?      -Why does Edward even find Bella desirable?  Oh right!  He can't read her mind, or least he couldn't.  Though now that he can, can we have one more book where he comes to his senses?     -Why was this book soooo LONG?  I swear it could've been condensed to 450 pages and re-written altogether at that.    -And to piggy back that thought, WHY was everything happening so fast, and yet, it felt like the story was going nowhere?    -And seriously, WHY did Bella get EVERYTHING she wanted in the end?  I mean, I get the whole happy ending concept, but seriously, why?
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This product was very good once it arrived. No complaints about the product but the seller on the other hand was horrible the item was late and I never got an email back from the seller when I asked about where my product was. So to sum it up the product is great and the seller is just horrible.
B0016K40KY|5.0|There is no other word to describe the experience of viewing the 2012, 5Oth Anniversary, Blu-ray edition of Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean Great epic. For TV viewers, though, it requires the largest screen your money can buy, for this epic was made at a time when no VHS, laser, or DVD were even envisioned. For those lucky to have seen it in the large screen, either in its initial release (as I have), or the 1989 re-mastered, \\"Director's Cut,\\" then the general release in select theaters, even the new Blu-ray edition will not do. But it is the best compromise possible, for the 4-disc version offers so much extra material, not available in the best biographies and critical works on David Lean's works. For those already familiar with the the 2008 Collector's Edition, on David Lean's 100th birthday, of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and the not so different in contents than the 2000 leather-bound box 2-disc edition by Columbia Pictures, the new 2012 Sonny Picturesd Blu-ray 4-disc edition will easily fill some of those gaps with lively narratives and comments from the likes of Peter O'Toole, at 80, Martin Scorsese, or Eddie Fowlie. There is plenty here to enjoy. The \\"coffee-table\\" book is distinguished for its stunning, high definition stills of the adventure in the desert, and the many quotations from the likes of Steven Spielberg's, Robert Bolt, and many others, while the essay by Jeremy Arnold and and the Preface by Leonard Maltin provide good information, if not for the Lean scholar, to whom details of production are familiar, but to the general reader who wishes to be informed on the production of this giant project that took more than two years to complete. The book features the actual notes from from Maurice Jarre's theme of \\"Lawrence,\\" reviews from the time the epic movie was released (1962), and a sources/bibliography section that mentions such important works by scholars on Lawrence as Robert Morris's and Lawrence Raskin's \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" and Adrian Turner's \\"The Making of Lawrence of Arabia,\\" along with works by Kevin Brownlow, Sandra Lean, and Gene D. Phillips.<br /><br />But the real bonuses come in the high definition Blu-ray edition of the movie, based on the recent work of the Sonny Pictures Technologies studios. Disc #1 features the film, all in one disc,stunningly clear, in the proper aspect ratio of the original of 65mm original negative, painstakingly restored after many months of work in the Sonny labs. Disc #2 opens with a contemporary narration of Peter O'Toole, whose memory at 80 seems to be flawless, and his sharp wit adds to the variety of recollections of the epic adventure of filming. O'Toole pays tribute to Lean as a great director and leader as only he can; adding that he could have been great no matter what he had chosen to do. The rest of Disc #2 contains familiar material from the two previous editions, Adrian Turner narrating \\"The Making of Lawrnce of Arabia,\\" with Norman Spencer and Omar Sharif adding recollections of the venture of their own. Disc #3 is the real treasure trove for both collectors of trivia, film buffs and scholars. First, is the feature showing the \\"Deleted Balcony\\" scene, narrated by Anne V. Coates, the original editor of the film, who also helped Lean and Robert Harris to put together the 1988 version of the restored film. She explains that the balcony scene is placed there only for \\"historical\\" purposes, since the voice of Jack Hawkins, who was dead at the time (1988), could not be recovered. This is the famous \\"seduction scene,\\" where Allenby persuades Lawrence to resume his campaign to take Damascus,a vital piece that explains Lawrence's sudden change to reverse his decision after the Derea indident, where he was tortured. The next feature is an impression by Martin Scorsese, who gives his insights about Lawrence's enigmatic personality, as Scorsese only could. Next s is an analysis by Sonny executives involved in the Blu-ray edition of the film, Chris Cookson, President of Sonny, Grover Crisp, vice-president, and Scott Ostrowski, digital colorist. Wipes show the difference between previous picture quality and the undeniable clarity of the Blu-ray version they produced. The disc contains other features, the most endearing of which is a 120-minute recollection of Eddie Flowlie, made in 2000 (and thence not in high definition) the Lean prop-man and factotum, who travels to Jordan, Spain and Morocco, in the actual spots the film sequences where filmed. It is informative and fun to watch and hear.<br /><br />There is also a disc with Maurice Jarre's music, where the entire composition is recorded. Yes, the 4-disc edition costs--perhaps too much at $67 (down to #57 since), but, for me, it shines, and I got my money's worth., Grover Crisp, vice-president, and Scott Ostrowski, digital colorist.

0670019925|5.0|David Lodge is not a flashy writer, but he is an extremely good one. Superficially, his predilection for working the same, relatively narrow, ground (he is a master of the academic novel) might seem constricting. But each of his novels delivers fresh insights, with his signature blend of intelligence, wit, and genuine affection for his characters.<br /><br />\\"Deaf Sentence\\" is no exception. Although it's not as hilariously funny as some of his earlier books, it is - like all of his work - compulsively readable, and ultimately very moving, in an understated kind of way. Lodge's description of the various indignities that deafness brings is hilariously funny and so utterly convincing that you know it has to be based on first-hand experience. There is far more wisdom about aging in this unassuming story by Lodge than, for example, in Julian Barnes's recent, migraine-inducing, bloviation about his own mortality.<br /><br />When I think of the trio of Julian Barnes, Martin Amis, and David Lodge (I try to think of Christoper Hitchens as little as possible), restaurant analogies come to mind. Amis is the risk-taking molecular gastronomist, brashly confident of his own genius, and hey - if the diners don't always appreciate the flashiness, that's not his problem. To his credit, when he's on target, he can be sublime. But the brilliance is hit-or-miss. Barnes is closer to Amis than he might care to admit, thought perhaps not writ quite so large. In general, the quality of his work doesn't fluctuate quite as much, but he is still capable of succumbing to navel-gazing, and cleverness (or perhaps his consciousness of his own cleverness) is definitely his Achilles heel. You'll be served some extraordinary meals chez Barnes, but there will be an occasional inedible mess. At the risk of beating this analogy to death, David Lodge, perhaps at the cost of never reaching the Olympian heights attained sporadically by the others, never disappoints, reliably serving hearty nourishing comfort food that leaves the reader satisfied and looking forward to the next visit.<br /><br />That might sound like damning with faint praise, but is actually meant as the highest compliment. I can think of very few novelists working today who are consistently such a delight to read. He joins a very short list of authors (Margaret Drabble in early and mid-career, Anne Tyler) whose work is reliably intelligent, thought-provoking and interesting without being flashy. Such craftsmanship is rare and not something one should take for granted. I look forward to each new novel by Lodge, and thus far have never been disappointed.eaves the reader satisfied and looking forward to the next visit.

015206396X|2.0|While I loved the idea behind this book of someone having a special skill called a Grace. I was very disappointed with the way the story went. I felt like I was reading a women's lib book and not a story. I liked the writing style and the basic idea, but was sad that the main character never seemed to stop being a tom boy. She was just to manly for me through the whole book and I didn't like that. Also didn't care much at all for the extra things she added with the villain of the book. That I felt was unnecessary. I wont be reading this again and I will suggest it to others only with a clear heads up to some content first.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Loreena McKinnett's followup to an abbreviated album of winter/holiday music is superb, as usual. The songs are sung beautifully and make the cold winter nights around the holidays and even beyond, bearable. The music is perfect as background music to holiday dinner parties or just intimate settings with just a few people. It also is perfect calming music to listen to during the sometimes stressful holiday times amid the hustle and bustle of shopping, baking, etc. I highly recommend this CD along with any of the other ones that Loreena has put out for our listening pleasure.
0439023483|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. :) I will be happy to read it again and I can excited to know there will be a second and third in  the series. I can't wait. I would totally suggest this book. It is an interesting story. Well worth my time to read it :)
B000R7HY0K|2.0|I saw the Grindhouse movie combo at the theaters and had a great time with Planet Terror. Death Proof should have been shown first because it was such a very s-l-o-w, long and drawn out movie as to put one to sleep.   Y-a-w-n.  It finally built to a great, climactic ending that was awesome and finally made the movie sort-of worth watching.
B000002KDM|5.0|I'm ashamed to admit that the very first James Taylor song I heard was back when I'd never heard of him. A cover of \\"Fire and Rain\\" showed up on a new Blood Sweat & Tears album I'd just bought, then the next thing you know I heard his own version of it on FM. But it took this landmark third album for his sound to carry its own ID card no matter who did one of his songs. A guy I was jamming with at the time did the title track from this album and I immediately spotted it as a Taylor song by its sound alone--I'd never heard Taylor's own version of it. It proved that his music carries his own stamp no matter who does it. He even brings his own style to covers like Carole King's \\"You've Got a Friend\\", which I hadn't known was hers when Taylor released it as his second single. But you listen to King's own version of it and you spot the fact that Taylor even copied her piano intro on guitar. I think that was what made Taylor a success, critical mention of a \\"thin, reedy voice\\" notwithstanding. For a singer of the \\"folkie\\" genre to be that skillful on guitar is not in the least a given--the other one who comes to mind is the early Paul Simon. Chordal accompaniment is usually the rule, even for the iconic Dylan. When you get someone who can be a really outstanding player as well as songwriter, well, that doesn't happen every day. That's when you start to influence others. Friends of mine spotted an unintentional Taylor influence in one of my own songs back then. When musician fans tend to sound like you in some of their own work, that means that you're a star, no matter where you stand on the charts or how long you're there. Which makes \\"Hey Mister That's Me Up There On the Jukebox\\" from this album a bit ironic. It has to have been well before this release that it was necessary to point out who that is on the 'Box. Play him on XM and you don't need to look at the screen tag.
B001MW0J2E|5.0|It's 4:01 in the morning after a grueling 12-hour day at work.  Couldn't sleep and this album's on.  Genius comes in flits and flickers.  If you blink, you just might miss it.  Word of advice: Don't.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I sort of knew before I viewed this film that I might be dissapointed and I was.  The first two IJ flicks were great while the third with Sean Connery was lagging. While Shia Leboef was great Crystal Skull tried but the whole film sucked in the end.  Too bad.
1591841666|5.0|Seth says in this book that what he's sharing isn't anything but the simple and obvious truth.  There's no pretense to a miracle answer, insider secrets, or get success tips.  Seth just tells us how come it matters when you are in the dip and when to know you're not.    Lots of reviewers are critical of this book for the very reason that it's simple and general in nature.  I believe some of them are missing the point.    It's not about hard work paying off.  it's about giving up bad tactics, bad strategies and bad beliefs. Quitting them in essence.  Giving up the things that don't work and won't work for you.  Give up old and ingrained habits. Give up being part of 25 hobbies or scattering yourself over dozens of attempts at things.    For me this book really describes the last year of my life at work.  I've been in the dip again and didn't even realize it had a name.  For me it was about not just putting in my time, which is never that simple to get ahead, but deciding to 'lean into the dip'.  While others were choosing to resign themselves to misery and drudgery, I chose to do some of my best work ever as a programmer and analyst.  Now while others have come through, still miserable and nothing changed for them, I'm taking over planning their work and managing contractors.  Oh well for them.    I'm endorsing this book because I've lived it several times in my life already.  It's really simple. Like Yodda, 'do or do not'.
1881273156|5.0|This is a GREAT book for couples with issues!  It really explains a lot and gives insight on how to love your mate in a way they can understand and appreciate.  I think every adult should read this book!
B001QD7SF0|3.0|In the 1/5/09 issue of Rolling Stone, David Fricke describes Bruce \\"cracking himself up quoting one of the opening lines\\" of the album opener, \\"Outlaw Pete.\\" He goes on to label the song as his \\"little opera,\\" a modern-day \\"Rocky Raccoon.\\"    Sorry, Boss, I tried to get behind your fun. Really. I found the song to be more than a little annoying and cute, and by the time the album's second track kicked in, \\"My Lucky Day,\\" I was really relieved that the saga of Outlaw Pete had run its 8 minute course.    I would classify this as a good, solid, 3-star Springsteen album. He may have returned to the meticulously overdubbed, heavily produced Phil Spector \\"Wall of Sound\\" antics of the \\"Born To Run\\" days, but this is no \\"Born To Run.\\" And while Bruce may feel that this album belongs in a category with \\"The Rising\\" and \\"Magic,\\" they're both stronger efforts. Even on the stronger tracks, I found myself thinking \\"Haven't I heard this song before?\\"    Three stars. New Bruce. That's it.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I was very pleased with the quick service and the condition of the cd's. Thank you!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth is awesome. Great buy for families or those interested in seeing more spectacular sites around the world.
B001KL3GY0|5.0|Picking up on what another reviewer said, the synth here is, well, great. There are a dozen or more bands (Talking Heads et al) that are invoked for FF's new CD (and on boy, find them extra tracks) for an upbeat, nice indie-goes-pop sound that all works.<br /><br />\\"No you girls never\\" sounds like the big FM playlist winner, and rightfully so.<br /><br />A nice, analog-sounding, lower- production-sounding killer album worthy of your hard-earned bucks!
B0012RM4NG|5.0|This is without a doubt the best Iced Earth offering.  While most of their stuff is solid (except for Glorious Burden), Something Wicked is simply the best.  From the first track to the closing trilogy, Schaeffer and co. get after it and deliver a metal classic!  The remastered version simply adds to the experience!  Get this CD!!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this for my wife after I couldn't get tickets to the show.  She has loved it.
141690977X|5.0|This book was really great. It pretty much goes through all the excuses women come up with for reasons why the men aren't calling or want to be with them.  It's really awesome because all the examples are stories and experiences of real women with real problems and when you read it, it makes so much sense.  A lot of these things are so obvious but people often forget to or don't want to come to the conclusion that maybe the guy just doesn't feel the same way.    I think the main point of the book is that if a guy is interested, he'll go after you, no matter if he's shy or gaveng other issues. And yes, there are exceptions, there always are and the book mentions that as well, but for the most part, the guy will go after the girl.    As I observe my life and others' around me, I find that it's true.  Think about it. How often do you see a relationship work out when the girl is chasing the guy and the guy is kinda of/kind of not interested? Not often. The girl always wonders\\"o well does he like me?\\" But when a man is interested in the girl, and she feels the same, the relationship works.  I see this everyday with my friends and what they go through because they don't want to be alone, so they try to find guys they like, but the feeling isn't mutual, and the relationship only lasts for a very short term.    My boyfriend just read a few pages and he said he liked it. Oh and guess what, he asked me out, he calls when he says he will and does what he said he'll do. And I never have to wonder if he's really into me or not, because I know he is.    If you're a woman who wants to understand why she's in such situations, I recommend the book.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I listened to this CD when it was first released, and shelved it. Maybe I wasn't mentally prepared or just wasn't in the mood for DT at the time.    I picked this up again a few weeks ago. Upon completion of the disc, I couldn't believe how fantastic this 9th studio album is! For newbies or old time fans, some advice when listening to this CD: play it more than once until it sinks in! Don't give up on SC like I did after one listen. This is a GREAT group of songs and another excellent studio offering from the best prog band on the planet.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought my first Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller this month, and what a cool thing I've been depriving myself of for the last two years. I never thought that a silly controller vibration could add much to the gaming experience....but don't knock it `til ya try it certainly applies here.<br /><br />One of my original Sixaxis controllers that came with my 60GB PS3 started malfunctioning. So I decided that I'd replace it in conjunction with starting [[ASIN:B000X1TC0U Dead Space]]. The first Dualshock effect was when I had to stomp on something in the game; the controller literally shook in my hands adding a sense of reality to the action that I was taking in the game. And of course when I fired my first shot, the controller recoiled with the blast.<br /><br />If you don't have one these already, add this to your cart. If you only have one, you need another for when you play with a friend or while your other one is charging. Man, I don't know how I ever played games without a Dualshock! This thing really makes gaming on a PS3...well...better. Ya feel me?
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Errol Morris has done a service to history by getting McNamara to candidly talk about his life experiences and the lessons he has gleamed from them. By letting McNamara do most of the talking, Morris avoids introducing any bias or pronouncing judgment on his subject. The accompanying soundtrack is one of the best I have seen in a historical documentary with a particularly haunting quality and complements the cut scenes very well.     At a particular point in his narrative, McNamara talks about the assassination of JFK and how he got around to selecting the final resting place of the President in Arlington National Cemetery. As he ruminates over those dark days of Nov 1963, you notice that he fogs up. Long disparaged as an impersonal number crunching automaton, this moment offers the viewer a rare direct look at the all too human side of McNamara.     Other reviewers before me have done a great job in discussing the merits and demerits of this documentary. Suffice for me to say that the 11 lessons are universal and well applied to any situation whether in business or war. The one that has lingered with me the longest is the first one - \\"Empathize with your Enemy\\". After watching this documentary, we empathize with McNamara too and understand the mindset that drove all of his actions. McNamara has done well to share his lessons with reasonable frankness and objectivity. This ultimately is his penance.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I got a great deal on Season 4 of Lost. Amazon had this collection at a great price and it was brand new. I am very happy with this purchase.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I really like Jillian training techniques, she is straight forward and let you know that modifying exercise (from hard to easier) is not an option, if 300 lbs people on Biggest Looser can do it, anybody can. She has the know-how and gets the job done, loosing fat and strengthening bodies.   I wish that someone would come up with a DVD that has different workouts for the whole week (every day), so it keeps it interesting, maybe with the blue ray technology it will be possible, the disk has more space.   I recommend this DVD to all.

B0001HLVS2|5.0|Master and Commander is bloody superb. This is a historically authentic picture (not to be mistaken for actual events and people but bits and pieces of real history sown together) takes us aboard Captain \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey's (Russell Crowe's) British war ship the \\"HMS Surprise\\". You can almost feel the sting of the frigid air and smell the salt water in this truly immersive exploit into the Napoleonic war between France and Britain. The Surprise and her crew are set in 1805 and have direct orders to hunt the French warship \\"Acheron\\" on the South American coast.  This is one of those rare epic movies with literally no flaws despite its grand nature. Peter Weir directs this saga of British life on the high seas and holds his cast to nothing short of impeccable acting. The battles scenes are gripping full of cannon ball explosions sending shards of wood into there victims along with fierce sword fighting. This movie is triumphant at demonstrating how difficult it was to be aboard a sea fairing ship whether an British officer or deck-hand. It conveyed well the highs and lows of moral and how punishment was swift and firm. Best of all Crowe demonstrates how a captains judgment is a tight rope leading to victory or defeat. Although only winning two Oscars this movie was nominated for ten including best picture and director only losing the other eight categories to Lord of the Rings the Return of the King (Hobbit Billy Boyd is among the cast of M&C).     Acting (Impeccable): Some of the cast members are quite young but even they deliver strong believable performances. Max Pirkis (who also gives a strong performance as the young Gaius Octavian in the hit HBO show Rome) character is young Midshipman William Blakeney which he plays with depth beyond his years. Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany, who is also terrific) role demonstrates effectively how crude medical attention was but how without it many more souls would die. Bettany and Crowe relationship as captain and doctorplus friends adds many more layers to this already deep story. This leviathan of a movie has scene after a scene of deep heartfelt acting that never missed a beat or felt out of place.     Score (Brilliant): The music is a variety of selected baroque and classical pieces some of which are played by the highly noted Yo-Yo Ma. This score hits the nail on the head throughout the whole sea faring adventure. The music does an eloquent job of setting the tone of each scene enhancing the overall mode whether hopeful or depressed. It's one of my all time favorite scores.     Wardrobe/effects (Realistic): The outfits are varied and printed out to the exact detail from the British officers, able shipman, Royal Marines to the French navel outfits of the time. The ship looks spectacular whether in calm or rough seas. The cannon exchange from ship to ship is exhilarating due to the high quality effects maintained in this picture. Be warned there will be blood (no pun intended) in the battle scenes not a movie for younger viewers.     Last take (solid purchase): This is a must see for all lovers of Patrick O'Brian books (this story was taken from several of his books), Horatio Hornblower, Russel Crowe, or lovers of an epic British driven Navel adventure. No female cast or campy love story thrown into this movie but there also wasn't any need for one when keeping to historical accuracy. Did I mention must see?

B000X5SPBI|5.0|the Complete Third Season of Supernatural does not disappoint one bit. The box set includes all original 16 episodes along with awesome commentaries and deleted/extended scenes. The DVD extras include a hilarious gag reel and two awesome featurettes: a 25 minute look into the visual, special and make-up effects of the show and a 10 minute one on the Impala car and the truck's weapon cash. All around a great buy for any fan of the series, I continue to watch mine over in over, coming back to favorite episodes in my spare time.
B000AO4MDM|3.0|I received this product, and I was very excited (C'mon, System of a Down on Vinyl!) I got it pretty fast, but the packaging was not up to par, I'm surprised it did not break in transit. The disc was slightly scratched from sliding around the disproportional plastic sleeve. It was new though, just freshly scuffed. Played fine, except for one track, the first one on the A side, that was scratched the most. Ah well. Otherwise, Awesome find! Love the vinyl sound, definitely a conversation starter.
0375703764|5.0|I cant say aything less than AMAZING. Its a must read for someone that wants a little scare with out the gore.

B001IF266C|5.0|I confess, I'm still getting used to the glitzy, glammy sound Goldfrapp had in its last album. Now it has gone to the other extreme -- floaty, instrumental pop.<br /><br />Fortunately it doesn't take long to get used to this new style, because it fits Goldfrapp like a fine silk glove.The dancy electrobeats are translated into shimmering downtempo, the hard edges softened into acoustics -- it's a floaty, dreamlike, bittersweetly beautiful little album, full of swirlingly addictive instrumentation and wistful vocals.<br /><br />It opens with the mellow rippling guitar, overlaid with an ethereal fog of sorrowful violins, a touch of synth, clips of birds singing happily. \\"Only clowns would play with dull balloons,\\" Alison Goldfrapp sings in a girlish slur. It's pretty hard to hear what's she singing (\\"Roasting, roasting, roast indeed, mahogany\\"), but the exquisite quality of the music makes up for it.<br /><br />This is where you know it's all going to work.<br /><br />And she doesn't disappoint in the songs after, startling with the quivering synth and satiny vocals of \\"Little Bird\\" (\\"We dance by the sea/the land of blue and gold/is where we were free/do you lie, lie lie?\\") and catchy, sunny \\"Happiness.\\" And it sets the tone for some of the songs that follow -- exquisitely sensuous pop melodies, odd chorale ballads, dramatic electronica, and the sprightly dancy chamberpop of \\"Caravan Girl.\\"<br /><br />The highlight has to be \\"A&E,\\" a warm fragile little melody spun that ripples with piano and soft keyboard. And as the melody picks up into a swirling instrumental speckled with electronic blips, the tone turns a bit darker. \\"I was trying to phone you when I'm crawling out the door.... I was feeling lonely, feeling blue/Feeling like I needed you/Like I've woken up surrounded by me/A&E...\\"<br /><br />Most bands can't pull off a total change of sound -- they're going to disappoint a lot of, and often the quality of their music suffers because they're simply not used to this style. Fortunately Goldfrapp is not one of those bands -- it's hard to imagine anyone being turned off by the lush, bittersweet sound of this album.<br /><br />The songs are spun out of a lot of acoustic instruments -- waves of elegant strings and a low-key piano, with some acoustic guitar and jazzy drums to keep the melodies grounded. But they haven't totally abandoned electronica -- there's a trip-hoppy downtempo flavour to these songs, mostly expressed in warm, misty synth that gently wraps around the chamberpop and folky melodies. But you do get some kooky catchy organ again toward the end.<br /><br />And Alison Goldfrapp sounds like she's having fun. Her flexible, silky voice can become whatever the melody requires of her -- girly slurring, terrifying perkiness (\\"We're here to welcome you!\\"), an otherworldly balladeer -- but most of the time she sounds lovelorn and wistful.<br /><br />And while the music may be more accessible, the songs she sings are flavoured with depression, moments stolen with a lover you'll never really have, and even drug overdoses (\\"It's a blue, bright blue Saturday, hey hey/And the pain has started to slip away/I'm in a backless dress on a pastel ward that's shining/Think I want you still/But it may be pills at work\\").<br /><br />Assuming you don't already have the full album already, this deluxe version is a great find -- it has some really gorgeous live performances (which sometimes look/sound like fairy rock concerts), interludes from a TV show, and a cluster of music videos.<br /><br />These are particular treats -- there's the lushly pastoral \\"A&E\\" with a disheveled Alison in the middle of a forest,surrounded by dancing leaf/tree monsters and woodland animals; \\"Happiness\\" follows a chirrupy white-clad guy who hops everywhere; and \\"Caravan Girl\\" is a peppy, quick affair that follows a girl who skateboards far from home.<br /><br />Goldfrapp have really outdone themselves in the shimmering, exquisite \\"Seventh Tree,\\" a sharp deviation from their previous music. Utterly spellbinding from beginning to end.
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell alwasy provides food for thought.  This book is very entertaining and iteresting.  I love all the anecdotal evidence althogh he has statistics too.  It definately makes you think differently about success.  As usual, I'm not sure he got the title right.  He seems to not come back around to the idea of outliers very well.  I'd title it Hard-earned Success or Lucky Duck.

B000059RL3|4.0|Everything that needs to be said about Marvin has already been written here.  What's Going On is a rare, precious and honest album that reveals a rare artist with a real soul.  The amazing thing is how addicted Marvin was to cocaine in general, but how he managed to dig deep enough to his soul to perform this wondrous piece of music.<br /><br />The gift of Marvin Gaye that most audiences relate to really refers to What's Going On.  One has to marvel at his crystal clear, effortless vocal lilt and lyricism - this is a collection of different genres spanning r & b, jazz, pop, gospel and funk...which blends together seamlessly through the intricate weaving of Marvin & Co.<br /><br />The title track and Mercy Mercy Me are really immortal songs. I can't think of anyone else who could sing about brutality, oil, radiation and mercury and make it sound so achingly lyrically good.<br /><br />The world lost a genius too fast, but at least he made this, and the subsequent Let's Get It On - both of which represented a true quantum leap from his commercial days in Motown and sealed his proper place in music history.<br /><br />**BONUS DISC INFO:<br />The two disc Deluxe Edition is well worth it.  CD 2 has the classic 1972 Live at the Kennedy Center concert. Of the other three official live Marvin Gaye albums that I have - this is probably Marvin's most polished and precious performance.  He goes full throttle into it, without hiding behind a big orchestra or back up singers...just pure Marvin and soul.  Highly fulfilling as Marvin plays the piano and sings.  Marvin sounds FRESH and ready to bare his soul here.  It's well worth listening to every note - though Marvin omits Mercy Mercy Me for some reason.<br /><br />Unlike subsequent live performances, Marvin did not feel compelled to rush or perform \\"for the audience\\" but instead served the music.  He doesn't try any showbiz moves or schtick that he would in later years.  For this alone, it's truly a genuine effort.  Admittedly, Marvin was so insecure, he felt like throwing up - but thanks to the powers that be, this performance was preserved.<br /><br />PS Watch the live rendition of this somewhere on youtube - and witness a master performance.e throwing up - but thanks to the powers that be, this performance was preserved.

B0009A40ES|5.0|I saw this movie after I read the book hopeing that Hollywood hadn't butchered it or watered it down to it was urecognizable but that wasn't the case. This movie was good. It took Brett Ellis's novel then made it rated R. If there was a true film adaption then it would most surely be rated X. But this was a really good version of the book.  Christan Bale playes Patrick Bateman who's an ego mniacal wall street broker that specializes in mergers and aquisitions, though if you ask him he would tell you that he does murders and exicutions mostly. He plays the perfect man, with the perfect body, that is living out the American dream of fame and fortune. But he has a much more dark and sinister side in the night he will go out, torture, rape, and kill people ranging from the hooker to his coworkers.  This is definitly not for people that don't want to see anything gross. He eats people and smears them on the walls of his apartment.  So if all the blood and gore doesn't automaticlly sound like a turn-on, then Christan Bale running around naked with a chainsaw sould do it. ;)
0736063684|4.0|I'd say a good portion of my adult life I've been rather thin. Not crazy skinny, but thin. When the New Years came around I made a conscious decision to try and add a little bulk to my frame. Since I don't really have much body fat, it's always been painfully easy for me to just hit the ground running. Laziness was always stopping it seemed.<br /><br />Anyway, this book like others have said, is not a \\"how-to\\" book. It's just mainly divided into body part sections with specific exercises that target certain muscles. So far I've picked and chosen different exercises and made my own little regiment. You could take a couple exercises from this, mix and match, and hit the gym each time targeting different muscle systems.<br /><br />So far it's been about a month and a half since I started with this little book, and the results have been good. My brother before would only do bench presses, and a handful of others, but he's never targeted anything else. This little book shows you all the different muscles you can target, and how to do them and variations on them.<br /><br />While my results aren't earth shattering, after a month I've got some relativly decent form and moderate bulk. I stick to about 30 mins to an an hour a day doing various exercises from here and another book (From Scrawny To Brawny) and have seen noticeable changes and have gotten comments from friends who havent seen me in a few months.<br /><br />A few negatives are the illustrations are sometimes a little off. There are only 1 or 2 large pictures per exercise and it can sometimes be hard to tell exactly what is going on with the people in it. The book itself also seems to be a little on the flimsy side, it seems the pages are almost coming loose.<br /><br />With that being said If you're a little on the scrawny side, or thin side, and looking to add some weight, this is a good place to start. I had a little home bench set I bought from academy and at [...] and this book you can acheive pretty decent results if you stick to a regiment. Sometimes it's hard from me to roll out there and do a bunch of sets, but I try to do atleast SOME sort of reps and the results have been good.metimes it's hard from me to roll out there and do a bunch of sets, but I try to do atleast SOME sort of reps and the results have been good.

B000GDH9AA|4.0|This album is for hardcore Clapton fans who know his history.  He was beginning his period of collaborations with famous sidemen, having completed a two year run with Phil Collins and was doing a one off tour with Mark Knopfler.  The sound quality is not the best but it serves as an interesting historical document.  Clapton had retired his famous Blackie Strat which he had assembled from several guitars; it was simply worn out.  He designed a new model with Fender with electronic pickups. The sound is fuzzy but with an ethereal quality.  EC has since returned to guitars with traditional magnetic pickups.    Knopfler's distinctive picking adds another layer of texture to the songs.  This was also the period where Clapton began reviving his Cream material, beginning with a rousing renditon of White Room at the Live Aid show in 1985.  WR, Badge, Sunshine, and the leadoff song Crossroads are all well played in a style that you won't find on any other EC live album. Dire Straits' Money for Nothing, a huge hit of that era, is an extra treat.    The mark of a great artist is that they improve with age.  Clapton never ceases to amaze me (I've seen him 8 times in 40 years).  Today, academically, EC would be a Distinguished Professor.  Think of this album as his PhD.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|It is unusual when the most inexpensive option works out great.  If you are thinking of buying a monitor arm, buy this.  This product is great, and I'm very happy with it.  It's very sturdy--holds my 22\\" with no problem.  The kit is very versatile--from the desk/grommet mount, to the monitor size, and all the angles/viewing positions it can be in.  I am very very pleased with this purchase, i was a little worried since this was under $70 when other models were over $100, but this product exceeded my expectations, and does more than i thought it would/could do. Hurray for Ergotron!    In some of the reviews folks complain about the arms being too tight or stiff to move freely--all the joints have adjustable allen screws to manage the tightness of the movement; so if folks think it's too tight, they just need to loosen the screws with the supplied allen wrench.  This is not really an issue with this product at all, since all the joints have adjustable tightness.  If you don't loosen them, they will be tight and won't move--but isn't that what you want: user control...
B000VWYNNW|4.0|3 Essential Facts about This CD (IMHO, of course):    (1) SOUND IS WORTH IT ALONE: The audio is improved remarkably: much more \\"direct from the soundboard\\" presence all around; so much so that I think this is partly why some folks complain that it sounds like a whole different album.    (2) EDITS NOT A DEAL-BREAKER: The original was itself \\"impure\\" and full of edits, and I think only three edits really matter here. The short missing funk improv near the beginning of Whole Lotta Love is a problem, but the track sounds so much better now that it's worth the tradeoff to hear the other 13+ minutes so well remastered. The edits of No Quarter and Celebration Day do ruin them - the originals were the best versions of these two songs available anywhere. Keep (or get) the original CD for these two songs.    (3) WHY MOST PEOPLE SHOULD GET THIS CD: I firmly believe the core \\"Led Zeppelin sound\\" most general, non-hardcore-Zep rock fans know and love is from the 1973-1977 period, when (for better or worse, depending on your perspective) Plant's vocal style matured; the band added funk, acoustic and prog-rock elements to the bluesy style of 1968-71; Page's guitar sound got sharper-edged and more \\"metallic\\"; they added more reverb and effects to their live performances; and they played huge venues and really gelled as a touring act.     This CD is by far the best-sounding, most complete document of that era, period. It's not the only live Zep you might want to have, but I do think it's essential for any collection, no matter how small or large.    (The only other officially released live recording whose performances are consistently good enough to rival it is the second disc of the 2003 DVD, which contains about 1/3 of the fantastic Aug 4 1979 Knebworth concert, and a very nice example, from Earl's Court 1975, of the acoustic \\"mini-set\\" they started doing in the mid-'70s.)

B000003TA4|2.0|I was born in 1968, so I was 23 when Nirvana broke. Not a teenie bopper but not as old and grizzled as I am today. I was fortunate to live in a small town that had a true high school radio station, WBSD, that had access to a full \\"college radio\\" catalog. Where I lived I could also get WXRT out of Chicago. Between these two stations I got to listen to a bevy of alternative/new wave music from about 1979 on (when I first began to listen to music in my own right, not being subjected to Boney Fingers by my dad.     So by the time Nirvana came along twelve years later and \\"changed the landscape of music\\" I found it to be completely derivitive and about as fresh as my gym clothes were in middle school. I wlll say Dave Grohl's drumming was very good (if not a little too in front in the mix), but the remainder was, to me, a rehash of what had been done before, and without the classic 1990's 15 year old snotty attitude that Nirvana brought on board (and Dave Grohl jettisoned for his own output by and large), was done better by the likes of The Pixies and Killing Joke to name but a few.     Earlier bands brought a wider viewpoint to their music which lends itself to universality, and can still have something to say to the 40 year old father of two, with job hassles and a mortgage, while Nirvana evokes the troubles of the 15 year old who gets a pimple before a date. It's less about real alienation and more about teenage whining. Basically it is less weighty and more teen oriented. Once in a Lifetime by the Talking Heads resonates even MORE today, while Smells Like Teen Spirit evokes a time when small things seemed to mean so much until real life enters the picture that is.     So yes, Nirvana \\"changed the landscape\\" by making corporate Whine Rock available to spoiled kids who had no idea what real problems were (I'm not saying that some listeners had no problems, just that to explode as they did they peddled angst to spoiled middle class kids). The 80's were about hair bands singing ballads to the chicks and rockers to the guys, and the 90's were a rejection of this pablum by replacing it with something just as easily digestable. Just add a dash of whining and \\"irony\\" and voila! 90's rock that was dripping with \\"importance\\".     We are in troubled economic times. The last 25 years prior were a binge of consumption with borrowed dollars. With that explosion of available dollars rolled BILLIONS into the hands of the tweens and teens, and the record companies put out an even greater amount of product. Nirvana was the perfect, over-hyped band in the right place and the right time, and unleashed a cascade of mopey teen rock for the newly minted 12-16 year olds who had $20 a week to spend versus those of us in the 70's and early 80's that got fifty cents or a buck.    It's sad because Cobain obviously didn't want to be a part of such a commercial machine singing about teen angst the rest of his life. He reached back and did covers from a time when music could put really weighty material, but by then the machine had already rolled him over. Fortuantely Grohl and Hole were more than willing to ride the machine as far as they could without qualms.

0618918248|4.0|I found this to be a great book. It is was intellectually stimulating and the logic is carefully crafted. Being a christian, I found the arguments compelling enough to question my own faith, although there were a few loose ends still hanging and I got the sense that Dawkins also opened new questions in my mind without answering them? I would have given this book a 5-star rating but the final chapters in the book were largely discomforting. It was as if Dawkins was advocating for a new \\"religion\\" instead of the abandonment of all religion as he claims. The forcefulness of his arguments and some of the abominable ideas that he suggests about the state's role in child rearing makes me very wary of his atheistic ideas which seem to approach the ranks of atheistic discrimination and intolerance for theists. I only give this book a 4 star rating for the consciousness raising material in the first half of the book which I think every believer should contemplate.

You'll com to know Jack Aubrey and Steve Maturin and a cast of ancillary characters. Woven and interwoven the plots intrique and make it near impossible to put the books down.

Just the opening shot, when we look at that cab driving out and we see the big paintings on the walls, it was just visual sophistication...<br /><br />The movie is not an action story... It's a compelling drama with realistic action that works for the story... And it is done for an emotional reason... Cruise gives a dynamic performance as the cold-blooded killer... Foxx is terrific as the honest hearted guy driving a cab for twelve years, and both come together suddenly like a spike in a railroad right here in this point where things were going to change in one night...Jamie Foxx finds himself in the presence of a real adversary in the form of this bumbling cab driver, who has never fired a handgun in his life...
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I have been working out throughout my pregnancy (I'm 23 1/2 weeks right now) and really enjoy this workout.  The first time I did it, the lunges and squats were kinda tough, but since it has gotten easier.  The workout is a nice pace and feels shorter than it is to me.  I love that she reminds you to keep your abs engaged and I like the oblique work since you can't lay flat it is nice to work the abs in creative ways.  Some days that I do this, my lower body is more sore than when I do my non-prenatal dvd's using weights.  I think it must have to do with my form and the sequencing of the exercises and reps.  I wish there was a little more upper body work but I can easily add a few exercises if needed.  The tricep dips are tough and work a much needed area.  All in all, I love it and will continue to do this workout as I am able.

I understood more of it and liked it a lot! As crazy as their life was together,once they found out the truth about each other,I think  they got along better and saw each other in a totally different way. Their chemistry was amazing...just one look and you could sense it.<br />In my opinion, the excitement of their lives and their likes beats any romance.

At a particular point in the movie and that too when Wall E manages to get into the spaceship you wonder if the movie is still going to be all plastic and metal with only robots but the movie has surprises in store. The only other fault with the movie is accepting the fact that robots can feel love inspite of the development of artificial intelligence and robotics for the time period of the movie.    Color, screenplay, design of the various environments, animation and story all get full marks. Eve was a gem of a creation. The music played in the background in one of the best scenes of the film, Eve's and Wall E's dance in space was beautiful.     After The Incredibles, Wall E is the best to come from Pixar. Worth getting it on DVD although it wasn't made just for kids.
0307454894|5.0|I bought this book on Sunday afternoon and even with two tests this week, I managed to finish it by Thursday night.  The style of writing is so seductive and beautiful, it is woven like a spider's web.  I thought that his discussion of Hanna and Michael's love in the afternoon was so tragically beautiful, it was something that you know that cannot last but at the same time, you will find yourself savoring the passages when they are together.  I think that the way that Michael's father explains this situation is beautiful, but even underneath that, beyond who is responsible for what, there is the beauty of a story of a woman who has allowed her own life to be diminished because of the simple fact that she doesn't want anyone to know that she cannot read.  I mean even though she is illiterate she still manages to have a great affection and love for literature.  I personally love to be read to, I have lots of books on CD and I usually listen to them at night when I sleep, there is something deeply beautiful about someone reading to you.  When my husband reads to me, its is something that is beyond the book, its another form of intimacy.  In this book, the intimacy isn't the kind that is found between bodies but there is however something deeply initmate about his reading to Hanna.  I loved this book and I am going to see the movie this weekend, which I don't expect it to translate but I am hoping.  This book was emotionally and poetically stunning to me, I know why Hanna did what she did, but I don't think it had anything to do with what she was on trial for.  I don't mean to belittle the suffering of the Holocaust because that would be so wrong of me, only to say that you have to understand that this is all a sort of backdrop to the story.  I love this book!
B00009P57O|4.0|This one was quite a smash, their most successful ever with the inarguable chart busting kick-off single \\"Every Breath You Take\\" which really made this album take-off.  It is one of the finest sounding productions and rich with a fine mixture of guitar and synthesizer sounds and the extra fine tone which A & M strives to master in all their recordings.  Then followed the hard-driving, angry-toned, smashing single \\"Sychronicity II\\" which really rocked the airwaves with its strong beat.  \\"King of Pain\\" came out with a rather strange twist at first with its back and forth transition from relaxed sounding to irksome desperation and its strong back beat sound.  So I got the album, but on cassette and waded through side one as I got charged up with their upbeat \\"Sychronicity I\\" which I rarely heard a song move so fast with a hammering beat and it flowed smoothly into the next song \\"Walking In Your Footsteps\\", from psychology to dinosaurs, which was more symphonic than hard beat, but with nearly the same tempo. Then \\"O My God\\" broke the flow but still had the hard driving beat, followed by the annoyed Andy Summer's stoned \\"Mother\\" which was a very silly get it off your chest song followed by the sharp change to a perilous themed song \\"Ms Gridenko\\".  The closing starting with \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" bring the hammering beat to a more subtle, more relaxed tone with the desert mood of \\"Tea In the Sahara\\" followed by the ludicrous \\"Murder By Numbers\\" (not on the LP) and just as well not--with a rather useless theme or purpose.  What makes this album stand out for me is it was one that I had mixed emotions about but got to like the more I listened to it.  The cover art is sure capturing.
B00000DC7L|3.0|Brian May is in a very unfortunate position when it comes to his solo career- no matter what he puts out it will always be compared to his work with Queen.  Another World is no exception and the very best on the album falls short of the mark.    Make no mistake- everything that makes Brian May great is here- the stunning guitar work, the incredible arrangements and harmonies, etc.  There is even some good song writing but at its best it is only \\"good,\\" the reason being that Freddie Mercury, who made the songs \\"great\\" is no longer with us.  Minus Freddie, Brian steps up to the mic and falls short by a long shot.  On most of these songs I found myself thinking \\"Well, that would be incredible if Freddie was singing it.\\"  I know its not fair to hold Freddie Mercury's absence against May, since its certainly not his fault, but its still the Gods' honest truth: without Freddie, power rockers like \\"Business\\" quickly deteriorate into a poor blend of Whitesnake and Michael Bolton, turning the promise of an incredible song in to dentist office music.
B001O34NMI|5.0|This movie is just funny. The characters and how the interact is just hilarious. It kept me entertained, as I hope was the point of the movie, because if there really was a deeper side to this movie I missed it.     It made me lulz.  It's kind of like one of the movie adapts of Alice in Wonderland. Not the book, mind you, but like the movie adapts...    The movie follows the story of a very strange, lonely, unhappy guy (Cusack) who, do to his wife's insistence, gets a job in a filing company. The office itself is crazy and his co-workers/boss are just as strange.   He soon wants to cheat on his wife with a very snobby, hot woman that works on the same floor.  Shortly after his attempts with her, he finds a portal to the mind of John Malkovich behind a filing cabinet in his office. Then just random, hilarity follows.     I did not fully understand the ending, and it was a bit disturbing, but still, a hilarious film.
0446677450|2.0|Here's the substance of the entire book:  1. Be smart about investing and keep looking for better opportunities for your money.  2. Take advantage of the power of compound interest.  3. Learn elsewhere how to make clever business decisions.  4. Follow these simple rules, and \\"you too\\" can become rich without working hard.    Open the book, read the first or last 10 pages and put it back on the shelf.  From there, you'll be motivated to learn about finance without wasting your time reading the same stuff twenty times over.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|The best film of 2008.  The best film in the last 5 years.  the best vampire film ever made.    Available with English subtitles for adults who can read.
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|John Frusciante continues to create original music, which far exceeds his contributions to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.    His vocal range has alkways been an understatement, but this album, in particular, proves he's one the greatest vocalists of all time.    This record showcases everything's that's right in the world of Fru.    Here's hoping he finally tours with a full blown band backing him.  We can always wish.
1577314808|1.0|Don't even go here. Start with Thich Nhat Hanh's The Miracle of Mindfulness (and indeed anything by him), some Suzuki, the Dalai Lama's The Art of Happiness if you want something more topical. These are true philosophers, people who came by their wisdom over a lifetime of study, and the books are as clear and simple as can be. If you're dealing with depression and want to use mindfulness (or the NOW as this pompous creep relabeled this ancient practice) to help center yourself, there's a terrific new book, The Mindful Way through Depression, that is written by individuals with the education and experience to combine psychology with eastern philosophy. Sitting on a park bench after some sort of meltdown does not a spiritual teacher make. This is probably the most irritating book I've ever tried to read.
B001NE80P4|3.0|I enjoyed HSM 1 & 2. But I was disappointed with this one. It was more of the same (which is becoming a theme at Disney.) In this \\"final\\" movie the guys are dealing with graduation and where they will end up at college and what they will end up majoring in. Once again, there is the normal drama that threatens to separate Troy and Gabriella... but luckily there is a musical coming up at the end of the year that brings them back together again. What luck!<br /><br />I know that this is a musical but does it have to have the same plot three times in a row? Couldn't the writers focused on the other characters? Why would Gabriella fall into the same pattern again? I started to become disconnected due to the lack of growth in the characters.<br /><br />My children enjoyed it (and would be angry if they knew I was giving it this low a rating!) I enjoyed it for what it was: more of the same. If you've seen the other movies then you'll see this one no matter what the reviews say. If this were a movie on its own, though, I doubt you would enjoy it so much.
0743246616|3.0|The recipe\\"s in this book are very rich. The famous magnolia cupcakes are good but the frosting butter cream vannila is far to much frosting.<br />I would go with the standard two cups confectioners sugar not four to six.<br />The frosting looked good and spread good but put you in a diabetic coma to eat it.<br />Their are other recipe's that are not so rich, and ones that call for to much cream, I would modify them. if you like really rich recipe's you will like this book.<br />it's a bit much for me
B001LRJH0U|1.0|All the characters (except Jeremy Irons) sounded like they were reading to us. Their deliberate pronounciation of every word was annoying, to say the best. Ed Harris' struggling to find the right words was just way overdone and unbelievable. However, I could have just filed this movie anway with a bad 'B' western but Renee Zellweger made the whole movie downright unwatchable. She was totally miscast for this movie and looked and acted ridiculous as a western character.
B001LF4IA6|3.0|It's interesting to me that the two best songs on Bruce Springsteen's 2009 release are the first and last, and one of them was an afterthought. The cinematic sweep of \\"Outlaw Pete\\" harkens back to Bruce's narrative days (think [[ASIN:B000BJS4OY Born To Run]]), and then there's a song from the cinema, the Golden Globe winning \\"The Wrestler.\\" Like Bruce's theme to [[ASIN:B0012GMXTM Philadelphia]], Darren Aronofsky's film inspired him to a great theme song. Spare and bold, the underdog story of Mickey Rourke's [[ASIN:B001GCUNVW comeback movie]] profiles the toughness of pursuing faded glory so well that you wonder why it's deemed a bonus track when it outshines most of \\"Working On A Dream.\\"<br /><br />Which is to say that \\"Working On A Dream\\" is a mixed bag. Much like his ambitious double CD release of [[ASIN:B0000028SR Human Touch]] and [[ASIN:B0012GMWCA Lucky Town]] in the early 90's, much of \\"Working\\" seems rushed out with songs that feel incomplete or even thought to their quality. I thought \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" from [[ASIN:B000V8I2QU Magic]] was a lightweight, but it sounds like \\"Rosalita\\" next to \\"Queen of The Supermarket\\" here. While I can also appreciate the raw bluesiness of \\"Good Eye,\\" it sure sounds like an unfinished song to me. Same for \\"Suprise Suprise.\\"<br /><br />However, there are plenty of thing to like on \\"Working On A Dream,\\" including the title track and the melancholy \\"Last Carnival.\\" The dedication to Dan Federici seems to tie to the somberness of some of this CD's best songs (\\"Outlaw Pete,\\" \\"The Wrestler\\" and \\"Last Carnival\\"); these songs get offset by the amount of fluff. Springsteen is still in fine voice (even if the album succumbs again to the loudness wars) and this album actually benefits from being apolitical. On the spectrum of Springsteen's catalog, however, it is an average release, earning its fourth star by virtue of the inclusion of \\"The Wrestler.\\"
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Our daughters grew up with this; we never missed a Christmas watching it. It is warm, charming, beautifully done and very special to us. We are going to be grandparents in the fall and we want to make sure we can carry on the tradition.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I was a little hesitant of purchasing this CD/DVD for fear that I would have problems with my TV.  However, it was not the case and seeing Muse perform live in all their amazing glory really amped it up on my big screen.  The CD is great too, but does leave out a few songs that were present on the DVD.  I still enjoy trying to match Matt note for note in my car, which has proved difficult.  Thankfully, my windows are ususally up so I can spare innocent bystanders the horrible quality that is my voice.  Well, in comparison to Bellamy's anyway.  Great product overall, and at such a low cost!
1400031567|4.0|As in many mystery stories, the main character in this novel is supposed to have some expertise with guns.  Unfortunately he must depend on Mankell, whose expertise is apparently nil.  His detective has the (predictable) distaste for firearms and Mankell has him &#34;set the safety&#34; on a revolver.  What's next?  The &#34;well-oiled&#34; cliche?  The &#34;smell of cordite&#34;?  (Even the great James Ellroy once had somebody putting a silencer on a Colt Python.)  So get off your butts, mystery writers, and do a little research.  Would that kill you?
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I really liked his music on first listening, then I realized all that he was saying. Moody and a little sad, but that is what I love. The words are so meaningful and insightful. I love this man's way of expression. All his music is really good. A lot of variety in styles, but still all his own. A little reminiscent of Gregory Page's style but more serious. Buy all of his c.d.s. you will love them.
B000KJU182|4.0|First, it's nice to finally see this out on DVD with an excellent widescreen transfer. The great cinematography alone made this cry out for a good DVD transfer, which was released by Warner Brothers in March of 2007.    As for the story, a nice, innocent kid getting brutalized by an incredibly-sadistic 1700s ship officer is not always easy to watch, but this is one of the better under-publicized films of its day. It sill holds up, some 40-plus years later.    It was an apt choice to cast Robert Ryan as the sadistic \\"Claggart.\\" Ryan played mostly villains in his career and is extremely effective in that role here as an intelligent-but-sick-and-vicious bully. In fact, his character in Billy Budd remains one of the most memorable villains I've seen in a half century of movie watching. It isn't just his deeds. The looks on his face alone as he delivers his lines make him fascinating.    Peter Ustinov gives a great performance as the captain of the ship and a man who has to make a big, big decision about Mr. Budd, played by a young and boyish-looking Terrence Stamp. The character \\"Billy Budd\\" is about as pure and innocent as some of the characters Jennifer Jones played in the 1940s, such as Cluny Brown, Bernadette Soubirous or Jennie Appleton. Also of interest is Melvyn Douglas as the aging seaman.    This is simply a powerful and very involving film, one that is hard to forget.
074356619X|4.0|I have live by \\"the secret\\" nearly my whole life (before this came out) because it is a very Pagan way of thinking. Very helpful in trying to better yourself and figure yourself out. Great helpful tips and tricks to help you have a happy life. Worth the listen, just come at it with an open mind, and try a few things suggested, and you will find your life changing is ways you never would have expected (for the good of course).
B000NQRE0K|5.0|This is a stunning transfer, one of the better transitions to Blu-Ray I've seen and especially impressive since the film is 15 years old.  Detail is sharp and the colors magnificent..  Anyone fortunate to grab this when Amazon was selling it for $10 got a steal.   It's still a great bargain for under $20.    By the time you are done watching this, you are emotionally spent with the involving story and totally satsified with the beautiful photography you've witnessed over 177-minute epic film.    What makes this movie so intense is the passion of the main character: Scottish rebel leader William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, who put his heart and soul into this performance. Add to that a powerful story, great cinematography, excellent action scenes and even some humor....and you have a classic film that looks incredible on Blu-Ray.    Scrap your old edition and get this one: you won't be sorry.
B0000011P7|3.0|Depending on how one views the landscape, this could be seen as the second solo effort by Ian Anderson, since the Jethro Tull album \\"A\\" was slated to be Anderson's debut, but was released under the band's name due to a decision by record company executives.<br /><br />Released in November 1983, it is a collaborative effort with keyboardist Peter-John Vettese that strides back into the progressive rock/electronics of \\"A.\\" The 10 tracks are equally split between Anderson and Anderson/Vettese compositions, while clocking in at 38:29.<br /><br />The standout selections are Made in England, User-Friendly and Different Germany. The electronic period of Anderson (solo/band) is oftentimes overlooked by fans and critics, but it shows an artist attempting to use a variety of paints on a familiar canvas to keep the sound fresh, which is a creative walk down a lane of brilliant light.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I thought the producer did an excellant job choosing this soundtrack. As stated by Stephenie, Muse was one of her inspirations for writing and I can see why, it's amazing!
B001N26GHU|3.0|My copy from Amazon of the vinyl edition has some different band/artist's songs pressed onto disc 1 side 2 (where the song \\"Working on a Dream\\" and two others should be.) Has anyone else had this problem, or was I just \\"lucky\\"?  I'll be contacting Amazon about returning this album, but I was curious to see whether other strange pressing issues have been seen by others. (By the way, I like the music (I've listened to the MP3 downloads that were included with the record) so that explains the 3 stars.)
0380820846|4.0|Romancing Mr. Bridgerton was fun and cute, and I liked the characters, especially the heroine Penelope Featherington, who's had a secret crush on Colin Bridgerton since she was 16 - it's been almost a decade, and he still only knows her as a casual acquaintance.  Their progression from his neglect to friendship and then love started kind of randomly, considering how long they've known each other, but Colin is a very nice hero, and I was happy that Penelope finally got him after all those years of silent pining.  For some reason, though, slogging through the last half - about the time that they get engaged - was a huge chore.  Before this unfortunate turn of events, however, I enjoyed myself, especially the opening chapter.     Along with the romance between Colin and Penelope, there is the mystery of that witty Lady Whistledown to be unraveled in this fourth installment of the Bridgerton series.  So as not to spoil anything, I'll refrain from commenting on it, except to say that this plot thread kind of distracted from the romance for me.  I didn't like how Colin became annoyingly irate in the second half of the book, or that Penelope became a damsel in distress at the last moment.  But it is all resolved satisfactorily in the end, with a rousing, heartwarming finale for Lady Whistledown, and everyone's happy.  Yay.
B001DPC4RS|5.0|Great vinyl reissue: sounds absolutely great, vinyl is very quiet, has a thick sleeve.<br />It's not cheap, but I think well worth the money.
1401322336|5.0|I bought this for my daughter after she borrowed it from the library and fell in love with it.  With explanations on cuts of beef, various spices, assorted pastas - you name it, practically everything - it provides more than recipes, it provides an understanding and appreciation of the art of cooking.  The perfect gift for any new cook.
159448385X|4.0|Where do I begin...this beautiful, sad, horrifying, and disturbing novel grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  Fall in love with the characters and you'll find yourselves cheering outloud at their triumphs and crying over their inhumane exhistance.  A story to pass down through many generations!
B0014YVC6W|4.0|The artificial love story for the gals, not the finest acting from the leads, a predictable story line: all should make this a bomb.  But Johnny Five makes it fun, and the graphics are good.  Maybe not an Academy pick, still it's a good entertainment, and not just for families.  Despite the slightly sexy bathtub scene (no nudity) and PG situations and language, it's a good entertainment.  With a nod to Eisenhower's warning on the \\"military-industrial complex\\", it shows the dangers of overzealous war industries in a mostly lighthearted context.  This is a fun movie despite its flaws, and Johnny Five really does steal the show.  It's a keeper.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|If your all about the little looks and smiles and happenings that cause too people to fall for each other this is the DVD for you. Its about four hours building up to the climax.  Not bad though, it was a nice Sunday afternoon movie.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Near the end, Jack Lemmon is recanting his sales success story with Al Pacino.  Pacino has a look on his face that seems to show his joy of watching Jack Lemmon at the top of his game...as well as his character's appreciation of Shelly closing a sale.  Priceless...  What's chilling is realizing that Williamson (Spacey) gave Shelly (Lemmon) a bad lead...people who were \\"insane,\\" and simply \\"liked talking to salesmen.\\"  Ed Harris is wonderful as the office complainer, the hothead who bitches about all aspects of the company he works for.  Alan Arkin delivers a huge performance from such a small role.  Pacino is a bit over the top with his mannerisms and rantings, but as usual, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the role.  Priceless dialogue, right up there with the \\"Pulp Fiction\\" sequences.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is a classic - right up there with Monopoly, Risk, and Scrabble.  You're not going to find a better value than this package, I call it the \\"economy\\" edition.  Like Monopoly, there are a lot of different styles and releases of this game.  This particular one requires more assembly than some others.  This is the original, and the game takes a good 15 minutes to set up for the first time.    This is a beautifully crafted strategy game that forces you to use different techniques to claim victory.  There are tough decisions on where to build your settlements and what you want to spend your resources on.  Trading also plays a big part in the game, cooperating with your opponents can pay off until you finally turn on them at the end for the win. You'll need at least three players to play, and if you also buy the expansion set, you can play with up to 6 people!      Best of all, the game always had a new feel to it because the board itself is customizable and changes with every game, providing for unique strategies every time.    This a game everyone should know how to play.  The only downside to this version is that the look of the game is cheap; complete with flimsy cardboard and uninteresting pictures.
0646497855|5.0|This is a good book that produces great results. It improved my Reading and Writing skills a lot in a very short time (two weeks) and I was able to receive much higher score.     It is very practical, yet short enough to be digested in a matter of hours, which means that it leaves time to focus on practicing. As I had only two weeks to prepare for the exam, \\"Target Band 7\\" was the most useful resource of all the available materials.     I have managed to improve my writing skills by a whole Band using the writing technique, also the section about various kinds of reports was useful.    As for Reading, I found the strategies work well as I have realized that there is no need to read the whole text to answer successfully the questions.
0439806119|5.0|Honestly, I did not think that Uglies sounded very intriguing when I was first introduced to the book; I only started to read it because of my friend's great persuasion skills.  However, once I gave it a chance, I was pulled into the plot swiftly and could not put it down. Westerfield's creative ideas fascinated me! They forced me to ponder on how our world might be in the future, and the oppressing reality of society's definition of \\"beauty\\" that women and men alike have to put up with in order to gain some precedence in the world.      Usually when I read a book, it's most annoying if I can predict the entire plot within reading the first chapter or two.  That did not happen when I read Uglies.  I hardly knew what would come next, and only twice was I able to predict the next move.    Uglies is 425 pages long, but a very easy read.  Even with my busy life, I was able to finish it in a day and a half.  It kept me anxious to know more, and when I closed the book at its end, I felt a hint of disappoint that I had to give it back to my friend.      To anyone who likes a fast-paced, easy-to-read, creative narrative, I strongly recommend this book.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|13 songs in 13 days. No written lyrics, no other musicians to help, nothing but the improvisation of one man both on vocals and on instrumentation. And he puts out the best album of last year. Impossible? Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, that man is Paul McCartney. He's that guy from that band, you know.<br /><br />The album starts off with a screamer, and it seems like it's directed at his ex-wife (he sings - or screams - about giving love and getting betrayed). In fact, if you read the lyrics of all of these songs, even though they're improvised there is actual meaning and symbolism and metaphor you can derive from the words. There is some poetry here.<br /><br />\\"Two Magpies\\" is sweet and understated, it's kind of like you're listening in to Paul while he's alone with his guitar and reminiscing in song. The best word to describe \\"Sing the Changes\\" is BRIGHT. The album has a lot of references to light, and that's probably why this is the single - you can practically see the light while listening to this. \\"Traveling Light,\\" the fourth song, is the opposite - it is dark, mysterious, with a haunting vocal from Paul.<br /><br />\\"Highway\\" is the kind of 70's rocker they don't make anymore. It has Wings written all over it. \\"Light From Your Lighthouse\\" is maybe the catchiest song on the album. Paul double tracked it with a very high vocal and a very low vocal, giving it a very funky sound. At this point in the album you may find yourself dancing, or at least bopping your head and mouthing the lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Sun is Shining\\" is just a beautiful song; if you saw the light earlier in the album, now it's just pouring in. In \\"Dance 'Til We're High\\" Paul unintentionally made a great Christmas song, there's just something very Christmas-y about it, and I don't mean in a cheesy way - I can imagine it in a great movie, in a scene with snowflakes falling and a family dancing together.<br /><br />\\"Lifelong Passion\\" should be listened to with your eyes closed - it's a richly visual song. These are the first three lines:<br /><br />Step into the misty mountains<br />With your hair like ambered honey<br />To feeling warm and breezes<br /><br />He improvised that!? Well, you'd think the rest of the album would be filled with duds, filler material, but it's not. \\"Is This Love\\" is a very meditative song with beautiful music and light, distant vocals - I think George Harrison would have liked it. I think John would have liked the next song, \\"Lovers In A Dream\\" - it's very psychedelic - the kind of song the Beatles would have released to trip people out (like Revolution #9). The album ends with two experimental instrumentals, \\"Universal Here, Everlasting Now\\" and \\"Don't Stop Running.\\"<br /><br />Well, I've done my sales pitch for the day (it's the least I could do for the guy who has given me so much great music to listen to). If you're still reading this that means you haven't clicked Add To Cart yet. Go on, buy this album!
031606792X|5.0|The entire Twilight series is very well written.  I don't often become captivated by a book series, but this one did me in.  I'm not going to spend a lot of time writing a long review explaining all of the details of why I loved this book.  I'm only going to say, I finished the series today and for the life of me I can't figure out what I'm going to read now.  I think anything else will be a let down.  I for one, hope that this truly is not the last of the series.  If it is, I only hope someone will turn it into a TV show because waiting every couple of years for the movie is too long to wait.  I loved Dark Shadows as a child, and think that the build up of the characters in Twilight through Breaking Dawn has more than enough to survive on TV for years.  I want to see what becomes of Renesmee and Jacob!

I walked around in a daze for a while after reading just pondering his life and the events that lead up to his death.  He will also be a hero to me and it's a shame that his life was cut too short.
0061150142|5.0|I ran into two women at the store one day while looking at the massive collection of books by Jodi Picoult on the shelf.  I asked a lady about the author, and she told me that THE PACT, MY SISTER'S KEEPER, and NINETEEN MINUTES were the best.  I didn't buy a book that day, but later I ran across SECOND GLANCE and bought it.  I couldn't put it down, and I soon became eager to read more.  My brother gave me an Amazon.com gift certificate for Christmas because I told him I wanted the three books above.  I bought all three and started with THE PACT.  I can't even begin to describe how well-written, thought-provoking, and emotional this book is - what an AWESOME book!
B001EO748M|5.0|I anxiously have waited for the second season, and it did not disappoint!  The actors totally embrace their characters, and you get swept up in the emotions of their torments.  The relazation of the brutality of the era gave me a new respect for those who lived in those turbulant times.  The sets, costumes, and atmosphere are breathtaking as well as the soundtrack.  Jonathan Rys Meyer is outstanding as King Henry- his intensity and passion set the bar for the remainder of the cast- and they rise to the occasion.

B001NFNFNA|3.0|\\"Changeling,\\" the latest endeavor from director Clint Eastwood, is not only about the ordeal a loving mother, played with determined passion by Angelina Jolie, suffers after her young boy (Gattlin Griffith) goes missing, and the unusual lengths she must go to recover him, particularly after the Los Angeles Police Department closes the case after uniting her with a boy who does not appear to actually be her own. It is also about the lengths people in power will go to preserve that power and their prestige. In the real world, outside of movies, we live in one of the eras in which citizens throughout the US are as distrustful as ever of those with power and influence and this film can be taken to also symbolize a kind of indictment of such people and the abuse of that power.    Indeed, almost everything within the film is calculated to hit extra hard at our emotional chords, to tug our heartstrings in support of the heroine, fill us with rage and disgust at the sight of the actions of the powerful leaders in the story, and, of course, jerk the tears from eyes. Eastwood's more recent films in particular are known to contain some sentimentality but, until now, he's refrained from hitting us over the head with the overexuberant brand of saccharin, meritless emotion found in many other films based on real-life accounts of peril and injustice. Yet, that is a particular test \\"Changeling\\" does not quite pass, though it is still far above some of the biggest and worst weepies in the room (\\"Tsotsi,\\" anyone? Or, perhaps you would prefer shedding tears to \\"Central Station\\"?).    Part of the problem is the way the central character is portrayed, not entirely due to Jolie's work, but also to the fact that she, and as such her character, comes across as rather too glamorous for the predicaments she finds herself in. Even during the most trying scenes, such as searching frantically for her missing son, dealing with a police department that is, at best, apathetic and, at worst, one ofthe chief causes of grief Christine Collins (Jolie) and the audience are made to suffer, she seems oddly beautiful in a way that leaves a disconnect, to the detriment of any realism the movie may have otherwise had, with the drama that unfolds.    As was the case in last year's \\"A Mighty Heart,\\" in which the actress delivers another impassioned performance as a woman who is, in many ways, in a similar situation--tragically wronged by circumstances and people beyond her control--it is often difficult to see past her movie-star glitter to get to the raw agony at the core of her character. A large part of this has to do with how the film visually presents her. Her hair and makeup are just right enough to flatter her, even during her most trying times within a grim psychiatric ward, many of the patients of which arrived unwillingly mainly because they were an inconvenience to the police and others in power. She is always filmed by the director of photography, Tom Stern, to look beautiful, almost saintly. That's not a criticism of his work in the film generally; it appropriately renders a vivid interpretation of a 1920s Los Angeles reminiscent of old Hollywood pictures. However, it does distract from Jolie.    I don't know if Jolie plans to take on similar roles in other films like this any time soon, but if she does it would be best for all involved if she transforms herself according to the demands of her character--with the help, whenever necessary, of the filmmakers. Too many of her performances feel adequate but also seem as if they could have been more profound than they were.    The other actors in this movie--and, consequently, their characters--suffer less from the glamour effect. John Malkovich, as Rev. Gustav Briegleb, who adopts Collins' search for the truth as his own mission--and, by extension, that of his church--infuses a more fiery brand of righteous indignity into the story, in case that of Collins herself, along with the situations that develop in thecourse of the story, don't make you angry enough.    In terms of emotional depth, many of the police and those associated with them are not much more than cardboard cutouts, especially compared to Jolie's palpable emotions. Jeffrey Donovan is Captain J. J. Jones, Collins' main contact at the LAPD who, when questioned about the identity of the boy given to her in a highly-public photo-op, steadfastly dismisses the notion that he and his unquestioningly proud colleagues, in their quest to quickly pacify the mother, may have made mistakes, and, when confronted with the fact such mistakes were made, declares Collins insane, ordering her sent to an asylum against her will. Colm Feore is chief of police James E. Davis, Jones' boss who is determined to keep the corrupt department in the best light, at least until Mayor Cryer (Reed Birney) wins his reelection bid. Dr Jonathan Steele is the head of a psychiatry ward that owes its allegiance completely to the police department. He is played by Denis O'Hare in a way that banishes any trace of humanity from the character and fills the void with nothing but contempt. The main exception to the overwhelmingly mean and callous police team turns out to be Michael Kelly as Det. Lester Ybarra, who makes an important discovery during the course of the Collins case.    Other key characters include Carol Dexter (Amy Ryan, edgy, moving, real and, as usual, unpretentious--a good example to follow), a woman who befriends Collins at the psychiatry ward; and those played by Colby French, Eddie Alderson, and Devon Conti.    The movie is obviously being pushed for the Oscars, especially for Jolie. There's even a scene in which Collins listens to the Academy Awards broadcast. It's an exercise in naval-gazing, and it is rather irritating when filmmakers place marketing campaigns for Oscars within the very films for which they would like an award. It's worse than product placement. On the other hand, due to the lighthearted nature of the scene and the fact that it occurs late in a film that is unrelentingly heavy both before and afterward, the scene could also be seen as comedy relief, a welcome respite from nonstop drama; but the same effect could have been achieved without so blatantly screaming for an Oscar nomination.    Despite the objections, the film is by no means ruined by the glamour and the oversentimentality. Rather, these are mainly a distraction from what is otherwise a compelling and memorable story, written by J. Michael Straczynski, otherwise told relatively well. The basic story is perhaps the best thing about the film, more likely than not because it it presents an inherently compelling situation. The way scenes are intricately intercut (by editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach) so as to play off each other is an old tool of storytelling that is used to good effect here, though more for dramatic effect than as an essential method of conveying the plot. Overall, the film could have been more efficient, with a few minutes being trimmed from the film, most obviously the aforementioned Oscar scene. Also, some sequences do feel repetitious in plot and especially in the emotions evoked.    In the end, while \\"Changeling\\" is an engrossing story, its distractions interfere with the film, rendering it far from perfect, and, ultimately, minor Eastwood.
B0011UCOGG|5.0|this book was full of magic huge battles and is one of the best series i have ever read take a hint and read this book
B001P3SA8U|3.0|It's a musical showcasing unknown artists who perform songs in strange but inventive ways never  heard before. It's about their de facto representative, their rise to dizzying success as well as their many troubles and, in some cases, their fall to dreadful lows. It is about their struggles (and agent's maneuvering) to be heard on the radio and thereby sell their records. It's about life in the big city and race relations during times of segregation. It's about addiction. Clubs. Showbiz. Records. Radio. Payola. Loyalty. Flamboyance. Big houses and shiny, new cars. Fidelity and infidelity. Sex. Drugs. Even rock and roll. And, it's a true story. But, it's not \\"Dreamgirls.\\" Nor is it \\"Ray.\\" Or \\"La Bamba.\\" Or even \\"Hustle & Flow.\\" Although it does bear more than a little resemblance to those films and others of similar ilk.    There are so many films of this type that there should be an actual name for this subgenre, one that sticks. This time around, the movie is called \\"Cadillac Records,\\" a shiny, new vehicle written and directed by Darnell Martin. The storyline truly resembles so many other biographies about the rise of musical legends that it almost need not be explained here, but I'll devote the next three paragraphs to a brief summary, which you may feel free to read carefully, skim sporadically, or skip entirely.    I'll bypass the typical backstory the movie features of unprivileged childhoods and young-adulthoods and cut to the chase. The \\"agent\\" is really music club proprietor-turned-record label owner Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody: \\"The Pianist\\"; \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\"), who firsts discovers a skeptical but talented Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright: \\"Syriana\\"; \\"Quantum of Solace\\") at his club in Chicago before it burns to the ground. Chess then takes a gamble by replacing the club with Chess Records, signing, as his first artist, Waters, a bluesman previously seen playing curbside, whose Southern upbringing influences the distinct sound of his music. Chess' groupof new artists grows to include Muddy's harmonica-playing sidekick Little Walter (Columbus Short), personable and cavalier Chuck Berry (Mos Def, inhabiting his character with an appropriately humorous personality), affable songwriter Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer), imposing, lady-stealing Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and independent-minded Etta James (Beyoncé Knowles, in a role with much similarity to her turn in \\"Dreamgirls\\" but better realized here). Also in the picture is Chess' devoted wife, Revetta (Emmanuelle Chriqui).    All the artists and Chess himself would eventually go on to attain \\"hall of fame\\" status but, long before that, had to deal with life in and around the music biz (see the first paragraph), including rampant racial discrimination, which touches even the white-skinned Chess, merely for associating with African-Americans, whether or not they are top musicians whose tunes are copied by other bands, like the Beach Boys, almost verbatim. As Muddy says in the narration, the only time a Black man and a White man could be seen in a car together was if the Black man was driving. In another scene, Berry is thrown out of a club he is scheduled to perform in because, to the management's disbelief, he is not White, as seen in the club's poster portraying him as such. In times of crisis, Chess spends time repeatedly telling his performers that just because they sing the blues doesn't mean they must also live the blues.    Why is the movie called \\"Cadillac Records\\" and not the more accurate \\"Chess Records\\"? Because, Chess made a point of giving each of his successful stars not only a fine house but a shiny, sleek Cadillac, complete with those 1950s tailfins, his own preferred make of dream car since the time he was a man struggling to open his club.    The whole affair is a mix of drama, comedy and, yes, music. Plenty of music. The storyline is relatively predictable--we know the general arc of the story not necessarily because anything in Martin'sscript is a giveaway but because Hollywood film biographies of artists and entertainers tend, unfortunately, to follow similar paths, no matter which medium the artist worked in, or whether the movie concerns a single individual or a larger group, such as this film does. But, as was the case in another show business musical, \\"Dreamgirls,\\" that fact does not impact on our enjoyment of the music itself. Fans of the music are in for a treat, and will undoubtedly pick up the film's soundtrack (though at my screening, I didn't notice any excitable members of the audience wildly applauding and cheering as when I saw \\"Dreamgirls,\\" but no matter).    \\"Cadillac Records\\" is much more low-key than \\"Dreamgirls\\" (more similar, perhaps, to \\"Ray\\"). Its cinematography and production design (by Anastas Michos and Linda Burton, respectively) are much less dazzling and flamboyant. And it is much less hyped. But it works reasonably well as a film, which, when making a movie, should be the first and foremost goal. Although it is not inspired enough to break away from the typical artist-biography path, it does tell its story better, is better directed, features better acting (Knowles included) and is better accomplished in terms of basic filmmaking technique (e.g., editing) than \\"Dreamgirls.\\"    Nevertheless, like any such musical, the standout feature is the fine music, the whole reason the film exists, crafted for fans and fans-to-be. But you knew that already, didn't you?
1400032717|5.0|It was hard to think of a title for my review.  I really liked this book on such a strange level.  I am the mom of an eight year old diagnoised asperger(autistic) child. I own a library of books on autism and aspergers, . . . really a library for the past 8 years I've collected a whole lot of books. There are just way to many books on autism to really review, . . of all the books I own this is the one I chose to review.  Kids with autism are so unique on such a vast level I could never say with my experience what works. Like cancer all patients require a different cocktail of prescriptions.  I can say that my little guy has truly benefitted from early intervention and is now in 2nd grade reading at a 5th grade level, and has not required treatment or support services for the past 3 years.  He has friends, seeks social situations, and really fits in as just one of the guys.  My only advice to any mom or dad out there is to get early intervention, . . . no matter what it costs, or how much of your time it takes, . . it is so well worth your while and that of your child.  With that said. Of all the books that I've read which involve personal experience this was by far the most entertaining on such a strange level this book really gave me an insight on the mind of a person with autisim.  It truly shows how extremely brilliant and loving people with autism are and I find it interesting how people diagnoised with autism are generally labledd as being emotionless.  It just seems like their minds operate on such a different level.  It is really hard to review this book and talk about what it is about.  All I can say is get it read it.  It is a fast and easy read but will leave you thinking.
B001N26GFM|2.0|Over the course of film history, both in the United States and abroad, numerous films have been made which relate, in some way, directly or indirectly, to some aspect of the Holocaust, among the darkest periods of any century and of human existence. They include those that have a popularity that transcend the subgenre and rise to become classics in a general sense: \\"Exodus,\\" \\"Sophie's Choice,\\" \\"Schindler's List.\\" Many of them involve the young in some way but there's a body of work that focus chiefly on young victims who find themselves caught in some aspect of the genocide. This decade alone has seen more than a few such films, whether they are Jewish children who are forced to endure unspeakable barbarism (\\"Fateless\\") or young-adult Germans with the courage to take a stand against the atrocities of their leaders (\\"Sophie Scholl: the Final Days\\").    \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is the latest such movie to premiere. From the United Kingdom, it is directed by Mark Herman from a screenplay Herman wrote, basing it on a novel by John Boyne. The story, experienced mostly from the perspective of children, concerns a lonely eight-year-old boy, Bruno (Asa Butterfield) newly relocated to the German countryside from Berlin, who befriends another boy his same age, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). They like each other, find they have much in common, and want to play with each other every day. But they're separated by a tall barbed wire fence that courses with electricity. After all, despite their similarities, there is one irreconcilable difference: Shmuel is a Jew and that fence hems him into the grim concentration camp to which he and his family have been sent. Bruno, meanwhile, maintains his freedom with a family headed by his father, a captain who moved them to the country when he was promoted. His new job: run the concentration camp. Visible on a distant horizon from Bruno's new room, the \\"farm,\\" as the child initially mistakes it for, is tended to by numerous \\"farmers\\" who wear the titular \\"striped pajamas\\" (really, uniforms with numbers); Shmuel is but one of hundreds of them.    A large part of the story, generally filmed by cinematographer Benoit Delhomme in muted tones, with especially drab grays for the camp and its workers, concerns Bruno's gradual discovery of the senseless hatred people can harbor against one another for no good reason. Unlike his older sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie), he is relatively slow to absorb the lessons of the tutor his father hired, lessons that purport to justify why his father's work is for the benefit of their country. Bruno, by his own admission an \\"explorer,\\" much prefers to read his fantasy and adventure books over the anti-Semitic tomb of a book his teacher assigns him to read. Another concern of the movie is the infuriating class differences inherent in such systems, as, for example, the monstrous treatment imposed on the Jewish Pavel (David Hayman), formerly a doctor, now a worker in the camp and servant in Bruno's well-to-do household.    But perhaps the most important concern of the story is naiveté. Not simply childhood naiveté but the childlike version in adults. It is this that is not only one of the most interesting aspects of the picture, but its most problematic. It manifests itself here in Bruno's initial perception of the \\"farm\\" and the workers in their striped PJs, which is one thing. More sadly, but less believably, it also is reflected in the fact that the depth of the systemic hatred and lack of humanity in Bruno's father (David Thewlis), not to mention the dark details of his new job, barely register at first with Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga), an innocent, then concerned, then indignant woman with some shreds of humanity that she fails to act upon until she sees her children become too exposed to the cruel philosophies and actions of their father and his henchmen.    As the story progresses, the level of ignorance of the two boys at its center regarding the circumstances that envelop them becomes less and less plausible, especially considering that they each witness and experience some of the abuse of the soldiers first-hand. Late into the film, Bruno has seen some of the rougher side of his father, yet, when asked by Shmuel if he is proud of his father, Bruno responds in the affirmative with seemingly a minimum of hesitation. Further, Bruno seems to have little if any doubts about his family, even in the face of his sister's rapidly increasing phobia, militancy, and hatred. Most profoundly, despite the fact that Shmuel himself toils in the camp, he does not even come close to suspecting that the explanations he is given about his and his parents' predicament, why he was transported there, and why people in the compound keep mysteriously disappearing may be weak attempts to mask something that is wrong. It's nearly impossible to accept that, when he realizes his own father is missing, he starts searching the camp for him, oblivious to the notion, despite where he is, that he may have been murdered. It isn't until the final, waning minutes in the film, when the boys--Bruno especially, but to an extent even Shmuel--begin to better comprehend the wickedness of the camp. These may be kids, but I doubt real children in similar circumstances would be as clueless as the film assumes they would be, no matter at which side of the fence the sit.    The basic conceit of the film is certainly engaging and there are many scenes that are memorable for their drama, tension, and horror, but, in its realization, the filmmakers attribute so much permanence to childhood innocence that much of the story's credibility is undermined. They assume that such innocence can continue to survive, will not erode, even under circumstances as difficult and raw as these.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Great new installment. It brings bac all the great things from the series that Fearless Fourteen was missing
B001PPGAIK|3.0|THE FILM    After many months of anticipation, Baz Luhrmann's epic motion picuture \\"Australia\\" has opened in theaters. The director of such deliciously extravagant spectacles as \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" \\"Romeo + Juliet,\\" and the giant stage phenomenon \\"La Boheme,\\" Luhrmann is indeed a storyteller but, first and foremost, a showman on the grandest scale possible, and his latest offering is no exception. Visually, his films look sumptuous, with production design that is so lavish and imaginitively unusual that the films seem to be carried along with the winds of escapist fantasy.    \\"Australia\\" is different in some ways from, say, \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" his previous effort. The new film, due to its setting in the rowdy, rugged desert continent \\"down under\\" during the Second World War, necessarily ties in with historical and social issues that are not to be taken lightly, such as the relations of the Aborigines, especially their children, with people of European descent. It's also a story about class, focusing on interclass relationships, and business and life in a harsh environment evocative of America's old wild west, and with as many social parallels.    The movie exudes Luhrmann's trademark brand of exuberance and boisterousness, which feels exciting of course, but there are several moments, especially in the first forty-five minutes or so, when such a tone is misplaced, given the dead-serious significance of what is happening onscreen at the time. Presenting the story cloaked in such a tone, along with the irreverant humor in some scenes (also something of a trademark of this director), actually marginalizes, to a degree, the very real tragedies suffered at the time: social ostracism based on race, ethnicity, class, or gender; wartime attacks on civilians by foreign countries; military camps for unwanted children; and, to a lesser extent, generational differences. \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" could afford to take a more playful approach, due to its telling of a story that, compared to that of\\"Australia,\\" seems of less consequence (though still tragic in its own way); this film shouldn't have that luxury. It is evident that the filmmakers' were well-intentioned in depicting these issues and, fortunately, this picture does not persistently remain so flippant.    The story (conceived by Luhrmann, who also wrote the screenplay with Stuart Beattie,  Ronald Harwood and Richard Flanagan) is narrated by one of those aforementioned ostracized kids, a young boy by the name of Nullah (charming, soulful Brandon Walters, making his movie debut) who, as the son of an Aboriginal woman and a White man (the identity of the man is not entirely clear until toward the end of the film), is derisively considered a \\"cream,\\" as all such children are. It is also the story of a wealthy, exquisitely well-mannered Englishwoman, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman, gorgeous and first-rate, as usual, continuing her work with Luhrmann after starring in the director's \\"Moulin Rouge!\\"; she was also the villainess in an adventure of a different sort, \\"The Golden Compass\\"). Upon arriving in the country, en route to her late husband's mansion in the Australian outback, she seems humorously detached from any world outside her one of privilege to the point where the movie seems to ridicule her as a floozy. It's an example of the movie's style diminishing the importance of such a character, who, as the film itself later shows, was ahead of her time in her developing a lucrative and powerful business despite her sex, her relations with members outside her established class, and her acceptance, care and compassion for Aborigines and Aboriginal children at a time when the Europeans and their descendants routinely institutionalized them, supposedly for the benefit of society.    When circumstances leave Nullah a child alone, Lady Sarah welcomes him into her home, and, eventually, into her heart, despite her initial feeling that she would not be a good mother. In an effort to cheer him up, she tries to tell him the story of \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" going so far -- at Nullah's gentle insistance -- as to sing a few songs from the old classic (badly, as she's out of tune and can't remember the lyrics or, for that matter, much of the story). Her surrogate child loves music and loves to sing, and does so quite beautifully, especially his favorite, \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\\" One some levels it makes sense that it becomes a running motif through the rest of the film, given the more fantasy- and childlike aspects of the production. However, it is also rather overused and grows a bit saccharine, especially as the film becomes more serious.    Finally, the story is also about Drover (Hugh Jackman, conceived here as the very epitome of physical manliness, much more so than in \\"The Prestige,\\" the stage musical \\"The Boy from Oz,\\" or even \\"X-Men: the Last Stand\\"), a cattle driver as tough and rugged as the land, to whom Lady Sarah becomes infatuated soon when he gives her a ride in his truck soon after her arrival in the country, as prearranged -- and soon after he wins a knock-down, drag-out brawl at a local bar. Drover is the practical answer to Lady Sarah's progressive ideology. Where she is the optimist, what would today be considered liberal, who feels society's standards must change, he is a pragmatist whose eyes are colored by tradition and Australia's status quo; he's not necessarily against change, he just can't imagine it would happen. He soon shows her the feeling is mutual, and Nullah effectively becomes their adopted son. Drover is rather like John Wayne in any number of old Hollywood westerns, though more sexed-up, with Jackman's big, hairy muscles, frequently seen with no shirt. The main drawback to their relationship is that it seems the chemistry between the two leads is sometimes lacking, especially early on.    Their shared goal is to make something more of the scrappy cattle business now run by Lady Sarah -- a.k.a., \\"The Boss\\" (except while herding the cattle, at which point Drover assumes that role, unquestionably) and defy the ruthless tactics of their more successful rival, King Carney (Bryan Brown) and his cruel-hearted deputy Neil Fletcher (a cold-bloodedly villainous David Wenham, who previously appeared in a different kind of role within a different kind of Australian western, \\"The Proposition\\")    The film, several years in the making, was clearly a labor of love for Luhrmann, his Bazmark team and, it seems, the cast. Their devotion to it shows, just like in all his previous efforts. Luhrmann and the principal cast, including Kidman and Jackman, probably had more invested in this film, emotionally, than usual, since it focuses on the country from which they hail.    At its stylistic heart, \\"Australia\\" is a Hollywood production of epic proportions. A widescreen presentation that is CinemaScope-esque. A meaty running time (clocking in at about two hours and forty-five minutes) that doesn't feel long. A huge country populated by people with huge personalities, ideas, and muscles. Big social issues. Lavish parties. Epic sequences of suspense and action (the bar-room brawl spills out into the dusty streets and seems to involve all the men in the town; later there's a stampede at cliff-side; a perilous no-man's-land desert crossing, and, finally, a massive air raid). \\"Small\\" or even \\"average\\" is clearly not in this film's vocabulary. It's more reminiscent of films like \\"The Searchers,\\" \\"Giant,\\" and \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" In many ways its visual and tonal aesthetic seems rooted in classic films such as these and others.    But, this is also a film by Baz Luhrmann, so the images we see are not merely grand, but super-stylized, sumptuous, and over-the-top, more restrained than in \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" but by no means reserved. And, except where noted as inappropirate above, that's not a criticism. Shots that I'm sure were already impressive with their high-gloss sheen and glorious views are given further lift by impressivedigital special effects, well-done in that they blend in with the fantasy elements of the story. Technically, the film is engrossing and superb.    When all is said and done, this movie, despite the issues it addresses, is not really a history lesson. At its heart lies the classic Hollywood spirit of pure, old-fashioned cinematic entertainment, in all its big, brash glory.

B001CTDH30|4.0|THE FILM    The acclaimed Broadway play \\"Doubt\\" was developed at a time when the authority of religion and the notion of its infallibility were being seriously challenged in the light of instances of indiscretions by priests against children and philosophies that seemed outdated, even irrelevant. The play itself is indeed about both issues but, more central to its concerns, to judge from its new cinematic counterpart, are people's perceptions of certain events and of one another, their convictions that those perceptions are factually accurate, how they act upon those convictions (whether they are correct or misguided), and the consequences of those actions. (And, yes, one issue does beget the next.) It is about people believing what they want to believe, even if to do so they must turn the other cheek.    It could not have been an easy task to incorporate so many essential human conditions into one story, and develop them as well they have been here, but John Patrick Shanley, who both directed the film and adapted his own play from stage to screen, has succeeded in what is easily one of the best-written films of the year.    These themes could occur in any place or at any time, but it makes sense that Shanley chooses to set it in a Catholic church and school located in the Bronx in the mid 1960s, a year after President Kennedy's assassination. It is, arguably, a time when people within the country have doubts about the world and theirselves and, perhaps, looks to their religion and faith to find some hint of reassurance. Yet, over a relatively short time, that stability and certainty is challenged for the small group of nuns, clergy, parishioners, teachers and parents at the center of this story.    Despite the fact the movie is about events that could lend themselves to easy sensationalism, it wisely avoids such a show in favor of a simple, no-nonsense, almost minimalist style of storytelling and character study. It's this style that helps us to immerse ourselves without distraction in our scrutiny of the people on-screen, even as they scrutinize each other and themselves. That, along with the writing that never fails to be intriguing, even for a minute.    Sister James (played with a kind, almost childlike, innocence by Amy Adams) is a nun and teacher at the Catholic grade school adjacent to the church who notices some peculiar behavior in one of her students after the priest calls him to the rectory for a private meeting. Her suspicions heighten when she later spies the priest discreetly place an article of clothing into the boy's locker. She eventually confesses what she knows and suspects to her superior, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (the wonderful Meryl Streep, late of \\"Lions for Lambs\\" \\"Redacted\\" and \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" excellent at thoroughly becoming her character, here and as always), the head nun at the church as well as the school's principal. Sister Beauvier favors an old-fashioned brand of morals and sensibility, enforcing them with a stern demeanor toward her students and even her colleagues. Father Brendan Flynn (the gifted, hardworking Philip Seymour Hoffman, who's made a career of richly, memorably portraying characters--\\"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,\\" \\"Synecdoche, New York,\\" \\"Capote\\"--who are some combination of troubled, vulnerable, and ethically- or morally-challenged) is the priest in question.    He is soon to be at the center of Sister Beauvier's consciousness and the focus of her campaign to force him out of their church. It is no easy task, considering the fact that, under the church's rigid hierarchy, official complaints by nuns are to be made solely to other priests; Father Flynn is, officially, the sister's own superior in an organization that reveres men of his ilk; and he is in better-than-good graces with his own superiors--often seen chatting and dining with them as the best of buddies.    When she questions him about the issue, nervous at first, assertive at last, Sister James as a witness, he begrudgingly provides reasons that nonetheless seem valid, to the junior nun's satisfaction and immense relief. Yet, Sister Beauvier remains highly skeptical, thoroughly convinced of her belief that Father Flynn has committed a breach of the most serious sort, not by any concrete evidence or supporting testimony, but by her own indefinable hunch. With it, she embarks on a mission to oust him, first by speaking to the boy's mother, Mrs Miller (Viola Davis), from whom she learns a surprising revelation about the nature of people in difficult circumstances, then by threatening him directly in a fiery confrontation.    In his own defense, Father Flynn remains quite credible: he pays special attention to the boy because he is the only African-American in a school of often-hostile Whites; the nuns have no proof of their allegations; and Sister Beauvier's concerns could easily stem from a conflict of generations and ideologies, Father Flynn being determined to connect with his parishioners in ways that are more personable and than the senior nun's strictly traditional methods. Both profess, convincingly, their desire to protect their congregation, and the children.    Shanley has clearly taken pains to ensure that neither appears more guilty, more free from ethical questions or, indeed, more doubtful than the other, until right past the very end. Though it offers no easy, black and white solutions, the conclusion fits the story just fine and is satisfactory if not happy. Given the context of the picture, any overtly happy ending would seem unjustifiable.    This is one of the better stage-to-screen adaptations in recent memory despite the fact that it was directed by the same person who wrote the original play. I don't mean that as an automatic criticism of all such movies; it's just that many such films, in their execution, are sometimes too \\"stagey\\"--mere replicas of the shows they were based on, rather than assured transformations from one medium to another. (\\"The History Boys\\" and the newer, musical version of \\"The Producers\\" are good examples of good stage shows turned into poor movies because their basic cinematic requirements were ignored.) An oft-overlooked fact is that each medium has its own distinct conventions and opportunities to be taken advantage of.    \\"Doubt\\" does not entirely overcome this transitional problem. The entire production still feels rather theatrical, which is not necessarily a criticism in and of itself. However, some scenes do look a bit overly-staged here and there, especially when the sole action on the screen--and from the speakers--consists of characters standing and talking to one another. Of course, this story is told much more through dialogue than physical action, so it is expected that most of the running time would be devoted to characters speaking. Notwithstanding this, little cinematic touches could have been introduced to make the whole affair seem more cinematic without sacrificing the simplicity that works so much to the film's benefit. One obvious touch would be the addition of a bit more music to the soundtrack. It's ironic that Howard Shore, one of the most revered film score composers working today, was hired for this movie, yet his work is only infrequently used.    The somewhat static quality brought on by the occasional staginess, in any case, is a relatively small criticism, which the writing--the meat and potatoes of the film--easily overcomes. Shanley clearly is an expert at the art of metaphor, a talent which abounds in his script, sometimes a little too often or too humorously, but never so much as to be a true distraction; it's usually just enough to make things more interesting. Some of the more memorable uses an overhead light bulb above Sister Beauvier in her office blows itself out when Sister James first expresses her doubts about the priest (Sister Beauvier, with a tone that is both lightly humorous and sly: \\"Look. You blew out my light.\\"). Later, Father Flynnjoins them both in the same room, and the same bulb blows itself out again. As suspicions continue to rise in the nuns' minds about their priest, he is shown in the midst of dinner with his fellow men of the cloth: a loud, jovial, almost rambunctious feast complete with wine and, on each plate, a slab of beef, thick and very bloody. Cut to dinner with the nuns: they sit orderly, quietly around their table, eating veggies and drinking tall glasses of milk. The sinful priests; the wholesome nuns. The devastating final scene takes place in a cold garden, the leaves blowing in the wind, having left the bare branches of the trees behind.    The cold, blowing wind plays a metaphor in other scenes, too, generally reflective of an unease that lingers in the air and within oneself. Another, somewhat more old-fashioned indicator of the unease characters feel at certain moments are the oddly-canted camera angles that appear on occasion, in which characters are diagonally oriented, usually when when perceived by another character. Such simple metaphoric techniques have been done in cinema for generations, but remain powerful in this film, nevertheless.    If you were not able to see the theatrical play (even if you did see it) go see this film. You may wish you had seen the play. If you're not religious, don't let the church setting, and presence of nuns and priests scare you away, as it's about something more fundamental and universal than religion. No matter what your persuasion, it merits a close viewing.

Yorke calls this his version of \\"seduction songs\\"; they do sound rather seductive, particularly the sensationally dark \\"All I Need,\\" but they're about as emotionally warm as an iPod.  Then again, the same could be said for the spiritually-distant \\"romance\\"(sex) Yorke is singing about.  Less cold: \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" a confused high-voltage anthem for twenty-first century society, and \\"Weird Fishes,\\" in which Yorke gets eaten by the worms and sounds kind of happy about it.
B00000G3I2|5.0|Friends; the real ones only come around once in a lifetime.  Sure, the general embodiment of the term `friend' comes in and out of our lives with reckless abandonment and makes their little dents in who we are, but true friends never leave us and are irreplaceable.  You'll know it when you meet that someone, or those someones.  You'll know it immediately because there is a close comfort that comes very rarely; a feeling of overwhelming ease that allows you to be yourself, more yourself then maybe you've ever been and thus it is those real friends that help you realize who it is that you really are.<br /><br />I'm lucky to have such a friend, and no doubt you have that person (or persons) as well.<br /><br />`The Big Chill' is a story about that kind of friendship, a friendship that survives all and continues to shape and mold us.  It's a story about realizing that we are nothing without that friendship, and that all that we have attempted to become becomes null and void without that friendship.<br /><br />The film begins under very somber pretences, with the passing of a dear friend; Alex.  Alex, who took his own life, left a tight-knit group of friends to ponder why it was that he left them.  Over the weekend these eight people lock themselves away in a house and rediscover themselves.  There is Sarah and Harold Cooper, the happily married couple (who own the house in which they are all staying); there is Sam Weber, the ashamed television actor; there is Michael Gold, the obnoxious journalist; there is Meg Jones, desperate for a child; there is Nick Carlton, out of touch with himself and those around him; there is Karen Bowens, the unhappily married mother and there is Chloe, Alex's girlfriend, stranger to the group.<br /><br />They all fight, they all break down, they all overreact and possibly underreact and basically all deal with the sudden situation as humans do; naturally and passionately.<br /><br />What makes `The Big Chill' so wonderful is that it feels so real, so raw and intelligent.  Each character is wonderfully fleshed out to reveal their honest and true emotions and the metamorphosis they make over the short weekend seems legit and understandable.  Sometimes being away from the ones who complete you for so long can make you become a variation of yourself that you are not comfortable with.  When you are reunited with those persons it doesn't take long to realize what has been missing and what needs to change.<br /><br />The script is magnificent, but it is the acting that elevates every scene.  Standouts are definitely William Hurt, Glenn Close and Kevin Kline; all three of which turning in some of their finest work.  This was a breakout film for a lot of these actors, proving to be a jump off point in their careers.  Hurt went on to do `Kiss of the Spider Woman' shortly after (winning an Oscar); Kline went on to do `A Fish Called Wanda' (winning the Oscar).  Close had a string of Oscar nominations in the late 80's (she was also nominated for this).  Meg Tilly received an Oscar nomination for her work in 85's `Agnes of God'; Berenger went on to be nominated for his stunning work in `Platoon'.  The entire cast used this as a solid foundation for their careers, and some of them (namely Close and Hurt) are still working solidly today.<br /><br />Couple the acting and the script with the impressive musical accompaniments and you have a film that feels complete and warming and understanding and moving.  It is a complete package, from start to finish, with never a dull moment and barely a thing to fault it over (I am not a Goldblum fan, and he annoyed me here, but there is always that one friend you can't stand so it fits well).racter is wonderfully fleshed out to reveal their honest and true emotions and the metamorphosis they make over the short weekend seems legit and understandable.

0767836286|2.0|Okay, look at this objectively and realize that it is not that good.  Please, do that for me.  I know that it stars two of the better actors around and on of the best supporting ladies out there, and sure, the action is well paced and it has one unbelievably great ending, but when you stack up all the faults here it becomes apparent that this is not as good as it should have been.<br /><br />The film is smarter than it looks, but sadly it comes off rather dull thanks to uninspired direction.<br /><br />The film centers around Michael Faraday, a college professor teaching an American History class on terrorism.  His wife, a former FBI agent, was killed in the line of duty and the circumstances surrounding her death have thrown Michael into a state of seeming paranoia.  This paranoia is only heightened when he meets his next door neighbors Oliver and Cheryl.  They seem sweet enough, but there is just something off that raises concern in Michael.  Everything he talks to thinks he's crazy, but is he really?<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much, but the movie does that for you already.  That's one of my main concerns.  We are expected throughout the first half of the film to slip into Michael's paranoia with him, and feel that he is blowing things out of proportion; but Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack won't allow us to do that.  They play their characters with so much obvious `strangeness' that it's shocking Michael is the ONLY one who thinks they are terrorists.  I love both actors, but Cusack plays Cheryl like she were a joke really, and Robbins is so unconvincing as a `normal guy' that even when he supposedly convinces Michael he's not a terrorist all he manages to do is further convince us that he is.<br /><br />My second issue is with the whole middle of the film, and parts of the ending as well.  It goes from this `trying to be smart' psychological thriller into this `lets be stupid' action thriller that just throws off any real tension they were trying to build.  When Hope Davis hangs up the phone and sees Joan Cusack giving her that ridiculous smile I knew that the movie was just going down hill.<br /><br />Now, many have mentioned that the end of the film is intelligent and well done, and I agree.  The final frames are brilliant, but brilliant to a fault.  It's so smart that it makes me hate the balance of the film even more.<br /><br />Why would they waste such a marvelously thought out revelation on a poorly constructed B-Grade thriller?<br /><br />That said, Jeff Bridges works very, very hard to elevate this movie, and he manages to get us on his side throughout.  He is convincing, even when his surroundings are not.  We believe him, and so I hate to fault the film so much because he tries so hard.  Oh well, I still love him and I respect him for giving this a try.  It seemed good on paper I'm sure.  How was he to know that Cusack and Robbins were going to make a mockery of this script?  How were we to expect that a film starring some of the most impressive talents working today was going to be such a waste of potential?<br /><br />In other words; watch something else.ld.

0321543726|3.0|This book is put together well aesthetically, (color) but it says on the back that it is \\"For Beginners - And anyone who wants to learn something new.\\"  I have done programming in assembly language, visual basic, and MEL scripting language, and getting back into programming, I am learning C++.  This book is a nightmare for a beginner.  For example, I kept seeing the word \\"subscript\\", and I could not recall what the word signified, so I looked in the dictionary in the back of the book, - it was not there; in the index, I could find no page that defined what a subscript was.  I know now by looking it up elsewhere, but this type of thing is frustrating for a beginner.   This book gets way to technical and would not make a good reference book, because if you were looking for quick references to good coding, you would have to read the whole chapter again just to see what code is the good code and what code is the bad code, because he has both listed all over in the book. I would describe the writing style as muddled, because, while there is a lot of very distinct detail as you read through, there seems to be no effort to put it all together clearly for a \\"beginner\\".  Alright, so the guy is the designer of C++, but it does not follow from that that he is a fantastic teacher, if I were judging from this book, I'd say not.  This book is not a beginner's book, it is an intermediate programmers book, no matter what the advertizing says.  If you want a good beginners book, look for \\"Starting out with C++\\" by Tony Gaddis.  Plenty of example code and real clarity when it comes to explaining the code.  This book would be a good book for adding depth to your knowledge of C++.

B0000024ZT|4.0|Recorded when he was 23, Bruce Springsteen's shiny debut is like nine dances over quicksand.  Sometimes he sinks: the acoustic \\"Mary Queen of Arkansas\\" is horrific, and the other acoustic number, \\"The Angel,\\" isn't much better.  But for the bulk of the record, Springsteen jive-talks and rolls his way to success via absurdist anecdotes (\\"Blinded by the Light,\\" much better than the ridiculously showy Manfred Mann cover), street-myth rambles (\\"Lost in the Flood\\"), and youthful underclass poetry (\\"Growin' Up,\\" \\"Spirit in the Night\\").  Even in the case of the aforementioned acoustic nightmares, one is saved by the disarmingly charming \\"Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?\\", the other by the irresistibly straightforward \\"For You.\\"  Sometimes primitive, often admirably romantic, and consistently smart, \\"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\\" had shades of Dylan and Van Morrison--not bad for a twenty-something punk from Jersey.

The only thing that might suit the songs better is if Townshend took the vocals, since Daltrey sounds like he's faking it.  They're so good, in fact, that I didn't think about Moon once while I was listening.

B000NZD9RS|3.0|Pink Floyd's faux-masterpiece almost feels like the real thing at its beginning.  It soon becomes clear that it's a narcissistic epic of self-pity, with a scope so small that Waters--who's running the show--might as well have been peering through a child's telescope at a brick wall.  Some of it's good: \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\" and its counterpart, \\"Another Brick in the Wall,\\" are excellent, and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" seems great.  But the triumphs of those songs are shaved down by mediocre numbers and pieces like the revoltingly theatrical \\"The Trial.\\"  The story trips over itself, one imagines due to Waters' self-obsession.  The lyrics are up and down, and the production is consistently empty.  The album itself is down with a few ups, though Waters' egoism ensures that it's never quite as empty as it feels.  I'll stick with \\"[[ASIN:B000024D4R Animals]].\\"

Clapton and the boys never stray too far from their prodigious blues stylings; their boldest departures, the vaguely Britpopish \\"World of Pain\\" and the cluttered \\"Dance the Night Away,\\" are successful because they maintain that grungy sound eminating from the stony drums and Zeus-ian guitar.  It finishes on a decidedly strange note (the traditional \\"Mother's Lament\\" via \\"Monty Python\\"), but the album as a whole--led by the accelerated-blues ride \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\"--is gold.

But its hypocracy is off-putting: we know its hero, who is apparently an everyman, is NOT an everyman, or if so, he's a jackass jerk who can't be much fun to be around.  We know this from the entire verse serving as a passive, thick-headed anti-gay attack.  It could've been more repulsive, anyway; Knopfler could've poked fun at blacks.

055380457X|4.0|Obviously this book does not cover the entire story of Google in depth, but it does provide a look into the company from the time the founders were students in graduate school until the time when the book was published.<br /><br />Covered are such material as how the company got it's financing, how the founders insisted in staying true to their dream, how the company operates and how it is challenging the big M for dominance in the world of technology companies.<br /><br />I completely enjoyed the book. It contained enough information to make the read interesting while keeping the technical jargon and in depth computer material to the minimum necessary for the story.  This would be a good book for a high school or college library and makes an interesting study of how a company can be different and still very successful.
0956010903|1.0|That is great and important to me, then I made a purchase in august 2008. Until yesterday, I didn't receive it. Now Amazon wrote to me this:  \\"Please note that we cannot send a replacement order once the refund has been issued as it's been our policy.\\".    I have not required a refund. Amazon took a auto-refund, and they washed its hands.    People, never buy a special or colletible stuff at Amazon, It's a great risk.    Hey Jeff Bezos..!! Less skyboarding, more management control into Amazon.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|A few days ago, my wife told me that she heard a radio d.j. promoting his upcoming program, called `Is Springsteen over-rated?' I couldn't help but think that this d.j. was hopelessly uninformed and out of touch. Nearly forty years into his career, and Bruce Springsteen still needs to suffer fools like this? From his very first album, he had to deflect the `next Dylan' hype, then the simultaneous Newsweek and Time magazine covers, while naysayers wondered if he deserved it.  In later years, fans bemoaned that he `lost it' simply because he refused to rewrite (fill in your favorite Springsteen song here). If nothing else, Bruce has been tenacious, and reasonably consistent as a songwriter. Few people know their way around populist ideals as well as Springsteen does, and maybe that is exactly why there will always be someone who resents his innate ability to reach into the heart of a crowd.<br />\\"Working On a Dream\\" will give the skeptical plenty to squawk about. It is also one of Springsteen's most interesting albums. Superficially, it is easy to criticize much of the material. \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" sounds like a near-mindless concept, while \\"Outlaw Pete\\" is so deceptively dumb that it could start a bar fight. Since it is also the opening track, it is virtually impossible to ignore, as he sings, \\"He robbed a bank in his diapers and little bare baby feet, all he said was \\"Folks my name is Outlaw Pete.\\" A more auspicious beginning to a major album would be hard to imagine. As the song unfolds, it grows in grandeur until it becomes cinematic in scope, but doubters will remain perplexed, or even dumbfounded. Cinematic? \\"Screen door slams. Mary's dress sways. Like a vision she dances...\\" That is cinematic. \\"I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me?\\" Puh-lease. \\"Thunder Road\\" is widescreen, surround sound huge. Comparably, \\"Outlaw Pete\\" is a kinescope. So, I understand why people will criticize and nitpick at this song, but they ought to stop and think that Springsteen wrote it, fully aware of his own catalog, and that there is something playful and ironic at work here. He knows what the expectations are, and by leading off with this track, he deflects pre-formed opinions, and subsequently, the album proves itself to be as rich in imagery and melody as anything he has ever done.<br />For starters, \\"Working on a Dream\\" is much less dense than 2007's\\"Magic,\\" allowing the instruments to breathe. There is spaciousness where there previously had been claustrophobia. Perhaps the difference is political in its essence - \\"Magic\\" captured Springsteen's impression of the Bush years, while \\"Working on a Dream\\" portrays a cautious optimism, as implied by the title track and \\"My Lucky Day.\\" Springsteen is undoubtedly in love, and he is fully capable of tapping into that vein for rich material that expresses the joy of living in the moment.  On \\"This Life,\\" he unabashedly expresses that thought, singing \\"A bang then stardust in your eyes, a billion years or just this night, either way it'll be all right,\\" while the gorgeous arrangement suggests Brian Wilson at his finest. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (not the Beatles song, but a beautiful country rocker with strings), and \\"Life Itself\\" further develop this theme, and it reaches its apotheosis on  \\"Kingdom of Days,\\" where he sings, \\"I count my blessings that you're mine for always. We laugh beneath the covers and count the wrinkles and the grays...this is our kingdom of days.\\"<br />\\"Working on a Dream\\" is an album you could grow old with, but listeners need to let its beauty reveal itself. If you're a Springsteen fan, you might as well brace yourself for the usual uninformed negativity that often accompanies his latter-day work. Some people will hear a song or two, then toss off \\"Working on a Dream\\" by saying that he lost it, or some such thing. The truth, though, is exactly opposite that. The album demands you to listen beneath the surface, and if you are willing to try, the pay off is extraordinary. Sometime in the future, \\"Working On a Dream\\" is destined to reveal itself as a masterpiece, one of Springsteen's finest albums, but meanwhile, the debate is sure to rage on. Loudmouths and ignorant d.j.'s will continue to spew nonsense, but I'll drown them out by listening to \\"Working on a Dream.\\"  A  Tom Ryanfuture, \\"Working On a Dream\\" is destined to reveal itself as a masterpiece, one of Springsteen's finest albums, but meanwhile, the debate is sure to rage on.

B001ACH4DS|2.0|david c. is a talented singer. it's too bad this album did not showcase that talent. the album is packed with alternative rock songs, which unfortunately, are forgettable. sure he can hit those high notes, but after a song or two, you would desperately ask for a breather. it could have been better, in my opinion, had they included more mellow tunes that david sang so well in american idol like \\"always be my baby\\"/\\"billie jean\\"/\\"first time ever i saw your face\\" or even \\"music of the night.\\" the only track i can listen to in this album is \\"time of my life.\\" i really got stressed out when i listened to the cd the very first time. i like alternative music but not david c's.
B00003CXA6|5.0|It is the best war movie I have seen, period.  I have seen many being a History Teacher.
B001H5X7I4|2.0|I wanted to like Tropic Thunder. I was looking forward to seeing it having heard some good reports. In the end though, I just didn't enjoy it. There were some funny moments, and the production was very good - it's slick and impressive to look at, especially on blu-ray. But the film is let down by a dull plot, and empty characters. I just didn't care about any of them - they were all one-dimensional. I know, in a way that that is the point - they are all supposed to be one-dimensional actors - but that joke kind of carries on into this film, making Stiller, Black, Downey et al all seem boring. Downey Jr. is great, but the joke wears thin, and is kind of dealt with in the first few minutes of the film.    I found myself longing for the more nuanced character comedies of Steve Martin, John Candy, Chevy Chase etc. The Three Amigos, for example, was a similar type of film, carried off with a more absurd humor, and some genuine warmth.     For all the explosions, Tropic Thunder left me cold.
0307269752|1.0|There are very few books that I throw away after reading them.  When I do so it's because I do not want any responsibility for wasting another reader's time on bad books.<br /><br />The best review I can write is this: I can't remember much about the book at all. The parts I do remember are the open marriage of two characters, the frustration of the girl at the end who is tempted into falling in love, and seeing her intended walk off laughing with his mistress, and that's about it.<br /><br />Save your money.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Warning... Avoid this album if:   1) You only enjoy older Springsteen Classics (BTR, Darkness, The River, Nebraska, BITUSA) and haven't enjoyed anything he has put out since 1984!   2) You are expecting a full blown Rock album with the E Street Band    If you're not and can appreciate the diverse styles that Bruce has offered on recent albums such as Devils and Dust and the Seeger Sessions, then you will find another excellent album by the Boss which has depth to it that may not be fully evident on first listen.  The writing really is top notch.  I appreciate the fact that Springsteen continually is moving forward, trying new styles and not writing the same songs that he did  when he was the 25-30 year old who penned Born to Run or Badlands.  (Classics yes but three decades ago!) I think thats what seperates him from some of the other \\"classic\\" rock artists still making music today.     Standout tracks:   Outlaw Pete (lush orchestration, nice storytelling song)  What Love Can Do (Great Rocker that should be good live)   My Lucky Day (Another Good Rocker)  The Last Carnival (Very nice tribute to Danny Federici)  This Life (Lush, takes a few listens to appreciate, Nice Sax Solo to close the song)   Life Itself     I highly recommend this album as I think it represents the excellence of Springsteen once again.
B0009VJYKM|2.0|2 1/2    Solid, if predictable and bloated continuation of Waters post-Floyd era suffers from self-importance, essentially still taking many ideas from mainly The Final Cut and recycling with a fair amount of success.

B000003BD3|5.0|[[ASIN:B000621484 The Rolling Stones - Rock and Roll Circus]]<br /><br />What can you say about a recorded show that, until the late 1990's, was kept from view to the general public, (for reasons unknown), but, turns out to be one of the greatest 1960's period rock musical performances ever captured on film?<br /><br />Everyone involved, from Taj Mahal & John Lennon to Jethro Tull, The Who & especially The Rolling Stones themselves put on a wonderfully memorable show! Looking at it now makes one regret that many of the participants are no longer physically with us, (Lennon, Jimi Hendrix Drummer Mitch Mitchell, The Who's Keith Moon, pianist Nicky Hopkins), but, the most obviously missed person to me, is the late Brian Jones.<br /><br />This show turned out to be his last public performance with The Stones & I understand he was not in the best of health. Despite that, the band performs a blazing set in the final act that not only sounds great, but is fascinating & very entertaining to watch.<br /><br />This show has been described by some as a 1960's time-capsule of a moment in time that was great & will never come again. That sounds about right to me!<br /><br />Some of the other features, such as additional acts performances & various voice-over commentary choices add even more depth.<br /><br />Thia is one of those rock music shows & soundtracks that really should be in your personal library if you're a fan of The Stones, The Who or just 60's rock music in general.<br /><br />Two thumbs way up there!
B00064WSNM|3.0|3 1/2    A mid-level entry in the classic-prog band's powerful output, with typically eclectic brilliance offset by some underdeveloped rough patches- symptomatic of a lot their early work but feeling even less cohesive as a whole and in individual songs here, despite much obvious microcosmic quality.
B000FVGN00|5.0|[[ASIN:B0002B77EY Slider]]<br /><br />I used to think \\"Electric Warrior\\" was the best T-Rex album of them all,... until I really repeatedly listened to \\"The Slider\\".<br /><br />What Marc Bolan & Company started to do musically on the Warrior disc, reached it's apex on The Slider album. That whole combination of great, choppy Chuck Berry-like guitar hook riffs, funny, loopy lyrics & just all around heavy metal thunder wall of sound bombastics shows the band at it's peak. Even the quieter tunes rock!<br /><br /> My personal favorites, \\"Metal Guru\\", \\"Chariot Choogle\\", \\"Mystic Lady\\", \\"Ballrooms of Mars\\", & \\"Rabbit Fighter\\", sound like a great mini space-travel rock opera soundtrack.<br /><br />Ideally, to me, both this disc AND the Electric Warrior disc should both be enjoyed together. They make a potent case for T-Rex & Marc Bolan's place in rock & roll history that greatly deserves to be remembered and appreciated more than it presently seems to be.<br /><br />Definatly both worth checking out if you have'nt done so already!

0385338732|4.0|This book was a lot of fun to read.  Lexi was such a fun character who at first appears to have gotten the dream transformation.  I know I always pictured myself losing two clothing sizes, having perfect teeth, a handsome husband and a career on the fast track.  But this book really makes you think if that is what is most important.  The relationship between Lexi and Eric was so dysfunctional it was funny and I was rooting for Jon the whole time.  I'm glad Lexi ended up sticking it to all the jerks at her company in the end and only wish I could have seen their reaction after they found out what Lexi achieved.  Definitely recommend this as a put a smile on your face read.
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book.  Yann Martel clearly deserved the Mann Booker prize for writing it.  One thing that makes it particularly appealing is that it can be appreciated by such a diverse group of readers.  It does not fit comfortably into any packaged genre (e.g., legal drama, horror, romance, travel, etc.)  It's really just a great read, and a masterpiece of literature.
B000P0J0AQ|1.0|I have never received the dvd.  I have emailed amazon and DisCount Goodies; no response.  If this is not resolved, I will discontinue using Amazon, and tell everyone I can of my bad experience.
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Clearly, one has to be a fan of the sad world of Woody Allen to enjoy this film. Unfortunately, I'm not. I found the premise interesting: Two American young women, propositioned by an attractive, charming, Spaniard, actually do fly away with him for the weekend. But even though both end up in bed with him (although not at the same time, as he proposed) the experience - and the surrounding drama, seem to produce no changes in anyone. It's almost like a porno film, where people have sex, but it doesn't matter.<br /><br />Beyond that, there are only questions. Why does Vicky (Rebecca Hall) seem to be such a depressive that even an affair with handsome Spaniard can't jolt her out of her stupor? Why is Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) never satisfied with the love she has? These are some of the issues the film raises, but never really explores. The downer ending wouldn't bother me if the film provided some resolution to the conflicts it has set up. But it doesn't, except for Woodyphiles, who seem willing to accept whatever the master offers. Yes, life doesn't always offer a resolution, but art should. As for the voiceover narration, it isn't needed. All it does is add proof that the film lacks a dramatic structure.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|This is my favorite new movie. I went to see this with my mom and we loved it. I cannot say enough good things about this movie. There are serious parts, and other parts where Eastwood is hilarious. I was laughing and crying throughout this movie. It was entertaining throughout. I have a feeling this will go down as a huge cult film, considering it was snubbed by the Academy. This should have been up for Best Picture and Best Actor. Oh yeah, and the car is pretty awesome! Go see it, you won't be disappointed.
0956010903|5.0|Great book....especially the beautifully presented book case it comes in and the velvet bag containing the metal encrusted tales....A good read and nice old fashioned morals within the pages. Great for parents reading to their young children.
B001L5SXQG|1.0|Outlaw Pete is painful, ditto the rest of this crap. There may be a lone bright spot in Life Itself. Very fitting that Bruce is playing the Super Bowl this year: Like Favre, I used to love this guy, now I just want him to shut his trap and hang it up. Newsflash to all Bruce fans - your boy is done.
B000023VR6|5.0|My favorite style of rap is G-Funk and the is the best. The original chronic set the bar, but this is the only album to top it. There are no throwaway lyrics just to rhyme, but every word means something. Truly great from start to finish. Dre is the Best

0316113506|1.0|Facts that could easily be checked via google are incorrect, for instance, New Trier High School is not in Evanston as the author states. He also botches most of the details of N.T.'s physical education program. It's hard to accept his big theories, when he has the small details wrong. He also states that a \\"radiation study\\" wasn't published because the results weren't as expected. Huh? Research is rejected by peer-reviewed journals because the study is poorly constructed or flawed, but  not because of new or different results. That's what scientists and publications are looking for!<br /><br />The basic premise has allure -- exercise and all will be better -- but the execution and writing need polishing.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|I don't feel compelled to review many things, but I absolutely love this album. If you like blues, rock, or listening to an incredible guitarist, do yourself a favor and get this CD.

0861714911|5.0|A great book! Bhikkhu Bodhi has taken his vast lifetime of experience of translating the Theravada Buddhist texts and complied the most salient sections straight from the most original Pali sources.<br /><br />I've spent a lot of time with the Pali texts and if I had this selection years ago it would have saved me a lot of work. It's such a good reference.<br /><br />The oldest and most original Buddhist texts are in Pali. These are older than Zen, and older the Tibetan texts. Both Zen and Tibetan texts are outstanding, but the texts in Pali are the oldest and hence the source of the others.<br /><br />If this doesn't become the Bible for Buddhists I don't know what will.

B001B1876G|3.0|This is the animated iron man.  A movie; which like the live action movie can trace it's origins to the classic marvel comic book. Those early stories have been reprinted in the hardcover marvel masterworks series<br />and are worth reading.  The movie was NOT put out as a bait and switch manuever , this movie was at the theaters a year before the live action movie as part of the marvel comics animated series.  Doctor Strange and the Avengers have also been put out this way on blu ray.  But I can understand if you bought this without seeing the box that you would be upset. Anyways the live action movie was closer to what the comics where than this movie is and that's not a good thing.  The mandarin is a classic iron man villian, who is not some ancient creature with powers but a man from asia who leads a crime organization and has powerful weapon rings. This animated story goes off into a mythological story that would have fit doctor strange better. Iron mans foes are more down to earth types like the crimson dynamo and others; not mythalogical creatures.  In spite of that the movie is entertaining and on blu ray it looks great.  I just wish that they would stick closer to the original comics and not stray from what made the iron man stories so classic.  Iron man fights solid powerful villians who use technology to make weapons and armor mainly.  At least that's what he mainly fought!  The Mandarin used technology to battle iron man not magic.  Nuff said.  So if you want a decent animated movie that strays some but still has some solid thrills then you may like this flick.
B000002U9W|5.0|Don't care what the members of the band think, this is my favorite album of all-time and has been since 1971. I own approximately five thousand albums and honestly cannot think of one I appreciate more than Atom Heart Mother. All the tracks are so outstanding and evoke such strong feelings for me that I NEVER get tired  of giving it a listen; the AHM Suite, If, Summer 68', Fat Old Sun, and of course Breakfast are far and above Floyd's best compositions. Only Echoes can match the quality of the songs on AHM; to me, the albums made without Roger Waters are by far the worst of Pink Floyds albums--but still are quite good.  If there is anybody out there who has not listened to Atom Heart Mother, please do so now; you will be amazed at it's brilliance. DC

I've been listening to this in my car and really enjoying it.  Most of his big hits are represented and also some cuts I've never heard before that are really great.  (I could've done without Murder Incorporated but I have to admit it makes me smile every time I hear it because it reminds me of The Sopranos, and Steve Van Zant portraying Silvio Dante.  What a guy!)  Springteen is such a great songwriter and performer, he's definitely the Boss. Not too impressed with the packaging, but whatever!
B000I0QL82|5.0|A favorite of mine and also my niece, so I ordered two - one for a gift.
1416562591|4.0|The reviews on this book so far reveal just how sharp Avind's pen is: the lowest star rating seems to come from Indian readers.    Right on the first page, I realised that this was going to be a roller-coaster ride and all the conventions, institutions and traditions that Indians hold holy would be mercilessly attacked.     The success of the book lies in the consistency of language, and the frankness with which the narrator dissects the rotten mess that is India today: the stifling extended family relationships, pervasive corruption, urban apathy and decadence, and the stench of uncontrolled urbanization.    I can understand how an Indian in the \\"fat belly\\" caste or aspirations of joining it would take great offense at this book. However, the author succeeds very well in depicting the India of the \\"darkness\\" that the sanitized films, cookbooks, travel brochures and sponsored CNN ads so effectively mask to outsiders. It is a necessary counterbalance, and thoroughly entertaining too.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|My wife and I had never seen this movie and bought it not thinking it would be any good.  It was much better entertainment than we expected and is going to be a new holiday tradition for us.<br />It's not your typical old black and white movie.  The story is excellent.
B001H69D9K|5.0|A truncated version of this lasting an hour was shown on the BBC in the UK last year and it was truly amazing. The standard of musicianship, sound and filming was as good as you are ever likely to see. It helps enormously that it was filmed at Ronnie Scotts Jazz Club in London which gives an intimacy to the performances that larger venues will never do.<br /><br />It helps of course if you have a fantastic band. Becks here is absolutely top notch whether you are talking Rock or Jazz. Vinnie Colaiuta is on drums. He's played with Chick Corea, Joni Mitchell, Frank Zappa to name but a few. Technically one hell of a drummer. Tal Wilkenfeld is less well known, but building a great reputation as a bass player. Finally on keyboards is Jason Rebello, one of the UK's finest Jazz Pianists. Lets not forget one of the best rock guitarists of course Jeff Beck.<br /><br />With the reputation of Jeff's backing musicians you might be thinking this isn't for you - long jazz solos etc. Well don't worry, there are long solos but Jeff Beck plays them, with all his usual inventivness. The other musicians get the occasional moment (well they did on the edited version I saw) but mainly provide a a great foundation for Jeff Beck.<br /><br />The guests add some variety, and the rare chance to see Eric Clapton with Jeff Beck playing the blues is worth the price of the disc alone.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|What an awesome concert this was! This is a 2 disc DVD.  The second disc has most (all?) the songs from the Dark Side of the Moon.  Between the music, watching the musicians, light show and videos that go with the music, this was a great way to spend the evening - it would be even better if you have a theater-room.  Better than being there and probably the best concert I've seen.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was fortunate enough to find tickets to the Broadway show of Wicked in mid-December, and couldn't stop talking about the show to everyone. (It's fabulous, and I highly recommend it!) Anyway, when I saw the soundtrack on Amazon, I couldn't resist ordering it. The songs take you sequentially through the show and it's a wonderful soundtrack to get you through the day. Amazon definitely had the lowest price compared to other online retailers and stores in my area.
0783233477|5.0|Many critics, and if I remember correctly, even Mr. Pitt himself, were highly negatively critical of this film.  This, in my opinion is Mr. Pitt's best work, including the current Button movie which is excellent.  Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt work so well together.  Mr. Hopkins is, as always, top-notch.  All the roles were perfectly cast and acted.  Each time I watch this well-made film, it is like eating my favorite desert: over and over and wanting more. Brad Pitt and the peanut butter is so sweet.  Mr. Hopkins love for his wife is deeply moving.  Peace
B001QB9H10|4.0|\\"Transporter 3\\" is a high-action action film that shows off what has been the endearing traits that has caused this series to be a hit at the theater and worldwide, and that's a good thing because this episode of the series suffers from too much imitation of star Jason Statham's other films. It is as if the producers felt that they had to borrow elements of Crank and Death Race to assure that the series' fans wouldn't desert it.<br /><br />Statham again plays Frank Martin, an ex-Special Forces soldier who lives in Marseilles and works as a \\"Transporter,\\" someone who delivers merchandise in his black Audi no questions asked. This time, he is forced to deliver a package in the trunk, and a young woman sitting in the back seat. He and the woman are fitted with bracelets that will explode if either one strays too far from Martin's vehicle. Martin struggles to figure out what is going on with his forced clients, the identity of the girl, who isn't forthcoming with information, and how to remove the bracelets without killing himself and the girl.<br /><br />Because of the lack of confidence of the producers, we are forced to endure not just car chases and crashes, but way over-the-top car stunts reminiscent of the Death Race film, and the bracelet device smacks of Crank, where Statham was a hit man injected with a poison that will kill him if his heart rate drops, causing him to move at a frenetic pace for most of that film so he won't die. In this film, Statham has to perform all kinds of stunts to keep up with the vehicle so he won't blow up.<br /><br />Fortunately, the film is also keeps the martial arts action, witty script, and the endearing relationship between Martin and local detective Tarconi, played by Francois Berleand. Also, the woman, played by Natalya Rudokova, is charming enough to help overcome some of the irritation at the film's imitations.<br /><br />Transporter 3 is worth seeing, but if there is a fourth film, one hopes that the film will find ways to revitalize without cannibalizing the star's other films.the star's other films.

031606792X|2.0|First, let me preface that I absolutely adored the first 3 books in this series.  I'm one of those \\"foaming at the mouth\\" fans that read each book in 2 days because I just couldn't get enough.  Even with all that love and desire for the characters, the author, the concept, etc, I could not give this book more than 2 stars.  I found myself reading and asking myself if these were even the same characters.  Was this really the same author?<br /><br />I know many of you are still going to want to read this because you are already so invested in the story.  So, here is my advice to you:<br /><br />1.  Read the first 138 pages.  Honestly I could have stopped there and really wish I had but, this section of the book reads like the rest of the series and was a great start.<br /><br />2. SKIP, I repeat, SKIP the section called Jacob.  It is worse than a B  Sci-Fi movie on at 2 am in the morning.  It stops being good fantasy and turns...well... absurd.  The characters don't even sound like themselves and the whole Jacob point of view seems to be uncomfortable for the author.  She writes as Bella so well, but writing as Jacob felt forced. I was actually laughing while reading portions of this book because it was so bad. I don't know if it is possible for a character in a book to \\"over-act\\" but that is what it felt like.<br /><br />3.  Ask a friend for a 3 sentence run down on the Jacob section you skipped (just to catch you up to speed if you want to continue reading).  I don't want to give any of the book away so I won't post a run down here but I'm sure you have a friend unfortunate enough to have read the whole book.<br /><br />4.  Jump to page 367 and start reading again.  Prepare to be a little disappointed and totally annoyed by the character Nessie but it's still worth it to get some closure. I enjoyed a lot of this section, Bella was Bella again and Edward sounded like himself once more.  The passion and undying love was as electric as ever and I was able to forget and forgive Ms. Meyer for the rest.
B0000013G9|5.0|TLC's best album will always be CrazySexyCool. Dont get me wrong because Oooooooohhh On The TLC Tip was a great album too but this album was nicely put together with a lot of hot tracks that showed TLC's true potential and talent.<br /><br />Creep, Diggin On You, Kick Your Game and Switch showed you that TLC can hold their own with the fast tracks. Red Light Special, Let's Do It Again, and Take Our Time are soulful love ballads that would keep this album in constant rotation. Tracks like Case Of The Fake People, Waterfalls and Something Wicked This Way Comes are the reasons why I have the utmost respect for TLC: you are guaranteed to get a track of substance from them unlike these R&B artists nowadays that are all about sex, sex and more sex. Now I know that there are a few exceptions in R&B now but a few exceptions are not enough to save a wonderful genre from being on life support.<br /><br />At any rate I gave this album five stars because I cant think of any bad songs on this album and even the silly skits with Busta Rhymes dont sound out of place on here. CrazySexyCool is one of the best R&B albums of all time by the best R&B trio to grace the mic and is definitely worth being in the collection of everybody thats a fan of Old School R&B.<br />Two Thumbs Way up<br /><br />Rest In Peace Lisa \\"Left Eye Lopes!
0545128285|5.0|Although Dumbledore has scribbled a few notes in it, none of it has to do with the actual 1-7 Harry Potter books.

(Kinda scary but you have to learn some time or another.) I did skip one part however- (SPOILER ALERT! The part about the 2nd brother killing himself after the stones affect made him depressed. Well leave that for another time.)<br /><br />I really enjoy this book and I think other Potter fans will too! I think its worth every penny!
0316776963|5.0|I've never come upon a book that physically made me laugh out loud until I found this one. My only complaint is that I wanted the book to be much, much longer. It's a great book for busy people who can only read a chapter at a time. I will admit, I did question my sanity while reading this since most of the humor is rather twisted. But if insanity breeds this kind of humor, I don't mind. Buy the book if you want to laugh. Period.
B000002J09|4.0|Page DID NOT play on the Kink's \\"You Really Got Me\\". He wasn't in the room, he wasn't in the same town as the Kinks. He didn't get involved in working with them until 2 weeks after the song was done.    If Page did 1/10 of what people claim for him, he might actually be a genius rather than a petty liar and outright thief.
B001I8A76A|3.0|I personally liked Pink better when she first came out as an R&B singer. I was not a happy when she made the switch. I liked the 1st cd, I thought she was alot better of an artist, at the time. But when get the party started came out, I was like ugh? This sucks. So i haven't been a fan since she first started out. But with this new CD,I thought the singles were actually pretty good, upbeat, and very well done. She hasn't totally won me over, but she's done a good job of coming back. I'm really surprised shes been able to stay current after all these years. I saw this performed live on MTV and I was like wow this is a pretty good song. I like the concept and the idea. Plus, she stuck to more a rock sound,instead of trying to infuse techo/pop rock crap.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We have two boys 5 and a 6 years old, who took to this game instantly. We parents got sucked in too, since it's so easy to grasp but it leaves a lot of room for mastery.

B000096IBI|5.0|Chaplins's  genius on display as he rails against a system that is still slowly driving us all insane. He was also a one man campaign against talkies as late as 1936. You know what? He won. Except for sound effects & music he made his points satirically, romantically, classically without words. The sound effects did help of course. I imagined watching The Three Stooges without coversation, only their trademark sound effects. Still hilarious. The political tone was not popular nor was Chaplin & even less so as post war paranoia seized the country a few years later. Chaplin was ahead of his time, ironically, with a silent movie. He has a  romance, gets some anti-capitalist licks in, gets into legal trouble, stresses out & dances constantly. I never tire of the little tramp. A classic keeper for all times.

B001LRJH0K|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Video/sound quality are quite good.  The picture is a little subdued, but still very clear, colorful, and detailed.<br />*Includes a commentary, additional scenes, and four featurettes.  And it includes a digital copy.<br />*There are a few gunfights, but they are very brief.  For the most part, this is an intriguing drama.<br />*Production design is excellent.  Exterior locations are interesting.  Interior locations are detailed and colorful.  Costumes and props are good.  I think much of it is also fairly realistic; the sets look authentic, and there are some parts where people appear to be doing tradescraft in a realistic manner.<br />*Photography is good.<br />*Despite the length of the film, it maintains pacing very well.  All of the scenes are not too long and to-the-point.<br />*Characters are good; they are well-developed and compassionate without being to extreme.  Acting and writing are excellent.<br />*There isn't much expository dialogue to describe the story's actions (the dialogue seems more character-driven), but if you pay attention, the storyline is good.<br />*Music is good.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Despite the pacing and occasional violence, the movie is still mostly a long drama.  It requires some tolerance; if you're looking for pure action or violence, this may bore you.<br />*Not for kids; rated R for violence and quite a bit of swearing (and one scene where some unruly characters were urinating on the floor).<br /><br />It took me a couple of viewings to truly appreciate Ed Harris' directorial debut.  But now I can say that I got it, and it is a very interesting story with some very interesting characters.  If you have the patience for it, it can be a very rewarding viewing experience.  Otherwise, you might fall asleep through it.

B00005JPNY|5.0|The Golden Compass is a wonderful story.  It differs from many fantasy and fairy tales in that it forwards the idea that people can and should think for themselves and that those who do can be good, caring people.  The antagonist in this story are highly organized, dogmatic factions that wrongly believe they know better for the rest of world.  In their hubris these people commit great atrocities and crimes, consequently doing more harm than good.      If you consider yourself a free-thinking person that holds reason, logic, and independant thinking in high regard this is a great story as these are the qualities of the story's protagonist.
B001KL3GY0|2.0|This one is stale to me.  I loved their first one, and most all of the second one.  There aren't any real stand-outs on this one.  It isn't horrible, but it doesn't have the feel of the music that drew me to them originally.  No band should sound the same every single time, but they should try to write more catchy music.  I found myself scanning and skipping through on the first run through.  Over time, I might warm up to it.  Before buying this one, check out the first two.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is a cute film about a robot who takes trash and compacts it   like the auto trash dump does. Then a new robot comes to earth to find  something, and Wall-E falls in love with it.     When the other robot starts to jet back to its home planet, Wall-E follows  behind. Things start to happen on the spaceship and Eve the other robot  tries to help him get back to earth.  In the process, Eve starts to care for Wall-E.    It is kind of silly for robots to fall in love, it kind of shows kids what  it is like for adults when they start to have feelings for another person.  In not as graphic a way as an R rated movie would show.  I think it is a cute way to show kids about feelings.

0553199803|5.0|No spoilers<br /><br />As you can tell from the other reviews here, this novel is, without a doubt, one of the best espionage thrillers ever crafted. You can find plot summaries and stellar reviews for this book on this site ad nauseam, so I'll keep my two cents short and sweet...<br /><br />This is a very well-thought out book pitting the most professional of assassins against a smart and determined lawman. The best part of this book is that what you would call the climax (the attempt on President de Gaulle's life) doesn't even happen until the VERY end, yet you don't even notice it. The entire book is basically dedicated to the methodical and tedious preparations the assassin must make to prepare for the job, which sounds like it would be a boring read. However, Forsyth crafts it in such a way that even though history knows the outcome of the assassination attempt(s) on the President, it is still a truly thrilling read to the end.<br /><br />Please read this book right now, just try to hold yourself back from reading it in one sitting or you'll be sad it's over so quickly.

031606792X|5.0|I didn't start reading this series until about 2 months ago.  If I had had the time, I would have read all of them in about a week, but going slower allowed me to let each one sink in.  All except the last 2, where I could not bear to wait to start Breaking Dawn directly after finishing Eclipse.      At first the tone of the book being so different from the previous ones threw me, but as I got into it I came to love it am much as the first 3.  Looking back it reminded me a lot of how I felt about New Moon. I missed Edward so much during New Moon that at first I didn't think I liked New Moon as well as Twilight, but now I realize why he had to go.  Can you imagine the rest of the series if he hadn't done what he did?  I think the same is true with Breaking Dawn.  How else could this series possibly end?      It's not the ending I was picturing and maybe I am a sucker for a happy ending, but there is not one thing that I would change about this book.  The only reason I can think of to explain the negative reviews are that people started with Breaking Dawn (what a shame), people think things have to be sad to be \\"good\\", or that the majority of the audience is young and the concept of seeing Bella and Edward go from teens to married adults with a child deosn't work for them.  As a woman of about SM age with children of my own, I LOVED IT.      Only problem is that I am hopelessly in love with Edward.  Oh well.  One last thing, I hope that SM finishes Midnight Sun and that while the Twilight Saga may be over, that the Twilight Universe isn't done.      Thank you Stephenie Meyer for writing a series that touched me like few others.
B001KW0C96|2.0|What happens when someone in Hollywood gets a great idea, but the execution of said idea becomes mismanaged, resulting in an essentially half-hearted attempt at a movie? Well, one could say that the outcome would resemble something similar to the mind-numbingly formulaic, contrived, and completely devoid of any thrills thriller known as \\"Righteous Kill\\" starring screen legends Robert DeNiro (\\"Goodfellas\\") and Al Pacino (\\"The Godfather\\" trilogy).    \\"Righteous Kill\\" centers upon two detectives, \\"Turk\\" (Robert DeNiro) and \\"Rooster\\" (Al Pacino), longtime partners within the NYPD for over 30 years. For these two decorated officers the streets shouldn't be able to offer them any new surprises; that is until several known criminals begin getting murdered by an alleged vigilante. To make matters worse, the dead bodies are all tied to cases the pair had solved over their many years on the force, prompting many in the department to wonder if one of their own has gone over the edge.    Prior to viewing this film I began to notice some rather strange omissions from the trailers preceding the impending release upon DVD and Blu-ray. Namely, the lack of any critical praise being thrown about; of course, this makes perfect sense given that a vast majority of film critics blasted the movie to pieces. With a growing sense that perhaps this movie is as lackluster as the critics had said it was, I found that my eagerness to see it was waning significantly. Yet, like a glutton for punishment I decided to sit down one night to see it for myself, because even though the movie was almost universally panned, I still like to make my own judgments about a film. Needless to say, after watching \\"Righteous Kill\\" I find myself in complete agreement with the majority of the critics, and wondering why on Earth did this film ever see the light of day, let alone find its way into the hands of two of Hollywood's icons?    To attempt to understand where this film went wrong we must first look at the base on which the film stands... the screenplay. Next to the involvement of actors Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, the other big surprise surrounding this film was the fact that the script was written by the man who penned the outstanding heist film \\"Inside Man\\", writer Russell Gewirtz. After crafting such an entertaining thriller full of twists and turns and originality, I'm surprised that Gewirtz's follow-up would essentially embody the antithesis of all that was great about his previous script. With \\"Righteous Kill\\" there is nary a hint of originality, in place of that is an abundance of predictability that causes all of the potential twists and turns that the story will no doubt throw at the audience to fail due to the sheer obviousness of the proceedings.    On top of that is the fact that the only way any sense of suspense was created in this film was through a contrived plot device where several of the characters are referred to solely by their nicknames. This way the viewer doesn't know who is really who until the final moments of the film. It is this manufactured form of suspense that made me feel especially disappointed for two reasons. One, I can't think of a single person whose nickname is the only name by which they are called; and second, if Russell Gewirtz didn't want certain people's identities being truly known until the end, there are much more natural ways to achieve this. For instance, many people don't even refer to someone by name when talking to them, especially if they are very familiar with them. So, in the movie the nickname device could have still been used in conjunction with just casual conversation where no names are ever mentioned. This way the dialogue could still feel natural, and the unknown identities would still be a form of manufactured suspense, but one far less obvious and annoying.    Now lets move on to the director of this travesty, the much maligned (by me, that is) Jon Avnet, director of the abominable \\"88 Minutes\\". From whatI have been able to gather after watching Jon's last two attempts at feature films, if it weren't for the surprisingly talented cast members he is able to ensnare, his films would most likely wind up on rental shelves or never even see the light of day in the first place. I find myself completely surprised that this man is able to get such high-caliber actors and actresses to flesh out his roles. Granted his track record of television shows (\\"Boomtown\\" for instance) is a bit more impressive, even if his shows haven't been the longest lasting, at least they were compelling; and it is conceivable that news of the utter crap-fest that was \\"88 Minutes\\" was not made known until after it was too late and those involved in this film were already signed. With those two thoughts in mind, they may serve as an explanation as to why Pacino and DeNiro would even consider joining up with such a hack director; although Pacino by all rights should have already figured out that this guy didn't have a clue after his time spent headlining the previous film. Whatever the case may be for why this man still has work coming to him in Hollywood, from my perspective he's had his first and second chances, and massively blown them both, so I can't understand why he isn't just shown the door or at least his way onto the B-list, a.k.a. the Direct-to-DVD list.    As I stated before, the biggest surprise of all surrounding this movie, was the involvement of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. The last time these two screen legends had acted opposite each other was in the superbly crafted \\"Heat\\" from director Michael Mann. Here we are 13 years later, and what should have been one of the greatest Hollywood reunions of all time, is wasted in a movie that is well below their considerable talents. Although some could argue that neither actor has been at the top of their game in quite some time; I still believed that their common sense would have told them to run away from this mess before it is too late. ButI guess I would have been wrong on that count. Which leads me to wonder if these two acting giants have lost the drive that once made them such forces to be reckoned with, and is it too late for them to reclaim what they appear to have lost?    I will say that even though this film is well below the standards of their prime, both Pacino and DeNiro did give decent performances. However, I would have to say that neither one seemed too committed to their respective role, but at least they weren't just overtly going through the motions without a care, as they have done in some of their recent work (i.e. \\"88 Minutes\\"). Joining them we have actress Carla Gugino (\\"Sin City\\") who serves the purpose of being nothing more than the eye candy of the film. Her role doesn't really offer anything to the proceedings, and the one point in the story when it seems her character may have some relevance after all, is squandered in the end. Other supporting cast members include Donnie Wahlberg (\\"Saw 2\\") and John Leguizamo (\\"The Happening\\") as two other police officers with ties to some of the various criminals being murdered. I'm sure their characters were intended to serve as compelling antagonists to Pacino and DeNiro's, but in the end both of them appear as bland and uninspired as the rest of the production, despite the efforts of Leguizamo and Wahlberg. Lastly, Brian Dennehy appears in a thankless role so small that it is almost relegated to cameo status as the boss/friend of \\"Turk\\" and \\"Rooster\\". Brian Dennehy is a talented actor who has always managed to entertain no matter the role; yet in this film even he can't make a miracle happen and his choice for signing onto this project seems just as bewildering as the two leads.    It's a shame that such a large amount of talent was wasted on such a generic movie as \\"Righteous Kill\\", and truth be told had the star power associated with this film not been involved, I have no doubt that most people never would have heard of the movie andit would have found its way directly on to rental shelves instead of in theaters. Now, if you have not seen a mystery/thriller or any kind of cop movie or television program, then perhaps you will find \\"Righteous Kill\\" to be outstanding; however, if you have seen any of the aforementioned, then you will most likely find this film to be just as dull and boring as I did.    \\"Righteous Kill\\" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality.

B001DPC4TG|5.0|Everyone has heard these songs over and over again... but you haven't heard them on RTI 180 gram vinyl. This pressing is excellent, on a good system it's easily better than the CD including the remastered Best of Both Worlds CDs which sound pretty good for CD. This is a great sounding pressing that won't make you think you overpaid for an old record you could have got on ebay for a few bucks. It's first class with a nice heavy poly record sleeve and a poster/liner notes on the inside. Im very happy with this LP, it's all that makes vinyl great and none of what vinyl doesn't do well. And like I said, it's top notch music everyone has heard too. It's just a win win win. If you like vinyl or Van Halen or both, just get it.
B001LF4IA6|1.0|There are two major problems with this release. #1 It seems like a rush job to capitalize on the election of Obama. There is nothing wrong with taking a few years between releases. The audience will wait. #2 Brendan Obrien. I was willing to put up with the crappy sound of Magic because the songs were good. These leftovers sound like bootlegs.     The only people that should be allowed to work on the production end of a Springsteen album are Jon Landau, Chuck Plotkin, Toby Scott, and Bob Clearmountain.     Bob Ludwig should have been ashamed to put his name on this.

Released in 1983 Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble's debut album is by far there best and has remained a classic album to this day. What's shocking about this album is that it was recorded in only a mere three days and what's even more shocking is that it took Stevie Ray Vaughan almost ten years before he landed a record deal.<br /><br />  Texas Flood, was respectivley named by Stevie Ray Vaughan to honor Larry Davis a relatively unknown blues guitarist from Austin Texas wrote the original version of, \\"Texas Flood\\", back in 1960, Stevie Ray Vaughan's version contains a slow beginning beat but then launches into a wailing blues guitar solo that keeps you listening every time. Some key tracks on \\"Texas Flood\\" are, \\"Pride and Joy\\", \\"Texas Flood\\", \\"Mary Had A Little Lamb\\", \\"Tell Me\\", and more.

Ralph Maccio does a fair job, but the guy that plays Willie Brown, Joe Seneca, is outstanding and the best in the movie. The duel with Steve Vai as Jack Butler from Memphis is awesome, and the movie has that great climax of good vs evil, with good winning in the end. You gotta get it!
B00000JZJ0|4.0|Even though the Pioneer DVD is long out of print and might be more expensive than the readily available Artisan release, you should make the effort to track the out of print disc anyway!<br />Why bother?<br />Well, the Pioneer release includes the R-rated and Unrated versions of the film, a commentary with Brian Yuzna,Jeffrey Combs, and a bunch of others involved in the making of Bride of Reanimator.  Also, there are things like conceptual drawings, behind the scenes footage, outtakes,etc.<br />The Pioneer 'Special Edition' truly deserves that label.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|[[ASIN:1440498466 Charity: The Rodeo]]<br /><br />I am a Gay Cowboy and proud! When I found out about the movie I was in class at college and went to the website to check it out and save the page to my external drive for opening at home, while also listening to the preview music. I couldn't wait to get the movie as it's a 'true' story about love - a 'love that has no boundaries'! Knowing how full of hate so many religious cult followers have, I knew they would put it down, and at the same time it came out, I was residing in a so-called 'christian' home where there was nothing but hate, greed, self-servitude, deceit, drugs, and more! Now isn't it sad how many of these fundamentalists put down anyone who is different or better, yet are savages themselves?<br /><br />When it finally came out in the theaters I was still at that 'place of hate' and so anxious to see it, but not only had I been keeping my personal life and feelings to myself, as well as my opinion - especially when it came to wanting to stand up for my own people - but I had to 'hide' my enthusiasm when I 'snuck' out the door after giving a line about seeing some other movie while getting the third degree about Brokeback Mountain being at the same theater! I won't tell what was said, but maybe you can imagine! Sad how ugly this guy was and how much 'hate' he had within!<br /><br />I was so excited when I got to the theater and could barely wait for the movie to begin, while the theater was also packed with a mixture of folks, as well as nationalities! I watched the movie and wanted to see it again as it really told the 'truth' of life on the range, though many 'homophobic' fundamentalists will always deny that something so true would ever be right or accepted as far as they're concerned!<br /><br />When it ended I was not the only one in tears! While a few patrons left, there were those of us who stayed to the very end of the credits while sharing amongst one another their many different feelings about the movie, as well as the way it ended, which was so sad, but true! Breeders and teachers of hate will always be around, and though education helps in many cases, sheep or religious followers who are so full of hate will 'never' change unfortunately! When I got back home I not only had to hide my enthusiasm about the movie, but also had to lie about what I had seen at the theater knowing what would happen if I told the truth! I'd of been on the streets looking for another place to live!<br /><br />When the movie finally arrived I watched it several times and each time cried for both of them, but especially for Jake's character! When you fall in love with someone and are willing to give up your own life for that person, yet they turn their back on you out of fear or not sure if that's what they really want, it can destroy the other person in so many ways! A lot of Jake's character was like me and I could 'feel' his hurt to the point that I forgot it was a movie and wanted so much to comfort him! I am like Jake's character in so many ways, while wishing some day of having a Ranch of my own, or by proxy, while at the same time wishing I had the money to buy land and build a Ranch somewhere here or near the Antelope Valley here in California. Then, it was a place for myself where I could create movies, since I now know about video design and more thanks to one of my classes at Antelope Valley College, but now it would be an 'Intentional Community Ranch' where other folks who could enjoy life on a Working Ranch and Movie Studio would be most welcome to live!<br /><br />With so many fundamentalist sectarian religious cults out there that breed and spread nothing but hate, while there's so few places where folks could go and 'be themselves', the Ranch is a dream and goal that I am reaching for, while in part, would be a dedication to other Cowboys and Cowgirls who are not so 'mainstream' and 'stereotyped', but who share a love of togetherness and community! I also admire AngLee for what he did with this 'true' movie of shared love between two Cowboys and though I'll never meet him or another guy I admire who is Huell Houser, one day I hope to also create movies similar to either Brokeback Mountain, or even documentaries like what Huell does on his many journeys!<br /><br />I highly recommend Brokeback Mountain for everyone out there who really wants to know the truth and not hype from fundamentalists that being different and unique just doesn't fit into society - their society!shared love between two Cowboys and though I'll never meet him or another guy I admire who is Huell Houser, one day I hope to also create movies similar to either Brokeback Mountain, or even documentaries like what Huell does on his many journeys!

0525951113|5.0|From a reading enjoyment point of view, this book has it all.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end... where there is a \\"setup\\" chapter to prepare for the next book...<br /><br />Unlike most AI take-over-the-world books - which I enjoy, this book does not rely entirely on the implausible accidental or on-purpose creation of a super intelligence computer program.  I enjoy these types of books anyway, even though I understand the impossibility of such an event actually happening (as a long-time computer programmer and even part of the MIT AI effort in the late 60's).  After all, we can't even write an operating system that works... (sorry, Microsoft).<br /><br />What this book relies on is the use of thousands of \\"daemons\\" that are simple and are triggered by external events - in this case, by the appearence of a set of keywords in the news sites.  These are distributed worldwide on hundreds of thousands of machines.  All this is designed by a billionaire game developer, to be released on his death.<br /><br />The story is quite riveting.  Spellbinding.  However, there are a few things I should mention.<br /><br />First, the early chapter of XXX rated gratuitous criminal sex is unnecessary and unwelcome.  Second, the underlying belief of the game programmer is that society is about to die, and evolution is going to take us to a new place that is \\"better\\" and will save billions of lives.  The reality is unlimited evil and total disregard for human life is let lose (just like in video games), and civilization is being destroyed in the name of the \\"new order\\" where mankind will be enslaved to the daemons.<br /><br />Sounds like the 1930's and 1940's all over again... after all, Hitler was only trying to \\"help\\" evolution along with his plan to kill the Jews...  Here, we destroy civilization and introduce the mayhem of violent computer games as an upgrade.  Sigh.<br /><br />By the time you get to the end of the book, you realize that the approach taken to get past the AI requirement did not pan out... the daemons and the people behind them were beginning to take on god-like powers and capabilities.  At least they got there from a conceptually possible approach...<br /><br />In all, while the underpinnings of the book are weak, you can easily forget them and get drawn into a wild and crazy ride.  Enjoy!an out... the daemons and the people behind them were beginning to take on god-like powers and capabilities.  At least they got there from a conceptually possible approach...

B001DJ7PR8|1.0|Why using a narrator when everything is clear and is flowing smoothly? The same old themes revisited, why? I find Penelope hideous and Bardem unbelievable in his role of an artist. What's more, it is annoying to find these Spaniards trying to convey their ideas in English just when they are having an argument. I don't see a solid reason to make their arguments in English in front of Scarlett. It's annoying seeing Bardem repeating his IN ENGLISH, SPEAK IN ENGLISH!  Very silly indeed. Not a movie for starters in Woody Allen. Please refer to the movies of the 70s and 80s, Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Manhattan, Hannah and her Sisters or more recently, Match Point.  Keep away from this movie!

0316776963|4.0|This memoir is Garrison Keillor crossed with Augusten Burroughs. More drugs than Keillor, but less depravity than Burroughs. It's non-linear and each essay is a portrayal of an event in his life or a family member. As you read it, it becomes apparent some embellishment is going on. It's a shared wink, I think, between author and reader, and I didn't mind. He's a James Thurber for our age.    One of the shortest essays, \\"Big Boy,\\" is the funniest. At a party, he has to go to the bathroom. Once there, he discovers that the toilet contains a huge, uh, product that will not flush away. Someone knocks on the door and he panics, not wanting the next visitor to think said product is his. What to do? Well, there's a window ...    In his portrayal of the childhood and teen years of his sister, the actress Amy Sedaris, he shows that she was headed to the stage at an early age. She wore fat suits to dismay her father. She made phone calls, imitating the voice of someone else. She would put fake cuts and bruises on her face and when asked how she got them, would reply, \\"I'm in love!\\"    His mockery of New York restaurants that offer absurd, overpriced meals with ridiculous ingredients stacked vertically on the plate is priceless. After the meal, he buys a hot dog, relieved to be eating something \\"horizontal.\\"    David Sedaris is one funny guy.

0345494997|2.0|This book has some strengths to commend it: It is well-researched and historically accurate. BUT: I found two main flaws in this novel, or at least in my enjoyment of it.      First, Horan, although a fine writer, is not a storyteller.  Her descriptions are static and somewhat austere, lacking in both descriptive and emotional power. For that reason, this novel was the antithesis of a page-turner; it was real work to keep going.    Second, great literature can take the particular and universalize it while at the same time take the universal and particularize it.  In the hands of a great writer, the tale of a grand theme (love, war) or a minor one (a really good sandwich, packing up a house after a divorce) will resonate with the reader's own emotions because the story transcends the particulars of its characters but also will take the reader beyond his or her own experience because of the particularity of the characters and situations.      This book did the reverse: It drained the characters of both individuality and transcendence, making their great love story banal.  Ostensibly, this novel's subject is one of the most notorious affairs of the 20th Century. But in the hands of this writer, it just seemed like the most common tale - two bored folks in the 'burbs with a case of the hot pants, who acted on it, and then had to live - at least for a while - with their regrets.      If you have a particular interest in Frank Lloyd Wright and his loves, or in this historical time period, read a good work of biography.  If you're looking for a transporting novel or story, just look elsewhere.
B001GCUNVW|3.0|The Wrestler contains few surprises, and its climax is telegraphed from the very opening montage of old match posters.  I sometimes felt as if I were watching one of those 50's and early 60's movies with Burt Lancaster or Marlon Brando or the Paul Newman of Cool Hand Luke where the hero keeps getting dealt lump after lump in life and equally keeps coming back for more.  Another parallel, of sorts, is Rocky, but The Wrestler is grittier and considerably more real.  Mickey Rourke couldn't be better (coincidentally, I'd watched him a couple nights earlier at home in Diner and you'd never know they were the same actor) and Marisa Tomei matches him.  Evan Rachel Wood as his daughter seems overmatched by the others.  Best of all may be the camaraderie between the wrestlers -- some of whom are the real item -- who carefully plan out each match, but that doesn't make the blood and the pain in the choreographed spectacle any less real.  (Spoiler ahead) And there is a lot of blood in The Wrestler, none of it fatal, all of it vivid. When Rourke briefly retires, he takes a job in a grocery store deli.  You know the rest of that tale.     Here's the Wrestler in a nut shell -- some five star performances and effects in a too familiar two star story.
B00005B4GU|2.0|It's difficult not to think of Amnesiac as a collection of B-sides from [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]], masquerading as an album. A few tracks on it essentially are B-sides. There's even an alternate version of one Kid A song (\\"Morning Bell\\"). For what it's worth, it's better than the original, though the original wasn't a high point of Kid A. There is also one song (\\"Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors\\") that sounds like a demo for the title track of Kid A (or, perhaps, a vocoder test rather than a full-fledged demo), and a completely pointless two-minute guitar noodle (\\"Hunting Bears\\"). This sort of thing is exactly what you'd expect from a B-side collection -- similar to the stuff on the original album, only less coherent.    The most well-known songs from Amnesiac are probably \\"Pyramid Song,\\" \\"Knives Out,\\" and \\"You And Whose Army?\\" But all three are very similar, and make for pedestrian listening. Kid A also has many songs like this, but the best ones, like \\"How To Disappear Completely,\\" have an expansive dramatism created by theatrically lonely keyboard melodies. \\"Pyramid Song\\" has an echo of that in the woozy synths. But the other two, despite their aggressive titles, are languid, sleepy, blurry mumbles, far too mannered for their own good. In my review of Kid A, I argued that the album opened the door for vapid minimalism posing as a serious statement in the music of the 2000s. Much of Amnesiac is the fallout from that event -- lots of vapid minimalism, but without the dramatic flourishes that elevated Kid A above its epigones. Blur's album [[ASIN:B0000931OG Think Tank]], an obvious Radiohead imitation, contains many songs like these three ballads, and often better. The similarity is really evident when you hear \\"You And Whose Army?\\" where Thom Yorke even sounds like Damon Albarn.    This tossed-off quality comes up throughout the album. Not only are the lyrics nonsensical (no stranger to that, Radiohead), but they are superfluous. For example, \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" the opening track of Kid A, had chopped up, seemingly meaningless lyrics (\\"there are two colours in my head\\" and so forth), but they were delivered in a careful, deliberate way, with a theatrical build-up. You couldn't understand what they meant, but at least you knew that they were supposed to mean something. But in \\"Packed Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Box,\\" the opening track of Amnesiac, Yorke just mumbles, \\"I'm a reasonable man, get off my case,\\" in monotone. He might as well be mumbling any other phrase from [[ASIN:B000024B9S Karl Hyde]]'s notebook. Or he might as well not be mumbling anything at all.    To be fair, though, the music in \\"Packed Like Sardines...\\" is actually quite good, a breezy little drum-machine pattern that sounds a lot more fun (and danceable) than anything on Kid A, and especially benefits from a comparison to the leaden rhythm in \\"Idioteque.\\" Amnesiac has a looser feel than Kid A, which yields good results when Radiohead are in an energetic mood. \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" is based on a rhythmic grind similar to \\"The National Anthem\\" from Kid A, but more upbeat and exciting, and ultimately closer in spirit to \\"Electioneering\\" from [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]], which was really quite a good song, come to think of it.    The last two songs are the best ones: \\"Like Spinning Plates,\\" another sorrowful electronic ballad in the style of Kid A (with glitchy sound effects), and \\"Life In A Glass House,\\" which makes very interesting use of a brass band. This time, the brass actually plays music, as opposed to the cacophony in \\"The National Anthem.\\" This is one of the few times when Amnesiac doesn't feel like a B-side collection.    Ideally, Kid A and Amnesiac should have been combined into one album. And now, I suppose anyone can do it on their playlists. Start with Kid A, cut the last two tracks, and replace them with the last two tracks from Amnesiac. Then replace \\"The National Anthem\\" with \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" (which works much better as a \\"loud song\\"). Also replace \\"Treefingers\\" with \\"Packed Like Sardines...\\" If you like, add \\"Pyramid Song,\\" or perhaps the Amnesiac version of \\"Morning Bell.\\" Then, perhaps, you'll have something closer to what Radiohead were hoping to achieve with their foray into IDM. If they had released such an album, instead of two, the decade may have yielded a lot more interesting music.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|The most interesting thing about this movie is that you can see how George Lucas ripped off the original book, 'Dune' by Frank Herbert, for his 'Star Wars' series. By the time Lucas gets to filming 'The Phantom Menace,' he has graduated to David Lynch's level of making sci-fi movies like 'Dune.' These kind of movies are filled with sword fighting, endless expository monologues, stilted dialogue, worries over economic warfare and pained attempts to invoke classical and religious themes. This movie shows Kyle Machlan teaching ragtag sand dwellers how to tear apart stone by making resonating sounds with their voices. Oh, and it has big worms.
B00005JNQA|3.0|Yet another case where the 5 and 1 star reviews are dominating with it having no resonance what so ever in my experience - why cant you reviewers make your point verbally rather than exaggerating the amount of stars you give?<br />The plot is realistic in the sense of how the world deals with conflicts in non-oil rich 'banana republics' and the director's pro UN / anti war point of view shines clearly through. Other than that the story line is thin and far fetched as many have pointed out. But the acting is no less excellent despite of that and there are many philosophical gems inserted along the way (allegedly all deriving from the sayings in the 'Ku' language).<br />With realistic expectations the movie is maybe not a must see but a good overall experience nevertheless and we must all learn to ignore most of the 5 and 1 star reviews.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Part time-capsule, mostly well acted drama, 'Mad Men' is simply the best show on TV. It demonstrates the kind of genius that is so rare in television writing. You feel as if you're watching real adult conflict. It follows the life of Don Draper, an advertising agency executive with many demons and a shameful past. Somehow, he's an empathetic character, a man who reinvented himself and found his excellence among the disputes with his colleagues, family and most prominently, his lovers. Jon Hamm invokes a certain kind of Cary Grant smoothness in his role as Draper. The supporting cast is fantastic and January Jones is stunning.

0316010669|5.0|One of key ideas of this book is that on many occasions the unconscious can inform the rest of `the person' of a decision that is not realised consciously for some time to come. We need to recognise that, and know how and when to trust these potential critical moments - is it a good judgement or not?    Gladwell has hit upon a winning formula in his writing. His earlier block-busting book has been a key influence in modern thought, and the title (\\"Tipping Point\\") has entered common vocabulary in its own right. The title of this book is not snappy enough to do that, but the book is a fascinating meander through both mental and physiological factors that can result in us making snap decisions. In its own way, this is no less of a classic as his earlier effort.    The book does not only concentrate on key moments where the snap decision has been a `good' one, but also where the decision has been poor or very questionable - indicating when to trust snap decisions, and when not to. The election of Warren Harding as 29th President of the USA is an example of a collective snap decision that proved to be poor. Gladwell uses examples of many experiments, yet these do not detract from the overall narrative.     There are a number of research techniques that are described, yet these are introduced in sufficient detail as to keep the overall interest of the reader. The variety of the knowledge touched upon is breathtaking, so it is a mixture of research, interspersed with little anecdotes, which work very well. The reader is sometimes left wondering how the rest of the story finishes, but that is a comment rather than a criticism.    One of the series of anecdotes relates to the previously unknown prejudice in selecting personnel for orchestras. This only became apparent when auditions when the performers were unseen by the adjudicators became the norm. Gladwell uses this to illustrate that snap decisions sometimes use clues that are unknown and unhelpful.    Thinking about thinking reminds me of the centipede, which when asked how he manages to walk, no longer can. So it is with people thinking. Take the story of how some people think, and use it to avoid possible pitfalls. Read the book, but keep on thinking. Take from it the notion of `Thin Slicing', so that you can realise when snap decisions can be an advantage. Look at the expressions on faces (learn to `mind read'), and if your heart rate is significantly raised, be very careful what you do.     Peter Morgan (morganp@supanet.com)
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I originally rented this movie...almost didn't because most gay movies (in my opinion) aren't that good, but I only regret I didn't see it sooner.I ordered it the same day I first watched it and have since watched it several times. The people in it all seem real, hopefully the biggest compliment an actor can get, and talk like actual people. A common criticism of the movie is that its too short. While I agree the storyline could have been even more developed (and in truth I think I just don't want to leave Zach's life...), there is a charm to its short length and because of the small investment in time to watch it I have watched it much more than I would have if it was 2 or more hours. Also a great soundtrack. The music fits with every scene. One of my all-time favorites of any type of movie.

Acting, story and visual effects are fabulous. If you have a blu-ray player this is a great movie to have in Blu-ray.

I felt like I was going to die (what she wants) at the end. And I fell asleep for three hours afterwards!<br /><br />This video is no joke! Level 1 was easy, but I am still trying to master level 2, which is considerably harder. I love Jillian's toughness! She also pushes you to realize the potential that you have. When I finish the video, I feel like  have conquered something!<br /><br />I am seeing more tone and ab definition. My legs quiver at times due to the intense contractions put on the legs, but like she said - stress (on the body) causes it to change. I know some people may not like the video because its too hard and Jillian is tough, but hey ... if you want results, you gotta put in the work ... and this video helps you do it!

B000WEH74G|4.0|This classic Japanese tale born of truth is endlessly fascinating.  I have collected several different versions of this story from different directors.  Although I must admit my favorite version is the 1962 \\"Chushingura The Loyal 47 Retainers\\" often called the Gone With the Wind of Japan.  The scope and color really pull you in.  This version may harbor subtle motivational elements but is compelling in it's own way.
B001O6W9QC|1.0|I admit, I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes. Movie seemed aimed at 14 year olds and I ain't one, so I guess I couldn't appreciate the over the top chararcters and loose script.  And what's with the praise for Robert Downey in this role? What I saw from him was abysmal.
0061150142|5.0|As, it says on the cover, this is a gripping read and I definitely recommend it.  It follows the story of two teenagers who grew up together and seemed to be destined to live their lives together until one of them is shot and the other is accused of her murder.  Did he kill her or was it suicide? I thought that there was a particular detail in the girl's childhood that could have been better left to the reader's imagination but, other than that, Jodi Picoult does an excellent job of portraying the intense emotions involved and keeping you reading.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Read the reviews from the people here, there is nothing that I can tell you that they haven't already said.  This is serious training, and it is hard at level 1.  There is 3 levels and the work outs are so intense that when I DO make it to level 3 this is going to be something I will be doing for the rest of my life, everyday.  So read these wonderful reviews and only get this DVD if you are serious about getting in shape. Jillian makes it so easy to follow and the exercises are not that hard but the way she put this workout together is what makes it challenging and if you want cardio and you want to sweat then you will definitely find it in this DVD.  I have done it for 5 days now and I can almost stay up with Level 1 and my endurance has gotten much better.  I am a strong and very active woman and when I first started I thought I was going to hyperventilate and die, I couldn't make it thru 20 minutes and I felt so horrible with myself for letting myself get so out of shape, and then my whole body was sore for the next 2 days, every muscle hurt especially around my ribs and abs but I pushed thru it.  Now I feel good about myself for persevering thru it and there is no way I am stopping now.  5 Stars and a HUGE Thank you from me to Jillian, who is about to change my life 4-ever.    Hope this helps ~ Sincerely, Izzy
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Somewhere along the trail, and I don't remember exactly where, I simply tired of the predictability of Bond movies although I never stopped watching them probably out of some perverse personal obligation to say I had seen all of them regardless of whether or not I still enjoyed them. Fortunately, with Casino Royale and Daniel Craig, I sensed reinvigoration to the series and recognized I once again found the franchise thrilling.<br /><br />Craig's Bond is a refreshing diversion, more urban than urbane, confident and competent but falling short of cynical hubris of Connery, Moore or Brosnan. He is rugged rather than elegant and with this step back to the nascent persona much more introspective. While he is undoubtedly 007, he has not experienced so much that his compassion and passion has been misplaced.<br /><br />Casino Royale introduces a freshly credentialed 00 agent, with his spurs so to speak, earned early in the film. The gadgetry we have become so accustomed to is thankfully absent instead replaced by guile, wits, and in some instances, pure luck.  This is a Bond who lacks all the answers and more importantly, fails give the impression he has prior knowledge of all of the questions.  Both the antagonist, with a decidedly predominant of ideological rather than tyrannical bent and the requisite love interest are outside the stereotypical characterizations of the series' later films.<br /><br />This version of Bond may not care if the martini is shaken or stirred but if like me you've found the entire series most recently overly dry, this one might very well be the mix to suit your taste.
0156012073|5.0|This book appears to be for younger readers but the message clearly is for adults as well. The story is told from an adult's point of view and he does not talk down to the reader either. The Little Prince is a journey of life lessons that children seem to know but adults seem to forget. The main message throughout is that the important things in life are invisible. I was also saddened to learn that the author of the book actually was killed in a plane crash a year after the book was published. I took many of the messages away from this book and feel that we as adults need to remember to experience adventure in our lives just like The Little Prince did.

B0014Z4OQG|2.0|This movie took all too long to go anywhere and I knew over about the first 30+ minutes of watching a far-too-long party sequence that it was headed to be a rotten tomato. It begins where everyone is having a great party time before Mr. Monster strikes and you hope maybe it will start  going somewhere w/ subtle (or not so subtle) suggestion or hints that something is about to explode. Well the movie itself is in fact a bomb and the explosive hell that finally (and all too late) breaks loose comes across with no impact other then the thought, \\"where's the beef\\". As others commented negatively, the all too free camera style (shaky, you-are-right-there) has been used far more effectively and creatively in the Jason Borne Movies (the first movie series to really utilize this free style -as some are trying to copy now- ,but, do it so well and with less shake in the process). I rented this movie for $1.99 at the local video rental store (seems perhaps they were trying to get some ROI back on this due to low rentals?) Well, that was about $1.98 too much spent to watch it, but, glad I didn't buy this DVD!  In checking how much revenue this movie brought in; The film has grossed $30,341,830 in DVD sales, bringing its total film gross to $200,944,148. My hats off to those editors who create those \\"trailers\\" we all see to entice us to go see the movie at the theatre or on DVD. Obviously, the trailer was a lot better then this movie!

B001LRJH0U|4.0|Appaloosa as directed by Ed Harris, is a western that will appeal to most fans of the genre regardless of one's preference for the traditional vein in the mode of John Wayne or the modern interpretations like 3:10 to Yuma.<br /><br />Virgil Cole (Harris) and his long-time associate Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) are essentially `cleaners' of a bygone era. Appaloosa is just another dusty town in need of their particular brand of expertise, establishment of a codified rule of law - as defined by the no nonsense Cole - and eradication of the human blight that has plagued the area for the last few years, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) and his despicable crew of trail vermin. While it does not take long to ascertain there will be confrontations on the horizon, the arrival in town of a young attractive widow, Allison French (played by Rene Zellweger) immediately foreshadows complications that may irretrievably alter the dynamic between the complementary partners, Cole and Hitch.<br /><br />There's plenty enough action and violence for the bloodthirsty viewer and well as refined cynicism for those who appreciate the contemplative portrayal of the new age intellectual cowboy (Mortensen's understated performance is a gem, somewhat reminiscent of Val Kilmer as  Doc Holliday in Tombstone, absent the addictiveness) but to the credit of Harris' direction and the screenplay adaptation of Robert B. Parker's novel, the film never seems to meander into the fantastical, where quite often the protagonists are seemingly invincible and infallible.

B00138KK1M|5.0|I've always had a soft spot for Stained Class, an album you didn't really tell your friends you liked so much, no one else seemed to be into it.    This album is Priest's finest moment in the 70's, until their sound took a new direction with \\"Hell Bent For Leather.\\"    There is not a bad song on this one, and even more unknown songs like \\"Savage,\\" \\"Hero's End\\" and \\"Invader\\" have stood the test of time, and are some of Priest's finest.  Even the title track is an iPod addition for me, despite not necessarily being a \\"metal head.\\"  It's a transitional album for Priest, and possibly one of the most underrated metal or hard rock albums of all-time.    And of course if you really like 70's Sabbath during the Ozzy years, you would likely dig 70's Priest.
0375826726|4.0|It is still amazing that this series was written by someone so young.  This is an interesting fantasy story and perfect for teens and young adults.  I still get the feeling in the back of my mind that I have read it all before as his books have stolen from nearly every other dragon/fantasy series around.  A little here, a little there and whoops, we have a new series about dragons that smacks of everything else ever written about them!  While not actually plagerizing, the ideas, plots and some characters were certainly lifted, however skillfully.  It never the less is a well written tale that is a fun read. One of the most interesting aspects of his books is his creative development of various \\"languages\\".  It will be fun to see how he winds this up in the next book.
B00065GX64|2.0|\\"M\\" is an example of a good idea that is poorly executed. Peter Lorre plays a child murderer who is terrorizing a city in Germany to the point where both the police and members of the local underworld are hunting him down. With more action involved, this could have been the \\"intense psychological thriller\\" that many critics claim it to be, but it is very hard to become emotionally involved in a film when 80% of the film comprises non-descript characters (police and gangsters) sitting around and discussing the need to capture the murderer. It is repetitive to the point of being sleep-inducing and with the exception of Lorre's murderer (who barely even appears in the first hour of the film), all of the characters feel like the same \\"person\\". They have no real distinguishing characteristics. Even by the standards of the time when this was made (1931), \\"M\\" is a slow-moving and uneventful film, which is surprising, since director Fritz Lang himself had already demonstrated that he was capable of making better films with 1927's \\"Metropolis\\", a film which is just as engrossing as any modern film. If you want to see one of Fritz Lang's \\"masterpieces\\", then \\"Metropolis\\" is the way to go, not \\"M\\".
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|Like desert bunkers, good ideas can go up in flames. In this first direct sequel in the Bond series, a sullen and vengeful agent 007 is single-mindedly hell-bent on exacting a few pounds of flesh following the loss of his love interest, Vespar, at the end of Casino Royale.<br /><br />Unfortunately, notwithstanding the continued de-emphasis of gadgetry from the MI6 laboratories of \\"Q,\\" saddled with a convoluted environmental storyline and encumbered by overlapping and fundamentally unwatchable phrenetic action sequences this rendition comes off as conflicted, confusing and contrived.  But, there is an homage to Goldfinger in a formulation for edification of a new world order.<br /><br />In his second outing, Daniel Craig continues his intriguing interpretation of the lesser Bond, the 007 equally as skilled as his predecessors yet definitively less sophisticated and assuredly more driven. My primary difficulty with the film was it reminded me of a set of flash cards shuffled together to give the illusion of animation but if interrupted or slowed, it tended to lose all sense of continuity.<br /><br />This was a Bond I saw as mired in depression and it will be mildly interesting to see what path he follows in future episodes, continuing to be portrayed as dark and foreboding or if it turns out to be a precursor to the insensitive, intimacy dismissive and self-absorbed Bonds of the Connery/Moore eras.
0316017922|2.0|Outliers is an interesting, but ultimately unimportant book.  Serious readers have already pointed out the selective use of cases and the generally unemperical approach to what is vaguely described as research.  Readers seriously interested in the subject of this book would do well to acquaint themselves with research methods and the importance of differentiating between anecdotal evidence and more scholarly approaches to the development of a fundamental thesis.  Lively discussions at book clubs are likely (and useful) but generalizing from a few case studies provides little of value in establishing important causality links.

B000784WMW|1.0|This miniseries is miserably amateurish. I've seen better actors at school plays.  Who wrote these favorable reviews? Their parents? Bad, bad, bad.
0425221806|4.0|There were 4 movies based on this book and not one was a good adaption. Some day I hope a movie is made that does the book justice. The movies that were made are B-Movies. The book is about a dog named Einstein that given special abilities in a lab. He escaped and a monster called the Outsider that was also created in the lab and is just as smart as him also escaped. The Outsider thinks he's ugly and rips the eyes out of his victims. He can sense where Einstein is and Einstein can tell when he's close by.<br /><br />  Einstein befriends a depressed and lonely man named Travis who's used to his loved ones dieing and who's afraid of losing Einstein as well. Travis quickly learns how smart he is. Together they meet an anti-social and self-conscious woman named Nora who's being stalked by a pervert bully who's obsessed with making himself a part of her life. He was never in any of the movies, nor was the crazy assassin who thinks he obtains the life energy of the people he kills. He thinks he killed so many people that he's close to being immortal.<br /><br />  While in the movies the agent Lem who's trying to find both the Outsider and Einstein is always bad. So the movies didn't get anything right since in the book, he's not that bad. Hell, he's such a good guy that he even feels sorry for the Outsider for ever being created. If it sounds like I gave a lot away, I really didn't. This book is packed with suspense and twist and turns. It can be extremely violent and even disturbing, but since Travis, Nora and Einstein are so likable it's hard to put the book down. You want to know their fate and how they can possibly escape all the dangers that are following them. It's a good read while the movies are barely watchable.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|As an Enya fan I give this a thumbs up.....she never fails to be super. This was affordable and made a great Christmas gift.
B0014WSWTY|4.0|While nothing in the Jos van Immerseel-Anima Eterna collaboration on Beethoven's symphonies and overtures gave me reason to dump Roger Norrington's first batch, with the London Classical Players, from my personal mountaintop of period couplings, it gave me plenty to chew on and think about and, occasionally, great musicmaking. For the uninitiated, Immerseel is the keyboardist-cum-conductor founder of Anima Eterna, a band of 45 or so players that use period instruments, some originals and others copies, and gut strings. Unlike recent Beethoven recordings by Haitink, Vanska and Norrington that used modern instruments and period-induced style, this set stays true to period mantra by using old instruments.<br /><br />My experience with Immerseel as chamber musician, soloist and conductor tells me he is a musical moderate, not a dogmatist in the Norrington mold. His interpretations of the symphonies tend to moderate, with only No. 7 being what I would call full blown in your face conducting. The performances are generally satisfying. I would say Symphonies 1,2,4, 5 and 8 are all good or better and 7 is one of the best performances I've ever heard. Commonplace interesting musical details leap out at the listener on every disk, as well. The overtures are lively and the marcia alla turca section from the Ruins of Athens sounds different than any version I've ever heard because of the Turkish band Immerseel put together to play it.<br /><br />But I grade Beethoven sets on how the forces do with the magnanimous triplets -- Symphonies Nos. 3, 6 and 9. Here, I would say Immerseel is not always at his best. The Eroica lacks the gravity most adhere to it while 6 starts a little fast for my taste, even though I was humming along by the end. Symphony No. 9 is something of a watershed for period performance; it is almost a traditional reading in pace, projection, muscial values and singing. While I wasn't always persuaded by the orchestral movemments, the vocal final movement is probably the best reading I've ever heard of that music. It is definitely an ear-opening experience for anyone that's heard the ode to joy once or 1,000 times.<br /><br />The sound on this set -- everything was recorded in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam -- is exquisite, full of illustrated details, making the most of fruity period winds and horns, and exceptionally natural with marvelous timpani. Even though Anima Eterna is a smallish band, you don't get the impression the scale is small or that this is less than leonine Beethoven. They sound bigger than they are, most of the time, for reasons Immerseel explains in his outstanding notes. And it is this nonmusical element of the production that sets this collection apart from all other period Beethoven collections. Immerseel's outstanding notes address everything -- instruments, performance style, choice of singers and choir, score edition (Del Mar-Bahrenreiter), halls of Beethoven's time, tempi, etc. and completely lack the cult of personality we often find in booklets. Heck, there isn't even a word about any of the vocal soloists (their photos and names appear) or the choir, much less about the conductor or band.<br /><br />These notes are full of interesting stories and judgments. At one point, Immerseel reports that Otto Klemperer once tried to put together a period band and do a cycle of Beethoven symphonies but didn't because there were not enough musicians available that could play it the old way. Equally as enjoyable are Cecile Reynaud's notes on each symphony that include critical reviews of the day by Hector Berlioz, ETA Hoffman and /Robert Schumann. Most enjoyable, for me, was Schumann's comments on the Symphony 9, which he reported listeners variably compared to the creation of the world and the great Pyramids of Egypt. Anyone that loves Beethoven, musical history, or musical information will relish this package.<br /><br />Yet, alas, it's the music you'll play over and over again after reading the notes once. And, in that respect, I don't think thls package sets the same high standard for a number of characteristics irked me. First, even though Immerseel says \\"selective use of vibrato is part of the aesthetic,\\" the strings often moan in an unattractive way, especially during Eroica. Immerseel takes all the exposition repeats, which turned me off, and he never once interpreted the music differently on repeat. If this was Bach, this would be enough to call the music bland. Finally, Immerseel is the only conductor I know that mercilessly followed the composer's markings that move from true fortissimo (FFF) to pianissimo (PPP) in a single phrase. If there is any sound interference when you hear this, you might think someone turned the volume down on your player.<br /><br />These complaints considered, this set offers good value at less than $40 new for collectors and those wanting to pick up their first, or a new,  set of period Beethoven symphonies. I haven't heard all the period sets but I've heard both Norrington sets, Zinman's and Gardiner's and this one can stand up to all but Norrington's first revolutionary offering that started the whole period craze in Beethoven. And, because Immerseel is more moderate in approach than any of the others, his set may appeal to traditional Beethoven listeners that have yet to tip their toes in the pond of period performance.hls package sets the same high standard for a number of characteristics irked me.

0896762629|5.0|I am a dedicated fan of Janet Arnold. Each of her books have afforded me hours of fascination and challenges that contributed to my abilities with needle and thread.  The fourth book in this series is an intimate view into the 'linens' of those who lived in the 16th and 17th centuries. The amazingly detailed photos are the next best thing to actually touching and examining the garments in person. Some of the photos duplicate those in the third book, Patterns of Fashion c1560-1620, but this duplication can be forgiven. The new photos are in color, and add a dramatic depth that allows the sewer to determine exactly how the garment is constructed and/or embellished.  It is not a book for the frivolous or quickie sewer, but for the artisan and crafts person, researcher, designer, costumer or historian,it is singular.
B001PNSHLK|4.0|Given the choice of getting 12 tracks or 15 tracks, that's easy so get the version of this CD with the 3 bonus cuts. In comparison to earlier Derek Trucks CDs, this one has quite a bit less guitar solos and they are for the most part, shorter solos. There's a lot more vocals here than before and a lot more vocals than you'll see at a Derek Trucks concert.  There's just one instrumental and that is the 14th track\\"Swamp Raga\\" which is pretty laid back and one of the bonus cuts.  As to the vocal tracks, Susan Tedeschi's track is excellent as are Doyle Bramhall's tracks. The opener \\"Down in the Flood\\" is very good also but the rest of the songs are in the good  to very good but not great category. Overall, this is a very good effort but it could have been excellent with less singing and more jamming from Derek and the rest of the band.
B000WZAE0Y|4.0|I never read the book, didn't even know there was one until reading the reviews below. So I had no standard to compare it to.<br /><br />I found this movie full of cute jokes that were safe for the kids, a bit of action, a touch of suspense, some fairy tale magic, a love story, a coming of age.<br /><br />I found the characters refreshingly unique - I mean a gay sky pirate - in a flying ship, that captures lighting for a living,  is not one I had seen before.<br /><br />It is just a little bit long to keep the kids fully engaged from start to finish by the fourth watch, but we all have enjoyed watching it several times.<br /><br />It was a keeper in our family.
0446530573|5.0|I'm not Italian, but I grew up in a heavily Italian area of Pittsburgh and ended up having lots of Italian friends and eating lots of Italian dishes by default, which I still proudly serve today to my own family. Actually, I should say \\"Italian-American,\\" rather than Italian. The recipes in this book are exactly like many of the things I tasted growing up in Pittsburgh, from the pastas to the soups to the desserts, and that I still proudly serve to my own family, remembering each person from whom I obtained the recipe (not written down, more often than not). The commentary in the book (each chapter is narrated by a character from \\"The Sopranos\\" television series) is both humorous and informative. I heartily recommend this volume as an addition to any home cook's library who is interested in Italian-American cuisine and a little bit of its history, especially the cuisine that originated in Naples (as did many of the Italian families in Pittsburgh). Try the peppers and egg sandwich for the Superbowl! Buon appetito!

B000002BFL|5.0|I just listened to this CD again, and was struck by the power.       It's kind of a testament to Springsteen's career that someone can be a huge fan, and not be the biggest fan of his hits.   This CD, along with Nebraska and the Seeger Sessions, are what makes Springsteen great in my book.  There are songs on this CD that tap the core of America, and what comes out isn't bitter wrapped in sweet ('Born in the USA'), it's just brutally honest through and through.      In particular, 'Youngstown', which serves as an ode to the workers and industry that built the nation.  Powerful and sweeping, this song says more than many books.        'Ghost of Tom Joad', might as well be our new anthem, given the economic troubles the USA faces.  This song serves as the base of the whole CD, and is a far more accurate picture of the USA today, than when it came out.

B001C3KCSY|4.0|I believe I heard about Kings of Leon back in 2003 when their debut, \\"Youth and Young Manhood\\" was released. I believe I listened to the sound samples, and I believe I did not hear anything promising. Kings of Leon faded from my memory.<br /><br />Last year, I saw the buzz around the band, but it wasn't until I heard \\"Sex on Fire\\" that I revisited the band. What I heard made me buy the cd. After listening to the disc all week long, I formulated my review.<br /><br />In terms of sound, they do remind me of U2, Coldplay and Radiohead, but primarily U2 due to the band's soaring guitars and melodies. They also remind me of Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Black Crowes. Put them in a blender, and you have Kings of Leon. I know \\"Only By The Night\\" is different from the band's first two releases which were much more organic and southern-fried.<br /><br />I like the technological treatments to their down home southern sound. It makes for an interesting mix. The band draws you in with \\"Closer\\" and \\"Crawl\\" and then punches you to the left with \\"Sex on Fire\\" and then to the right with \\"Use Somebody\\" and a final knockdown blow with \\"Manhattan\\".<br /><br />Things mellow out with \\"Revelry\\", and the southern roots take hold for mid-tempo rockers \\"17\\" and \\"Notion\\". I liked the stuttering mellowness of \\"I Want You\\" followed by the charging U2-ish \\"Be Somebody\\" and then the sobering closer \\"Cold Desert\\".<br /><br />\\"Sex on Fire\\" and \\"Use Somebody\\" were perfect choices for singles, but I'd add \\"Manhattan\\" and \\"Be Somebody\\".<br /><br />Although the Followill clan may have lost some fans with their last release and now \\"Only By The Night\\", I find them moving in a unique direction, with great promise in the future. Caleb has a great Joe Cocker-ish voice, unique in this day and age of fluffy, nondescript and bland singers of today.<br /><br />As this is my first Kings of Leon album (I have ordered the other three), I cannot compare it to the band's previous work. As a stand alone, compared to other artists I've been listening to, I give \\"Only By The Night\\" four stars, with just enough room to really hit the big time.ht\\" four stars, with just enough room to really hit the big time.

So much awesomeness that you might have a seisure. Not much action but totally worth it when there is. Don't think about buying it. JUST do it.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|This is a great movie.  It did not get much attention, but is a great film.  The decision to come at this story from the travel guide's perspective is wonderful.  Highly recommend this film.
B000FS9MV0|2.0|I thought the first album was by far better.  I'm sorry I waited so long for this, I play the first one over and over. They could have done better with this one!!!!
B001QKSWOE|1.0|her worst book yet.  nothing new more of the same old stuff.  it was boring.
B001G9F9IW|5.0|I watched this with my wife and we both enjoyed it a lot.  It wasn't hard for either of us to suspend belief, go along with the story and enjoy the delicious scenery. Javier Bardem is extremely sexy without being macho or pushy. The two women are a nice mix of adventurous and staid. The three of them form a very interesting dynamic of sensuousness and sensibility. I liked it because it was easy for me to identify (i.e. want to be like) Javier Bardem and my wife enjoyed the movie from the female (Scarlett Johansson/Rebecca Hall) point of view ... being courted by Javier. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a sensuous  romantic film as much as I enjoyed this one. The beautiful intimate view of Barcelona was a real bonus and inspired to want to visit Barcelona as soon as possible and to get this on BluRay immediately. It was like a mini romantic vacation I was very glad I took. I would highly recommend this film. Watch it with someone you love.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|Had eagerly awaited this one. Great movie, but the image quality was in no way up to BluRay standards. Not having seen it in the theater, I don't know whether this was by design.<br /><br />That said... Oscar-worthy.
031606792X|5.0|The perfect escapist, romantic, happy-ending (just look at the titles of the last few chapters - no spoilers here) love story, and I say this as someone who, until recently, was an adamant Twilight sceptic. Anyone who isn't completely ensconced and addicted by this point just doesn't keep a giggling teenage girl within them! Escapism is the key here - it's supposed to be truly absorbing and implausible. If you loved the first three, you WILL love this last instalment. I can't imagine how anyone couldn't!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Yes you want this on dvd. No matter how many times you saw it online for free. Plus dvd bonus features.
0385339100|2.0|I've read many Grisham books and generally like his style.  He's obviously comfortable in the courtroom setting and I loved the detailed legal twists and turns in The Partner.  The sign of a good work of fiction is we come to believe it's a true story about real people.  Unfortunately, at the very end I felt the author threw away credibility for the sake of another \\"twist\\" - unbelievable and very disappointing after such a great ride.  If they ever make a movie of this they better have the sense to end it the obvious way that does not betray what has gone before.  Five Stars for great writing and plot, minus three stars for ripoff ending = two stars.
B001P3SA94|4.0|This is a film about the struggles that African Americans faced to get their musical voices heard. It takes music back to where it all began. The origin of R&B and Rock and Roll. But like the historical music and triumph it also portrays the dark side of the industry in it's early stages. The stand out actor in the film, in my opinion, would be Columbus Short playing Little Walter. He owned his part and made you feel all of his emotion. But the one thing the film lacks is a long enough history line of the dark lives of the charatcers that were portrayed. The dialog quickly skimmed through the lives of these characters. Actors like Mos Def (who played Chuck Berry) did not have much of an appearance and they're is so much more of Miss Etta James' life (beautifully played by Beyonce) that was not shown. The movie had five stories in one and not enough time to tell them all. The actors and actresses did great performances. And a big kudos to Miss Knowles (Mrs. Carter) for her improved acting skills. But sadly she sang more then she acted. If the movie lacks at all it would definitely be due to the lack of script, not in performance.The film had more \\"f\\" words in it then storyline.  All in all it's a good movie. But sad and depressing.
B000089RVX|1.0|After reading all the \\"glowing\\" reviews of this album, I jumped at the chance when a buddy of mine offered a new copy to me.  I threw the cd on while I stepped into the bathroom to grow a monkey tail.  I usually enjoy listening to music from my bathroom due to the acoustics I can get in there.<br /><br />Anyway, the cd player is across the room, so I hit play, sat down to do my business.  I could not understand what all the rave was about this excuse for a cd.  I got as far as the 3rd song before I had to cut it short because I couldn't stand it anymore and turn it off.<br /><br />It was Terrible!<br /><br />Every song I heard...carried the same whinny voice with no change in tone.  When I think of rock, I think of in your face...this was not.  It sounded like something you hear on a teen movie soundtrack like Jumper or some other EMO crap.<br /><br />Go get some Tool or something that truly rocks.  If you want a female singer, go get The Duke Spirit.  This CD was a waste of my time and hurt my ears.  I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this cd because it went strait into the trash after my bathroom trip.  If I could have, I would have flushed it down the toilet like the piece of crap it was.
B000026OW3|3.0|It's somewhat dismaying to read reviews that begin with something like \\"Obviously, Rubinstein was a great famous pianist, and this is one of the greatest Chopin recordings EVER!\\"  Clearly, there's no argument with the opening - Rubinstein was one of the titans of the keyboard during the 20th century, and many of his recordings still provide tremendous enjoyment. But for this listener, these justly famous recordings of Chopin - far from complete - are neither the finest examples of this pianist's legacy nor the finest recordings of the works themselves.<br /><br />I highly recommend this set for the casual listener, who wants to have some Chopin in his or her collection. You can pick it up on amazon currently for about $21 (for 11 discs!!) For that price, this set will sate your appetite, and provide hours - if not a lifetime - of listening pleasure.<br /><br />For the student of music, or piano, or simply the more discerning  listener/collector, this set should be - and needs to be - heard in context. Rubinstein was in his \\"early\\" senior years when the recordings were made. Gone is the flamboyance, and risk taking of his youth. In its place was a golden, burnished piano tone, and careful - oh so careful - playing. Careful is good. Careful is meticulous. Careful is boring.<br /><br />There are those who will jump all over me for suggesting this (particularly those who end the first sentence of their review with the word \\"EVER!\\") but there is a monotony associated with this set of recordings - a beautiful monotony to be sure, but a monotony none the less.  The playing works for the beautiful Nocturnes and Waltzes, but is far less successful for, say, the Mazurkas which sound like cocktail hour at a senior center.<br /><br />After two or three discs all the playing begins to sound the same. By five discs it sounds like an interminable concert of notes written by Chopin. Halfway through, you may fall asleep. Beauty without drama has a tendency to become deadly. For fans of Rubinstein - and I count myself as one of his bigger ones out there, I strongly suggest you explore the recently re-issued remasters from the Rubinstein Collection. While sound quality of the earliest recordings in the series varies -  the 1930s recordings of the Mazurkas for example  - most of the discs sound very, very good. It's the playing, the musicianship, that is in a different league. You can practically see the townsfolk dance to these Mazurkas as you listen to Rubinstein's gleeful, swinging playing from his youth.<br /><br />These justly famous recordings from the 1960s - Rubinstein's only stereo recordings of Chopin - do not represent this great artist in his prime - this is the playing of an elder stateman. For pop fans, it would be like gaining your inital exposure to Paul McCartney through a listen of Chaos and Confusion In The Backyard and wondering what all the fuss over Beatlemania was about. It's pretty, yet bland - and hardly memorable. Unfortunately, this is true of Rubinstein's final recordings of Chopin as well.<br /><br />(Although Rubinstein was capable of stupendous playing in his later years, he seldom attained such heights in the controlled legacy atmosphere of the studio. Check out his famous Carnegie Hall concert [[ASIN:B00005427H Rubinstein Collection, Vol. 42]]or the rarer, and God-like playing of his 1960s Moscow concert [[ASIN:B000031WC2 Rubinstein Collection, Vol. 62: Recital in Moscow]]. Better yet, WATCH Rubinstein in Moscow on this recently issued DVD of the performance [[ASIN:B001IMFHVG Classic Archive: Artur Rubinstein - The Legendary Moscow Recital]]<br /><br />In conclusion - this is a fine introductory purchase, or second set for the bookshelf. For lovers of the piano however, I strongly urge readers to heed the advice of another reviewer for this listing C. Pontis Tholin (as I did) and explore Garrick Ohlsson's magnificent traversal of Chopin music - all of it. Ohllson's recordings dust off this music and take it out ofthe salon. His performances sparkle, and provide each and every work with a distinquishing sparkle and personality, bringing Chopin to life as never before.  [[ASIN:B001F4YGUA Complete Works]] Truly revelatory. If you're interested, make sure you check out the pricing at amazon.com/uk. (NOTE -  6/10 - The Ohlsson set is routinely listed on Amazon for about $62 from an overseasl vendor who is reliable - I know because I purchased a set from this vendor as gift for a friend! - At this price, the Hyperion set is a steal)<br /><br />For Rubinstein lovers, let me also recommend Harvey Sachs' great biography of the master, which you can currently pick up on amazon for a little over a dollar.

B001E5FYS8|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />The spellbinding documentary, \\"Man on Wire,\\" chronicles a very different kind of \\"assault\\" on the World Trade Center's Twin Towers from the one that happened on September 11th.  This earlier one involved a French tightrope walker named Philippe Petit who, on August 7, 1974, illegally crossed over from the South Tower to the North Tower (both still under construction at the time) on a wire suspended more than 1300 feet above the ground.  However, in this case, the \\"attack\\" was designed not to bring the buildings crashing down in a wanton display of death and destruction, but rather to celebrate them for the extraordinary feats of human engineering and achievement they clearly were.<br /><br />Although director James Marsh deliberately avoids any mention of the 9/11 attacks, that earth-shattering event can't help but cast a haunting pall over the film anyway - like some unacknowledged ghost hovering above the project.  This is particularly the case in the early stretches of the film where we are shown grainy footage of the buildings as they were being constructed in the early 1970's.  In fact, we're jolted to find that the familiar debris-littered hole we're looking at is NOT a picture of Ground Zero but rather of the site that would serve as the foundation for the buildings.  Having witnessed the destructive end of the structures, we find it doubly poignant to be present once again at their hope-filled beginning.<br /><br />But \\"Man on Wire\\" is not concerned with what happened to the buildings on September 11th, 2001, but rather what happened there on a misty day in August twenty-seven years earlier, when a man dazzled the world by seeming to defy the laws of gravity and of physics and, more strangely still, the code of self-preservation that rules all living creatures.  It's possible that we may never be able to fully understand what drives a man like Philippe Petit to do what he does, for even he admits flat-out that he can't define what it is that motivates him; all he knows is that he has some innate, obsessive need forging him on - some inner compulsion to live life constantly on the edge.  There's also the secondary thrill that comes with skirting the law in a way that doesn't do any real harm to others.  However, we're hardly in a position to criticize Petit for his vagueness, since our own undeniable fascination with those who routinely flirt with death can never be thoroughly explained either.  Marsh`s film plays with that fascination by taking us into Petit`s world and letting us see for ourselves how this amazing feat was finally accomplished.  Luckily, Petit and his crew recorded much of their preparations for it on film - with the director providing humorous, slightly surreal re-enactments shot in silhouetted black-and-white to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />We're also fortunate in that most of the key players in the drama are still around today and more than willing to sit down and talk about their part in it.  This includes Petit himself who tries to put into words what was going through his mind at various stages of the project.  In addition, Marsh interviews others who either took an active part in engineering the stunt or who were in some way ancillary participants in the event.  What's interesting is how the fear of being caught by the authorities is almost as intense as the fear of Petit's falling to his death - a possibility that seems to register on most of them only at the point when he is about to venture out onto the rope.  Yet, throughout, there are those random moments of quiet contemplation when doubts, second thoughts and cold feet begin to worm their way, if only unconsciously, into the minds of  the people involved.<br /><br />And when Petit is up there, teetering on a thread strung across the top of the world, we sit in dumbfounded silence at the sheer aesthetic beauty and balletic grace of what we are witnessing - and catch our breath at what feats of superhuman wonder we meremortals are capable of achieving when we set our minds to it.  However, a little warning might be in order for the acrophobics in our midst:  you might just find yourself having to clutch the nearest available hand or armchair rest to steady your nerves through the ordeal.<br /><br />\\"Man on Wire,\\" inadvertently perhaps, turns out to be as much a tribute to the Twin Towers themselves - and, by extension, the people who lost their lives in them - as to the irrepressible, death-defying daredevil who did his bit to immortalize them.<br /><br />Now, thanks to Petit and those who made \\"Man on Wire,\\" we have another, more life-affirming document to remember them by.ving when we set our minds to it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this on a recommendation of a friend and couldn't be happier with the results.  I only wish I had taken measurements at the beginning of the 30 days so I could report real stats to you!  I have done this video fairly consistently for the past 24 days (had to take a few days off due to sickness) and have seen big changes in my body.  My favorite jeans fit again (and are too big), I've had to take my belt in TWO notches (and it used to be snug before), I feel stronger and my hips are definitely more trim as is my stomach (and, after two c-sections, this is amazing to me).   It's not an easy workout and I was a little nervous switching levels, but if you stick with it and work as hard as you can for the entire workout, you will see results.    I haven't really modified my diet too much, but I do use common sense with my portions and choices (always have).  I have tried to add at least three days of cardio (no more than 1/2 an hour) to my week as well just for the extra cardio work, but even when I haven't, I've still seen results using this workout.    Jillian is tough, but sometimes that toughness is just what I need to keep me going.  Just when I think I'm going to die, she says that I have 3 seconds left and I can make it throuh.  Don't get hung up on the technical details of the video (long intro speech, talking etc).  Do the workout and see the results!
0670020478|4.0|Although I do appreciate anyone bringing attention to the importance of creativity to education and a thriving society (and I LOVED Sir Robinson's amazing talk at TED)  I have one thing to say:  Julia Cameron.  In 1993, Julia Cameron wrote The Artist's Way and went on to write many books on creativity (one of her latest, Walking in the World, is a wonderful follow-up to The Artist's Way).  Both of these books are in workbook form and truly guide you toward uncovering your passion.  She was way ahead of her time and a whole lot of people have made a lot of money taking her ideas and repackaging them as their own.  If you really want to discover \\"the element\\" for yourself, do the work in Julia Cameron's books!

However, she makes interesting use of a sort of militaristic drum beat which contrasts with her lyrics and gentle delivery in a kind of interesting way.          Dido lovers, I say, Go for it! People like me? Stay far away and crank up the Joan Jett!

B001GAPC1K|5.0|This movie has everything lots of action, outstanding special effects and a good story. I think that the people at Paramount nailed the character selection casting Robert Downey Jr to play Tony Stark. The blu-ray version has lots of features and most of them are in HD which is something rare in recent blu-rays (most of them come with Standard Definition extras). I highly recommend this movie to anyone, I saw it by mistake and ended up loving this movie.
B0017ANAZO|3.0|I liked the movie inspite of the fact it was so sad to see Meg Ryan having so much plastic surgery. I think she should sue whoever did her surgery. She was so pretty before she went to far. And it is kinda distracting to see her face with such surprise and her mouth is so fish like now.<br /><br />But the movie was good I would say buy the movie.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|While the acting is above average, the storyline is COMPLETLEY over the top.  I made it through the first few episodes of this show and couldn't watch any more.  This series goes WAAAY beyond strange.  AND I have enjoyed watching T.V. series about vampires; like Buffy, Angel, and Moonlight, and especially the Underworld movies.  But mixing pop culture and vampires like this series does is too campy and Schumacheresque.  I honestly don't see how this show has survived past one season...
B000RO8T7K|5.0|...but haven't heard these sonatas for Violin and, yes, PIANO* (thankfully), have a listen to this performance and think again. (No, I have no axe to grind with \\"authentic\\" Baroque purists..).<br /><br />This 2-CD set was brought to my attention by Gramophone magazine, where it was recommended as \\"Editor's choice\\". And what a revelation it was! Admittedly, I wasn't too familiar with these particular Bach sonatas. Musicologists have often placed these six works alongside the Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin and the Brandenburg Concertos because of their wealth of invention and their mature, individual style. They were probably composed ca. 1725 in Leipzig; some 50 years later, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was still championing them as the finest works of his father.<br /><br />These sonatas, which were not necessarily designed as a cycle from the outset, have a slow-fast-slow-fast sequence of four movements, except for the five-movement G major sonata (BWV 1019) in which the central movement is for the piano alone, while the violin remains silent. The slow movements in particular are of great emotional depth and melodic elegance.<br /><br />German violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann and Italian pianist Enrico Pace, a regular duo since many years, are unsurpassed in their collaboration on these sonatas, with fully equal roles for both performers. Superb musicality, expressiveness and phrasing, combined with great richness of tone, make of this set a breathtaking listening experience. The gorgeous sound of Zimmermann's Stradivarius (once belonging to Fritz Kreisler) balances and blends beautifully with that of Pace's charismatic and tasteful pianism. I can't think of a stronger case for the superiority of the piano as the keyboard instrument on which to hear these sonatas (see comment).<br /><br />I can listen to this performance non-stop for hours, even days.. If you love Bach, BUY this set! (Check out amazon UK and other sellers for cheaper price tags.)<br /><br />*It's a shame that modern performances of these sonatas are very rare. I found recordings by [[ASIN:B00002DDVE Menuhin/Kentner]], [[ASIN:B0000028NN Laredo/Gould]] and [[ASIN:B00000IJGA Tenenbaum/Kapp]] and that's about it. But they are simply no match for the present recording.<br /><br />P.S.

0446691437|5.0|Wow! What a fast-paced, though-provoking work. This book punches and triggers serious thought about the \\"war\\" in each of us--and, better yet, ways we can win that war. If Pressfield cannot motivate the artist, creative writer--anyone at all--to put aside demons and proceed to producing sometimes yucky, yet sometimes surprising and valuable, work, nothing can I am a writer and English professor (composition and creative writing, mostly) for art, design and film students. Sometimes, it is challenging to get these types of students excited about reading and responding to the written word, for they are amassed with studio projects that demand incredible energy, thought, time and attention. However, this text seems to have invoked in them that same energy and thought--and effusive response, both in class discussions and a variety of written assignments. Thank you, Steven Pressfield!     I cannot speak directly for my students, but I can speak directly to my experience in engaging with this text, and it has empowered me in most helpful ways. It's a must-read!

It has everything; drama, the damsel in distress, King Kong fight different dinosaurs, the adventurer, lost live, big ape falling in love with blonde woman, and a touch of comedy to go with it.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|I will never forget the indelible, and terrifying image of tightrope walker Phillip Petit in the Guinness Book of World Records when I was a kid.  I would stare at that picture and wonder what would possess a person do such an insane thing. I don't mind saying that when it comes to heights I'm like Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo... I am acrophobic. So the photo alone puts me on the edge of my seat.  I thought James Marsh did a phenomenal job on this documentary. Thank you! The documentary is suspenseful, not only due to the vertiginous subject matter, but also the heist-like element of plotting the wire walk itself-- It's like watching Dassin's Rififi from the criminal element.  Anything could've gone wrong. Petit could've died. Accomplices arrested. All odds were against Philip, but he remained unstoppable in his vision, tenacious in his insistence that it could be done, AND HE DID IT!  It is a true story of perseverance, a focused mind and vision,  no matter how insane the idea is perceived. True genius! On a deeper level, I kept reflecting on the 9/11 hijackers, as I am sure many viewers will while watching this documentary, the difference is between Petit's innocence and only wanting to conquer the Twin Towers, to perform a stunt... not hurting anyone...  and how a century later another's evil intentions would obliterate them forever. This is an incredible story! Again, thanks to James March for assembling this and completing the picture.

Woolf's long ruminations and interior examinations are where the energy is, inside the characters who act little, but think much.<br /><br />The language is exacting, taxing, and sometimes the author's sentences finish somewhere else than they're supposed to. It's hard to imagine that such a baroque and delving prose would stand a snowball's chance in hell of getting published today.<br /><br />It was written, you see, before the vast commercialization of that same revolutionary film-making--as-storytelling process and the homogenizing effect it had on most people's treatment of literature.<br /><br />A family called the Ramsays have a coastal house somewhere in Britannia before the First World War. They are genteel; he a famous philosopher, she a hothouse flower of heightened sensibility.<br /><br />Three-quarters of the book take place in a 24-hour expanse as Woolf takes us through the minds of nearly a dozen people; people thinking about their relationship to a larger world, to themselves, to the people gathered at the Ramsays.<br /><br />Although not wealthy, the Ramsays can afford to keep some illustrious guests at the summer home and their brood numbers five or six. And so the author's mind-mining finds plenty of fertile ground for topics worldly and domestic alike:<br /><br />\\"...children never forget. For this reason, it was so important what one said, and what one did, and it was a relief when they went to bed. For now she need not think about anybody. She could be herself, by herself. And that was what now she often felt the need of - to think; well, not even to think.\\"<br /><br />So what?<br /><br />If you're a parent it rings true. It tells you something you knew innately, but had never crystallized into a solid idea. Good literature does that. Pulls us in by making us relate and instructs, turns pleasure into profit, while you're laying beneath the warm glow of a golden late-night lamp.<br /><br />But the scribe's writing like Woolf here (that happens).<br /><br />Mrs. Ramsay is the star of this gentile warm-season gathering, the looking glass through whom we experience the day-turned-evening event, the one who judges the motives and shortcomings of the guests, although we are treated to the points-of-view from other characters, too.<br /><br />A fading beauty, but a beauty both spiritual and cosmetic nonetheless, Mrs. Ramsay's particular gift is the arrangement of sublime moments and her conflict is that she enjoys them so much more than those she deigns to design them for:<br /><br />\\"Everything seemed possible. Everything seemed right. Just now (but this cannot last, she thought, dissociating herself from the moment while they were all talking about boots) just now she had reached a security; she hovered like a hawk suspended; like a flag floating in an element of joy which filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly, not noisily, solemnly rather...\\"<br /><br />Looking for a little post-reading help, the scribe read an article by Louise DeSalvo on Woolf's relationship with writer Rita Sackville-West, during which she wrote \\"To the Lighthouse.\\"<br /><br />It's from a book entitled \\"Significant Others, Creativity & Intimate Passion,\\" edited by Whitney Chadwick and Isabelle de Courtivron, and published by Thames and Hudson in 1993. Some of the other couplings it assays are Clare and Andre Malraux, Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, Camille Claudel and Auguste Rodin.<br /><br />According to DeSalvo, the younger lover and writer saw that Woolf needed social interaction, and made sure she got it, because \\"Virginia based her fiction primarily upon observation, not upon her imagination.\\"<br /><br />So Mrs. Ramsay may very well be Woolf's mother, a woman affected by withdrawal and depression.<br /><br />While together, they generated the finest work of their lives, Woolf informing Sackville-West's writing with a greater literary quality, Rita giving Virginia an openness and the tools to reach a wider, best-selling audience.<br /><br />\\"To the Lighthouse\\" was one in a troika of novels (\\"The Waves\\" and \\"The Years) that \\"examined her childhood in the Stephen Family, a childhood riddled with violence, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect,\\" according to DeSalvo.<br /><br />The Mr. Ramsay of \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" corresponds to Woolf's characterization of life with her father as, \\"living in a cage with a lion.\\" His \\"self-absorbed\\" grief is on display and much-detailed in the novel.<br /><br />Not an unsympathetic man, Mr. Ramsay is falling just short of being a great philosopher and the resulting worries keep him from strengthening the fading connection he has with his wife. She must repress the need to quote the price of a roofing job to stay out of his fuzzy head where he is very busy. Those around him cannot help but be charmed by his magnetism and intelligence, but his overbearing nature (sometimes he's just being a father), leads mostly to resentment.<br /><br />So, \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is a work pegged to her childhood and perhaps Virginia is Lily, a minor character and more minor painter. Here she alternates between artistic courage and terror, enriching before a blank canvas.<br /><br />\\"For what could be more formidable than that space? Here she was again, she thought, stepping back to look at it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers - this other things, this truth, this reality, which suddenly laid hands on her, emerged stark at the back of appearances and commanded attention.\\"<br /><br />If you want to read a map of your precious individual self, you might want to try Virginia. If you don't, maybe you shouldn't.<br /><br />Or maybe you should read it no matter what, because it's reading. Listen to how Woolf weaves her own enjoyment of books into the fabric of the character Mrs. Ramsay:<br /><br />\\"And she waited a little, knitting, wondering, and slowly those words they had said at dinner, `the China rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee,' began washing from side to side of her mind rhythmically, and as they washed, words, like little shaded lights, one red, one blue, one yellow, lit up in the dark of her mind, and seemed leaving their perches up there to fly across and across, or to cry out and be echoed: so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book.\\"<br /><br />On this particular outing the family situation seems vulnerable, threatened by a crumbling roof and cracks in the emotional edifice, but it's difficult to tell if the looming threat is extraordinary or just the stuff we all live with. In any case, Mrs. Ramsay triumphs once more, creating a sublime moment that is gone more quickly than it took to manufacture. The guests enjoy a magic they've come to expect, but without guessing at the work behind it.<br /><br />The story breaks suddenly as Mrs. Ramsay turns the lights out on her children for the evening and the reader is then vaulted into a second book entitled: \\"Time Passes.\\"<br /><br />World War I comes. Some of those present on the summer weekend have been taken by it. Mrs. Ramsay has died, \\"suddenly\\" and the family has ceased returning to the beach house. Pages-long, majestic descriptions of the house's decrepitude, of nature's advances upon the property, of the lingering spirits that once warmed it unwind under Woolf's careful, intricate hand.<br /><br />Such stretches recall Italo Calvino who observed that literature represents a rare moment of order in a universe heading toward dissolution: \\"The literary work is one of those small points of privilege where things crystallize into a form which acquires such meaning.\\"<br /><br />Finally the Ramsays return, robbed of their life force, a pale facsimile of the prior clan, stitched to one another by grief only. Again it is Lily, the old maid and mediocre turtle artist, who brings us to the point of the piece. Veiled and indirect throughout, Woolf now bids attention be paid in her first sentence:<br /><br />\\"The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one. This, that, and the other; herself and Charles Tansley and the breaking wave; Mrs. Ramsay bringing them together; Mrs. Ramsay saying, \\"Life stand still here\\"; Mrs. Ramsay making of the moment something permanent (as in another sphere Lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent) - this was of the nature of a revelation. In the midst of chaos there was shape; this eternal passing and flowing (she looked at the clouds going and the leaves shaking) was struck into stability. Life stand still here, Mrs. Ramsay said. \\"Mrs. Ramsay! Mrs. Ramsay!\\" she repeated. She owed it all to her.\\"<br /><br />So mostly, \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" is a character sketch and Valentine to Mrs. Ramsay: perhaps Woolf's mother, perhaps Rita Sackville-West, perhaps somebody else, an amalgamation, or nobody at all. Just somebody she thought we'd like to see.<br /><br />For time travelers, the tale offers the privilege of vacationing with a homogeneous family of middle-class gentility at the beginning of the 20th Century. It's no wonder Woolf could wander and wade through the psyches of those present. Isolated, far from the news of the moment, without any means of communicating to the outside world, everybody is obligated to be present and consider one another and the landscape of dunes, long lawns at dusk, and wind-rippled tide pools.<br /><br />And then it's modern literature and the modern world. The politics discussed at the table sound familiar and strangely up-to-date, the strivings and shortcomings of the characters are not far at all from our own: to be great, to be respected, to get to the lighthouse.ore minor painter.

B001KL3GY0|5.0|Franz Ferdinand has been getting funkier with each album they've released, and I'm lovin' it.  I would pay 20 bucks just to own the song Lucid Dreams.  It is, by far, one of the coolest songs I have ever heard in my life.    Even in the midst a global recession, this album is one thing that you gotta shell out some cash for.

B00004Y6NT|5.0|There's little doubt Communique has received the poorest reviews of any of the six albums, but I like it the best.  This and the group's first album portray the heart and soul of Dire Straits.  They tell stories running the gamut of life experiences and tell them in a variety of styles . . . ballads, rock, country, R&B.  They are not \\"catchy tune\\" jingles that immediately grab your attention and then lose your interest after listening to them a few times. Instead, they are substantive songs that you may not even like at first, but grow on you the more you listen to them.  What do the critics know?    Tuneful Once Upon a Time in the West has some wicked guitar playing, while Lady Writer adds zest to a mainly melancholic collection. News is an unheralded jewel of a song with mesmerizing lyrics and melody. Portobello Belle and Single-Handed Sailor are beautiful ballads.  Angel of Mercy shows that DS can do Nashville and do it well.  Although offbeat Communique and mysterious Follow Me Home take some getting used to, your patience will be rewarded.  The haunting Where Do You Think You're Going is my all-time favorite DS song, but to gain a full appreciation of the song you should check out the live performances on YouTube, which include a passionate and extended outro. It's frustrating that the recorded version, while excellent, does not include the extended outro, nor does the song appear on any of their live albums.    Some complain that Communique is a re-hash of the first album. I think the songs are unique, although there do appear to be parallels (a sort of kinship)between songs of the two albums which I've listed below(just for fun):    Dire Straits album tracks and Communique album \\"sister songs\\"     Down to the Waterline and Single-Handed Sailor (nautical theme)  Water of Love and Communique (choppy tempo)  Setting Me Up and Angel of Mercy (country flavor)   Six Blade Knife and Where Do You Think You're Going (grim, threatening)  Southbound Again and Follow MeHome (heading my way)  Sultans of Swing and Lady Writer (lively, fast-paced)  Wild West End and Portobello Belle (streets of London)  In the Gallery and Once Upon a Time in the West (life's not fair)  Lions and News (angst)    Communique is the most unappreciated album of the most unappreciated band, but both will stand the test of time.    Notes:  1.  Lady Writer was released as a single with Where Do You Think You're Going on the flip side.  2. The Money For Nothing \\"best-of\\" album includes a very good live rendition of Portobello Belle. The album also has Lady Writer and Where Do You Think You're Going, but for some unfathomable reason uses a different studio version of the latter that is good, but not as good as the Communique version.  3. Lady Writer sounds a lot like What's the Matter Baby, a real rocker co-authored by Mark and David Knopfler that only appears on the Live at the BBC album. 4. At a concert in Germany in 1980 MK dedicated News to the memory of John Lennon.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. Friends have told me they felt the childhood scenes were depressing but I found the movie very uplifting. The music score is fantastic. The whole story is woven together expertly. A lot of what is depicted about India is true. I have been there many times and seen it firsthand. If you would like a book to go along with this movie read 'A Fine Balance' by Rohinton Mistry.

1423107233|3.0|This book makes a nice coffee table book.  But if you intend to use it for research, it will be of little use.  It's a big beautiful book full of pictures, with no text.  It covers so many of the Disney animations, yet can only display a small amount of artwork for each one.  It's a minutia of the variety of artwork and illustrations that Disney artists have produced over the years, and alot of the artwork chosen for the book is far from the most exciting that was produced for each movie.  It's almost like they took the leftovers that were easily available and used them for the book.  Also, alot of the artwork is not credited to the artist that did it.  So even as picture reference, it's not entirely helpful.  But it's a pretty book nonetheless, and there are tidbits here and there that are really beautiful examples of drawing.  Amazon's price is a really good price though for the quality of the book though.

B000YXMMAO|5.0|Oh to listen to brand new perfect, well pressed vinyl. This album is an amazing pleasure to listen to on vinyl. There is a reason In Rainbows was the top selling vinyl album in 2008, it's well near perfect.<br /><br />Listen to the previews, download the MP3's, then go and buy this on vinyl. The sound quality and difference is remarkable. Everything is just warmer, and clearer than on CD.<br /><br />The pressing is on heavy thick vinyl that never existed back in the day (even audiophile recordings in the vinyl heyday were never on vinyl this heavy). Frankly, vinyl never sounded this good. When that was the only format, there were tons of manufacturing shortcuts taken. The audio gear and speakers were nowhere as good as they are today. My Yamaha receiver has the best sounding preamp for phono input. Nothing I ever listened to before was this good.<br /><br />Just enjoy the whole vinyl experience on a really great album.
B000MGVWKO|1.0|Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus  By John Gray, PhD.    Introduction:    Prejudice. One of the greatest gifts that has been discovered because of our wonderful system of democracy is the problem caused by having prejudicial beliefs. Prejudice breeds ignorance and contempt, results in anger, produces an overwhelming urge for power, blinds individuals from seeing the path to happiness, and in reality is the cause for the troubles within our relationships. Unfortunately, this concept has not yet breached the walls of the ivory tower of the psychology industry.    The very theme of the granddaddy of modern relationship books, Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus by John Gray, Ph.D., is the prejudice that men and women are different. In essence, what Dr. Gray is claiming is the key to the successful relationship is that men and women are different, if you want to be happy then you must realize this and simply get over it. Sadly, he couldn't be further from the truth.     Ah yes, say the critics of this prejudicial perspective.  The formative Dr. Gray is merely propagating a perspective that men and women should simply accept these differences, that tolerance will lead to loving and caring for each other through the understanding of these differences.  The only problem with this perspective is that it promotes prejudices between men and women.  Unfortunately Dr. Gray isn't a fan of history, or he would have known this. We have a perfect example that completely debunks his platform, the famous \\"separate but equal\\" decision in 1896 that kept African Americans and White Americans \\"separate but equal\\" until it was overturned in 1954 with the Brown v The Board of Education decision.     The only difference is instead of different drinking fountains and restaurants we have different households, with our current culture of divorce. In fact, this book has probably done more than any other to help propagate our culture of divorce.      Yes the idealism of tolerance and acceptance makes sense intellectually but unfortunately is impossible to implement. Promoting the difference between people only promotes the underlying fear of those differences.    Overview:    Ironically, he begins the book by claiming, \\"I do not directly address the question of why men and women are different,\\" which would add profound insight as to how to overcome those differences. Throughout the book it becomes extremely clear what those differences are. In his world, men only think and women only feel, which may be true of relationships in the nineteenth century but does nothing to help relationships in the twenty-first century.    In fact, to really help troubled relationships requires an understanding of the reverse that men can also feel and that women can also think. He does, though, contradict this logic, as he does with much of his \\"circular\\" logic, by stating that sometimes men do learn to feel \\"in order to become more loving and nurturing,\\" and that women do learn to think, \\"in order to earn a living in a work force.\\" His logic goes something like this; \\"Men mistakenly expect women to think...women mistakenly expect men to feel.\\" But can't men feel and women think?    In fact, if this book is read with a critical eye the reader would actually feel incredulous over his logic. For women his comment that \\"Their egos are dependent not on looking `competent,'\\" says it all. He is asking women not to think as part of the relationship. So his advice for women is to forget their ability to think. After all, that is man's work.    And he does the same for men with feelings. \\"When having a conversation with him at home, it seems as if only 5 percent of his mind is available for the relationship while the other 95 percent is still at work,\\" the place where men are supposed to think. In other words, Dr. Gray is trying to convince the reader men have only 5 percent of their brains available for feelings. He goes even further by stating, in essence, if men are not thinking then \\"he is drawn to solving little problems, like reading the news, watching T.V., driving his car, doing physical exercise, watching a football game, playing basketball, and so forth,\\" all behaviors that replace his feelings within the relationship. He even goes so far as to say that when a woman wants to engage in a discussion of feelings with a man, asking him \\"What's the matter, honey?...he may feel insulted or repulsed.\\"    His advice for the reader then follows the logic that \\"Men need to remember that when women seem upset and talk about problems is not the time to offer solutions,\\" while \\"women need to remember that unsolicited advice or criticism...make him feel unloved and controlled.\\" In other words, the key to the happy relationship is for men to do their thinking but not associate with the women's feelings and women can feel but helping a man think makes him somehow weak.    He uses this same logic when he explains that a man needs to periodically sink into his cave when he is upset while a woman retreats to her corner. What is true about his logic is when a couple argues a man does revert into the mode of thinking while a woman reverts back into the mode of feeling. Explaining this does not help couples overcome arguing. And again, he defends this point when he claims women want respect, respect for their feelings, while men want trust, trust that they can think. But don't men want respect, and women want trust as well. Not according to Dr. Gray. This circular logic is repeated throughout the entire book.    The rest of the book is spent giving behavior advice, just like all of the others. Dr. Gray even goes as far as explaining a point system, both positive and negative, that men and women should use to keep score of their different behaviors. Does he explain the causes of behavior? No, like he states initially he doesn't even discuss the \\"why\\". He doesn't even attempt to! So without the why, how can he provide an inkling of a solution? Again,he doesn't.    Well, he did sell over 20 million copies. Why did his book sell so well? People in troubled relationships identify with his description of the problem. How many copies do you think he would have sold if he wrote a book entitled, Men Are From Earth Women Are From Earth?    by Tim Kellis

B00005JNTX|3.0|NOTE:  Look at the Goya prints of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain.    Style may not be everything in cinema or in anything else, but it does help to pass the time.  It can keep you glued to your seat, watching a spectacle and even make you glad you spent whatever you spent for it. In  this case its an opportunity to surrender oneself to what may well be the signature movie of the Bush Decade; which is to say, to experiene an essay in sadomasochistic violence, featureing cold, elaborate murders, prolonged and in a sense even ritualized torture and mutilation -- including male castration -- and all delivered in a matter of fact, self-jusifying tone indicative of psychotic depravity.      SIN CITY is kept out of the realm of Pasolini's SADO only by the film's near-abstract visual style, for instead of photographing the performers of these rituals naturally, or realistically, the film utilizes the look of the 'adult' comic, by severely restricting color.  By so doing, the movie maintains an atmosphere of fantasy that keeps the enterprize at an acceptable distance from the loathsome; as aceptable a distance as the soft-core sadism of Miller's novels can hope for.      Nevertheless, this film is entertaining as simply a series of vivid, masturbatory fantasies of a vividly and purposefully ghastly nature.  It makes for an astringent kind of pornography.    The three stories that make up the scenario of this movie are vehicles for three male anti-heroes; these are played by Mickey Rourke, Bruce willis and Clive Owen.  There is nothing even remotely spontaneous about their performances, the controlled nature of the cinematography prevent it.  Nevertheless, their performances are hypnotic.    And the stories?  The stories, such as they are, are pathetic fantasies of female brutalization, rape and torture, all slick with the slobber of slavish, narcotized love; or that fixation that passes for love among drunken, impotent men.  All the women -- except for one little girl -- are either prostitutes or dancing sexual exhibitonists like the peerless and endlessly agile Jessica Alba.  Many, oozing treachery, parade the streets and alleys in thrillingly fetishistic costumes.    At first glance there's a familiarity to all this: it has somethng of the old American detective stories from Hammet to Spillane.  Rotten doins in back-alley L.A.  But, what's happened here is that the sensibility has shifted.  Thanks to the power and popularity of Japanese Samurai movies and Hong Kong Kung Fu movies, the genre has changed; its has become Asian.  It has become crueler, more intense and utterly fatalistic.  All the characters crouch under a low, jagged ceiling of hopelessness.    SIN CITY could well be seen as the story of three rag-tag, out-at-the-elbow Samurai who frequent the same mid-town combo noodle joint, brothel, and tavern where they oggle and salivate over the same generic, interchangeable would-be geishas.  They have no Lord, and therefore, no honor or duty, and in their alcohol-soaked consciousnesses, they become the self-appointed protectors of the sluts they are powerless to satisfy physically or financially.  Depravity is not a result, it is a foregone conclusion.    Everything is blood-soaked and takes place in the dark.      In a land controlled by a hidden, unapproachable autocrat whose deadly agents are everywhere, whose will and methods are secret, devious and depraved, everything is reduced to a series of block-printed pictures printed cheaply on cheap paper; images of poverty, helplessness, empty commercial sexuality, filth and cold.    Other people's pain is an amusement: Torture has become commonplace.    SIN CITY.
B000YABYLA|4.0|When I first saw it in the movies, I thought that Juno was a strange girl, and really she was. But then again, she was supposed to be.    Ellen Page gave a good performance of a extroverted teen with quick-wit, a snappy tongue, and still much growing up to do. Yet she also was naive, sweet, and quite tender at times. I like that she had enough wisdom not to be selfish concerning her baby.     Even though she wanted to, she did not abort her child....so the rest of the story goes from there. Her equally offbeat, and immature, boyfriend and her aren't ready to be parents, so she finds a couple to adopt her unborn child. Her father and stepmother, don't crucify her like she worried they would, but they help her out inspite of their shock and immediate disapproval. Her friend--who bugged me--came along her side, too.    The unique part is that Juno and the baby's father, Bleeker, remained friendly to each other, and solidified their relationship.
B000W91RUG|1.0|Now he tells me! Apparently the disc freezes.   Had he told me sooner I could have returned it.
B00009RDG9|1.0|At least Rambo had a reason he was causing so much ruckus.  This guy is just, well pointless.  Supposedly all he sees people as is targets, except for a little girl and her mom, and just about everyone else he meets.    Buy Rambo instead, you'll be glad you did.  This movie is not worth a rental fee, let alone a purchase.  I'm glad I got it from the library for free, that way I'm only out the time I wasted watching it.
B00008Y3VA|4.0|A good song selection and according to the reviewers, well remastered and carefully placed in the right order. However, it should be noted that like Genesis and Deep Purple, Heeps career was divided by a change of singers. Also, Ken Hensley, the driving force behind the best Heep songs, left somewhere in the late seventies. This virtually put the band in the hands of remaining founder member Mick Box.<br />Almost all of disc 2 is about Heep after David Byron and the material is not half as strong as before. If that is no objection to you, this is a good overview of a band that managed to survive for more than forty years -  an admirable achievement!<br />If you prefer the music Heep produced in the Byron/Hensley years, get Classic Heep.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|One word to  describe this movie: Garbage. I already wasted too much time watching this movie, so i do not want to waste any more time describing this film.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|We have seen the musical three times and the movie was no disappointment!!  It was wonderful, fun, exciting and some great performances.  Those that disliked Pierce's singing should get a life!!!
B0019CSXAM|4.0|Great show, great characters!  You will absolutely love this show.  It drops a little from the 2nd season but still a must have in the library.
0316113506|5.0|This was a fascinating read and really makes you understand the impact of exercise on the brain, learning, depression, ADD, etc.
B001L5SXQG|2.0|Rolling Stone's way off the mark on this one. This cd just seems excrutiatingly boring. The lyrics are very pedestrian for what you'd expect from Springsteen and the music is way too overproduced. Outlaw Pete sounds like something someone could have written in High School. The rest of the album plays like someone on Prozak. Yes there are strong Byrds and Beach Boy influences throughout the album, but they're no where near effective. And why does Bruce feel he would need to copy anyones elses style is beyond me?  After MAGIC (5 stars) I really thought this one was going to be very good. I think MAGIC was the best album he's done since BTR. I really don't give bad reviews too often but I didn't have a choice with WOAD. I'm just glad I listened to it a few times off Myspace before I went and bought it. If you get a chance to see him in concert though GO! I saw him on the Magic tour and it was the best show I saw all year. It was even better than Van Halen and The Police. The Roger Waters show was a close second. Oh and buy MAGIC.
B001GKJ2FM|4.0|My wife and I first saw this \\"show\\" on stage and did totally enjoy it. When the movie came out we could not imagine how it would outdo the stage performance. But it does add some amazing scope and dimension to the story through cinematography: the beauty of the islands of Greece, the water, the \\"sets\\" used in the story and the unique choreography of the \\"songs\\" scenes did add dimensions which could not be captured by the stage performance. We bought this for our daughter who totally loved it. We'll borrow her copy and look at it to enjoy it again, too.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Through the lens of history, fascism is made more mild, it just becomes something people foolishly bought into. This movie shows fascism for what it really is, a nauseating, disgusting thing that creates monsters-- both those who exploit and those who allow themselves to be exploited. This absolutely disgusting tale needs to be told to remind people of what it is like to be controlled and to control. No one is left clean by this.     Someone said something about homosexuality leading to death in this film. I do not feel this is true, everyone just has sex with everyone, it's not homo or hetero. This film is not about desire for particular bodies, but the desire to control bodies to gain power, as well as when those bodies allow themselves to be controlled. This film serves as a cautionary tale to warn those without power about those with power, but to also empower those same people to not be easily won over. This film is an allegory for the contemporary age, and just because it's a hard pill to swallow does not mean it should be ignored.
0307455874|5.0|President Obama has given supporters and detractors a great gift. Instead of the typical boilerplate, partisan book which every presidential candidate has ghostwritten while running for office, the author put a great deal of thought into this work. It was penned before an attempt at the presidency was even a glimmer in his eyes and it shows by President Obama's unguarded presentation. It is not a detailed blueprint of what he would do once he is in office, but a man grappling with being a father, husband, Senator, a man of mixed race and deeply religious.<br /><br />Forthright, humble, respectful of others' views and introspective are the staples of the author's book. The man truly shows a level of emotional maturity and dignity not seen in some of our more recent chief executives. It is very rare to get a glimpse into the inner workings of how our president thinks before he takes the oath of office. We have to rely on third-person narratives which are usually interesting, but give an incomplete if not a blatantly false picture. Here's your opportunity to know your President. Easy to read, yet eloquent and sincere.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This is a great collection for the \\"True Blue\\" fan of this series.  Great price and the  binder style book that holds the disc is very unique.  Full of beautiful pictures and info.  I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Regarding some of the other reviews, you can guess what some folks will say when you see that this album has been tagged with \\"political propoganda.\\"  So, I'm sure that some of the customer reviews will be skewed somewhat by some rather immature posters who can't seem to get over the fact that Bruce Springsteen doesn't share the same political philosophy as they do, and wish that he would \\"shut up and sing.\\"        This album will play tricks on you.  As a long time fan, I hated this the first time I heard it because it is so different than anything else he has done, especially within the last twenty-five years or so.  It's an album that requires effort to get inside of, but in the end, it is well worth that effort.    WOAD is not really suited for the thirty-something crowd, either (though I am actually a member of that agegroup myself).  On this album, though, Springsteen has created some of his most beautiful melodies and arrangements.  The harmonies are mind-blowing, in so much that it takes a moment to realize that it is the E Street Band that you're listening to.    The centerpiece of this album is \\"Kingdom of Days,\\" a majestic Roy Orbison-crossed-with-the-Byrds-harmonies track that shows Springsteen at the peak of his musical creativity.      I don't want to go through and rate the songs one at a time.  However, another highlight of the album is O'Brien's production.  While many were divided over the work he did on Magic, this album is crisp, clear, and most tellingly, it does not peak on the master track.  The over-compression is gone, and you can see/hear the high and low points within the track.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|I have liked AC/DC since the early 80's.  They have done some different music on this cd but still like it very much.  Great CD.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell's best book since \\"The Tipping Point\\" examines, through fascinating case studies (e.g., Bill Gates, the Beatles, Canadian hockey stars) the conditions which enable talented people to turn into stellar successes.  \\"10,000 hours of practice\\" is only part of the equation.  It's just as important to born at the right time and right place.  Great success is inevitably assisted by flukish serendipity -- the great good luck to have the kind of talent perfectly suited to one's era and locale -- while the absence of such serendipity leads millions of potential successes to wither in dark obscurity. By establishing that \\"genius\\" isn't confined to biological miracles, but can be developed in anyone who is \\"good enough\\", the book is both an inspiration and a wake up call.  A mind is a terrible thing to waste, especially when with a little care it could light up the world.
B00006AFF5|5.0|I purchased this for two of my grandchildren. They love it. In fact their Mother informed me that hardly a day goes by that the youngest does not ask to watch the movie. Could not have been better!!
0743270754|5.0|Learned a lot of history from this book.  Most of Lincolns history and the man that he was is never learned in school.  Great read.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A must see!!  We all Love this one!  Delightful, really intriguing story, terrific acting.  Great characters, costumes and scenery.  Wonderful romance.  Watching it over and over is a privilege.  Even dealt comfortably with uncomfortable socio-political issues.
B000PXUA5W|4.0|My son loves this watch.  I got it for him for Christmas for his \\"first watch\\". I wanted him to have an analog watch first so he could learn to properly tell time. This was a great choice because it is easy to read and has that great lego look.  I worried that the watch might fall apart while wearing it but that does not happen, its very well put together.  The only complaint is that because it's plastic, he can't wear it for more than a few hours without taking it off and letting the skin breath undernieth.  The watch itself is accurate and reliable.  All in all a good choice.
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|I love ABBA and their music very much, and I wish I could rate this musical movie a 5 star rating, but I can't. I have no other choice but to give this movie 2 stars.     When I first watched this movie, I was kinda confused or I couldn't quite make out what the dialogue was talking about. Now that I've watched it a few more times and read some of the other reviews here helped me get a better perspective. Now, I have mixed feelings about this movie.     First the positive, I enjoyed the scenery and orchestrated dancing and performing near the pretty blue waters. I was surprised to see Benny appearing for 2 seconds in the song \\"dancing queen\\" and Bjorn appearing at the end as a Greek God. Although I've heard of most of the songs before this movie, but I was introduced to \\"slipping through my fingers\\", which is the only song I don't have on any of my ABBA CD's. Lastly, I feel the need to talk about this but, for a PG-13 rating that this movie didn't have any of the F-word, S-word, or the B-word, which was wonderful.       Now to the negative, the songs sung by Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan didn't exactly get my attention. I mean the only ones who can sing ABBA's songs is ABBA personally. Furthermore, I wasn't too thrilled in some of the sexual comments on the movie. Plus, I was kind of disappointed at all the finger-pointing, borderline feminism, rejection, and crude houndlike behavior coming from both male and female so-called companions. And we wonder why there's people in the world who have been known to avoid relationships.       So what is my expressed opinion for Mamma Mia? I would have to say Average, or Fair.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|First, let me say that some parts of this movie deserve five stars. The cinematography was stunning, the costumes were so beautiful I could've cried, and the acting was first rate.<br /><br />It was the story that was lacking and really quite depressing. I don't remember feeling depressed reading the book -- just a bit fascinated with the author's portrayal of the court and sad for the noblewomen who had little to no control over their own destinies.<br /><br />If the movie had been named differently, I would've watched it with the expectation that it might have a different take on the story. All I could think about, though, was \\"Hey wait, that's wrong.\\" And \\"No, that didn't happen.\\" And \\"Hey, that's not the way it's supposed to be.\\" Even knowing that most films can't adhere that closely to the book, this one was so far off that it was jarring.<br /><br />Do I think you'd enjoy it if you hadn't read the book? Hard to tell. So many parts were glossed over that I don't know how easy it would be to follow the story and the characters. For instance, Mary is courted by Stafford, but we weren't told that her young husband had died, so that seemed weird. I'd suggest you read the book instead.<br /><br />I so-so enjoyed it, won't watch it again, and wouldn't recommend it to family and friends, unless those friends were dressmakers.<br /><br />(Review by Mrs. Scott)
0321543726|5.0|Different from other fine technical books in terms of heft and its use of color, Professor Stroustrup has achieved a remarkable balance of both accessibility and accuracy.     As other reviewers have noted, this book is not musings on the evolution of C++ nor is it meant as a means to transition to C++ from some other language. Instead, it starts from a tabula rasa and teaches programming concepts using C++ as the medium of expression. (He even explains what a screen cursor is. :-))    I've been using C++ since 1992 and it's the language I chose for our company's major project back in 1999, a decision that proved to be prudent as the application has grown in complexity over the years. In spite of my long C++ experience, I'm still finding gems in this book, some of which are of the ``Oh yeah, I forgot about that!'' variety.    Another point not yet made by other reviewers is the sheer joy that shines throughout the pages. It's clear that Bjarne Stroustrup is still jazzed about programming after all this time and considers it fun. This book happened to arrive when I was perplexed and frustrated with a problem (in an application written in another language). Reading this book helped to ignite my fire and made me remember just why I became a programmer in the first place.    There are a few things we purists may not like such as casting the return value from ``malloc()'' and using ``exit 2'' but those few nits are outweighed (pun intended) by the overall quality of this outstanding book.
0345441184|1.0|A retelling of the Arthurian legends which takes into account the nature of British paganism and its interaction with Christianity, and shows how this may have worked itself out in the Arthur stories themselves, would be a great thing.  Unfortunately this is not it.  The simplistic cliches and stereotypes which clutter this book make quite clear that anyone wishing imaginatively to enter the mind of British late antiquity should look elsewhere.  The conversations and social interactions sound, mutatis mutandis, as if they are coming out of a 1950s cocktail party.  When I mentioned this to a lover of this book she said \\"do you think it was any different back then?\\"  That in a nutshell shows the type of person to whom this book is likely to appeal: someone who regards history as having been century after century of more or less the same thing, at least until 1964.  I certainly do not expect or want archeological and anthropological accuracy from a fantasy, but I would like some sense that Arthurian Britain was a different place, and its people had different concerns, than those of a suburban college.  Maybe someday we'll get the Arthur we deserve; until then let's stick with Mallory.
B001KMB6X2|2.0|The movie had a lot of action and suspense thoughout until you got to the very end.  A real waste of time and money.  The writer and director should be ashamed. If you really want to watch this DVD - let the end remain a mystery - turn it off.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Jamal is a teenager appearing on the Indian TV game show, \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,\\"  and he's doing so well that the host and the police think he's cheating.  When he's taken in for questioning (and torture), we learn that he answered the \\"Millionaire\\" questions correctly because of incidents in his childhood, when he was an orphan fending for himself in the teeming slums of Mumbai.<br /><br />This is an exceptional movie with a riveting script, outstanding acting, and cinematography that makes you feel like you're right there with Jamal.  The movie owes much of its success to the small children who play Jamal and his brother in flashbacks; they're wonderfully talented and believable in quite challenging roles.  However, I would recommend it only to those who know what to expect, because it was way too intense for me.  The scenes of the boys growing up in hopeless misery and squalor are so shocking I often had to look away.  Inhuman cruelty directed at young children drew audible gasps and groans from the theatre audience.<br /><br />The triumph of the human spirit at the end is heartening, but the pain and suffering of the slumdogs was so graphic, it was really painful to watch.  It's a well-made movie that I wouldn't want to see again.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|Death Race Best of its Kind... This is a Bell Weather Blu-Ray up there with Iron Man...for an Example of an Show Case into HD Blu-Ray...<br /><br />Death Race is death to the finish car race in the prison system. Action is great...I am not going to get into the movie in my review ...This is a must see movie with this regular DVD looking like High Def with great color saturation and now I have the Blu-Ray as well and Blu-Ray is Slightly better in depth and deeper color and Hi Def Sound...And yes I do recommend getting the Blu-Ray version...
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I know I'm probably in the minority of guys who saw this movie and actually enjoyed it, but what the heck. it really is brilliant! I didn't have too high expectations when my mum dragged me along to see it in the theatre, I thought it would be just another desperate cheesy attempt from Hollywood to make money, having run out of original movie ideas, all they could think of was to make a movie out of a stage musical. Boy was I proven wrong big time! Not only were there a cast of well-known great actors, but the thing that surprised me the most was that Meryl Streep had an amazing singing voice, as did her \\"daughter\\" Amanda Seygfried whom to me was not heard of until I saw this movie. Starting off with the first pure, beautiful lines of \\"I Have A Dream\\" sung to perfection by Seygfried, we're off to a greek island with breathtaking scenery and the party is on, going from one Abba hit song to another, helping to run the story and you'll find yourself tapping your feet along to the beat, singing along to some of Abba's biggest hits being performed in this movie, surprisingly well-sung by a talented cast of actors (all except for Pierce Brosnan, who, in my opinion, should stick to acting). I bet they all must've had a lot of fun shooting this movie and it definitely shows by their great performances. Streep and Seygfried were the ones that stood out the most for me and I can now see why Meryl has gotten so much praise in the past, she definitely shows what an amazing actress she is in this movie and this has made me want to see other movies she's been in as well. As for Seygfried, she's a talent to watch out for, she is onto big things in her career.    I promise you won't regret it if you see this movie, if you are an Abba fan or just into musicals in gneneral, you will certainly enjoy it.
B000002B30|2.0|The hits, are well known by all us fans. I must say I'm shocked \\"The Boss\\" claims he dropped the ball on the Wal-Mart deal. Are you kidding? He took millions from Wal-Mart and then throws them under the bus, all the while, taking their cash. Most of us shop at Wal-Mart and like shoping there for the great deals during these tough times. Maybe Bruce should donate his profits from the Wal-Mart sales to those millions who are struggling during these tough economic times. I love his music, put your money where your mouth is.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I love this movie!!! And the blu-ray is awesome. It's like being there. I have watched it three times so far. Hmmm, it's movie night here at home so we will probably watch it again. Who doesn't love Abba music. And even though Pierce Brosnan isn't a singer he is still great to look at, lol. So totally satisfied with the purchase.
B001676320|5.0|I did not think I would care for Chicago but wanted EWF on blu ray. To my surprise, both groups were awesome and I got to see them performing together and as individual groups.    I would recommend this DVD
B0000C8AVX|3.0|This review is not for the content, but the SACD sound of the album.  Frankly, it is underwhelming.  Understandable, based on the source material.  Ability to listen to this one in 5.1 is a bonus, but if you are expecting miracles to happen you will be disappointed.   The sound quality of Blood on the Tracks is much, much better, but then it was recorded about 10 years later in 1974.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|This movie strikes me as worth at best 3 stars. The first is for the acting of Bardem and Cruz which rises above the mediocrity of the material given them. The second is for the beautiful photography, in this case of Barcelona. The third is for the tentative hints of irony which fitfully peep out in the course of the numerous betrayals among lovers this film apparently accepts as standard operating procedure for sophisticated contemporary persons.    Woody Allen's judgment - or lack of it - is clearly inferior to his talent. His characters have experiences, yet neither he nor any of them seems to seek after, much less grasp, their meaning. Theirs are lives only of sensations, not of thoughts; they can resist everything except temptation; adultery, for example, is presented here consequently as less a betrayal of integrity than a logistical inconvenience.  Eschewing judgment of actions lest he be thought \\"judgmental\\" of persons, Allen - and by extension his characters -  emerges as less sophisticated than as diminished by arrested development, one whose vision remains embarrassingly that of an overly-hormonal teenager.     An infinitely greater artist Henry James, when he dealt with the international scene, saw that the key to a character's wholeness and maturity often rested with the ability to sacrifice, to renounce a less than finely human course of action. I wonder if Woody Allen, here so at home in the world and eagerly accepting of human failure simply because it's human, would have any understanding of what an artist of high standards like James was talking about.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Well done, and sounds much better on SACD then other earlier Dylan titles.  The stuff from the sixties just does not sound as good.  Pity, because those are my favorites.  When it comes to sound quality, You Can't Get \\"Blood\\" From A \\"Stone\\" seems to have a double meaning here. Pardon the pun...
0780619951|3.0|This movie is definitely missing some plot elements (a twist at the end would have been a nice touch) but it still delivers.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Val Kilmer's performance. He is absolutely insane in this movie. Marlon Brando is also phenomenal and plays the mad scientist to perfection.<br /><br />I think that the main lead star (can't remember his name) was a little bit of a miscast. The creatures were good, and thankfully the CGI was not abundant. The CGI that is in the film is completely phony and it shows. The special effects team made the right decision by actually using masks/costumes for most of the scenes.<br /><br />This movie isn't Oscar-worthy, but it has cult appeal. If you're a Kilmer or Brando fan, it's a must-see.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Fun Movie. It's about lazy fat people who realize they can't be lazy and fat anymore.
1575666286|5.0|Fantasic life changing book.  Highly recommend to anyone who wants great health for life
B001KL3GY0|4.0|Franz Ferdinand are definitely not for dissapointing their fans, and yet this album is just as accessible as their debut and 'You Could Have it So Much Better' except there is a more dominant electro/new wave feel with 'Tonight' that anyone can easily get into (and should).    'Tonight' offers a different, more sexier and darker side to Franz Ferdinand. Still, they never seem to loose themselves to experimentation; you know who you're listening to and that this is for sure a Franz Ferdinand album. 'Ulysses' is catchy, no doubt, probably not as much as their previous singles,'Take Me Out' or 'Do You Want To?', but it's still a good song. 'Turn It On' is also good, but it's a better segway to 'No You Girls', a quite swaggering tease of a tune; it's a brilliant pop song, and possibly the album's highlight. 'Twilight Omens' and 'Dream Again' are a wonderfully dreamy pop tunes. 'Live Alone' is probably another album highlight, a very meaningful and very dancable elctro-diddy. 'Lucid Dreams' is way different from what listeners had previous heard on the net (though it was considered a demo). It's still a great song and Franz's longest, running at nearly 8 minutes; the last 3 minutes are pure elcectronica bliss. The album closes with 'Katherine Kiss Me,' a classic Franz ballad, acoustic, mellow, and a reminder that Franz can do anything.
B000002UC5|5.0|OK...so it's the first solo album Macca made. Long time ago. But I LOVE LOVE LOVE it. It's raw, simple, incredibly sweet but not the kind of sweet that will give you diabetes. Rather the best of Macca's ability to be incredibly whole, complete, and beautiful, with few words and the most touching melodies. I thought I had never heard the album until I heard the songs on YouTube and realized I practically knew every single song.   \\"Junk\\", \\"Everynight\\"...etc. etc. Love it. Oh. And remember: Paul plays all of the instruments himself on this one. As if we needed a reminder of the absolutely genial musician he is.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|I remembered why I had trouble getting into NCIS before Seasons 5 and 6 viewing this season. The jokes are not that funny and the episodes are plotted in an obvious or contrived way. But in the context of the later seasons, it is worth seeing how the plots of Seasons 5 and 6 are developed. Worth buying, but just not as good as NCIS currently is.
B00006AFF5|5.0|Great movie for both adults and kids.  I think Dr.Seuess would be proud of the way his book has come to life.  Ron Howard did a great job creating Whoville and the make-up and costumes are well done.  JIm Carrey did an excellent job as The Grinch.  The Deluxe Edition has a second disc with recipes from Whoville residents as well as games to play.
1587264412|5.0|This is  a classic. I read it years ago and had forgotten the lush beauty of his language, the acuity of his vision and the wisdom of his conclusions. My daughter and I visited India more than 20 years ago, and it brought back the smells, the poverty and the lush beauty of the country. What I remember most is how kind Indians were to us. Incredibly giving, you never see a car or even a scooter that isn't crammed to the hilt with people. They share. Something we Americans seem to've forgotten. Anyway, it's a lovely book and, as I recall, a lovely film.
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|I've been a Bond fan since Dr. No was released in 1963.  I've seen each Bond film more times than I can possibly count.  I found this film to be a mid-level Bond at best, a big disappointment since the triumph of \\"Casino Royale.\\"  Simply put, each scene is a way to push the film forward to the next action scene.  And the action scenes are simply not that good.  The pre-credits sequence is an an extremely confusing car chase that doesn't come close to so many of the other great car chases in the series.  The theme song is possibly the worst in the series, it makes Madonna's \\"Die Another Day\\" sound good.  And the action scenes that come after are okay at best: a not very exciting boat chase, a CGI-enhanced airplane scene that looked like something out of \\"12 O'Clock High,\\" etc.  The concluding action sequence, a fight between Bond and the villain in a burning hotel that catches fire way too easily is okay but unmemorable.  Daniel Craig is very good and tough, (hes terrific in \\"Defiance\\" by the way,) but at times I miss the class and sophistication of the Connery and Moore films.  Olga Kuryenko, who was stunning in \\"Hitman,\\" is absolutely gorgeous, but simply not used enough in this film.  I don't want to criticise this film too much, it is still entertaining and the hour and 45 minutes go fast.  However it is not a great Bond film like \\"Casino Royale\\" or many of the others. However it is a James Bond film and the James Bond films are in a class by themselves.  It is probably better than Brosnan's last Bond \\"Die Another Day\\" and perhaps \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and a couple of Moore's films like \\"Golden Gun\\" or \\"View to a Kill\\" and the Connery abomination \\"Never Say Never Again.\\"  But thats about it.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|I have a question for everyone who hates this movie:  Do you know what this is based on?  Have you ever seen the Speed Racer cartoon?  It's not one of the lost works of Shakespeare.  It's bright, frenetic, and rarely makes an ounce of sense but if you don't turn your nose up at it you'll have the greatest time.  If we keep that in mind this could very well be the most faithful film adaptation I've ever seen and I love it.  Matthew Fox may as well quit doing that \\"Lost\\" nonsense, because after playing Racer X there's just nowhere else for his career to climb to.  Go Speed Racer, Go!
0061120081|5.0|I've read hundreds of books and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is the only I return to over and again for the sheer simplicity and beauty of the work. The book is rightfully a classic because it paints a picture of the race-embroiled South through the eyes of a child -- and in that Harper Lee gives us a view untainted by prejudice or stereotype. Buy this book, read it, and I promise you will want to return to it again over the years, too.
B000002PH1|5.0|Her voice is definitely unique and very recognizable.  Her hits \\"Circle In The Sand\\" and \\"I Get Weak\\" were some of the most memorable songs from the mid to late 80s.  An excellent album that should never go out of print.  It's Belinda at her BEST!
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt writes in simple, straight-forward voice that both lulls the reader into his world yet effectively moves him through McCourt's story. The strength of the book is that it is written through the eyes of a child, and all of the memories that just 'are' to him are powerful and moving to an adult who can only imagine the difficult childhood McCourt faced. He tells one person's story and, in effect, tells the story of a generation. It will be a classic and should be required reading.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|it's both and more. it gets better each time i hear it. this is the best album i have heard since person pitch.    thank you animal collective for making me truly care about new music again for the first time in years.    melodies are extremely strong and catchy. great song writing. harmonies are occasionally breathtaking. album flow is perfect. built on a bed of vintage synth tones and drum sounds that sound classic but never stale.     this may be a challenging record for people who are used to stale, boring music but it is really not that difficult. in fact it is a great POP album. this album caught me on the first listen but that is probably because i was so ensconced it that i entered a hypnagogic state. i think this album could catch anyone though. if you want to get a friend into animal collective just keep playing it around them and not telling them. eventually it will catch them and they will ask what it is.
B00005JLZN|5.0|I don't see how some reviewers missed the subplots or thought there were too many. I guess they must suffer from ADD.  I got the whole story the first time around, and have watched it many more times for the great dramatic and emotional impact it takes the viewer through.  I also think a lot of reviewers forget to watch the acting, besides just the story line.  In this I feel that Kate Winslet delivered an absolutely magnificent, emotional and gut-wrenching performance; as did Laura Linney and of course, Kevin Spacey.<br /><br />Too many people have preconceived notions about a movie before it even begins to tell the story, and end up convincing themselves that a movie is bad in comparison to this or that movie; which is a waste of time and thought (unless it's an intentional wanna-be type movie).  Gosh, just look and listen.  Try to be impartial, even though there may be a message; albeit forced-fed at times to the viewer (Libs and Cons take note).<br /><br />The more I see great acting (like that of the principals in this movie), the more I appreciate how much work actors put into their characters and how hard it is to \\"stay in character\\" as the filming goes on for weeks or months.  It's really easy to act badly, but difficult to act convincingly.  Can't say enough about the first-rate jobs by the entire cast of this movie. Bravo!
B00006WL2B|5.0|Few dispute that this, Herbert von Karajan's 4th recording of Beethovens's Ode to Joy masterpiece, is a masterpiece by itself. Karajan's first recording, in 1947 with the Vienna Philharmonic, would be a lifetime achievement for many conductors. That was followed by an equally fine Philharmonia recording that doesn't have the sense of occasion the 1947 performance enjoyed. Karajan's first recording of the 9th for DG in 1963 became justly famous, being surrounded by a media blitz and lavious packaging. No wonder the 1977 recording seemed somehwat of an after thought when it appeared on LP. But when this 1977 recording first appeared as a Galleria mid-priced bargains in 1986 - [[ASIN:B000001G6W Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 \\"Choral\\"]] - , it almost instantly vaulted to the top of the charts around the globe, equally favored by those with musical ears and audiophiles.    In 2003, DG issued a 2 CD set with a 24bit/96k remastering of this same  recording - [[ASIN:B00008CLNP Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 5, 6 & 9]] - that became the version to have - see my review there. The remastering removed some of the annoying over-microphoning effects that tend to mar most of the DG recordings from that era - the mid 1970s through the early 1980s. Oddly enough, DG in the 1990s became a big proponent of issuing recordings made from live sessions, quite a contrast to the 1970s.    So now we have an SACD of the 1977 performance. Another remastering? No, much more. From the first note, it is very evident DG did a complete remix this time. Previous CDs applied digital filtering techniques to the final master tapes to bring about the noticable improvements, especially the 2003 remastering. But in order to take better advantage of SACDs 5.1 surround sound capabilities, it seems evident to me from listening that this time around the who-knows-how-many original tracks were used to produce new mixing altogether. I have to say I was not impressed at first listen. The sound has more highs and it seemsa little more \\"tinny\\" and less full-bodied when compared to either of the first CD versions in A/B  listening tests. But a few full fledged runs through the entire SACD convinced me the new remix is far and away superior. Orchestral detail is phenomenally better. The Adagio particularly fares much better here than in the other two versions. In the finale, individual voices and choir sections are more distinctly placed in the sound stage. For example, Jose van Damm's voice at athe opening of the Ode to Joy is very clearly placed slightly to the right instead of almost filling the whole stage. And the closing climax is similarly less crowded and congested.     You don't need an SACD player, or 5.1 surround sound to benefit from these improvements. I prefer the SACD Stereo layer myself, but the SACD CD layer is equally fine too. I actually did the majority of my comparative listening several months ago using only the CD layer of the SACD as I lacked an SACD player at the time. So don't let the SACD format stop you from enjoying this.    I will keep the prior CDs, partiularly the 2003 version, but I think I will more often return to this version than any other of this 1977 recording for a breathtaking listening experience. And it certainly is that. My only sadness is that Universal exitted the SACD market so quickly. I would love to hear more of their recordings remixed in this fashion. Come back please!    As for those who have maligned this SACD, for preferring those glossy versions to this full range beauty, we call you \\"Mellow Yellow\\".

B001PPLIEQ|3.0|&#34;Quantum of Solace&#34; (2008) works better as a companion piece to &#34;Casino Royale&#34; rather than a traditional James Bond epic. The film plays like a fragmented novella, which accounts for its 105-minute length (the shortest 007 running time on record). Daniel Craig delivers another solid performance as a tortured, vengeful Bond — definitely the right man for the job. Judi Dench's M gets better with each installment and her chemistry with Craig packs a vital punch. In the low-key villain department, Mathieu Amalric's sociopathic portrayal is reminiscent of Klaus Maria Brandauer's Largo in &#34;Never Say Never Again&#34; (1983). Director Marc Forster keeps the thin narrative moving, but seems more comfortable with actors than bone-crunching action sequences. &#34;Casino Royale&#34; was a hard act to follow and the Bond producers should be credited for trying a different approach. Based on its own merits, &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34; remains a flawed yet strangely compelling 007 entry.

B001LRJH0U|5.0|I loved the Parker novel on which the film is based and the film is worthy of the novel.  Harris' direction is superb; the period details are spot-on and the script is lean and Parkeresque.  It is a story of friendship, of friendship between men.  As such, more is left unsaid than is said.  The fact that things need not be said is the whole point.  Everyone will think of Spenser and Hawk and that is fair, but I think as well of the laconic Jesse Stone, another Parker creation which has resulted in excellent film adaptations.  Remember always that Parker is an English Ph.D., one who understands genre at the deepest level.  Thus, this is a western in the purest sense.  The story is relatively familiar (as western stories always are) and the experience of watching it is one that borders on ritual and sacrament.  We know that we are entering a certain ethos and we know what will happen there.  We pray that we won't be disappointed.  Here, we are not disappointed.  It is not as operatic as the Sergio Leone films can be, but it is respectful, almost worshipful, of the world which the genre celebrates.  This is first-rate work, an exquisite film.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 10 year old grandsons.  They love anything connected to Star Wars.  Watched it two times on Christmas Day!
B000007WNN|5.0|Well, this is a classic hit album. I remember the band had some influence from Led Zeppelin and stuff when they recorded this album. The sound is wild and tight. I purchased this album because I wished to listen to the first few sounds of this album, but the whole thing was perfect as I knew, I've heard the thing some 20 or more years ago when I was a kid. I really appreciate that I could get this album through amazon.com.
B00005K3OT|1.0|Before I get hit by the first rotten eggs, let me state that I am a foreigner living in France who likes good chocolate and finds lots of it in this part of the world, who buys his wine in the Gers region, somewhere near Lansquennet-sur-chose, in that beautiful part of France between Bordeaux and Toulouse, someone who has often walked along trails others have avoided - yet I feel that this is a lousy movie.    The problem with this film is that it cannot make up its mind as to whether it wants to be a fairy tale or a political pamphlet and the rivalry between these two objectives makes for a lot of jarring noise.    It starts out as a fairy tale with two little red riding-hoods, mother and daughter, arriving in a kind of petrified town.  Their vocation seems to be the deliverance of the population from their self-imposed (senti)mental sklerosis by means of a magic drug, presented in a variety of forms to suit the various symptoms of the disease.  A little pepper-laced chocolate will help a desperate housewife, for example, to revitalize a lazy husband.    To make sure the spectator understands the message of the movie, the characters are presented in the most exaggerated manner.  The good people are frighteningly good, the villains ridiculously villainous, the artists wonderfully artistic.  This, then, makes it easy to include a few subliminal messages aimed at promoting the pleasant idea that the ultimate goal of our life is enjoyment.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is tarred and feathered - a rather unpleasant treatment even if the tar, in this case, is chocolate syrup.    Such a fate actually awaits the mayor of the town, a real model of a hypocritical brute whose family has been ruling the area for hundreds of years (the French Revolution notwithstanding) and even went so far as to drive all those gentle, fun-loving Huguenots into exile, back in the 17th  century.  He faults little red riding-hood for setting up her business during lent, he edits the sermons of the young priest (who is actually a very nice chap and later revolts) and he is behind a pogrom organized against this bunch of foreigners who come drifting down the river with their house-boat and dare throw a party during Holy Week.    The experienced movie-goer has been waiting for such an explosion to strike and just did not know whether the chocolate shop would be blown up or the house-boat set on fire.  In the end it is the house-boat, with the two lovers (little red riding-hood and one of the drifters) inside and but for the grace of God (if there is one) our valiant patissière is saved from drifting out of sight like Ophelia in a pre-Raphaelite painting.  It all takes place in an imaginary setting, unrelated to anything in the real France, the chocolate shop is mysteriously dark, the town frozen in stone without any sign of vegetation and with the church spire looming up at the end of every street like a watch-tower at Guantanamo; actual life can be found only down by the riverside where the trees are green even in early spring.    And the actors?  The men obviously suffer from the greasy hair that is de rigueur for a film set in 1959 and thus look a little silly, be they the friendly tramp or the ugly mayor.  Juliette Binoche, pretty as a picture, apparently brought along, in her little suitcase, a whole collection of evening dresses to wear when mixing her wares or when divining the secret wishes of her customers by means of a magical disk that once belonged to a Maya priest.  There is Judi Dench, wonderful in the role of the mean-looking but kind matron who owns the patisserie; she is not afraid of making herself look old, something that really makes her a good actress.    But for all the actors' talent and their efforts, this film is miles away from the poetry of \\"Babette's feast\\" or the highly recommendable farce \\"Le bonheur est dans le pré\\"; this latter film, by the way, is set in the real Gers region of which \\"Chocolat\\" is only a poor pastiche.
B001GM28HO|4.0|This cd is a very fun album with catchy lyrics and bass pounding beats! She is a great new artist of '09. She reminds me of my favorite artist Gwen Stefani. My favorite tracks are Just Dance, Love Game, Poker Face, Beautiful and Dirty Rich, and The Fame. This cd is definitely worth a listen!
B001L5SXQG|1.0|Geez..so this is the new Springsteen. I've been on board this bus since I worked at Discount records in St. Louis where one day we checked out this guy in the 'Folk\\" isle and we played the Wild & Innocent. Hey, he's not folk!    So my buddies and I'm were hooked and now I'm 56 living in Orlando. Every Springsteen new release hits some type of player 8 track, cassette, turntable, cd, computer the day its released. 23 times in the clubs, halls and arenas to see him live. My ex-wife and I even planned our honeymoon around the 'darkness' tour 7 shows in 12 days in a VW bug following their bus.     But man I gotta tell you. This stuff's getting ragged. Surprise, Surprise, Surprise! Yeah, I tell you I was Surprised all right. What the 'L' is that all about? Whew! And that cowboy thing that opens this collection...amazingly I read somewhere here on good 'ol Amazon that one of these reviewers compared it to Jungleland! Ok pass the pipe, I've got to get a hit of what you're smoking.     Overall this collection of dreck has a little better edge than that last rotten egg that was laid called Magic. I played it once and said - 'hmmm must not of been in the mood today for Bruce' played it twice and said - \\"could this really be as boring as I think it is\\" waited a month - played it again and when I heard that ' Girl in the Summer Clothes' thing I ripped it from my car cd player and frisbeed it out the window.     Devils and Dust in a word - BRUTAL. This Dream thing, the acoustic stuff has merit. Are there any rockers on this thing? Can somebody give me a hand here?    I know, I know he's almost 60. So am I. But honestly folks, you want good Springsteen? Then start with BTR and go right directly through every release including Live 75-85 till you hit Brillant Disguise and stop. That's it! You've got everything you'll ever need. No reason to expose yourself to this dreck that gets released now.     Bottom line if the first Bruce cd was Magic and Dreams was the second....you'd neverhear a 3rd.     I love you Bruce but its time to go back to that mansion in Rumson and weave those tales of the road to your kids.     See you at the Super Bowl.     Did this review help anyone...?
B001ACY8D2|5.0|Don't shy away from this band simply because they only sing in Icelandic, because they have some of the best music around.  I have listened to this CD at least 12 times in the past few days and I can not get enough.  They are beautiful and very interesting.  You will be singing along in Icelandic in no time.  Definitely get this album and do not ever stop listening to it.

If you like music that is soft and mellow, this is the CD for you.  Even if you don't particularly like soft music, you should definitely check it out.  It is some of the best music I have heard in the past few years.

B001L5SXQG|5.0|Stylistically, the 12 tracks (including the one bonus song) touch onto the turf Bruce Springsteen treaded upon for Darkness on the Edge of Town, but with the added maturity of the 30-plus years as an artist between that release and Working on a Dream.<br /><br />Springsteen worked at a faster pace in writing the music and recording, with the latter being done with the E Street Band during breaks in the 2007-2008 Magic Tour. There is a \\"live\\" freshness to the tracks, with 11 of the 12 clocking between 2:14 (Tomorrow Never Knows) and 4:40 (Queen of the Supermarket), with Outlaw Pete kicking off the album at eight minutes. The Last Carnival is a sequel to Wild Billy's Circus Story, which appeared on The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle (1973).<br /><br />The bonus track is The Wrestler, which won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. The deluxe edition includes a documentary on the making of the album. Already reaching #1 in Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands, it is a strong reminder that \\"The Boss\\" reigns supreme in the craft of creating music.

B000026X5E|5.0|Sparse and dark, Bruce Springsteen delves into the great depression of the soul when unbridled evil grips the mind, economic forces destroy the hearts of hard-working people and the real ramifications of rolling the loaded dice with organized crime.<br /><br />Released in September 1982, the tracks are demos Springsteen recorded on a 4-track cassette recorder. His voice powerfully conveys the bleakness, while his work on acoustic guitar and harmonica are timeless. An electric guitar is only used on Open All Night. The album peaked at #3 on the Billboard chart and the single, Atlantic City (#10), had the best Billboard showing of three songs that were released.<br /><br />This is life when winter never ends, with the Grim Reaper moving swiftly into the picture, while doing a victory dance.
0783225725|4.0|High Noon from Hell. A lean, anarchist, and spooky western. Eastwood's second directorial effort is also one of his best. He's an ex-marshal back from the grave to avenge himself on a corrupt California town and the men who killed him. Or is he? It's wickedly funny too. \\"Let's paint the town red, baby!\\"
B001GCUNVW|4.0|Randy \\"The Ram \\"Robinson\\" is a well past his prime wrestler. He was a big star in the 80's. But now his body is breaking down and he is stuck doing small shows for pocket money. His only friend is an aging stripper named Cassidy. They are similar in some ways, both having jobs based on using their bodies. But, while Cassidy longs for a life of normalcy, Randy is still striving to return to his former \\"greatness\\". Randy also attempts to re-connect with his estranged daughter, Stephanie. But, after a childhood full of broken promises, she is reluctant to allow him back into her life.    After a heart attack, Randy attempts to retire from wrestling and work a regular job at a deli counter. But his self-esteem is so tied up with being \\"The Ram\\" he can't accept just being an ordinary guy living a mundane existence. So he returns for a special 20th anniversary match with his arch enemy from the 80's, a heel named the Ayatollah.    The best parts of this movie were the compelling scenes involving Randy and Cassidy. Both Rourke and Tomei deserve Oscars for their top notch performances. The wrestling matches were also well done and intense. Clearly the director, Darren Aronofsky, knows the wrestling biz and the  inclusion of numerous actual wrestlers made the movie seem more gritty and realistic. But the plot itself is rather basic, essentially it's the character study of a man so obsessed with his former glory that he is willing to kill himself to get back in the limelight. It's a well made movie for what it is. But the story is not quite on the same level as the acting and therefore a little disappointing based on my very high expectations.
B000MRA5NS|3.0|Every ten years or so, the producers behind the James Bond movies get an itch to re-invent the entire genre; and `yes' the Bond films are far beyond a mere film franchise - they are, in fact, a genre onto themselves. This genre, which by now includes The Bourne films, Mission Impossible, and stuff like Alias and Austin Powers, is complete with a clear set of tropes and clich&eacute;s that can be referenced, tweaked, and altered to create a new-yet-familiar effect that every genre thrives upon.<br /><br />Up to this point the Bond pictures have generally kept their re-inventions fairly conservative; adjusting the tone to fit the strengths of their changing leading men, while keeping the Bond character basically still. Unlike most other film series, the Bond films each exist individually, not really following or even referencing the previous installments (with just a few exceptions). Bond, an established and self-contained character, simply enters each film, kills the bad guys, bangs the ladies, and saves the day. By their very nature, every Bond film is the first and the last Bond film.<br /><br />That's probably why Casino Royale, (Bond 21) feels so different. After more than 40 years since Sean Connery uttered the immortal words \\"Bond, James Bond\\" - and changed our perception of screen masculinity - 007 gets an origin story. Does it work?  Well frankly, Casino Royale left me a bit puzzled. I loved some aspects of the plot and the conceit itself is intriguing, but the film is unevenly paced, and its structure and tone is all over the place.<br /><br />Daniel Craig has been given the most leeway since Connery, to create an original character; he doesn't just step into the role of Bond, he gets to build it from scratch. His Bond doesn't start as the Bond we know, but he's supposed to be the Bond we know, by the end. And this is the film's biggest problem; we go to see a 007 film, but instead we get a film about a guy who's trying to become 007. By the end, I was basically ready to see the next film, the one in which Bond is Bond, but I really wasn't itching to have more of Casino Royale. Craig is a good actor, but he's not the most charismatic Bond (I'd put him behind Bronsnan) and his physical appearance is so un-Bond-like, he constantly has to overcome his own lack of suave. Blonde, short, and noticeably Cockney, Craig is the most miscast Bond ever. But what he lacks in looks, he makes up for in sheer physicality; this guy can probably beat up Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan all at the same time. And the action scenes, most being fairly organic fights and chases, really cook. This is where Casino Royale is at its best. There's a foot chase early in the film that's one of the best action sequences ever in a Bond film; and that's saying something. There's also a scene that's very reminiscent of Raiders Of the Lost Ark (to the point of rip-off really) that still manages to be quite satisfying. Through all this, Craig bleeds and sweats more than all the previous Bonds combined; this guy is physical to the max. And it's during these action scenes that his Bond is most effective.<br /><br />But by the middle of act two, the film settles into the casino showdown with villain Le Chiffre (Madds Mikkelsen), and things get a bit stiff. There's a crucial romance with fellow agent, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) that should have felt stronger; the chemistry between these two is fairly mild. The poker showdown is nothing groundbreaking, though I do understand why they substituted Texas Hold-Em for the Baccarat of the novel; poker is more confrontational. But the competition is presented in separate `rounds' (in an apparent homage to Cincinatti Kid) and it creates a jarring stop-and-go affect that doesn't serve the film's pacing. Then things get downright gruesome as Bond gets tortured (not threatened, but really tortured), then recuperates (seriously... there's several hospital scenes) and then ... Casino Royale just kind of fizzles out. Sure, there'sa sort of afterthought action finale, but it's both unspectacular and bizarrely referential to Moonraker, one of the worst Bond films ever. Then there's a coda that finally gives us the Bond we know and love for literally a second and... roll end credits. This left me with the burning question: couldn't they have given us what we came for just a bit earlier? I mean, the film is well over two hours long! Can't we have both a radical re-invention and a satisfying comfort food that one expects from a Bond film? Or at least how about a movie that has a consistent tone from beginning to end. I know it's a tough mission, but certainly not an impossible one. Maybe next time.e, but it's both unspectacular and bizarrely referential to Moonraker, one of the worst Bond films ever.

B00005JN2Z|5.0|Nobody's perfect, but it's hard to go wrong with a Michael Mann-directed film, especially when it's a crime movie.    Although this isn't the quality of his 1995 \\"Heat,\\" it wasn't far behind in its ability to interest and entertain the viewer while providing some slick visuals.    Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are the stars of the film, Foxx winning an Academy Award. No offense to him, but I found Cruise better. He was just outstanding in here as the immoral hit-man. Foxx was entertaining, too, as the nerd-ish cab driver who is pulled into Cruise's murdering adventures.    You'll appreciate both of these guys, and the great visuals, more on the second viewing after you are familiar with the story. The intense film is definitely worth more than one look. Check out the behind-the-scenes documentary, too. You'll be glad you are not an actor in one of Mann's films.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|A song kept playing in my head while I watched Children Of Men: David Bowie's Five Years. You know the one? It's the first track off the Ziggy Stardust album and it's about the release of the news that the human race was dying off. No nuclear war, no asteroids, no alien invasions... just a prosaic, species-wide extinction and what it means psychologically to one man.<br /><br />This, in a nutshell, is the setting of Alfonso Cuaron's unsettling satire/drama/sci-fi/action movie. But unlike the Bowie song, the human race in Children Of Men has more that just five years left; just the rest of their lives.  See, the human species has suddenly and mysteriously become infertile; the last child was born 18 years ago. And since then, everything's gone to hell.  Crime, terrorism, violence, and state repression have spun completely out of control to create a world that's totally realistic, completely plausible, and.... exactly like our own. And this may be the films biggest flaw. The world really has gone to hell and everything in Children Of Men is so current that from a sci-fi perspective, it's like shooting fish in a barrel. On top of that it's relentless pessimism just doesn't overpower its bleak worldview; which is probably why it didn't do much business or see any love on Oscar nigh. It's a very good film that never quite transcends it's own vision.<br /><br />Yet, I'll still put Children Of Men among the top of the films of '07 (I didn't catch it until `07). Cuaron has crafted a movie that's joyously in love with the art of the movies, that weaving an incredibly depressing story that's essentially about hopelessness. Scenes are laid out in long, meticulously choreographed takes that draw you into the action and the characters. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who's inspired tricks allow much of the techniques to be so effective, must be given much credit here. Yet the look of the film is anything but slick and `beautiful', it's rough and drab (which is probably why Lubezki failed to win the Oscar he so deserved). Overall though, Children Of Men is a work of a confident director who understands how to grab the audience and control their emotions with perfect efficiency.<br /><br />The central character arc is powerful and Clive Owen is awesome as a man who's almost dead on the inside. It's one of the films best elements to watch him come back to life as the story progresses. One of my favorite moments:  Owen's Theo, who's been walking around in a half-drunken daze for the first few minutes of the film, just survived a terrible tragedy and stumbles alone into the woods. He fumbles for a cigarette and then collapses with loss, horror and a shadow of joy that he's still capable of any emotion. It's a great scene and a truly great lead performance in a very difficult role; Theo is a character who internalizes everything. He's not showy, and Owen pulls it off in a way that would make Bogart proud. I mention Bogart because Children Of Men has a classic quality; and a quiet sadness that you used to see in Hollywood films of the `40s and `50s like The Setup and Out Of The Past.  I just don't know if its `currency' and bleakness will help it stand the test of time.win the Oscar he so deserved).

He's not showy, and Owen pulls it off in a way that would make Bogart proud. I mention Bogart because Children Of Men has a classic quality; and a quiet sadness that you used to see in Hollywood films of the `40s and `50s like The Setup and Out Of The Past.  I just don't know if its `currency' and bleakness will help it stand the test of time.

6304698682|3.0|Another remake of Shane. Clint Eastwood tries to use the supernatural angle from High Plains Drifter to far lesser success. Clint is a butt-kicking preacher inexplicably defending a small mining community from an evil corporation. The film has a great visual feel, but its predictability proves too tough to overcome. Watchable, but ultimately, the weakest of the four Eastwood-directed westerns.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|Short Attention Span Summary:<br /><br />1. Frank Lucas works for the chief black gangster in Harlem. Chief gangster dies, and Frank works his way up to the chief position.<br /><br />2. He goes to Vietnam and establishes a rapport with direct producers of heroin.<br /><br />3. As a result of the purity of his product, he is able to undercut the competitors and take over a very large section of the drug trade in New York and New Jersey.<br /><br />4. Many cops are on the take, but there is one honest cop who gets chosen to head a task force to take down the drug trade.<br /><br />5. The drug empire duly collapses and it is found out that 3/4 of the cops in the New York DEA were on the take.<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />1. This is an excellent film. The attention to detail was just great (the costumes and whole way of recreating the period of the 70s).<br /><br />2. The soundtrack was also very good.<br /><br />3. The black accents in this film (of the characters who were not black) were laughable. Do you know anyone who talks that way? I don't.<br /><br />4. It was also interesting that the movie listed Chiang Kai Shek's KMT (Kuomintang) was in Thailand (??).<br /><br />5. One also wonders: If Frank Lucas killed people, why didn't he end up getting put in prison for the murders as well as the drugs? One of the murders he did was in broad daylight in front of God and anyone else who cared to look. Was he really that cool that no one would notice?<br /><br />Overall, this was well worth the price of a new DVD.
B001AQR3E4|4.0|Anne Rice's masterpiece brought to the screen in a surprisingly faithful, even reverential manner. The novel's tragic tone and unsettling philosophy are all here, wonderfully directed by Neil Jordan. This probably explains why the film was such a huge box-office disappointment despite Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. A good film that even manages to overcome the monumental miscasting of its lead characters. Yet one can't help but wonder what other actors could have accomplished in these roles.
0140177396|5.0|I used to have a considerable classroom library (I have since switched schools and there is no Silent Sustained Reading program at the new school) and I always would hand this book to any kid that said he or she hated reading and \\"there's nothing good to read.\\" I had a hard time keeping this book on the shelves and since I had an \\"honor system\\" check out plan this book kept on disappearing on me since the students seemed to have felt it was worth keeping and I had to make runs to the local used book store to re-stock it.<br /><br />But, I hadn't read it in a while so I decided to see if it was still one of my favorites.<br /><br />If anything, this book is more powerful than it was before. The loss at the end is more powerful, both the loss with Lennie and with the loss of a dream. Themes abound, such as the loss of the American Dream, loneliness, friendship and the responsibilities of friendship. Perhaps, even some religious themes with all of the events starting on a Friday and ending on a Sunday.<br /><br />But, all of that would be pointless if the story were not well-written and poignant. It's short length only serves to heighten the power of the story.<br /><br />One of the best American novels. Period.
B000AARKOO|3.0|David Desser, one of my favorite college film professors used to say that Ridley Scott is incapable of making a bad film. And I tend to agree with him. But with Kingdom Of Heaven, Scott comes pretty close. Not a bad film, per se, but certainly a major disappointment; a film more concerned with political correctness than dramatic impact or cohesive ideas.<br /><br /> Orlando Bloom stars as Bailin, a French blacksmith who, shortly after the loss of his wife, discovers that he is heir to the estate of a crusading nobleman (Liam Neesen). Appearantly the old man wants to bond with his bastard son, and Bailin finds himself following his dad to the Holy Land. Adventure and war ensues; noble deeds abound; and Bailin meets Saladin and his own glorious destiny. Sounds straight forward enough, but there are some major problems here.<br /><br /> First of all Bloom has virtually no character at all. We're supposed to believe he's driven by some idealistic notion instilled in him by his father (who he knew all of two days it seems like), but Bloom outside of looking sad and thoughtful conveys very little. He looks dashing enough in his medieval garb, but we're supposed to believe that his \\"quality\\" is instantly obvious to every man, woman, and child he meets; I certainly didn't see it. It's funny that Bloom is being hailed as the modern day Errol Flynn. For my money, he'd be wise to watch some of Flynn's films to see what charisma looks like. Flynn's heroes had personality and humor; their `nobility' was a characters trait, not the whole character, as is the case with Bailin.<br /><br /> Problem two; Bailin's story arc is frankly ridiculous. This guy goes from being a peasant blacksmith to being the King of Jerusalem in a period of a couple of months. I'm no slave to historical accuracy, but come on! On top of that, there's a point in the film when Bailin's \\"nobility\\" leads to the most idiotic decision in film history, and results in the surrender of Jerusalem and the deaths of thousands. How are we supposed to identify with a hero this dumb? I certainly couldn't.<br /><br /> The film's biggest problem though is conceptual. Kingdom Of Heaven bends over backwards to show us how wonderful Saladin and his Muslim warriors were, but by doing that, the film lacks real conflict. Saladin's saintly nobility begs the question of why Bailin opts to fight him in the first place. If all he wants is to negotiate terms of surrender, as he says at one point, why not just ask Saladin for terms instead of wasting hundreds of lives? This makes no sense, specially in the light of Bailin's humanistic pronouncements (there are about forty of them in this film and they are all utterly anachronistic).<br /><br /> Having said that, I have all the respect in the world for Ridley Scott's direction. He's the only guy working who seems to have any feel for historical drama. There are beautiful moments in the film; Bailin's battle with four Templar assassins and the overhead shot of a chaotic final battle to protect the City are both brilliant. But Kingdom Of Heaven (in this theatrical version) is fatally compromised. It's a film about history's most brutal religious wars that completely sidesteps religion. The fact is, whatever other factors drove the Crusades, religious fanaticism - both Christian and Muslim - was the key to the whole bloody adventure. And any film that doesn't have the balls to make an honest stand on this key point, is doomed to insignificance and banality.<br /><br />The studio forced Ridley Scott to cut a whole hour of the sprawling epic, and this basically destroyed the film's integrity. Thankfully, Scott seems to be one of the few directors in Hollywood who has the pull to 're-visit' his old films and release them on DVD in a form that he finds satisfactory. And while I'm often critical of re-editing existing art, in this case the second-guessing is both justified and well worth the effort. The Director's cut of Kingdom Of Heaven is so much better than the theatrical cut, it basically represents another film altogether. Addressing almost every problem I had, this 3-hour version is thoughtful, exciting and genuinely epic. And though it's still hard to categorize Orlando Bloom's performance as a success, it's filled out in ways that certainly give his character motivation and gravity he was so sorely missing before. Of course, the real star here is Ridley Scott and his amazing visual style and attention to period detail; given room to breathe, the film delves into plot-points and ideas that work to shore up gaping holes in the narrative that essentially destroyed the theatrical cut.  Kingdom Of Heaven, in this new version, is a film that engulfs you in it's beauty and majesty and demands to be re-evaluated. It's a terrific film!sents another film altogether.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|Here's the conventional wisdom regarding the Batman film franchise: Sometime in the late 80s, Tim Burton made a brilliant masterpiece from the Batman mythology, followed it with an equally impressive Batman Returns, then left the franchise in the hands of Joel Shoemacker, who proceeded to give Batman nipples, a sidekick and tons of neon.  The audience rebelled; the lucrative franchise died.<br /><br />Here's how I see it: The franchise was crap from the very beginning! Tim Burton had a vision, granted. But it was a vision that had nothing to do with Batman. The first film had some admirable art direction and some memorable moments, but it's no more a definitive portrayal of Batman than the `60s TV series was. Why? Because Burton didn't care about delving into the dark psyche of his main character, choosing instead to focus on the operatic villains and the mise en scene. I'll even go out on a limb here and defend Joel Shoemacker (one time only!) and say that Batman Forever was closer to a real Batman movie than either of the Burton films because it, at least, made some small effort to deal with the motivations behind Bruce Wayne's obsession.  And don't even get me started on the casting. Michael Keaton is a wonderful actor, but Batman. Come on!  Slight, un-athletically built, and wearing a hairpiece that somebody swiped from the set of TJ Hooker, Keaton didn't sell being Bruce Wayne, and Bruce Wayne is the key to the whole thing.<br /><br />Well kids, that's where Batman Begins gets it just right. Christopher Nolan's low-key, realistic take on the mythology is a lesson on how to reinvent a franchise; First, throw out everything that came before and start fresh. Second hire a writer who knows something about the character (David Goyer, in this case). Next, cast it right. Finally, stick with what's important - your main character's story arc. The concept here is deceptively simple; how did young Bruce Wayne work up to becoming Batman?  And unlike so many superhero origins, this horse has not been beaten to death. In fact Batman Begins benefits greatly from being able to craft a new take on the events leading up to Bruce putting on the cowl for the first time. I've read my share of Batman comics; but the first act of the film is phenomenally fresh and inventive. Managing to be both familiar and utterly original at the same time.<br /><br />As the film progresses, something even more interesting happens; the whole thing gets smarter, deeper, even more engaging. The film keeps deconstructing Batman; his past, his motivations, his psychology... and then reconstructs him fresh. So - for example - we don't simply get cool gadgets, we get the concept behind the gadgets, how they work, why they look the way they do. This is both clever and interesting. Batman Begins also benefits greatly from a wonderful cast: Liam Neesen, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Gary Oldman, and the great Michael Caine. Wow! And nobody here is just collecting a paycheck either; the performances are great across the board. One of my favorite scenes is between little Bruce and Oldman as Jim Gordon. Bruce's parents were just murdered; he's in shock and the only kindness he gets is the look on one cop's face. That look, folks, is worth the price of admission alone, and it perfectly exemplifies the level of acting and drama in this film.  And, of course, most of it would fail if Bruce Wayne himself was not brilliantly rendered by Christian Bale. This is, bar none, the best lead performance in a comic book based film, ever (sorry Chris Reeve)! Bale is smart, brooding, and deep. There are levels upon levels to his character and as those levels are peeled back, we grow to relate to a man who, frankly, is difficult to relate to. And when he puts on the Bat suit, Bale is scary. That's right, really scary the way Batman is supposed to be. And that's the way the action is handled too: things happen mostly in shadow with lightening speed. This is both true to the comics and dramatically potent. Batman is a night creature who uses stealth and misdirection and this film is the first to capture that on screen.<br /><br />There are minor problems here: some logic holes in the plot and some action set pieces are less than spectacular. For my money too, the romance between Bruce and Katie Holmes is bit dull. But these are minor qualms and every weakness is countered by consistent brilliance. Not everything works, but the important things do. You believe in Wayne, you believe in Batman, and you buy the whole thing. Kudos to Nolan, David Goyer and the cast and crew.

0061148512|5.0|Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiographical novel begins the first half with an uncannily similar  introspective caustic awareness of Holden Caulfield - [[ASIN:0316769177 The Catcher in the Rye]] - and ends with a tranquil and disturbingly pathetic prisoner of mental illness who resembles Susanna Kaysen - [[ASIN:0679746048 Girl, Interrupted]].<br /><br />The beginning accounts for a young talented writer who wins an award in college to work for a fortnight in New York and hob nob with literary greats while witnessing the operations of a media magazine mogul. Life was free and very good to the protagonist - Esther Greenwood.<br /><br />Then Esther shrinks and defies comradery and eerily succumbs to a mental illness that most cannot relate to - as most are lucky enough to be immune to such disease.  And, to Plath's credit, Esther does not deliver an account pleading for your sympathy.  Instead, Plath describes in the first person what she perceives - awkward to the sane reader, but amazingly enlightening.<br /><br />Malcolm Lowery won great praise for his dipsomaniac's perspective in [[ASIN:0061120154 Under the Volcano]] - where words plastered on the beginning pages read as though the typist either could not formulate a sentence, or was as impaired as the protagonist. By reading pages of the blundering but decipherable prose, Lowery made the reader feel the torment of the drunkard's demise.  In this book, where the prose is not  nearly as difficult as that by Lowery (in fact the writing is exceptionally good), the reader is taken to experience what Plath calls the Bell Jar. This book teaches without being didactic.<br /><br />Before reading this novel, I fondly looked upon bell jars - the  glass covers used to protect flowers.  They tickled pleasant and fond memories of nature and its beauty. But, to Plath, a bell jar is something much more than a cover to adorn. Even if she received the greatest gift from anyone, she writes that she could not appreciate it as \\". . . I would be sitting under the same glass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.\\"  And this haunting life discouraged her and made her want to avoid becoming a fusty old mare. She continually would worry because \\". . . I wasn't sure . . . [that] somewhere, anywhere - the bell jar , with its stifling distortions. . . wouldn't descend again. . .\\" And, in real life they did.<br /><br />Not hidden amid this novel are feminist tones - not undertones.  Great details about not marrying, not having children, and fighting men who almost rape good girls like Esther to do the \\"act\\" exist in this book.  And, in the end after having virgin-ending sex, she experiences what the doctor says \\"only one in a million\\" experience - severe unending hemorrhaging. Men are not good for much - even in that respect.<br /><br />Having lived in the novel's backdrop, and being an avid lover of J.D. Salinger's deprecating words in young man's jargon about the privileged of New York, I felt shrouded in nostalgia when reading this novel.  This book brought me to places and literature I admire. This book took me back in time in a comfortable way - irrespective of the topic which I rarely include in conversation or thought.  Plath is, in my biased opinion, as important a voice of the early sixties as those who preceded her by only a matter of few years - the [[ASIN:1560257423 Beat Generation]].<br /><br />This novel deserves its praise, and it is certainly our misfortune that the author died at a young age with only one published novel.ass bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.\\"  And this haunting life discouraged her and made her want to avoid becoming a fusty old mare.

B00005MP58|2.0|I think I'm the only person in the world who didn't like this version of P & P because of the annoying look on Jennifer Ehle's face for hours on end. She wore a contemptuous, pinched, uptight little smile throughout the entire miniseries (okay, I admit that I didn't watch the whole thing because I had to turn it off due; however, I can't imagine that that \\"look\\" went away--it seemed firmly entrenched.) It reminded me of that squinty-eyed, tight smile that Renee Zellweger sometimes sports, but much more annoying! It made the series unwatchable for me, even though I adore Jane Austen. I think that a lead actress should have more range, especially in a lengthy miniseries, and that she should seem \\"Elizabethan\\" (not Church Ladyesque).

Gladwell's suggestion that luck and practice contribute to achieving the pinnacle of success and Sir Ken's suggestions for how to increase the likelihood of that happening (through discovery and exposure that might help one discover what they might want to put 10,000 hours of practice into) make for something a lot greater than an interesting read.

0439023483|5.0|I really really like this book. I mean really. It is not the most stunning and emotionally wrenching thing I've ever read, but it deserves a 5-star nonetheless. I am a teenage girl, and there were parts of it that most definitely were aimed at my age and gender, but for some reason boys like the Twilight books so I wouldn't be surprised at all if my male friends liked this book as well. It is pure YA: no moody, complex reflection on the human condition, just fast-paced storytelling that leaves the thinking to the reader. It is written to make you want to turn the next page, and frankly there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.     Collins made an extremely complex character believable. Katniss is straightforward, yet knows how to lie and double-cross, she is a hardhearted survivor who goes mushy at the sight of nasty cuts and has a soft spot for children. Ultimately, Katniss is a young girl thrown into a heartless world, and she adapted while still retaining the ability to love. Selling that character is a remarkable bit of writing.    About the love in this book: it was refreshing to see a girl heroine who isn't obsessed with love. She obviously has some feelings for Peeta and Gale, but she really isn't too torn up about lying to Peeta to win the games, and she doesn't really think about Gale until he comes up paranthetically. Her reaction to her difficult love dilemma isn't \\"Oh Gale! O Peeta! Oh what shall I do?\\" but rather \\"Oh. That. Whatever, survival first.\\" The typical roles were reversed, the woman fought for her life and protected her beloved while the man blundered about, messing things up, attempting heroism, and following his lady like a puppy. I love Peeta, he's vulnerable and sweet yet determined and tough (for a city boy), but he is absolutely not the dominant force in that relationship. In fact, it's almost a complete role reversal of the most popular of all teen love stories, the Twilight novels.     About the things other than love: fantastic suspense, exciting adventure, and a futuristic world that is only a few disturbingly small steps from ours. Some futuristic worlds are highly doubtable: the world is not going to go up in flames, nor will Vulcans fall out of the stars and help the earthlings create a happy, peaceful United Planets sort of deal where the people who resist having civilization shoved down their throats are hunted down by the ruthlessly diplomatic Captain Picard and his cleanly dressed crew on a disturbingly snazzy and well-armed ship. I know, I know, I want replicators and phasers to exist too, but that is a rather unlikely future for humankind. But Panem, a dog-eat-dog (more like teenage-girl-eat-dog-rabbit-squirrel-and-whatever-else-she-deosn't-feed-to-her-starving-family)world, ruled by a sickly materialistic and ruthless capitol whose inhabitants are clueless to its corruption while the rest of their world starves...not so unrealistic.     SPOILER: A thought for the future of the series. Why was there nothing of Katniss's father left to bury? Why did Cinna ask for District 12? Who is the redheaded girl and why was the Capitol chasing her? Just a thought. I think this book - The Hunger Games - will be to the rest of the series what the Hobbit is to the Lord of the Rings series. A self-contained beginning that serves a piece of an even bigger puzzle. I'm very excited.

I am more that satisfied at this wonderful set, and the best part you watch these over and over again.  Jane Seymour is a wonderful actress, to me watching these again is just like renewing an old friendship.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|blu-ray is great.  if you like action and blood, this is the movie for you.
B001O6W9QC|2.0|I would say that I am a Ben Stiller fan but I was not very impressed. The best thing about this movie was Robert Downey Jr., that was good acting and good make-up. My kids are still haunted by the panda bear scene, HA! HA! I would say that I liked the Love Guru and Zohan better, what does that tell you about 2008's year of comedies.
B001N44BVQ|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Leonardo Dicaprio is way overrated as an actor; and I can't say that I am fan of Russell Crowe. The story is the same garbage that only Hollywood knows how to waste time and money on. This film is not worth five stars. I am sorry that I had to give it at least one star.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I am not a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I found myself captivated by this film, and even forgetting that I was watching Mr. DiCaprio, but watching Howard Hughes...a testament I begrudgingly must give to Mr. DiCaprio and his abilities as an actor.  He captured the man that was Howard Hughes; his visions, his incredible effect upon aviation, an insight into his life and what he became, how he began, and his utter brilliance.  This movie runs an amazing 170 minutes long, and one finds himself wishing it lasted even longer...I don't think I can say that about a single movie I've ever seen!  An added bonus...you get the second disc which has the History Channel's bio on Hughes...what a wonderful surprise addition to this set!  If you have not seen this movie, drop everything and rush out to rent it, buy it, borrow it, whatever you can do to see it.      Donn Kean
076790592X|3.0|I read this book in two sittings.      And although I really enjoyed the book, I find it hard to give it 5 stars for a few reasons.    1.  It is way too brief.  An entire Tuesday spent talking about \\"family\\" is summed up in only four pages, and of those four pages, a majority of the content is spent describing the suffering Morrie is going through and his current condition, and not really anything about family.    2.  It is too simple.  As some others have mentioned, perhaps the reason this book is so popular is because EVERYONE can read it.  A good thing, yes, but it's also a bit boring for those of us who enjoy some depth to the books we read.  No, I'm not trying to be snobbish here.  I just felt the whole time that I was reading a book I read for a 5th grade reading assignment, and was told to pick out the plot and the theme.  I was left wanting more depth, hoping the author or Morrie would delve deeper into the topics they cover.    3.  Morrie's \\"greatest lessons in life\\" really aren't that great.  I am left thinking, that if such things as simple as \\"Love other people\\" and \\"stay in contact with your family\\" and \\"don't let your problems control you\\" are really seen as such profound and life-changing concepts by the thousands that have rated this book 5 stars, what have we come to?  To me, these things should be common sense.  Yes, it's good to be reminded of them, but the fact that this book has \\"changed lives\\" scares me a bit.

B001P5HI4A|5.0|At the time this movie was released I knew all the lyrics. This movie came at a time of my life when I came out of the closet, my mother had heart bypass surgery and the name Streisand represented the Ultimate Superstar and still is in my opinion. Needless to say I was also excited yet disappointed when I received the email saying that Amazon was sorry but Yentl the single disc would not be available and actually more shocked at the rate it was going to go for. Yentl will remain a classic, nominated for Oscars but only winning one for the music. Yentl not only is a fantastic movie it made me proud of my heritage. Barbra is fabulous and I can't wait until I can watch this dvd. Streisand represents alot to me from her fabulous voice to her long nails, but Streisand has been a tremendous influence in my politics. Often people are shunned when they speak their minds, strange isn't it. That those with opposing views get air time on Fox. Streisand is a treasure and I value her being a strong voice in Hollywood and the world. Thank you Barbra, Finally your Yentl will give the world pleasure.
B00004U28G|5.0|This picture opened in theaters every in the country on June 19 1981 starring Burt Reynolds as JJ McClure, Dom Deluise as Victor Prinizim, Farrah Fawcett as Pamela Glover, Dean martin as Jamie Blake, Sammy Davis Jr. as Morris Fenderbaum, Jack Elam played the doctor, The Gorgeous Adrienne Barbeau as Marcie Thatcher, Lamborghini Babe #1 The Lovely Tara Buckman as Jill Rivers, Lamborghini Babe #2, along with Terry Bradshaw, Mel Tills, and Jamie Farr as the Sheik. This movie was about a bunch of people who wanted to race in the Cannonball Run a Race that went from New York to California and the first one to stamp there card wins the prize. Let's start with the drivers as they arrived at the hotel where the Cannonball Race will stat. There's Marcie Thatcher and Jill Rivers riding around the highways going 220 MPH and spraying traffic and speed limit signs. Then you got JJ McClure and Victor who are also in this race. Victor and JJ are trying to figure out what kind of vehicle they need to win this race. So JJ can think first they go riding in an airplane, landing the in the middle of town in order to get beer. Next they go boat riding, only to crash and both JJ and Victor and up in an ambulance. JJ asks the doctor how far away is the hospital and he was told about 15 miles. But they were also told it would only take 5 minutes because with an ambulance you can go in and out of traffic with no one bothering to stop you. So they look at each other and laugh as they continue to fly through traffic. Next you got Jamie Blake and Morris Fendebaum who are dress like priest but they sure don't act like one. So everyone one is at the hotel having a party the night before the race starts. That's when JJ discovers Pamela Glover a very young and beautiful girl who happens to like trees. As JJ is trying to talk to Pamela he is interrupted by Victor who wants to talk about the doctor.   JJ tells Victor that they need a doctor to ride in the ambulance so right before the race starts Victor finds Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing but JJ doesn't want to know where in found this doctor. So while the race has started, and JJ realizes that that they don't have a patient for in back of the ambulance. So as there going down the road they come upon and accident where Pamela Glover is standing when JJ and Victor pull up. Pamela ask if they will help the young man and so JJ opens the door, get Pamela Glover inside and Victor takes of leaving the man behind. As there going down the highway a New Jersey State Trooper has his lights on stopping the ambulance. Inside the doctor has given Pamela laughing gas to make it look like she really sick. The girls had a few tricks of the own. You see they would go down the states highways like a bat out of hell only to get pulled over by State Troopers. They were both wearing one piece suits so they open up the zipper show a little and the State Troopers would let them go every time. Who wins this race? Where does Captain Chaos come into play? How many of them get caught and don't finish the race?  Here are some thoughts of my own on this movie. I thought the plot and the comedy of this movie was great from beginning to end. However, I bought this movie because of Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman and I sure once disappointed. They walked around in those tight spandex and they were looking real good. Based on that and the great comedy I have no problem giving this movie 10 weasel stars.
0671004107|4.0|Many are the people who, for some existential reason, seem to find peace, or an ideal environment for contemplation, while gazing upwards on a clear night.  So vast, so unknown, yet, as far as we know, so, so empty.  It just boggles the mind that there can be such a waste of space.  Not surprising that such a vacuum has drawn a whole lot of fictitious accounts to fill it up.  Carl Sagan's foray into fiction, CONTACT is, truth be told, a rather enjoyable contribution to that library, giving us a very readable story about mankind's first encounter with an alien species.      One big reason that CONTACT works is that Sagan interweaves several elements at once.  Unlike many genre books (and I think especially sci fi) Sagan does not focus so heavily on the fantastical storyline that character development gets short thrift.  The story of man's first encounter with the little green men converges nicely with character development, with neither really overshadowing the other.    The same is true for the scientific features of CONTACT.  Not so dense as to be beyond the average lay reader, not so sophomoric as to flunk the giggle test, Sagan presents enough science here to live up to the 'science' part of the fiction, but avoids laying it on too thick.  Most people with enough intellectual curiosity to pick this novel up should have what it takes to 'get it' and not wind up all befuddled (and I say this as a non-scientist).    Sagan does, unfortunately, throw in some social criticism that does not hold up very well and which can come off as a tad condescending.  Several mentions are made comparing the advanced civilization and knowledge of the aliens to our own.  No surprise ours is paltry by comparison.  Yet Sagan includes man's economic systems in with such comparisons.  But economics, unlike mathematics, physics, etc. is a social science, based upon the psychology of humans.  Comparisons on this point fall flat and remind one of those 'which one doesn't belong' types of assessment tests.    Although not overtly hostile to religion, Sagan does portray it as buffoonish, and, like many scientists, attempts to portray the religious as antagonistic to science.  Although this stereotype may have a kernel of truth, it is, to a large extent, false and an example of people (in this case scientists) believing their own propoganda about others.  Again, though, it's not so heavy handed as to sideline the story.    In terms of genre fiction, I usually prefer crime stories to sci fi.  But a simple truth holds for both - there is an awful lot of poor writing, two-dimensional characters, and stories so ridiculous that it makes one's eyes roll of their own volition.  Separating the wheat from the chaff is a task unto itself, but CONTACT makes the cut.
B001EO748M|5.0|Not only is this show well done, but I love the fashions worn from this era. I just could not wait to see who was going to step out in what next.    The cast especially Jonathan Rhys Meyes were them like regal superstars.    I wish we dressed like that today. I live in San Diego and would still try to wear them.     The costume designer did a wonderful job on these creations they must have cost a fortune!!

It certainly gave us viewers and critics some things to think about from that period in time and the differences we may read or hear about or from what we saw to what we read.  The scenery and settings were awesome as well.  Thanks for the entertainment and the enjoyment it bought to our household.

It's only when the real ending, from the meeting at the castled to the end, starts up, that the book picks up it's lost momentum and comes to an interesting and satisfying close.
B00030590I|5.0|\\"Hero\\" is a visually stunning and philosophically profound parable on the relationship between violence and power. It is one of the very few movies that achieves a remarkable fusion between the philosophical ideas underlying the narrative and the visual language that is used to recreate it before our eyes.<br /><br />Below I am going to recount the philosophical backbone to the plot in some detail so I would advise those who would like to give themselves the opportunity to unravel the ideas on their own not to read further until they have seen the movie.<br /><br />It all starts with a king who ruthlessly wages war to conquer neighbouring people. His brutal expansionism breeds hatred and resentment in those that have been subjugated to his rule. Three masters of the sword - Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword - unite to kill the tyrant. Their attempts remain unsuccesful. Then they are joined by a fourth master - Nameless - who persuades them to join in a plot combining cunning and force to murder the king.<br /><br />The first part of the movie is only an introduction to the central point at issue. After his alleged victory over the three plotters, Nameless is invited to the royal palace. He is allowed to come within ten paces of the monarch. Later we will learn that Nameless has been training for 10 years to unfailingly kill from that position. So at that point the king is virtually dead. Nothing can technically stop Nameless to take his life.<br /><br />The king asks him details about the way he has defeated his opponents. He is not satisfied by the account that Nameless offers him and recognises the deadly intentions of his guest. The King then recounts an alternative version of the sequence of events that has led Nameless to his palace. It is in reply to this version that Nameless introduces the central issue.<br /><br />It appears that a previous assault on the palace by Flying Snow and Broken Sword was unsuccessful because of the deliberate refusal of Broken Sword to kill the king when he was in the position to do so. Indeed Broken Sword has withdrawn from the plan to murder the King, which is a bone of contention with his partner Flying Snow who is still very much committed to the cause. Broken Sword introduces a dilemma in the story: to kill the king or not to kill the king. We learn that he has transcended that dilemma by a long training in the art of calligraphy.<br /><br />Central in the movie is the insight that mastery of the sword can be practiced at three levels: the mastery of sword in the hand (allowing you to unfailingly kill your opponent from ten paces), the mastery of sword in the heart (allowing to kill your opponent with bare hands from 100 paces) and the mastery of sword neither in hand nor heart (which transcends the act of direct killing and conflict by a vision of peace and mercy).<br /><br />Broken Sword is someone who has mastered that highest level. He now sees that sparing the life of the king will at some point lead to a unification of an empire and enduring peace for all. This is a resolution of the dilemma - to kill or not to kill - at a higher level of wisdom. Confronted with Nameless's determination to kill the king, Broken Sword cannot but transfer the dilemma to Nameless. The doubt \\"to kill or not to kill\\" indeed settles in Nameless who is still vacillating when he is standing before the king. The latter recognises this and increases the pointedness of the dilemma by offering Nameless his own sword to kill him. Nameless has to resolve the dilemma there and then. Eventually he decides not to kill.<br /><br />By doing so he transfers the dilemma to the king who now has to decide whether to have his attacker executed or not. He decides to have him killed. That is a very conscious choice. As an individual human being the king has enormous respect for Nameless leap to the highest level of sword mastery (which is why the latter is given the burial of a hero) but as a ruler he has to respect the integrity of the law and the trespasser has to be killed. The law is not able to transcend the dilemma. It is not able to accommodate the everlasting tension between the two horns of the dilemma. That is a deeply philosophical assertion about the nature of institutionalised power and the Law.<br /><br />There is an interesting corollary to this movie. Flying Snow and Broken Sword embody the two horns of the dilemma: to kill vs not to kill. They are waiting for news from Nameless's mission: a red flag for a successful kill, a yellow flag for a failure. When the yellow flag appears, Flying Snow is enraged. She understands that this can only be because Broken Snow's councel has led Nameless to consciously forsake his mission. Broken Sword tries to persuade Flying Snow of his point of view but he can't bring her to consider the dilemma, let alone to transcend it at the higher level of wisdom he has gained. Reluctantly he fights with Flying Snow. From Broken Sword's vantage point the fight is utterly pointless. It draws him again in a quandary he has left behind him a long time ago. At a certain point he just drops his sword, a split second before Flying Snow will hit him with her sword. That split second embodies the desperate trust of Broken Sword in Flying Snow's ability to recognise and transcend the dilemma. Either she does in that split second or she never will. She fails and she kills him. After his death she decides to kill herself.<br /><br />Zhang Yimou tells this magnificent foundational myth in the most splendid and virtuosic fashion. The images are poetic, suggestive and precise. Nothing is gratuitous, everything assumes significance. This is great, timeless cinema.law is not able to transcend the dilemma.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Is this film totally historically accurate? Probably not, but it's intriguing enough to get you to dig into the history yourself. Is it a little hard to keep track of? Yes, the film does jump back and forth in time: but you're given the baseline date at the beginning of the film and with a little knowledge of the history of the times you can keep track of when things are happening. Heaven knows the script gives you enough clues. A rare film. You do have to pay attention. Thank heavens for pause buttons on the remote, though.     There is only one thing I would change. Wilberforce was a devout Evangelical. He was moved to his actions by a deep personal faith. I suspect that rather than saying that \\"all men are created equal\\" as he does in the script that he might have said that \\"all men are created in the image of God.\\" If that is true, then it is the best reason of all for the abolition of slavery then......and now.     And the film is worth watching for one other piece of history. William Pitt the younger still holds the record as the youngest Prime Minister in the history of England. He bacame Prime Minister at the age of 24. One year too young to run for the House in the US. And eleven years to young to run for president. Makes you stop and think.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|I hope that in 30 years someone decides to remake Gran Torino. Hopefully it will be a shot-by-shot remake like 1998's Psycho, or maybe someone tries to do a direct homage to it, or maybe a Japanese remake or didn't they make a Turkish version of Star Wars? I really don't care how they remake it. I just want to prove how masterfully Eastwood breathes life into a story that in wrong hands could be a melodramatic mess, or a bad Sitcom.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a guy missing his decade, he still lives in the home he raised his family in, even though the rest of the neighborhood disappeared years ago. His home is still painted while the homes around him fall apart. The post-war suburban paradise that once was is long gone replaced by gangs, crime, and the Hmong immigrants who have replaced his former white-bread neighbors.<br /><br />Kowalski has lived a life of hard work and maybe a little regret. He's a decorated Korean War Vet, a husband who's just buried his wife, and a father that has lost touch with his sons. Don't get him started on his bratty Grandkids who want him to die so they get his stuff including a sweet 1972 Gran Torino. Kowalski is a man who poured his heart and soul into a country who doesn't need him anymore and a family that is ready to send him off to Boca to die. Everything changes when he catches his neighbor trying to steal his Gran Torino, and he is introduced into a world that just might let him get the redemption he so desperately needs.<br /><br />Eastwood has crafted a beautiful film that is honest. With an approach that is so matter of fact and never over sentimental. In the wrong hands this could translate as boring. Yet Eastwood finds a way to make the film real without boring us. It's funny when it needs to be funny, gripping when it needs to grip, and emotional without being overtly emotional. Kowalski exists in the real world, he's abrasive, he's angry, he drinks, smokes, chews tobacco and has lived long enough to not have that politically correct filter that everyone in my generation was issued at birth. He built the world with his bare hands and wishes that people we're polite, kids respected their elders, and is tired of taking crap from everyone. But it's not because he's a monster and Eastwood instills a warmth in Kowalski that drives the film forward.<br /><br />The supporting cast works because they are real kids. Newcomer Ahney Her deserves notice as Sue, a smart plucky kid that Kowalski aids and Bee Vang hits the right marks as Thao, Sue's brother who Kowalski takes under his wing. Eastwood doesn't ask for gut-wrenching performances from these two kids, only honesty and that's why they work. When the climax hits it's apex Eastwood doesn't ask his cast to react as characters in a movie, but as regular kids.<br /><br />Gran Torino is not what I expected, it's not Dirty Harry meets Grumpy Old Men. It's a powerful film that sneaks up on you and pulls you along. At any moment it could have been shallow, at any moment it could have been melodramatic, and at any moment we could have hated Kowalski. Trust me there is plenty not to like about this guy, but Eastwood shows us his frustrations, and emotions not by acting them out, but by being real and by giving Kowalski a warmth we don't expect.<br /><br />Gran Torino makes me wish I had treasured the moments I could have had with my Grandfather. It also challenges me to reach out even If I don't want to. Gran Torino is not about telling a fake story about redemption, it's about real people with real problems and how they find within themselves the power to take responsibility for their lives and in that they find the strength to overcome what life has dealt them. Gran Torino will not change the world but it may make you look at your fellow man with a little more compassion.ect filter that everyone in my generation was issued at birth.

B001KL3GY0|3.0|Franz Ferdinand dove off the deep end with electronic synthesizers in \\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand,\\" making for some great and disappointing moments.<br /><br />This is still a decent album, nonetheless. Franz Ferdinand still made certain with their singles, \\"Ulysses\\" and \\"No You Girls,\\" that they would still play bass-thumping dance hall rock songs. And the second track, \\"Turn It On,\\" is an especially hot track with jagged guitar riffs and a chorus in which Kapranos and the gang shout \\"Turn it on!\\"<br /><br />The electronics aren't bad either. \\"What She Came For\\" starts with a cool buzz crescendo and a funky synthesizer. The spooky organ in \\"Bite Hard\\" really sets the tone of the album as a fun amusement park of wacky synthesizer sounds. Even the spacey synthesizers in \\"Live Alone\\" make the band sound like a futuristic dance band which would make the Jetsons proud.<br /><br />However, sometimes the electronics just don't sound that good. \\"Send Him Away\\" hardly has any guitars. In the middle of the song, the band breaks into some Afro-Cuban beat with soft guitars that just don't sound great. The funky organ in \\"Can't Stop Feeling\\" sounds a little annoying after a while.<br /><br />Worst of all, the band breaks into a four-minute instrumental with outdated Depeche Mode-style electronics in \\"Lucid Dreams.\\" By the time they pull off another awful electronic song with low-key synths, \\"Dream Again,\\" I was fed up with their act. Franz Ferdinand simply just doesn't sound as edgy as their disco-rock counterparts, Bloc Party and the Arctic Monkeys.<br /><br />Perhaps if Kapranos played more lovely acoustic guitar ballads, such as \\"Katherine Kiss Me,\\" this would be a much better collection. However, Kapranos chose to play with some not-so-great electronics. As a result, Franz Ferdinand's third album is somewhat stale.<br /><br />This is still a decent album. Just prepare for way more electronic synthesizers in \\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand.\\"

B0017R5UAA|5.0|It's pretty rare for me to buy CD's these days, between my current collection and the music available online I am infrequently motivated to shell out the money for a full length CD.  I love every track on this album though and considering it's their first LP, I can only marvel at what is to come.  When a co-worker offered to burn me a copy I actually declined as I felt OBLIGATED to put money into the hands of the guys who actually created this amazing music.  The Sun Giant EP is terrific as well (especially the track Drops in The River) but this album in particular I'd say is something of a pop masterpiece.  Time will tell...

B001LF4IA6|3.0|There are people who expect Bruce to pull out a \\"Born To Run\\" album everytime. It's not going to happen. I wasn't impressed with this one the 1st time listening, but I've given it a few more chances, & it seems to be growing on me. Not great but listenable, with a few songs pretty good. The Wrestler of course is pure Springsteen genius, but others are fairly good. Think of this more as \\"Tracks 2\\" & you won't be dissapointed. Bruce & the rest of us are not 20 years old anymore, so dont expect songs about racing in the streets, or rebelling against others. The thng that makes him stand out is that he is not afraid to turn out albums that aren't replays of his other albums. He is a true artist who continues to create different songs each time out. He doesnt turn out a Rocky 2, 3 4 ,5 etc. That would make him boring after a while. He always continues to surprise us & for the usually he doesnt disappoint. Take this as a lightweight Springsteen album and you will enjoy it for what it is. And for those who say he just wants to make money, obviously he really doesnt care that much since he released this free a week ago on NPR radio, where I'm sure others like me got it for free. But even if I did have to pay for it (& I have bought every album before this) It is still better than other artist's CDs.

When Dexter's foster sister, Deborah, asks for his help catching a serial killer Dexter is torn between his personal desires and the urge to help her.    I really liked the voice of this book.  I was easily pulled through the pages.  The mix of dark humor, confusion with human emotions, and unapologetic need to kill worked for me.  I fell easily into the mind of Dexter and enjoyed my time there.  I think that it is the mark of a skilled writer that I was able to like a character so much when he was clearly a sociopath.  I couldn't help but feel for him even when I was repelled by his actions.    I enjoyed watching Dexter fumble with the emotions of people around him.  Seeing him try to figure out what most normal people know by instinct was very amusing.  I particularly enjoyed his confusion in relation to Rita.  What seemed so obscure to him was obvious and hilarious to me (as well as most readers I'm sure).  I really loved how he was disturbed and confused over what ended up happening with Rita.  The embarrassment and definite yuck feeling was funny, but also kind of sad.    I was faintly disbelieving of Harry's reaction to Dexter.  I mean, the guy was a cop.  I really thought the teaching and honing of his setup and clean up was an odd thing to do.  I don't know, maybe I'm just being idealistic.    I can honestly say that I wasn't expecting the serial killer to be who it turned out to be.  It occurred to me when Deborah and Dexter were watching the video, but I discounted it.  I guess I should have listened to myself.    The ending really bothered me.  What happened exactly?  How did that get resolved with all the cops?  What happened in that final moment before it skipped to the last chapter?  It's bugging me that I don't know.  Hopefully it's covered in the next book.  I'll definitely be buying it.  I can't wait to see how Dexter's story continues.
0064430170|5.0|My daughter, who is 23 now, still talks about this book and when she was tiny I remember her asking me to read it every night for months on end.  It had a mesmerizing effect on her and helped calm her down for sleep, which as I remember it myself, was always a scary part of the day - a time for darkness and separation. Hence, my fascination with the book.  Too bad my parents didn't read this book to me when I was a child.
B000002513|5.0|A dynamite leap from Springsteen's charming debut, \\"The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle\\" is a rock & roll gem.  It's a glimmering kaleidoscope of organs, pianos, saxophones, bass, guitar, and drums, all led by jive-talking wild man ringleader Springsteen, who has perfected his Van Morrison-after-a-year-in-the-swamp hoot and growl.  Somersaultingly lyrical, breathtaking in its youthful inventiveness, and incessantly energizing, from the raucous opening number to the sweeping romanticism of the nine-minute epic \\"New York City Serenade,\\" \\"The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle\\" is one of rock music's most magnificent achievements.
031606792X|5.0|I had read the first three books when I took a peek at Amazon's ratings and was shocked to see that some fans hated this one. What on earth had gone wrong? Had Edward decided he'd really rather kill Bella, after all? Had she shrugged off her true love for a career in corporate finance? It was with relief and great satisfaction that I read \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and found my favorite characters getting what they wanted most.    Maybe it's because all four books were available when I started the series. There was no long wait in which to come up with my own notion of what would happen next, only to have it conflict with the author's choices. Once a book leaves the writer's hands, it becomes the readers'. Each person filters the story through her own experiences, tastes, desires, etc. Some seem to think a great love story has to end in tragedy. If that were true we wouldn't have the heart to invest in characters and to enjoy the delicious suspense as an \\"impossible\\" love tries to conquer all. Even Shakespeare, creator of the ultimate romantic tragedy, gave most of his lovers their happy ending.    The most baffling criticism to me was that the characters didn't have to sacrifice enough. Excuse me? Were we reading the same story or is sadism the new empathy? Edward's entire life has been about sacrifice and his natural reaction still is to take everyone's problems and responsibilities on himself. In a less colorful way, Bella's had to suppress her own needs and desires, curtailing childhood to prop up her flaky mom and clueless, if lovable, dad - not because she's a victim, but because she genuinely loves them despite their shortcomings. Although she's smart and brave, she's never really had the chance to recognize her own strengths or develop confidence - until she meets Edward, which doesn't exactly spell the end of her troubles. A lot of broken bones and a venomous chomp later, she's still risking everything for the people she loves, finally blowing off an entire \\"normal\\" life just to make things work. Even agreeing to a wedding is a sacrifice from Bella's point of view; her experience has left her suspicious of the whole marriage thing, but she knows what it means to Edward's more Victorian sensibilities, so she goes through with it - for him. Personally, I think there's been more than enough sacrifice from these two; they deserve their reward.    I saw that some readers objected to the baby, but the reason these books have been so successful is that despite the mythical elements, we can identify with the characters' feelings, and for a lot of us the ultimate experience is putting on the earth a new human being who is part you and part the person you love most in the world. I'm glad they got that too. (Not to mention, enduring the world's worst pregnancy ought to put a couple of points on the sacrifice scoreboard for poor Bella.)    Other readers objected to Jacob's imprinting on what's-her-face. (Sorry, I find that name hard to pronounce - even in my head. It could be worse; they could have named her Britney.) I didn't see that coming at all and thought it was a delightful resolution to the Jacob problem, one that was foreshadowed all along.    So I'm grateful to Stephanie Meyer for providing a pay-off that both her characters and at least some of her readers could appreciate. This is a series I'll read again, knowing I won't be disappointed in the end. The course of true love never does run smooth but - at least sometimes - it ends up where it should.
B000024D4R|4.0|Possibly the least pretentious of Pink Floyd's records, \\"Animals\\" is also the only of their concept albums in which the concept doesn't wind up buying the farm.  In other words, \\"Animals\\" is a success: Waters' lyrics are vicious and pointed, the music complements the ugliness of his lyrics, and its punk atmosphere excites at all the points it should.  Historical note: this was their last real (and last great) effort as Pink Floyd before Waters turned the group into puppets; as puppets they performed in Waters' repugnant opera of self-pity, \\"[[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall]].\\"
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I am a total fan and have been waiting to get a DVD of what I have been watching on You Tube for such a long time.  I loved all the out takes.
0143113100|4.0|I am ordering the book now and haven't read it yet but feel compelled to share a thought as this section seems to welcome. The thought? There is an almost universal tendency to see \\"neuroplasticity\\" as a function which just hides out in the brain and does nothing until you've had a stroke or have become otherwise physically impaired. What neuroplasticity actually implies is a NATURE of the brain which is ALWAYS in action--it doesn't perceive your trauma and swoop in like an internal super doctor whose intelligence comes on when you become comatose. To the contrary, it is a nature analogous to muscles where the harder we stress a muscle, it's nature is to slightly tear and repair itself with greater bulk which not only repairs the muscle tear but provides muscle extra new tissue specifically to that area which we have taxed above all others.     In the brain and on a nano-scopic scale, neuroplasticity follows much the same model though \\"tearing\\" the neuron is not likely to be an exactly perfect characterization of what happens. Instead there is a dynamic which science is still not 100% clear on but it seems to work just like this: your neurons have both a part in the cooperative whole which makes up whom you are. But in a sense they also have a second identity--a limited life of their own in which the struggles of some neurons and inter-operating dendrites and other cooperating members like axons perform more work than others based upon what you keep your mind indulged on resolving. When you then sleep and reach the necessary deepest wave sleep patterns, your own natural HGH--human growth hormone is released. Most people immediately take that to imply that their muscles will fill in with new growth and they can thus become somewhat more athletically capable. They don't realize that the HGH also is the agent of growth in the dendrites which link neurons thus resulting in greater intellectual capacity. We haven't gown more brain or bigger brains--we're grown specific reaches of minute wiring to allow the problems we had been try to solve to litterally seem smaller and our ways to encompass them bigger.      Kids and parents seem thrilled enough that junior is earning applause on the playing field and that his physique is improving to make him a good catch for some lucky girl in their eyes. They have no idea that the process can be completely restructured toward achieving some small boost in intellectual capacity from day to day instead of the boost in muscle which everyone can't help but notice. But within mastering the process details of this dynamic lay keys to possible leaps forward in the level of intellectual capacity in the common person and all manner of potential for social remediation to be developed through the taxing of functions which have by neglect of other such family dynamic been allowed to languish unfulfilled.     The truth of neuroplasticity factored into a reformed educational model which seriously seeks to normalize new cultural ethics based upon what neuroplasticity tells us can come to literally signal the end of racism, ethnicism, agism, sexism and other gross generalities which neuroplasticity prove false--as not only is each person unique but the workings of their minds which represent responses to their experiences reflect growth to accommodate vastly differing priorities and thus identities seperate from anything a \\"race\\" could simply signify.     Importantly, the dynamic of neuroplasticity operates regardless of whether we are lucid or have been knocked into unconsciousness by a blow. The mind continues to perceive and \\"want\\" something--something as simple as consciousness for instance and the efforts of the independent neurplastic process may play a role in control of the application of HGH which can manifest eventually in a return to some measure of speech or a \\"rewiring\\" of auditory responsivness in which the brain appears to have \\"rewired itself\\" around the impairment and what apears a miracle seems to have happened.     Indeed however it may turn out to have been neuroplasticity in action in the minds of persons on the level of Newton, Einstein et al as both may have had autism or aspergers or some such birth defect-related metal impairment. But the single-minded pursuit of answers to one question at a time without the \\"social tugs\\" \\"normal\\" humans feel at very small prompts may have pushed growth of the mental hardware they needed to solve the problems they did--things which seem superhuman to most persons but which were likely eventually clear as a bell to the so-thought impaired person (like Newton or Einstein). In the future we may find that neuroplasticity is part of the engine of evolution--it is a dynamic which perceives without language and does not communicate with langauge but indeed perceives needs and controls growth hormones. You do the math--it sounds pretty close to an adaptation center that shapes who and how we become in some regards.     Sorry for the verbosity but it sickeningly predictable to keep hearing neuroplasticity portrayed as some kind of internal magic super-hero that only shows up when they're ready to zip your body bag or when that eye is already doing vertical 360's.

0790729369|5.0|This movie is a awesome love story! I loved Meryl S. and Clint E., they are great! I loved the beautiful countryside, and all those covered bridges. And I loved seeing the rural country roads, and cornfields! I loved the beautiuful old farm house, and farm, it brings back memories, and you will need your box of tissues for this one! I have watched it several times over the years, and as usual, I cry each time!<br /><br /> It is so emotional, and it touches your heart in so many ways! It is about a married woman, who is a lonely housewife that feels empty, somehow in her life; and one day a man named Robert drives up her drive to ask her for directions, and from that moment on, their life is changed forever, and they end up falling in love! Francesa is torn between her love for Robert, and her duty to her loving, and very devoted husband, and her teenage children!<br /><br /> It is always so sad to me, to see people feel like they have married the wrong person, especially when the other spouse loves them, and has been very faithful and true and devoted to them, and you know that they, do not deserve to be ever hurt!  I am divorced, and I was a very true and caring wife, and my heart got broken so badly, so I know the pain! Love is so strange, and elusive, and wonderful, and sad, all at the same time!<br /><br /> One of the most awesome scenes to me in the movie, is where Francesa is sitting in her husband's red truck at the store, waiting for her husband, and she is watching Robert standing in the rain, smiling at her, and then she is seeing Robert  driving away! Oh gosh! I had a fit! But when you are watching this movie, you get all caught up in this love story, and part of you wonders, is there really a special rare love that only happens once in a lifetime, and you want to see how this movie ends!
0307269752|5.0|I loved this book.  Once I got started on it, I found it irresistable.  The characters are so easy to relate to because they all seem to have a slew of their own problems and mess, but at the same time are very endearing.  It is all tied together by a brilliant intertwined plot.  I enjoyed every bit.  Although, there are a few slightly graphic scenes, I would NOT recommend this for anyone who is not yet an adult.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is the pinnacle of U2's library.  Musically and lyrically complex and moving, much more powerful and complete than The Joshua Tree.  Less political than other U2 albums, yet full of angst and emotion about broken relationships.  Simply a fantastic release by one of the world's great rock bands.  Haven't heard it?  Give it a try.
B001ER4CSO|5.0|I watched this my husband and two of my grandchildren.  it was action packed and thoroughly enjoyable! I would reccommend this even if you didn't see the first one.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|The acting is very good in this fun, light trek to the underworld.  I wasn't expecting a major epic and so I could sit back and really enjoy it.  The story line is creative and the extra features on the DVD are enjoyable.  It's not a perfect film; it's simply fun.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The Coen Brothers outdid themselves here. The film does an excellent job of making it feel like the old south in the 1930's. Great screenplay, great acting, great editing and an awesome soundtrack. Just a very entertaining film with a lot of funny and sometimes strange parts. One of my all time favorites, I highly recommend it.
B0001US62I|5.0|*****************SPOILER ALERT*****************************    This is one of my Favorite flicks (sorry) and I loved it since I saw it when it first came out. I'm absolutely crazy about cinematic versions of Satan and Robert DeNiro's performance is the best ever, bar none, IMHO. He seems perfect to me, what with his odd appearance and silky mannerisms. His ominous restraint is indeed his most frightening feature, since if the Devil truly exists he could effortlessly exterminate us with a snap of his fingers. But his legend has always been that he merely toys with us in order to gain our souls, perhaps more for his own amusement than for their value to him. He certainly manipulates Harry every step of the way. The irony here is that for every murder he makes Harry commit, Harry gets away with. But at the end he actually kills Epiphany himself and successfully frames Harry for that one. Anyway, this representation of him is right on the money. Very creepy, even before you realize who he really is, although you can sense immediately that he's more than just a man. My theory on the cane is that he needs it to walk because he has to fit his cloven hooves into shoes in order to pass as a human being. There's only one scene where we briefly see him standing and walking in any of his appearances. There's not a clear view of him walking and it takes place in a Catholic church so I'll bet this is Alan Parker and/or DeNiro himself having a little bit of fun with the part. But he uses different canes for different scenes, so maybe it's just a kind of royal scepter. It's all part of the atmosphere of this movie. Lots of little details.      I always liked Mickey Rourke because he was just perfect for certain roles, and this is one of them. I'm glad that he has finally come out the other side of his own personal Hell and made a comeback with The Wrestler, also a part that he's absolutely ideal for. For some reason, in his interview he doesn't want to seriously discuss his actingor his character - he claims that Harry Angel was just an \\"everyday Joe\\"! Just an amoral, bottom-feeding, womanizing everyday Joe with amnesia and extensive plastic surgery who also double-crossed the Devil. At any rate, in Angel Heart his sleazy Brooklyn private eye is an all-time great version of the cliche-ridden cinematic gumshoe. What I liked the most about him is that he has no redeeming qualities whatsoever: no honesty, no integrity, no knightlike sense of honor like Marlowe or Spade or all those other guys. He strikes a match for his cigarette off the dead doctor's shoe and that tiny gesture tells us all we need to know about the character. And when we learn that Angel Heart is actually a quite literal term, it's a big shock. For me at least it was.     In fact, everybody in this movie is reprehensible and despicable. There isn't a sympathetic person in sight. Even the minor characters behave immorally and unethically at best. The  major roles are all fantastic - Rourke, DeNiro and Lisa Bonet. Miss Bonet supplies a weird mix of innocence and evil; of backwoods barefoot backwardness and serene worldliness; and of wide-eyed sweetness and enthusiastic sensuality. Her notorious sex scene is very powerful and meant to invoke her statement of how her mother told her that her father was a \\"terrific lover\\", I think. Among other things.    This transfer is great; couldn't be better. We get the full benefit of the fantastic cinematography and symbology. We'd need the finest anthropologist to decipher the countless emblems and talismans, but they sure looked authentic to my untrained eye. So anyway, if you want something unusual that stands up to repeated viewings, this is a superb choice.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This is a movie that seems to polarize people's opinions. Those who like it, love it a lot, many of them admitting to many, many viewings. Those that don't, well... The film, perhaps even moreso than the stage version, is campy and silly and demands you suspend your disbelief and hang on for the ride. If you're in a mood to be purely entertained and need an antitode to the recession and all the dark films of 2008, then pour a glass of wine, turn down the lights, cue up Mamma Mia! and have a good laugh. (Maybe even a tear or two.) As on stage, the producers sought actors who fit the roles well with -- particularly the males -- ordinary voices. But the instrumental backing tracks are outstanding, faithful to the originals, lovingly recreated by Benny Andersson and many of the original ABBA backing musicians. There's a reason why Andersson and Ulvaeus are now among the very top selling composers of the rock era and you'd have to be either a pop music snob or semi-comatose to resist singing along to this soundtrack.
0812580346|1.0|I'll be brief:    This is the first Robert J. Sawyer book I've read.  Very disappointing.  The prose was turgid and dull, bloated and repetitive.  (The dialogue reads at times like a transcription of boring conversation.) The characters, cardboard.  (They're both inconsistent and unbelievable.)  The editing, practically non-existent.  (Typos galore, but also changing pronouns, misspelled words.)  The plot, unconvincing.  (And ultimately unexciting.  In the end he tries to play a game similar to Greg Bear's Blood Music. It doesn't work.)  The science, uninspiring.  (He name-drops scientists, other science fiction writers, and other science fiction writers' ideas.)       I came to the book really wanting to like it.  I left the book feeling like I'd wasted my time.     I don't think I'll be venturing Sawyer's way again, unfortunately.
006112429X|3.0|How to be a wonderful mother?  Don't have children!!  At least, not if your husband is a blockhead!  The author says that the mother Eva might be an unreliable narrator.  But the mother narrates many, many examples of outsiders (babysitters, mothers of playmates, other kids) fleeing from Kevin. Eva may prove her motherhood credentials by her steadfastness but, in my mind, as I continue the novel, I see Kevin one day murdering her in her bed.  Or possibly by some more ingeniously weird method.  But dead before her natural lifespan she will be.    Fairly gripping, if rather annoying, read.

0316017922|2.0|Mr. Gladwell has taken an obvious observation - that success is a combination of talent, hard-work, dedication, and luck, and written a book about it.  But is that a new concept worthy of a book?  He made it so with his interesting and sometimes insightful vignettes especially regarding the 10,000 hour rule - that talent plus 10,000 hours practice makes perfect success.      However, some of his proofs were quite strained - such as early in the year born hockey players have more success than kids born in later months because of the way hockey leagues are structured, by birth year, and therefore early born kids are bigger and better and get more practice time on all-star teams.  This is pure hooey.     Also, I am still confused as to what the defintion for outlier has to do with any of this.  Last, he could have done a much better job tying everything together in the end.  We are just left hanging.

1932907009|1.0|This extremely overrated book doesn't deserve the accolades its getting. There's nothing Snyder offers in this book that can't be found elsewhere and better.  Snyder spends too much of the book stroking his own ego and bragging up his meager accomplishments -- he wrote Disney's Blank Check! -- and this self-importance imposes itself on all his advice.<br /><br />I really lost my patience with the book when I reached his section on genre. Rather than discuss genre as most people understand it -- Murder/Mystery, Sci-Fi, Romantic Comedy, etc. -- Snyder creates his own schema and new categories.  This encapsulates the whole problem with the book:  Snyder devotes far, far too much time to reinventing the wheel, or copying better writers and imposing his own weird theories on their ideas.  Vague and unhelpful examples litter the book, with Snyder making off-hand remarks about a bad script he read once in lieu of actual text examples.<br /><br />Trottier's [[ASIN:1879505843 The Screenwriter's Bible: A Complete Guide to Writing, Formatting, and Selling Your Script]] and [[ASIN:0385339038 Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting]] contain all the information in this book, and present it in a clearer, more concise and less treachly manner.<br /><br />The only \\"original\\" idea in the book is found in the title -- the advice to show your protagonist \\"saving a cat\\", i.e. doing something kind or good -- is hardly new advice, and is really nothing more than an obvious inversion of Syd Field's advice about\\"kicking the dog\\" -- the idea that you can make an audience loathe an antagonist by showing them being cruel to the harmless (i.e. kick a puppy).<br /><br />There, I just saved you a labored reading of this entirely unnecessary book.

B001L5SXQG|1.0|Thank goodness i was able to hear this CD before buying. At age 55 I've been a fan since Asbury Park and all I have to say is the only thing Bruce is \\"Dreaming\\" about these days is wishing he could write songs like he used to. He needs to take a lesson from the Stones and just give up trying to create worthless new material and take his dog and pony show on the road to play the stuff that the fans want to hear!    PLEASE Bruce!!.STOP..I've loved your music brother thru the 70's and 80's but you've got to know when it's time. Don't let your ego get in the way. You're surrounded by people who you feed off their praise and they don't have the guts to tell you when your time is up..    Still love you brother!!    Ken

B0019T9FL6|4.0|Oscar-winner Hudson's album is a fairly decent release of what-passes-for \\"contemporary\\" R & B, complete with guest performances from the likes of Ludacris and T.Pain.  It is because of such pairings that reduce the album by one star.  Perhaps the producers feel that, in order to garner a younger audience, the singer needed some \\"help.\\"  That is far from the truth because Hudson is, most definitely, a force to be reckoned with...and the songs on the album, though passable, are for the most part, not up to the level of her talent.  Some of them sound like Beyonce' \\"throwaways\\" even though Hudson has a better set of pipes than the more popular \\"Miss B.\\"<br /><br />Best cuts:<br />\\"Spotlight\\"<br />\\"Pocketbook\\" (without the embarrassingly tacky Ludacris rap)<br />\\"My Heart\\"<br />\\"You Pulled Me Through\\"<br />\\"Can't Stop the Rain\\"<br />\\"We Gon' Fight\\"<br />\\"Jesus Promised Me a Home Over There\\"...<br /><br />and, of course, \\"And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\" (highlights)<br /><br />Album running time: 52.1 minutes
B001LF4IA6|3.0|Not bad, but not rock and roll. Bruce Springsteen wrote and performed some of the best rock and roll songs of all time, but somewhere along the way he decided to become a poet and, at times, a country singer. Elvis left rock and roll to make bad movies, Dylan left to be a poor re-interpreter of his own songs, and McCartney left to write silly lyrics. Dylan has come back to what he did best. I hope Springsteen will be able to do the same.

B000W1V5OC|5.0|I saw Nightwish on an internet music video channel in December 2008.  I knew this was a band I had to check out.  I went to YouTube and watched some of their stuff and then decided I had to have the End of an Era dvd.  I classify it as mature rock, not kid stuff.  The female singer, Tarja, left the band after this concert and Nightwish now has another singer.  The new singer gives the band a pop sound instead of the mature, sofisticated sound when Tarja was the singer.    The dvd is great!  The sound is five stars and the video is also great.  My only complaint is the camera work and video editing suffers.  There are some blured shots and several times when the video zooms in and out really fast.  I guess they think it adds something to the music, but it is actually quite distracting.  There is also fast editing.  Switching camera shots three times a second takes away from the enjoyment of the concert, but thankfully it doesn't happen in every song.    I give the dvd five stars because this version of Nightwish gives a refreshing, mature, and sofisticated rock concert.  Some of the songs even qualify as metal.
0743455967|5.0|Why not learn a few tricks of the trade from a man who had sold over 100 bazillion copies of novels and stories? On Writing was a cool read; a little insight into Stephen King's past,a little insight into the craft of writing. The Best of Both Worlds! Funny,I think I actually WOULD pay money to read his laundry list.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Fascinating book. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. The author's portrayal from the dogs perspective was intriguing. It made me look at my own dog in a new light. Highly recommended.
0956031609|4.0|Shamim Sarif appears to possess the gift of writing verse as prose and the world unseen is a fine example of this lyricism. This is not great literature but it certainly is an easy read (I read it in a single sitting), drawing you in to empathize with the characters, rooting for them to succeed. It is a captivating book and I would highly recommend reading it.<br /><br />At its core is the restrained love story between Amina and Miriam, both astonished by the intensity of their feelings and the common need to break out of their oppressive worlds.  It is a story of opposites - of repression and expression, questioning tradition and blind acceptance, of courage and fear, of integrity and deceit, of finding a voice and finally of choices. What really evolves from this story are these broader themes, more universal in their appeal, underscored by each of its remarkable characters as small actions either in defiance of apartheid or convention, an arcane custom or simply humor in the face of adversity.  This is possibly the book's greatest strength.<br /><br />Sarif is smart enough to leave an open ending relative to the era. However, there's a strong argument for a more definitive ending - one that gives the reader some greater assurance of the relationship between these women surviving.<br /><br />Perhaps the movie offers some better form of closure.
0756405890|5.0|It is impossible for me to compare this book to other popular series I've read.  This is bar far one of the best books I've ever picked up.  The author has a rare gift of being able to make his reader feel what his character feels...    I've read and loved Tolkien, Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, GRRM.  Yet this is quite possibly the best fantasy book written in the last 30 years.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We needed a mobile for our 3 month old son's playard in the living room.  We looked at several mobiles, but many weren't colorful or captivated his attention for a long period of time.  Also, we found that it was difficult to attach several mobiles to the crib and playard.  With the Fisher Price mobile, we were able to attach it to the stairwell and also a chair with spindles in it.  Out of all the other mobiles we saw, we highly recommend this one.  Its a plus to also have the remote.  I used this remote on many occasions when I was home alone and breastpumping.  We also loved the different choices in music.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  We love Jose Whedon's works and this is a classic Whedon musical.
B00006FM77|5.0|I haven't seen Chicago in concert for maybe 20 years, although I saw the Live at the Greek Theatre video recorded sometime during the 1990's. Frankly, the last time I saw them, at the Fox Theatre in Detroit, they played uninspired, merely going through the motions. During its prime, with guitarist Terry Kath at the helm, this band used to sell out 10,000 seats (and lawn) at what used to be called Pine Knob, the outdoor music arena north of Detroit for five nights. Their music was raw, the band hungry, and they had an affinity for their audience.<br /><br />I went through two vinyl sets of the Carnegie Hall album before it was released on CD, bought that and then, when Rhino reissued it, remastered and with an extra disc of previously unreleased tunes from that momentous week at Carnegie, I bought that, too. The horns still sound like kazoos, but Kath's guitar work sounds even better than it did on the original release. The bonus disk contains a great rendition of Listen from the CTA album and alternate absolutely killer takes of South California Purples and Sing a Mean Tune Kid that are better than the takes on the original release, even if (or perhaps because) they are less poppish charts. An Hour in the Shower, a Kath composition, is a nice choice to include, and despite Kath forgetting the lyrics on Loneliness is Just a Word, the fourth disc alone is worth the price of this reissue.<br /><br />Kudos to Rhino Records for this reissue, and for the packaging, including the posters from the original release.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the top 40 hit machine that Chicago became in the 1980's, courtesy of Peter Cetera and a regimental record industry that today rewards formula, you probably won't care much for the music on this CD. However, if you loved this band with its original lineup, when they were the quintessential jam band, this reissue is a must for your music collection.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|I found this movie to be pretty boring overall. Unfortunately it is also a little long. I might have liked it better if my expectations hadn't been so high. Although Daniel Day-Lewis was very good as usual, it wasn't enough to make up for the slow tiring story. The characters for the most part were kind of bizarre. Two of the main parts: a young preacher who was very creepy and the main character's son that had no personality or lines. The ending was also strange but very abrupt thank goodness. Rent or buy used(like me). If you pay retail there will be blood from pounding your head on the floor.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Excellent Batman's film, Heath Ledger remarkable performer as the Joker, high quality in action scenes.
156224003X|5.0|I'm a vocalist first and a piano player second.  I bought this at the recommendation of a musician friend because piano has been my nemesis for years in spite of having lessons at a young age.  Not only am I relaxing and becoming a better piano player,  his advice is also great for vocalists as well.  A must read for all musicians!
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|Ledger must have watched Jack Nicholson as the Joker and realized that his own performance stunk like a skunk run over by a fertilizer truck.    This movie was awful, a real stinkeroo.  The acting was wooden, the violence gratuitous, the plot disgusting and disturbing.    I don't want to have man's inhumanity to man rubbed in my nose when I watch a movie for entertainment.  I don't want a 100+ body count or graphic views of a woman being blown to smithereens.    Sorry, let's leave The Smithereens out of this.  They rock!    This movie dragged on and on, it had zero humor in it, and the acting was strictly second-rate compared to the benchmark of the original Batman series of movies.    I recommend those.  Jack Nicholson, Jim Carey, Danny DeVito, Tommy Lee Jones all played GREAT villains and stole the movies.  They were evil but believable, and most of all they were FUNNY.    Ledger was NOT funny and NOT believable.  Sorry, but no insane guy is going to keep coming up with HUGE blow-em-up scenarios one right after the other, particularly when constantly being chased by a badly acted Batman.  They made Joker into a super SUPER dooper villain who would have to have the clock-stopping power of Santa Claus to get all of those attacks set up one after another.  I could not suspend the disbelief.    As for Michael Caine, shame on you for doing this piece of merde'.  I hope it is not the last movie you do in your career because I would not want to remember you by this big budget blasphemy of Batman.    I rented this for $1 at Redbox.  I WANT MY DOLLAR BACK!!    I had to rate this one star because they don't have zero stars or a negative star rating.  I would rate this a BLACK HOLE because it SUCKED.    PLEASE do NOT buy this movie or even see it for free.  If you want the REAL Batman, get the original series.  They were good movies.    This piece of garbage doesn't even deserve to be CALLED a movie.
1558908382|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. A dark comedy with a love story. Yes and thank you! Everything about this movie is spot on: cast, acting, story, writing, execution....
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The price of this DVD is only enough to cover the commentary.  I've never paid so little for so much effort put into a product.  If you don't want to feel guilty for getting 80 hours of enjoyment for only $10 (trust me, you will watch it so many times that you will find yourself singing duets with your totally straight gaming buddy)... (hypothetically) then the only solution is to buy two copies, and give one to a friend.  Oh yea, if you don't listen to the \\"Commentary the Musical\\" you will hate yourself forever;  even if you don't realize it.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|OK, there are some shows being recorded now with David Tennant, but they are not a full series like this is.  The next full series might come out in 2010 with the next new Doctor (Matt Smith) and his new companion (TBD).  I like this series with Donna Noble as the companion, she is so different to any of the previous ones (going back to the beginning with William Hartnell !).
B0000BYM3K|5.0|maiden has put out another solid one.like this one as much now as i did when it came out.Dance of Death is everything Iron Maiden represent. Heavy, catchy music with melody placed to perfection.   'Wildest Dreams' starts the album off with a memorable chorus and good kick to it. Despite being one of the weaker songs, it's a simple, basic Iron Maiden number. 'Rainmaker' is brilliant, heavier than Wildest Dreams, yet still the simple song to get the album flowing. 'No More Lies' is,  what Steve Harris has meant to do for several albums. With it's melodic start which suddenly kicks into the chorus and then maintaining that feel, and all 3 guitarists, Dave, Adrian and Janick, pulling off great solos to ensure the mid section rivals the best of the past.  'Montsegur' is heavy as hell, with Bruce really hitting the spot with the vocals. The title song itself clocks in at over 8 minutes and is another slow starter and another Maiden masterpiece. Next comes probably the weakest song on the album, 'Gates of Tomorrow' lacks what the rest of the albums has, mainly punch. 'New Frontier' has that punch which 'Gates' lacks, and is a possible single in my view. 'Paschendale' is an epic song that would probebly make any Best of Maiden album, another 8+ minute song.   'Face in the Sand' is a burst of energy, Nicko using his double-bass drumming to devastating effect, and like 'Rainmaker', is another chorus to die for. 'Age of Innocence' sets you up for what you think will be a grande finale, with memorable riffs from the 3 musketeers... and you're not disapointed. 'Journeyman' is a melodic song which shows the greater ability of Bruce's vocals.
1416562605|4.0|We can read all the books we can find on the rise of India as the worlds largest democracy tries to leapfrog past the industrial revolution to participation in the global knowledge economy.  Somehow, however, we understand that we can never grasp what these changes mean to the vast majority (800 million?) of Indians who are not part of this new elite middle class - but who serve the new elites as cooks, maids, nannies, or drivers.  In this novel we learn the story of Balram Halwai (aka the White Tiger) and his move from poor villager to servant and driver for a wealth family in New Delhi.  This is a perspective (that of the servant) that we seldom ever hear from as we marvel at India's transformation, a perspective that helps us understand the costs and dislocations as India messily rushes into its new reality.  As India goes so will the world.  The youngest country with a passion for education and a population ready to do the same jobs we do at much lower wages, we tend to see India through our eyes as threat, opportunity, and economic partner.  It is good to spend some time seeing India through another vision.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Bruce is still on top. The Wrestler is haunting and sums up the the movie so well that the director had to put it in the closing credits so as not to spoil the movie. Queen of the Supermarket and Life Itself are great! I hope after the summer Europe tour Bruce adds some Florida dates!!!
0143038419|5.0|A delightful book, entertaining and full of wisdom. The author takes us along on her year-long journey to find her true self. Her account  feels honest and yet has a lot of humor. Sprinkled in is interesting information about the countries she is visiting which I enjoyed as well.  Another book I enjoyed reading is [[ASIN:0071601082 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: The 3 Simple Ideas That Will Instantaneously Transform Your Life]] by Ariel and Shya Kane. It offers surprisingly simple ideas for everyday enlightenment.  Both books are fun to read and I found them very inspirational!
B001M4YZ90|4.0|A number of years ago young director Guy Ritchie changed mobster movies with his infectious LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS and that twisted underbelly of London's crime population is back in full force with ROCKNROLLA. Ritchie's style - mixing rapid action, flashback explanations, loopy violence, wildly imaginative characters, and a near non-understandable collection of various accents from the British Isles coupled with an integral musical score - makes this tale of deceit, desperation, intrigue, vice in all forms, low on the food chain criminals at service in the line of polished professionals - a fast paced highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />The script (yes, by Ritchie, too) combines narration with live conversation, a trait that can be distracting, but that in Ritchie's hands adds a layer of commentary and needed background that helps the viewer keep the many bits and pieces of plots screwed together. The Old School crime lord is played by Tom Wilkinson in a role far different from his previous roles. His nemesis is the New School crime lord Russian Uri (Karel Roden) with odd demands and a 'lucky painting' we never see. Gerard Butler pals with Idris Elba and the gay character Morne Botes in a back and forth series of thwarted attempts to gain status in the smarmy crime world headed by Wilkinson. The name character of Rocknrolla (pop star Johnny Quid) is well played by Toby Kebbell, Thandie Newton offers the touch of glamour as a twisted accountant, and Jeremy Piven, Chris Bridges (Ludacris), Jimi Mistry and narrator/star Archie (Mark Strong) pull it all together.<br /><br />This film definitely has an audience for those who appreciate the skills of Ritchie as writer/director. For others, it may be a bit hard to follow the technique of dishing out this tangled tale. Grady Harp, February 09
0385340990|5.0|I had read a review of this book and was tired of the regular and mundane.  The only copy my library had available was the audio book.  I ordered it and found it fascinating to the point where I would sit in my car and listen to \\"just one more letter.\\"  Great fun.
B00005JKTF|4.0|I enjoyed this movie so much I purchased it so that I can see it when the mood hits me. It has a great cast, the production is excellent, the twist and turns keep you involved and the special features are very interesting as well. Overall, a great WWII movie. One of the better ones.
B000WS4P5G|5.0|Buy this album. I just wanted to give it another 5 stars!  It has Mother for fvcks sake!
B001ILHY2C|4.0|If you've read the critic reviews of this movie prior to watching you're expecting a horrible movie, devoid of any sort of enjoyment whatsoever.  To a point they are right, there are a lot of ways that this movie lacks.  The story is pretty weak, and there is an awful lot of overacting in this movie.<br /><br />But that said, the movie is what it is.  Action packed from beginning to end and enough to keep any action junkie satisfied.<br /><br />Don't put too much into this film and you'll get what you should expect, a fun diversion for an hour and 45 minutes with enough groans and \\"ewws\\" to make you not regret it.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is most definitely the only way to purchased a series: the entirety of the series in order to continually watch each episode.  The show is great, with very good (but far from perfect writing).  Let me tell you now: I'm addicted to this show, as I'm a political and news junkie.<br /><br />It's a must no matter what you believe in (even though the administration in the show is center-left Democratic).
B001F7MSG6|3.0|Before I start I need to explain something about why I rated this film the way I did. First let me say that I'm a pretty big fan of both Guillermo del Toro and the original [[ASIN:B000OT6V00 Hellboy]] film. Ron Perlman was perfectly cast in the title role and I wouldn't wish that changed for the world. The first film (also directed by del Toro) had a pretty cool story about the beginnings of Hellboy and the organization he would eventually belong to. Let me say that again, the STORY was cool. That's important, because when you get right down to it, films must have that to carry them through to audiences.<br /><br />A friend of mine said that if I loved [[ASIN:B000WSLAUO Pan's Labyrinth]] that I'd love this film. Well, he was wrong. I did love Pan's Labyrinth. A lot. In fact, it was probably the best film of 2006. It won BAFTA awards and three Oscars and a gaggle of others, so the critics seemed to agree with me on that point. But Hellboy II didn't fair so well. Sure, it got one nod from the Academy (for make-up, though), but little else; not that I'd expect a comic book-to-film story to garner much critical acclaim amongst the snobby elite of Hollywood-dom. But here's the thing: It could have! Take a look at things like [[ASIN:B001GAPC1K Iron Man]] and [[ASIN:B001GZ6QEC The Dark Knight]] and you'll see what I mean (sometimes the snobs are forced to take note of these otherwise overlooked gems whenever they're done with extreme care ...and I mean E-X-T-R-E-M-E!). So what was the problem? you may be asking. First let's look at what wasn't the problem.<br /><br />Guillermo MUST be recognized as a visual artist. The sets and camera shots and costumes were very much on-par with what I expect from him (i.e., Pan's Labyrinth quality). The troll's market scenes were worth the price of admission alone! Stunningly dark, dreary but equally enthralling and uniquely beautiful. The Elfin lands and flashbacks were also well-done giving us a bit of history about the war between humans and elves.<br /><br />But we need more than history and battles to make a great film. We need originality, and this is where the film fell short for me. Looking more like a side-story for [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]], the history of elves and men have been done ad nauseam (in both literature and film). Although del Toro tried to put a unique spin on the story by incorporating the elves as split between being nice to humans and wanting them all dead, the story really never found traction for me. This was due, in great part, by the incorporation of two love stories. One we're already aware of between Perlman's Hellboy and the firebranding Liz (Selma Blair), and the other comes as a bit of a surprise (and ends up nowhere, really). To me, del Toro could've easily excised this second love story and extended the history behind Hellboy and/or extended our understanding of why the division between the human-hating elves and the human-loving ones was so wide (I understand some of this was due to the twin elves' father, but much of it is not). We're supposed to assume (or so I assume!) that one of the elves is just flat-out evil for the sake of being evil. Not good storytelling.<br /><br />So there you have it. I liked the film as a diversion, but I wasn't at all captivated as I was with the first Hellboy. Story, story, story. It's so important. I hope that with the next Hellboy flick (and I really hope there is another because I WILL watch it) that del Toro directs again and can give us a fresh story with the amazing visuals we've come to appreciate from him.But we need more than history and battles to make a great film.

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Those of us over-40 folks remember fondly the great BBC mini-series of yesterday, The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Elizabeth R, incredibly acted and scripted, albeit lacking in Hollywood glossiness.  The Other Boleyn Girl delivers on the gloss but the acting is mediocre at best, the writing several steps below mediocre.  I rather like Natalie Portman, but her variable English accent was distracting, to say the least.  (Obviously there is some logic in casting English actors in such roles.)  I didn't find Eric Bana particularly appealing (maybe we hetero males aren't easily swayed by an actor's looks), and the rape of Anne is unhistorical and was obviously included to spice up a rather dull movie.  (Tip to movie-makers: sex can actually be very titillating when it's just suggested, and off-screen.) After seeing this movie on DVD, I found myself dragging my old Six Wives of Henry VIII tapes out of the closet and relishing the great acting and the intelligent scripts, and the great actress Dorothy Tutin as Anne is a pretty tough act to follow.  I really cannot recommend The Other Boleyn Girl as entertainment, much less as history.  If scriptwriters want to sex up historical dramas, fine, but at least give us some credible dialogue and some actresses who can sound consistently English.

B001GM28HO|2.0|I give this CD 2 stars because there were 2 \\"Good\\" songs on it. Of course \\"Just Dance\\" is awesome, and the next would have to be \\"Poker Face\\" which has the same feel. The rest of the tracks are garbage (fillers). Save yourself some money and download the singles from Amazon - [...]. Of course this is just my opinion. Take it as you wish.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure Lady Gaga will be a one hit wonder.<br /><br />**Update** September 16, 2011<br /><br />Okay, so Lady Gaga was not a one hit wonder. Weird? I'm still not a fan, but I'm trying to figure out how she did it!

B000FS9MV0|5.0|Skylark is a stunning follow up to Renee's 2004 debut album. A great mix of standards and original material. All 13 tracks are so wonderful with no fillers. Renee can sing a dreamy ballad, the blues or playful swing very convincingly. \\"Lover Man\\" is the most incredible 5 minutes I have ever heard in my 55 years! \\"Hold Me Now\\" is simply beautiful. Gene Krupa and Anita O'Day would be proud to hear what Renee has done with \\"Thanks for the Boogie Ride\\" from 1941, swing is alive and well! In an era of sound alike and look alike \\"popular\\" music, Renee has a truly unique sound. Her music will be with me forever! Do yourself a favor and buy this CD.
B001NHZ2KW|5.0|By all appearances this seems to be the same version as the 2003 Pioneer edition. The box is exactly the same with a different barcode sticker slapped on it. It even has the 2003 copyright date and Pioneer logo. Is there any difference in the video content between the 2003 box and this one?    Either way, this still is one of the best rock documentaries ever made.
0312945973|5.0|The River God is a rousing tale of ancient Egypt.  It brings to life, with great detail, a time long past.  The characters are well rounded and totally believable.  Once you start it, it is hard to put down.  Based on this book alone, I immediately bought the rest of the \\"Ancient Egypt\\" series.  I became aquainted with Wilbur Smith years ago with his novel The Sunbird.  His writing is just outstanding.  I highly recommend The River God, The Seventh Scroll, The Warlock, and The Quest (although The Quest is a little bit \\"out there\\".
0312383320|4.0|*refers to audio version<br /><br />The Plum series is one of my absolute favorite series. I think I got in on it around when #8 came out and let me say that it did not take me long to catch up and then have to sit drumming my figures and waiting impatiently for the next installment. The \\"between-the-numbers\\" books are a wonderfully fun added bonus while waiting for the next number in the series. And of course, we get to ride along with Diesel in the \\"between-the-numbers\\" books which is a yummy trip.<br /><br />Plum Spooky is a bit on the edgier side, I think, though still complete with all the laughter, hi jinx and hilarity of previous books in the series. I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the story and quickly engrossed within Stephanie's adventure. Narrator Lorelei does a fantastic job bringing Stephanie, as well as all of the characters to life. She is a true voice talent and is a perfect match to the wonderful talent of Janet Evanovich.<br /><br />This is the third book in the Plum series that I have listened to, rather than read, simply because I couldn't wait to find out what happens in the story. Between a Mario, junk food eating monkey and an evil plot to take over the world by controlling the weather, Plum Spooky never has a dull moment. This is an excellent addition to Janet Evanovich's Plum series and I eagerly await the delight that is sure to come in number fifteen!

B0013FSL3E|5.0|My family watched Wall-E on DVD in our basement home theater with dinner. I just love that movie. It is a Disney animated film about a future if humans just trashed the earth and had to go into space to live until one lone robot cleaned up the mess down below. The humans are so obese, they float around on hover chairs and suck their meals through straws, too lazy to even chew.

B0000019PA|5.0|If you've never heard of Neutral Milk Hotel, like I had not until about 6 months ago, then give it a chance.  Like many of the other reviews, I will say that NMH is not perfection for most, but it is to a select few.      The music and Mangum's vocals are entrancing to this listener. But they won't be to everyone. It is one of those few albums that may put a permanent imprint on your mind.  They are hard to describe. It is poetry, sadness, joy, history, imperfection, perfection, flow...indescribable.  I can't think of too many album's I have that I am afraid to listen to too much.  This is one of them. I don't want to ruin this experience.  It is a must buy for a few folks.  I am not sure who they are but, give it a shot...borrow it from someone, at a minimum.
B001DWXUWY|5.0|These guys got it!  The lead singer is unique but has the voice of Bruce Springstien and the Killers' Brandon Flowers.  The songs are very well written and there are even some lyrics from other songs to add to the story.  Maybe they are a tribute or something to the past artists.    This album is very good, get it.
1400082773|5.0|This book features one of the neatest, pithiest author bios in memory:  \\"Barack Obama was elected President of the United States on November 4, 2008.\\"<br /><br />Perfect.<br /><br />The book is a revelation.  Chided by opponents as someone who could simply \\"give a good speech,\\" 'Dreams' unveils a man who is also a writer of the highest order.  Just the other day, Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan, in previewing the inauguration, praised Mr. Obama's efforts in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal:<br /><br />\\"Mr. Obama is a writer, and he sees himself as a writer. It is an important part of his self-perception. He is the author of two books, the first of considerable literary merit. He loves words. It is in writing that he absorbs, organizes data, thinks his way through to views and decisions, all of which adds to the expectations for his speech.\\"<br /><br />I fully agree.  \\"Dreams from my Father\\" is a first-rate memoir of considerable literary merit.  It's a must read by anyone with even the slightest interest in understanding the forces that helped shape the 44th President of the United States.<br /><br />I think it's important to read the 2004 paperback re-release, as its prologue allows the writer to look back at himself and his work almost a decade later.  It also allows his audience to peer into the president's thinking four years ago at the moment in time when he first burst into the nation's consciousness with his breakthrough Keynote Address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.
0316017922|5.0|[[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]]I caught the author of \\"Outliers\\" on a CNN book review show and am glad that Malcolm Gladwell introduced me to his \\"Story of Success\\". I was engrossed with his behind-the-scenes facets of success stories that make cultural foundations and opportunities account more for successes than I was aware. His book threaded his premise through every chapter and his personal last chapter gave me the firm conclusion that \\"cultural advantage\\" is the larger wheel on the road to success.  I'm encouraging all those around me to read it. Gordon
B001F7MSFW|4.0|I enjoyed Hellboy II.  The character story lines progressed really well while giving more history on the fairy world.  I thought Selma Blair was one dimensional and therefore drug down this otherwise excellent movie.
B0000931OG|3.0|You'd expect any band to crash and burn after their lead guitarist left. Especially when the band is Blur, whose sound was created by Graham Coxon's scraping, dissonant guitar hooks. But Coxon left, and only plays on one song on Think Tank. The rest was written by Damon Albarn, who had been taking an interest in electronic music after the unexpected success of his [[ASIN:B00005LMBK Gorillaz]] project. And, oddly enough, it's not as bad as you'd expect. Not good -- it's probably Blur's worst album -- but not as bad as you'd expect.<br /><br />In fact, Think Tank even has what is probably the last great Blur song, namely \\"Ambulance.\\" Bassist Alex James compensates for Coxon's absence with a tight, funky bass hook, which only emerges toward the end, after a cinematic build-up. I love the way the song gradually rears up from the swampy drum track, and Albarn's singing is great, along with the weird distorted vocal hook. There is something to be said for Albarn's electronic experiments, sometimes.<br /><br />The vocals are consistently good. At some point around the turn of the century, Albarn became an amazing singer. He was always appealing, since the [[ASIN:B000000WA2 Britpop]] days; his writing was clever and his voice dramatized it well. But purely in terms of singing ability, he wasn't very good. He had a heavily accented, off-key voice that was redeemed only by his acting abilities. But now, he's the best vocalist in popular music. In \\"Ambulance,\\" his voice is a vulnerable, soft falsetto. In \\"On The Way To The Club,\\" it's full of daydreaming detachment. In \\"Out Of Time,\\" it's sympathetic and gentle. In \\"Brothers and Sisters,\\" it takes on a husky tone that sounds all dangerous and sexy. I can't believe I just wrote that about him, but there you have it. He's just as great on the [[ASIN:B00082IJ08 second]] Gorillaz album. Seems that he gets better with age. I have a lot of criticism for the album, but I've probably listened to it more times than to [[ASIN:B000002USH Modern Life Is Rubbish]], and it's probably thanks to Albarn's singing.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this would still have been a much better album with Coxon aboard. You can see the difference if you listen to his guitar line in \\"Battery In Your Leg.\\" The song is completely bland and insubstantial, even Albarn's vocal doesn't catch one's attention, but the reverberating guitar, when it finally appears, instantly adds palpable emotion and drama. And it's not even Coxon's best guitar line, by any means. If he could do that for one song with so little effort, what might he have done for the rest of the album?<br /><br />But unfortunately, Albarn wasn't interested in writing guitar songs. He may not have been interested in writing songs at all. It seems that he was unduly fascinated with Radiohead's [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]]. Press releases played up the alleged influence of [[ASIN:B00006EXE0 world music]] on Albarn, but it is nowhere to be found here except in a few intros and outros. Instead, Think Tank largely consists of sleepy ballads with electronic production (\\"Good Song,\\" \\"Sweet Song,\\" \\"Caravan\\"), and thus is extremely similar to [[ASIN:B00005B4GU Amnesiac]]. Albarn's voice on tracks like \\"Caravan\\" even resembles Thom Yorke on \\"You And Whose Army?\\"<br /><br />This strange fixation on sullen minimalism leads to a truly horrible song called \\"Crazy Beat,\\" which is a carbon copy of \\"The National Anthem\\" from Kid A, except Fatboy Slim makes it even worse by adding an unlistenable croaking voice that repeats the song title endlessly. Like in \\"The National Anthem,\\" the music consists of an inept rhythm. The song thankfully contains no cacophonous trumpets, but they too get their turn elsewhere on the album, in another truly horrible song called \\"Jets,\\" which has the most pointless, tuneless saxophone solo that ever appeared on any rock record. Albarn tops it off with a singularly inane lyric, which mostly consists of \\"la la la.\\"<br /><br />The casualties go on. \\"We've GotA File On You\\" is a failed attempt to replicate \\"Song 2,\\" and is even worse than \\"Chinese Bombs\\" from the [[ASIN:B000000WDA self-titled album]], which itself was a failed attempt to replicate \\"Song 2.\\" There is one more truly horrible song in the form of a bonus track called \\"My White Noise,\\" whose gratuitously profane lyrics saddled the album with a parental guidance sticker. Other songs, like \\"Gene By Gene,\\" \\"Good Song,\\" and \\"Sweet Song,\\" are not terrible, but not very interesting either -- this is where Coxon would have been useful. Even \\"On The Way To The Club,\\" the best song after \\"Ambulance,\\" ends with notably inept keyboard noodling, where Coxon would have probably come up with a good guitar line.<br /><br />Think Tank was probably doomed from the start. By this point, Albarn had become obviously bored with the confines of Blur. Nowadays, he's more like a theatre director than a lead singer in a band; he's all over the place with all kinds of [[ASIN:B000IAZ3E0 collaborations]], and recently even a [[ASIN:B001CVCBEO Chinese opera]]. Perhaps his change of attitude also contributed to Coxon's departure. Whatever the reasons, Think Tank is mediocre; but at the same time, it does have one great song in \\"Ambulance,\\" and the vocals make it listenable, if not good.e \\"Song 2,\\" and is even worse than \\"Chinese Bombs\\" from the [[ASIN:B000000WDA self-titled album]], which itself was a failed attempt to replicate \\"Song 2.\\" There is one more truly horrible song in the form of a bonus track called \\"My White Noise,\\" whose gratuitously profane lyrics saddled the album with a parental guidance sticker.

0060989157|5.0|You don't even have to be a heavy metal or rock and roll fan to appreciate this book. I am neither. Watched some of their videos, knew some of the songs in the 80s and read the tabloids, that's it. But this book has to be one of the most riveting from cover to cover. If you want to know exactly what went on behind the scenes without having to pick through long boring passages, this is the book for you.    The material was so well organised, so well recounted, not a single out of place or superfluous word, phrase or chapter. Told in easy to read and follow language. Despite much of its content type, told in such a humble, open and honest style that it does not leave one with the taste of disgust or come across as self indulgent and arrogant like other auto/biographical accounts (such as those by Karrine Steffans).     I would highly recommend it, even if the band did not interest you, by the end it will and its a great example of how to organise events and material in just the right way. Definitely not a waste of a read.
068484267X|4.0|Without hope and a goal to live for, Frank McCourt could have become a member of the IRA, but instead he became a Pulitzer Prize winning author in America.    In the powerful memoir Angela's Ashes, the author, Frank McCourt, details his tragic and trying upbringing that compels him to strive for a better life for himself as well as his family. Living in poverty in Limerick, Ireland, during the 1930s and 40s, the McCourt's struggle to survive in a crowded drafty apartment. Frank's mother, Angela suffers from depression having witnessed the deaths of three of her children. His father, Malachy, is a constant disappointment because of his irresponsible drinking. McCourt contrasts his mother and father by writing, \\"The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.\\" After being confirmed at church Frank is struck with typhoid fever. At the hospital, he is introduced to Shakespeare and we begin to see his passion for storytelling. Even with his father's negligent behavior, Frank still looks up to Malachy due to his entertaining stories about Irish heroes and Frank wants to develop his own talent for weaving a tale.   With the arrival of World War II, Malachy, along with many other men, moved to England to work in an artillery factory. Once again demonstrating his negligence towards his family, unlike many of the other men, he drinks away his earnings as opposed to sending them back to support his family. Frank, being an exceptionally smart student tried to continue school after graduating, which wasn't easy given their impoverished second class position in Ireland. He soon takes on multiple jobs that gave him a sense of responsibility.  Even with the addition of his earnings, the McCourt's get evicted, forcing them to move in with Angela's cousin. While all this is happening, religion is the one thing that keeps him sane, keeps him fighting, and keeps the readers entertained; I continually found it amusing and ironic that Frank would constantly feel guilty about doing things that kept him alive and happy. He would go to confession many times throughout his childhood. This is also fascinating because it shows that with all the misery, they still believe in God, who remains their number one priority. Frank begins having an affair with one of his clients while working as a messenger boy, but again experiences heartbreak when the lady dies of tuberculosis. Frank works through everything imaginable in a great attempt to make it to America and create a decent life for himself.   Frank McCourt, as shown through this memoir, can accomplish anything. To bring this story to life he writes as if he were a child, as if he was writing in a diary. By doing this the reader is with the character every second of every day; the reader sees, hears, and feels what the author went through. Due to phonetic spelling and pore punctuation it is sometimes easy to get lost in the words, literally.  Without McCourt's eloquent writing style that expresses much detail and humor, Angela's Ashes could have been a complete and utter bore, but he certainly pulls off this depressing and yet uplifting book with both attitude and irony. We begin the story in a state of weariness, but once we see that the protagonist is able to push through and have the strength to travel a different path then his father. We as readers are also given hope, which is the key to winning the reader's heart.

B001KL3GY0|5.0|As a big fan of Franz's previous 2 albums, I really wanted this one to be just as good...and had high hopes and expectations to match...and the verdict?    Pure Awsomeness! Yes, there's some synths and what some are calling as a \\"different\\" sound for the band, but overall, the tunes are still catchy, still danceable...some darker, some sexier & all quite emotional...but just great as a whole.    Really, there's no bad or weak tracks on the entire album...it's another one of those exceedingly rare, pop it in and let it play from beginning to end albums. These guys are at the top of their game! Better than 95% of the crap out in the music world currently...    Do yourself a favor and get it -- Highly recommended!
B001ILFUD2|5.0|This is still one of my all-time favorite animated movies, and was one of the first movies that I had the joy of seeing in theaters when I was a kid back in the day.  It has some of the best songs of ANY Disney movie (my parents got me the soundtrack on cassette which I completely wore out within a year), and it also helped pave the way for major actors and musicians to contribute to animated films.      Like the main description says, Oliver and Company was basically the turning of the page at Disney's animation studios from the older, fully hand-drawn (and sometimes stock or recycled) animation, to the more modern, computer-aided work that paved the way for mega-blockbusters throughout the 90's. Although for me, every one of Disney's main animated lineup of movies post-Lion King had gotten progressively worse and worse in terms of both animation and story quality, so it's no wonder they leave everything up to Pixar these days.    But I digress... as an avid Disney fan and collector, I highly recommend adding Oliver and Company to your collection.  All of the cast and characters are great, and it has some very funny moments, especially with Cheech Marin on board as the voice of Tito the chihuahua.  I'll be picking this up when it comes out on Tuesday, as my old VHS copy circa the 1996 theatrical re-release has seen much better days lol.    Oh, and if you're one of those supposed \\"media elites\\" who has to have every new release on Blu-Ray and are thinking about skipping on this one since it's apparently not \\"worthy\\" of a Blu-Ray release, get over it and pick it up anyway!  This isn't the kind of movie you invite your neighbors over to impress with your overpriced home entertainment center, or drool over being able to see every little pixel worth of detail.  No, this is a movie you actually sit back with the family and enjoy... imagine that! Besides, you'll be saving yourself at least $10-$15 by not having to buy the overpriced Blu-Ray version, and these days with the economy in the crapper and Mr. Hope 'N Change as President, that actually means something!  ;-)
