1451637500|5.0|\\"I've greatly enjoyed all of Bujold's Vorkosigan tales since the first, Shards Of Honor, when his mom and dad met. This continuation of the tale begins six years after Miles marries Lady Ekaterin and now he has four young kids. As usual, Miles takes up Emperor Gregor's call to \\"check on\\" a life extension by cryogenic freezing business that seeks to set up on Komar. There is wild adventure, mercantile bad guys, mysteries, a far future version of the Roman catacombs that Miles wakes up in, in pitch black, as the story begins. Then there are the real and delightful \\"street people\\" of this story. The tale begins with Miles escaping from underground suspended animation catacombs, while suffering hallucinations, only to be helped to a refuge by 11 year old young Jin, a boy whose Mom was frozen away by authorities nearly two years ago. Thus begins a wondrous tale of relationships among Barrayarans, subjects of the cryotomb world Kibou-daini, Roic his Armsman, Vorlynkn the Consul General for Barrayar on Kibou, Suze the mysterious crone chief of a place where street people live and survive, and the corporate chiefs whose aim is to get everyone under contract to be \\"frozen\\" when badly ill or elderly. Then like the Wall Street moguls of 2008, the corporate chiefs begin selling \\"options\\" on such contracts, with implications for one of Emperor Gregor's empire worlds. This is a far future detective story that deeply explores the social implications of \\"putting off\\" real dying in return for enough money. What I loved tho was the depiction of family life issues and the street people that Bujold paints in a far future where society is far from perfect, there are the rich and the poor, and a rejuvenated Miles has his own health issues to deal with. Bujold gives her readers a tale of adventure, but it is a tale that is not adventure-linear. It branches out into a spider web of relationships, including Miles' memory of his own children, how his family members could be harmed by the bad guys he often pursues, and his realization that all that he does for Gregor is really for the future of children everywhere in the empire. For me, this was a wonderful \\"adult\\" expansion of Bujold's Vorkosigan saga. Highly, highly recommended.\\"guys he often pursues, and his realization that all that he does for Gregor is really for the future of children everywhere in the empire.

B0083DJWGO|1.0|....i am not sure where to start .... however the bottom line is that i think if there is something as a bad book ... this comes terribly close<br /><br />it only takes a few pages to get the notion that the author really doe stink highly of himself and certainly does think this needs to be shared with everybody<br />however that would not be so much of a problem, if it would not be for the fact that well, the latter are missing<br /><br />at time he does make an attempt to hide this feature, by random quotes of what ever sources,<br />however if you do put in the effort one does find quickly that those facts are often very skewed views

B003TXSF5C|5.0|This is the smartest guy on the planet. He is racked with ALS, can only speak through a synthesizer, has been wheelchair bound most of his adult life, and he still finds wonder in everything. His key message is about “conceptualizing” the ultimate core design of the universe. While I could only scratch the surface of his ideas, his sense of wonder and awe were amazing. He gives me hope. However I am sure that there is a significant portion of our citizens that would find him useless.

B001IWL2D8|5.0|I have always enjoyed Roth even if his books sometimes get a little too ethnic. This one is his masterpiece. It is one of the great books of the last century. It is a story about the perception and reality of happiness and success.<br /><br />The hero, Seymour Levov, is the son of a successful glove maker in Newark, New Jersey. It starts at the end of the 2nd World War. Seymour is fair haired and blue eyed, the greatest athlete in the history of his high school. Nicknamed &#34;The Swede&#34; he is a legend in his community. He is almost too perfect to be true. He sets every record, joins the marines and, when he is discharged, marries the stunningly beautiful Miss New Jersey. He goes on to take over the management of his father’s business, makes a fortune, buys an historic home in the country, and hobnobs with the Yankee bluebloods of New Jersey.<br /><br />Our narrator, Nathan Zuckerman, was friends with the Swede’s brother. He meets the brother at their 45th high school reunion and mentions that he had lunch with the Swede. Zuckerman goes on to tell the brother that the Swede was everyone’s idol. The brother just laughs. “I’m here because I just came from my brother’s funeral. He had a horrible life.&#34;<br /><br />Thus starts the tale.<br /><br />At the age of 16 The Swede’s incredibly obnoxious teenage daughter, Merry, blows up a post office in their small town as a protest to the war in Viet Nam. The explosion kills a small shop owner. Merry goes underground and continues her terrorist ways, setting off three other bombs and killing a total of four people. But appearance have to be maintained. How does a perfect family deal with this? How do they explain to their own families and friends that it is not their fault? How do they reconcile the fact that their daughter has insisted for years that her parents and the values they represent are the root cause of all the suffering in the world? Why is it wrong to work hard, to succeed and prosper, and then try to makethe world a better place?<br /><br />The factory falls into disrepair because The Swede cannot get or keep the skilled craftsmen he needs. Newark becomes a violent, lawless husk. His marriage falls apart. At the end of the book the Swede discovers that his perfect wife is having an affair with one of the local WASPs. The daughter returns. She has embraced some manic eastern religion whereby it is forbidden to eat or bath. The family is destroyed.<br /><br />This perfect man is vilified by his daughter and her proxy, Rita Cohen. These are easily two of the most obnoxious characters in fiction. The lovely Rita toys with the Swede saying that she will arrange meetings between himself and Merry if only he gives her money or sex. And through it all she viciously mocks everything the Swede stands for.<br /><br />What the Swede stands for is the question. Is it wrong to work hard, to be successful, and to want those things that we believe will make us happy?<br /><br />It is a story of the fifties and the sixties. The rhetoric is shrill but insistent. I found it a tough book to read because the Swede’s questions are, in many ways, my questions.

B00064WSNW|5.0|I was a King Crimson virgin when I heard this album back in 1981. Honestly, I couldn't get my head around it the first handful of listenings. But then something clicked and it all made sense. A wonderful, mind-blowing, intoxicating listening experience. Of course you had Fripp and his guitar, but the secret weapon on this album (and the two that followed) was Adrian Belew on vocals and guitar. To my mind, his presence was what really lifted this album into another realm. And because of that Belew factor, I never did go back in time and explore the older King Crimson albums. Maybe that's my loss. But I loved this album then and I think it still holds up as a classic. Sort of like a progressive rock meeting of the newer \\"alternative\\" sounds of the early 80s. And those sounds; the angry bursts of guitars, the persistent drums, the feverish rhythms, all bubbling and steaming, and then sometimes shifting pace and simmering down to a soothing, tranquil vibe. Enjoy it all ... and play it loud!

B00000016K|5.0|What with gold prices the way they are nowadays it somehow makes those of us with the old mofi 24-carat cds regret not getting more of them when we had the chance to and for me I'll just have to settle with the ones that I do have such as Daryl Hall & John Oates' \\"Voices\\", Supertramp's \\"Breakfast In America\\", Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and now this: the best sounding version of Cream's \\"Wheels of Fire\\".  Having heard the more recent SHM release I have to say that this DCC gold set still trumps it for overall sound quality.  Sure the compression on the former makes the overall volume louder and as a result certain details are more evident but the reduced dynamic range is a costly tradeoff and for me the latter release allows the recording to breathe more and hence comes across much warmer.  This is not to say that the former is poor sound quality but the compression means too many bass notes sound muddy or so close to overdrive that it affects my overall enjoyment of the whole listening experience.  Give this fan the DCC Gold which for now for the reasons mentioned above remains my favourite sound quality-wise.<br /><br />I've always thought \\"Disraeli Gears\\" to be Cream's best album but after a few listens, I'm actually finding myself liking at least disc one at least as much if not a little better than that other classic rock jewel.  \\"As You Said\\" would not sound out of place on a Pearl Jam album and is my favourite track here just for the overall uniqueness of the sound and the whole album unsurprisingly has a very psychedelic almost Sgt Pepperesque feel about it given its 1968 release.  \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" reminds me of The Police's \\"Be My Girl Sally\\" a little bit because of the monologue but I enjoyed this track a lot too.  Clapton's cover of the late great Albert King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" while not quite as good as the original is still a nice track in what is overall a great album.  I didn't enjoy the live second disc as much although I thought \\"Crossroads\\" was fantastic and worth the purchase of the whole set alone.<br /><br />This album is required listening for all aspiring rock guitarists and together with \\"Disraeli Gears\\" surely ranks among the top 25 all-time great classic albums of all time and this DCC Gold release for the sound quality alone makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!ught \\"Crossroads\\" was fantastic and worth the purchase of the whole set alone.<br /><br />This album is required listening for all aspiring rock guitarists and together with \\"Disraeli Gears\\" surely ranks among the top 25 all-time great classic albums of all time and this DCC Gold release for the sound quality alone makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book was very different from what I was expecting, which was a \\"teenager\\" book.  However, that made it intriguing and kept me reading.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This CD rocks.  I became a Deftones fan after the release of Diamond Eyes, but have been into similiar artists for years (Alice in Chains, Filter, Tool, etc.).  Diamond Eyes really rocked my world and I couldn't imagine this band coming up with another CD that could come even close to that one - but was knocked out by Koi No Yokan after listening to it a few times.  I am a huge fan of the screaming and rage, but then the more ballad type songs blow me away and leave me feeling haunted...like \\"Entombed\\" and \\"What Happened to You?\\", which seems to me to be a song about Chi Cheng.  This band is so talented and multi-faceted - I HOPE they stick around for a long, long time.  Incredible, amazing, a MUST buy for any true industrial/metal/alternative junkie.
B006CEYM3Y|5.0|Trajan is a game with fascinating mechanics and a plethora of different ways to score. The times that I've played I've intentionally pursued different paths to victory, they all seem to be viable, provided that you and an opponent aren't both focusing on the same path to your mutual detriment while another opponent continues on their path without competition.<br /><br />The mancala mechanism is particularly fascinating as it controls what moves are available, when you can trigger your Trajan action and speeds or slows the game. If you enjoy Feld games, you'll enjoy this game. If you enjoy Euro games without strong thematic integration, you'll enjoy this.<br /><br />Oddly, my favourite game is Agricola, which I feel has a vey boring theme, yet it is so well integrated into the mechanics of the game and has such replayability that I love it. In fact I vastly prefer highly thematic games. Despite this preference I think that Trajan is a great game. Out of a collection of ~50 at the time of this writing I'd probably put it in the top 5.

0765325950|1.0|After thirteen books and however many thousands of pages (10,000-15,000?) all building up to this Last Battle, this is basically about a 50-page (at maximum) conclusion, with 600 or so pages being an often equally confusing and repetitive medieval battle on a massive scale. Characters seem to be introduced out of nowhere just to be used for a brief description of a certain aspect of the fighting. The massive battle itself becomes something I was waiting impatiently for to progress in any way. One hundred pages could've easily been taken away from the battle and given over to Rand vs. the Dark One, and I still would've been unsatisfied.<br />And, again, after thirteen very thick books in the series leading up to the Last Battle vs. the Dark One, the Dark One itself is evident on a pathetically small number of pages. I'm glad I'm not a much bigger fan of this series, otherwise I would've been infuriated upon finishing this book.<br />This won't turn me off Sanderson's writing by any means, but this book is as unsatisfying a conclusion to an epic series as one could've possibly not have wished for.

Here is a gifted person that has pushed the envelope beyond a point where most of us would consider going and lived to tell about it.<br /><br />The book opens with a great story down in Arkansas but then spends a bit too long about him as a youngster and his parents.  The second half is much more entertaining.  I have found myself relistening to Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters and Bo Didley and how innovative they were for their time.  I've gained a new perspective on their influence over the sound that formed the foundation of the Stones.

B00ADIT8U2|5.0|99 cents was well worth it to inspire my daughter to start studying electrical engineering.  She and I played the game from beginning to end in about 3 hours.  She kept on saying how much she loved it and how fun it was.  As a person who studies Tesla, the game didn't cover much about the history of his life, but it did inspire her to listen to me rant about him until I had to command her to sleep.  \\"Can you tell me more about Tesla on Saturday... I'll just listen all day\\" she said to me.  The game inspires, challenges and teaches.  As a side note, My Inventions by Tesla should be made into the next video game.

B008M36EEI|5.0|It's an interesting character contrast.  One has strongly voiced an opinion about it's impossiblity, whereas, the other's &#34;faith&#34; leads him to believe in it's possibility.  That's mixed in with conflicting personal relationships of wife and husband versus woman and lover.  Very interesting ending!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Not usually one for war stories, but this is absolutely amazing.  A line from M*A*S*H said, &#34;You should have to meet somebody up close and get to know them before it's okay to shoot them.&#34;  These are the men who should be lauded, not the ones with stars on their shoulders who stay safely behind the lines and send others out to die.
B008E374PO|5.0|10/10 would buy again, great to listen to on a long drive to pass time. Perfect gift for my sister
B008LVCKH6|3.0|Excellent believable and very funny introductory chapters wherein the reader easily identifies and sympathizes with the old man, quickly followed by highly improbable and unbelievable series of events which become farcical and difficult to appreciate in their protracted zaniness. Somewhat unoriginal too as the reader is readily reminded of the main protagonist 'Gardener' in Peter Seller's 'Being There'  and even worse 'Forrest Gump'.
B00ARI9CDQ|3.0|Very easy to use and a nice layout for reading and skimming headlines but crashes about 20% of the time I use it on my KindleFire.

B008XG1X18|4.0|It is pinterest for my kindle, which is great. The app in and of itself leaves a little to be desired though.
B005NFJAMG|2.0|This is a pretty good movie with a good cast. I was able to get this for $4.99 so I thought I'd take a chance. The Blu-Ray quality to me was not that good at all. I actually thought I was watching a regular dvd most of the time. I watched parts of the regular dvd I have right after watching the Blu-Ray to see if there was a difference. There really was. This is better than the dvd but still not a great Blu-ray picture. After seeing Avatar in Blu-Ray this can't even come close to that. One good thing is the Blu-Ray is about 20 minutes longer than the dvd. My dvd was only 1:52:00 long & the Blu-Ray is around 2:12:00. The sound seemed ok but I listen through external speakers hooked up to an older stereo system. This is in the 2:40:1 aspect ratio which I also like. There are no extras with this Blu-Ray. Some would have been nice. It looks like they cut every corner they could to put this out as cheaply as they could. For the price, I guess I can't complain too much, but come on guys you can do way better than this. The 2 star rating is for the quality of the Blu-Ray & not the movie. The movie I would give a 4 or 5 rating.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book kept my interest. The only thing I didn't like is that it wasn't long enough. I finished it in less than 24hrs!
B003KGBIS4|5.0|A spiritual journey for three dysfunctional brothers after the loss of their father turns into something unintended and different.  Sounds pretty basic.  Plot-wise, it actually is pretty basic.  That's what I enjoy so much about this film.  It is stripped down Wes Anderson in India.  And on a train.<br /><br />The three main actors all do great jobs, with Adrien Brody being the only real new-comer.  They each have traits that make them perfect Wes Anderson characters:  Rich,  entitled, rude, brutally honest, mean, and deceitful.  It makes for great on screen chemistry and the pay offs to the rifts build up nicely.  Bill Murray's cameos are brief, but crucial to understanding the film.  Angelica Houston is marvelous, as usual.  I can't think of anyone in the film that I didn't enjoy or that didn't work in their role.  One thing I will say though:  If you're looking for higher answers from the overall story, this isn't the place for you.<br /><br />The cinematography is worth the Blu Ray purchase, alone.  The transfer is remarkable and the sound is also great.  The music is noticeably louder in the music only scenes, but that's a good thing.  Criterion did a great job with HD quality for both audio and visual.<br /><br />The bonus features are good but I found the documentary about the making of the film to be a bit too artsy and not actually that good at really giving us any insight from any of the actors or the director.  It's very literally a documentary film that captures on-set moments of clearing crowds, or getting action shots in a busy street, or Wes Anderson in a white suit.  And it's not exactly short, either.  I won't review anything else in the bonus content.  I just had to bring up that weird documentary.  So...unhelpful.  But it won't take any stars away.<br /><br />I think anyone who buys the Criterion Blu Ray of this film doesn't need to be told anything I've written here, but just in case, I hope this was helpful.  Buy more Criterions.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|OK I admit, time-travel films are hard to grasp but I am also relatively intelligent. However, even if you dismiss me, my husband is a freaking genius AND a film junkie so we both could not demystify the plot. It was good. It was enjoyable. there was no way I would have not finished watching it and I have no issues stopping films half-way if they are going to waste my time but alas, I am still not happy with how it all ended. But it had Bruce Willis so really, why am I complaining? :)
B002SR2PKG|4.0|It is a great way to get reading materials.  I can read it and my family all have access to the purchased book on their Kindle devices.  It is a great book.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Although they are unlike my usual fare, these three books proved impossible to put down.  Fast paced and intelligently written, the plot twists and surprises seem only marginally contrived.  Characters are people you care about.  Even though all the action takes place in Sweden, aside from the unpronounceable names, it could have taken place in the US.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I give this order a five star rating. This was for a gift and since all the seasons were available in one set it made shopping easy and quick. The price was actually better than what I found in the local stores and my order arrived in a timely manner. Will order again with thru Amazon.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I would really like to play this game, but my kindle just won't download it!  making me mad. GRRRRRRRR.............. So dumb!  I can download the free version, but I'm sure its not as much fun.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Our 11 year old Granddaughter, who is a barbie collector and also a Hunger Games fan, she has read all three books, was thrilled with this doll.  It was combining her two favorite things and was a big hit as a Christmas gift.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|It's entertaining and the perfect flick for a girls night at home.  Definitely a chick flick!  Enjoyable but may not be Oscar worthy.  Ha Ha
B004WKI204|4.0|Tina shows us some insight into what happens behind the scenes in TV world. Very enjoyable<br />I loved how she doid not take herself too seriously.
B008MM9630|4.0|Fun game but wish you could gain energy faster. But I do like it. Higher levels should be a challenge.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I had trouble putting this down, even though it was aimed at a young audience, I really enjoyed it. I saw the movie after reading the book and they were very faithfull to it.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I really like this game.  It's kind of mindless, so for me it's a good stress reliever.  The color is fantastic on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm not into competitive gaming, so this game is perfect for me to just sit back and have fun.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I loved this movie even while watching it shoved into the front row, very last seat on the left of the theater.  I knew I had to see it again in a different venue & wonderful!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Tears, Cheers, and a few Fears! Couldn't put the book down. So many turns. As a fan of Colleen Hoover, this is her best book yet!
B0053O89RY|5.0|If you have never seen Modern Family then you need too. This is the third season and it is as funny as the first.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|My wife loves this CD. She watches the show all the time and plays this in her car every day. Great product, great price.
B008OUTQ6C|5.0|The cd is great. She is a mix b/w Amy Winehouse and India Arie! Great sound quality too from Amazon.comas usual!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Exceptional! Can't wait each week for the next episode!<br />Every episode is just as exciting as the last was. Can't<br />wait for the DVD to arrive.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Still have to try it out in other than a home environment, like an airport or a train terminal to check the availability of Wi-Fi services.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Its pac man...so it is fun BUT...You will have to pay if you want to keep playing.  I don't recommend it.  Would be nice if you could get daily games for free or something...just putting it out there.
0765325950|5.0|It was a great ending to an epic series.  I'm not sure why there are so many 1 star reviews.  Brandon Sanderson did a fantastic job bringing closure to one of the most fantastic stories ever told.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|The item was shipped very quickly, had no visual defects in packaging or on the Blu-ray itself and played well.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My young reader loved this book!! It was worth the wait. We just wish the wait wasn't going to be so long.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjyoy playing the solitarie game.  It's nice to have when just relaxing after a long day of work to be able to set back and enjoy a game or two.
B006G2124E|4.0|i wanted to rent this movie, but couldnt, so purchased!<br />good movie, i enjoyed it!<br />i would recomend this movie!
B00846REIS|4.0|I am upset because I read the 2 installments of the Crossfire series and I have to wait until May, 2013 to read the final entry.  I will go back to read this series in April even though I won't forget these books any time soon.  I like Eva the heroine but Gideon could have been a little more open.  I got mad at him a lot.  Would I suggest this book to others. . . I already have!!!  Waiting for May is like a child waiting for Christmas. Hurry, Hurry, Hurry.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|i would recomend this movie. meryl Streep is a very good actress.<br />the move was interesting, educational and entertaing all at the same time
034580404X|1.0|I did not like the books...actually only read the first chapter<br />of the first book....was NOT impressed...it was pretty filthy!
030759565X|5.0|I love this book, i'm a foodie who loves to read cookbooks and try new recipes.  But i'm not in super hard or too complex things.  This book is perfect.  I alot of variety, ease of instructions and great tips.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I love this mans voice, his style and the songs he chose for this Christmas CD. I love Christmas music and always get a few new CD's each year. I must say this is the one I kept going back to time and again this Christmas!
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Not a big fan of Sci-Fi, but a good movie for kids and groud childrens...my wife loved it.<br />I would see it for the fun of it!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Love this voice - if you liked Van Morrison of yester year, you will enjoy this. Always like to hear new stuff from the older generation, when music was music!
B004GYY714|5.0|Tune in is very accurate and works awesomein my Kindle and Android phone.<br />Highly recommended to reach most radio stations arround the world.<br /><br />Elias
0345529057|5.0|Bought to read the story behind the TV series. So glad I did. I understand the characters so much better now.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Keep you nailed to the chair thought whole movie with fun.<br />Love the charcters and the voices!<br />Worth to watch it.
B007RI56NY|1.0|I can't move this music to Google play with the rest of my songs. It is stuck in Amazon. Cloud and it plays, but I can't hear it. I wasted my time and money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't stop reading this book. Loved all the romanticism. Been married for thirty five years and this book made me want my husband in a way I haven't wanted him for years. I think he enjoyed me reading this book as much as I enjoyed reading it. Cannot wait to read the second book.
B009A882D0|2.0|Great song variety, but not good listening quality going thru the speakers.  I guess what can you expect from the 60's.  Better to have remastered.<br /><br /> However overall, nice addition to my song library.
0316224588|2.0|I was so looking forward to the return of Rebus, after being bored out of my wits by the two books featuring the teetotal non-smoking Fox. I must say, though, that the story was a disappointment. The opening of the tale had so much potential, but it just dropped off, with most key points unexplained. Once Rebus solved the mystery of the first disappearance (all too easily), nothing was explained about the connection between it and the subsequent disappearances. There was no explanation of the meaning of the photos sent to survivors of the victims. There was no explanation of what motivated the responsible party. Fox of the Complaints was unbelievably hostile to Rebus and his capitulation was too facile and easily achieved. Great holes in the story and the ending seemed to indicate that Rankin got bored with the story early on and just ended it as quickly as he could. Rebus and Clarke deserved better than this! And Cafferty? I didn't believe for a minute that he could have become such a pussy and given way to young Christie, whose rise in the crime world came out of nowhere and nothing. Sorry, Mr. Rankin, I just didn't buy the whole setup. Sad. Very sad.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Fantastic story, well drawn characters, interesting issues, so much said in so few words.  Love Picoults writing and her characters are always so well developed.  You see the best and worst of them all.
B000KIPT30|5.0|AS advertised works great. I use it for Spanish translation services. They say they hear the messages very clear. Thanks for a great product.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is simply an amazing film with great acting, spetiol effects, and the music fits the movie perfictly. If I could, I would have sex with this movie... but i cant, so I'll just watch it when ever I get a chance. Love this movie and highly recomend it to comic book fans, action junkys and sci-fi geeks like myself. What are you waiting for... BUY THIS MOVIE ALREADY!!! It is worth every penny.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|This is a really good movie, but it probably doesn't deserve five stars.  The problem is, I gave so many other movies four stars and this movie is better than that.  It is a good sports movie and a good relationship movie.  Any time you have Clint Eastwood involved, you have a good movie if not a great movie.
1444723537|5.0|This is a terrific collection from King's earlier years as a writer and show his true mastery of the genre. They are four quite different stories, yet they all share a common theme - a man displaced by society and doing what he can to combat the forces closing in around him. Yer all four are vintage King - raw, surreal and honest.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great as usual. Josh Brolin is right on as the younger K. Nice twist to the story.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|This is a lot of fun. It takes some time to get used to the movements but once you have it down,,,,, FUN!!!!<br /><br />Love to show off when friends are visiting
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Love the music, sounds fresh without being too out there.  The main single, Its time, is fantastic rock out music for those of us who are tired of hearing about Beiber and other crap...  Demons is also excellent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg where do I start. Ok this takes the first book and throws it out into the wind. When they make the movie they have to make it into two parts because there's just so much happening in it,but this is one of the best books I have ever read it brought me to tears so many times. I can't wait to read the next book.
B007R41E8O|4.0|I really like this game! The graphics are good! This game is so addicting! Once you start playing it you don't want to stop till it's done! Then you're just sad
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a great book. You felt like you were the recipient of the letters. I loved it. I give it five stars!
B006U7WY6U|5.0|A wonderful classic, Tony sounds like he's 20 years' younger much of the time.  Just nice to have him available when one needs to reminisce.
B00A17P7OQ|2.0|Yossi is a sequel to but not a continuation of [[ASIN:B0001KNHAO Yossi & Jagger]], and I don't care that this movie doesn't carry that romance to new heights of ecstasy. This is a story of what happens to Yossi later in life, and the fact that ten years later Jagger isn't still an integral part of it is both normal and fine with me.<br /><br />What does offend me greatly is the way Yossi is presented as if his being over 30 and slightly heavier than an anorexic fashion model makes him gross and repellent, incredibly lucky if any man even slightly younger or thinner looks at him without vomiting or at least sneering. Obesity is far too extreme a term, and even overweight is unreasonable. Yossi is a normal size, and he is by far the sexiest man in this movie. It's any other man who's lucky to get him, not the other way around.<br /><br />The movie's second great offense is Lior Ashkenazi, as Yossi's pseudo-friend and fellow cardiologist Moti. Somebody in addition to Ashkenazi himself evidently finds him overwhelmingly attractive, but not me. I can't stand him. The most disgusting, most infuriating movie scene I've seen in years has him bringing a girl into the bar restroom where Yossi is peeing and trying to work up a sleazy threesome even though Yossi clearly isn't interested.<br /><br />I know Moti is supposed to be disgusting, as are several others in this movie; but I already know that most people - especially straight men (and, unfortunately, most young gay men, like a smug, insufferable jerk Yossi meets online, and even the supposedly hot but arrogant and ugly soldier Tom who forces himself on Yossi near the end) - are disgusting, and having offensive behavior rubbed in my face doesn't entertain me.<br /><br />I love Ohad Knoller, and the older and beefier he gets the sexier he gets, but he's wasted in this sadly and annoyingly shallow movie. Eytan Fox laid an egg this time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was very good reading and he is a good writer. I have read many of his books and they are always great.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is the spirit of Christmas!! Old fashioned but still just as special as ever.  I think he is Santa Claus!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|of course I love harry potter and this movie does not let me down. I had this movie two days after ording and loving it!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If all you want to do is watch the movies, this set is perfect.  We weren't interested in any special features, so this set is just right for us!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This game is obviously a copy off of 'Temple Run', only harder and boring-er. I guess it might be fun to some people, but I don't like it.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My grandson wants all &#34;angry bird stuff&#34; for his birthday into weeks. I assure he will love this. Shopping made easy for a grandma.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This film about the life of Venerable Pope John Paul II is brilliant. I was totally absorbed in how he navigated all the issues he went through and how he overcame them with love!<br /><br />He really is a truly great man, a modern saint for us all to look to for guidance.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|This album has a good pressing. I never got into the white stripes or Jack White but the album is terrific. LOVE the song \\"I'm Shakin'\\"
B00AREIAI8|5.0|iv been waiting forever for this app. it is by far the best horse app out there. the graphics are beautiful and realistic. its far better then horse life. I love that you actually do the competitions.
B007IE4DT0|5.0|George Harrison was my favorite Beatle. So I got the vinyl album without knowing anything about it. I was not disappointed. The tracks are demos and very interesting to listen to.
0007270968|5.0|I read this book in less than two hours.  For the all out Gordon Ramsay fan, this autobiography gives you some insights as to what his life was like before rising to fame.  Although I'm sure he doesn't disclose everything about his past, this book was informative and entertaining.  I would definitely recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was great I couldn't put the book down. I really loved and enjoyed this book. I can't wait to read the others
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|We have watched this now about 50 times and it never gets old.  What a great storyline for kids and adults.  My kids have watched this over and over since Christmas and they just love it...I actually love it too!!<br /><br />Kids ages 5 and 2
B002NT3B52|3.0|There's good information inside the book,  but it takes forever to get to it.  I'm having a difficult time finishing it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I LOVED this book, but I think I might have missed something.  I have gone back and read and re-read it twice now and I think I am missing the ending.  Other than that the book is amazing and I would read it again
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful ending to The Hunger Games. Suzanne Collins keeps everything moving and interesting to the last page. I loved the trilogy!
0802473156|5.0|I just read this book after years of having friends recommend it to me.  So glad I did. Chapman does a great job of explaining the way we relate to each other in relationships.  I would highly recommend this read to anyone who is in a marriage, especially for those who are having difficulty or considering divorce.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|He does not cover a lot of ground or topics, but he does what he does well! Worth it for so many songs.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has come full circle.  Her first album has all the &#34;t&#34; sounds at the end of words.  I found it annoying.  Her second album was so much better.  This album is unbelievable.  You would not put this one in the same league as the other two.  What is she going to do for the next one???
0321898648|5.0|This is my first Apple Pro training book on Aperture that I find going through the book page by page with the activities has been fun. The instructions are clear and easy to follow while it also gives enough practice to most features of Aperture. Aperture is definitely different from similar leading program(s) however, author Dion had laid out this course sequentially and is less confusing and gets from interesting to engaging half way through the book. On the whole this is a book that every new Aperture user must get their hands on. Looking for more from this author in future for any updates.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Taleb's book is a must read. In particular, it would provide 10th grade and older students with a balanced view of life, explaining how and why experts are so often wrong, and how an individual can 'proof' themselves against superficial advice.<br />Worry about experts quoting experts!<br />The subject of stoicism is not examined outside academia. Pity, its lessons are universal.
B000002KLP|5.0|Buy this cd because there are songs that are not on his greatest hit cds. The songs are:<br /><br />1. Head<br />2. Sister<br />3. When You Where MIne<br />4. Party Up<br /><br />When I purchased the cd from Amazon, it was cheaper than the album I had years ago. And in good condition and delivery less than 2 weeks.
0385751532|1.0|There are many things that disturb me about \\"The Boy in The Striped Pajamas.\\" After reading it for the second time I decided to look into other readers' thoughts and feelings about this book. I started reading reviews of this book by Amazon customers and I found myself shaking my head in disbelief long before I reached the well over 100 reviews I ended up reading. I thought to myself that I must have read a different book from the customers who wrote their reviews. The reality that became obvious to me is that so many people do not even know the most basic facts about The Holocaust, and here more specifically about the concentration camps. This speaks to the reality of how little if anything people are taught in school about The Holocaust and that general populations around the world eat what is spoon fed to them whether they be lies or the truth. Then they continue to spread misinformation to others, or simply don't give a dam about the annihilation of millions of peoples only 65 years ago. \\"The Boy in The Striped Pajamas\\" is a historical novel. Although it is a novel it is incumbent upon the author to not cloud, twist, or change facts of history, and especially not facts about a time when the goal of human beings was the total annihilation of millions upon millions of other human beings. I suppose if people do not know the truth and the facts about The Holocaust that their high praise and lust for an emotional and unique story could be understood. What the author and publisher of this book did is an entirely different matter. When writing a historical novel research must be done by the author in order to preserve the truth and facts of history. It seems unlikely to me that this author did not do enough research about The Holocaust and the concentration camps to know that what he was writing was at best a disregard of truth and facts. It seems more likely to me that this author did do research about The Holocaust and CHOSE to ignore and disregard the facts in orderto create a fantastical tale of impossibility that he knew would sell like hot cakes. One would think that a major publishing company would do its due diligence in order to not pervert verifiable facts of history, and that it would not knowingly publish a book that would make a mockery of history. One million copies of \\"The Boy in The Striped Pajamas\\" were sold as of just a few days ago. Clearly the sale of one million books took and takes precedence over not annihilating the truth and facts about the millions of human beings who were annihilated, as well as in essence, spitting in the faces of the very few who did survive. - Elizabeth Danzig Teck
B00004ZAV3|5.0|When I was little, I seen clips on them on tv shows. When cable came out videos, that was when I was exposed to more of their music and hearing songs I never seen clips of like &#34;Love Me Do&#34;. I don't want to buy every cd they made. I just want their classics and this cd fits the bill.
B007HIEBV2|5.0|This is my first step into the Electroswing genre, and boy I was not disappointed.  I was brought to Caravan Palace after seeing their excellent video for &#34;Dramaphone&#34; on their website.  What makes this album so strong, in my opinion, is the variety of tempos and samples from song to song.  It never feels repetitive, but always has a consistent voice.  Great stuff all around, a great buy.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Just okay, had its moments, fluffy storyline, comedy sporadic.  I need 11 more words this review is stupid.  La la
B009LY72LQ|3.0|Bought this as a gift for a friend's daughter, but the pieces don't always stay together and the Hair is almost impossible to keep on the dolls head. She still loves them though
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Well written and he speaks from the heart about his experiences in combat and life.  A true American who served his country an  the great state of Texas.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|This game continues Jack's quest to return to the island. It is very much like the first pirate adventure, so if you liked that one, you should be happy with this game. They did shorten the dialogue, and there aren't as many mini games, but the rest is the same: find hidden objects, find the differences and find matching pairs. You can disable the timer (turn off countdown mode in options) and you won't get tap penalties. There are 18 chapters, and it took me about 2-5 minutes to complete each chapter, but I didn't rush.<br />This is strictly a hidden object game, not point and click. The game is nothing fancy, but I had fun playing. The gameplay is relaxing (some may say boring), you don't have to think too much, and it's just a nice game for all ages.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love, Love Love Downton Abbey!!  I would highly recommend watching season 1 first. Very well acted and oh that castle is way cool!!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This Magic Academy is more difficult than the first one. The characters talk a lot and OUT LOUD this time, so that is very annoying. The objects are much harder to find, they added all kinds of tasks within each chapter and tried to make this more of an adventure mystery game.<br /><br />I think this game was OK, at times it was a little frustrating to figure out the right order of what to do and what goes where, but there are hints and I managed to complete every chapter. It played well on kindle fire with no glitches or problems placing objects. I finished in about 3 hours. Suitable for all ages.
B002ZG980U|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I like Christopher Nolan's work on Batman, but it wasn't Batman. It was his narcissistic interpretation of the character. Inception, was an awful movie. It had potential, but the way that it deliberately tries to turn viewers off by overly complicating the plot is just ridiculous. Dreams within dreams? That's when people got lost. Just stick to one dream. Ellen Page really hurt the movie as well. She's just a person that walks around with her nose stuck up in the air, and can't shake that smarter than thou attitude. Really obnoxious person, in general, and a poor actress. Marion Cotillard is also terrible. She can barely speak English well and just is a horrible actor. Without Nolan, she wouldn't get a job in Hollywood. I just couldn't recommend this movie to anyone, because its goal is not to entertain, but to confuse the viewer completely.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great set to buy for the Batman seriers.  It is worth the money, and cheaper than most stores.
B0093QDGEO|4.0|I love all the puns they make about hollywood doing remakes of all the old movies and not having any new ideas or creativity. Great action pack, chemistry and fun!
B003INBOE2|5.0|We got it faster than expected and great movie to watch.  This movie would be good for people who like action and martial arts.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Whimsical & Fascinating!  Once I started this book, I could not  put it down!  I hope that a sequel will soon follow.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy really pulls in the reader, me my two daughters and husband are currently reading this.  It is a  must for a very good  I would say kinda of mysterious read.  Would recommend!!!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love playing with it and I love the color when my kid gets older I will so let my kid play this game or look at it to see all the color
B004HW7JI8|3.0|It's okay if I was a bit younger and more into teenage drama rich kids.<br />kind of a story but my eldest daugher seems to enjoy it.  More for<br />the younger audience.  It's okay just keeps you gessing over and over<br />who the real killer is. and it just keeps going.  not for my viewing anymore too<br />much drama......
B006PAZMMK|5.0|This was a great deal on one of the best EP's I have heard in a while. The product was well worth the money
B007TK77QE|3.0|Love Jk, so bit disappointed, not finished book yet but finding it very confusing, too many characters to keep track of! :(
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|I got this game because I received a gift card, I had money to spend on apps. I gave the Campaign a try and, although the controls are difficult, especially on an 8.9 inch tablet, I very much enjoyed it. It gets 4 stars because of the controls.
0061733199|5.0|I'd probably repeat other readers to compliment this book. I loved it so much I gave it to my brother for his birthday. Pair it with a local map with elevation and a guide to edible plants in your region and you may be good to go for information.<br /><br />For some reason this book has jumped from $13 to $50 in the past few days. I have no idea why. If money was no object, I'd buy it for $50. Too bad I gave my copy away to my brother (expecting I could purchase another for $13).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was well written, lovely and entertaining book.  I felt as I was in the book, feeling t h e emotions.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a long book, but I couldn't put it down.  The characters are well developed and you can just feel the emotion as the story unfolds.  I highly recommend this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a juicy book that really gets into the nitty gritty of how sick relationships can be and how we hang on out of fear and insecurity even when it's bad news. And I love the constant battle of the wits, trying to out-smart each other!  Would make a great movie.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I hadn't been able to watch it when broadcast the last 2 years because of my conflicting work shedule. I love this movie. I got a little burnt out on my old favorite A Christmas Story (which I will still watch) but nice to mix it up. This is a classic in the making.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Before MCPE came out I had block story, but I can say that personally I enjoy MC better. It has easier controls (especially when building, which was a little difficult on BS), much more fun gameplay, and more crafting. Block story had more detailed graphics, but I like the happy almost-retro blocks of minecraft.<br /><br />I did not have the Minecraft PC version before getting the pocket edition (I do now, anyone know any cool servers??) and even though I was completely new to it, I still became easily hooked.<br /><br />You may have to look up tutorials on how to use some of the controls, because, unlike BS, this game comes with no instructions. This actually kinda adds to the fun of figuring everything out, though, so I'm not complaining.<br /><br />It works great but there are a few bugs- in creative mode, the game once just randomly froze my kindle and I had to reset it. After it loaded back up, all of my worlds had been deleted. I waited a few minutes and loading it back up, and just like that my worlds were back. Also, after activating the Nether Reactor, the world I activated it in keeps freezing in the same way. ._.<br /><br />Either way, it's an amazing game, try it NOW.<br /><br />(BTW, I played this on a kindle fire.)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just when I thought this was a run of the mill easy read I end up reading 18 out of 24 hours because I couldn't put the book.down. Amazing!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|Another true story of a dog's love and loyalty to his master. Well cast and produced.  In the same category with Greyfriar's Bobby.

B00846REIS|5.0|I read 50 Shades twice only because I could not find anything else. I read this and loved it. I even liked it better than 50-I liked Christian but loved Gideon seems more mature and sexier! I disagree with some other readers I don't think its a remake at all-the billionaire is the only real similarity. Completely different stories. Very hot steamy sex and a lot of it! I thought it was a really good story, fast paced and kept me wanting more. I literally could not put this down - in this case JUST LIKE 50. You want to read &#34;Reflected in You:A Crossfire Novel for the next part and I can't believe it will be May before Entwined - sooo looking forward to seeing what happens. Worth your time and money.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Thanks to Adam Brown for serving his country with dignity, excellence and tenacity!  Thanks also for his fellow soldiers and family for telling his whole story and inspiring the rest of us to persevere in our faith and patriotism!  Well Done!
B008Y212PI|5.0|very good game, but you have to review to get all the puzzles. that is about the only downside. this one is just as much fun as the free ones and has way more puzzles
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Excellent Price , Great Item for Kindle Fire , Perfect Match Up My husband loved it , it was a Christmas Gift
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great Book! My only time to read is in the evening when going to bed after a long day. I found myself getting ready for bed earlier and earlier just so I can get back to this book. I really enjoyed the twist and suspense. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good book.

B0082Z1CVQ|2.0|I had trouble keeping the girls  apart and after reading for a while found myself bored. I did not finish it.  But I do not read a lot.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book, can't wait to read the rest of the series.<br />Going to read the series before I watch the movie(s).
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I loved the musical and ,hey, they did a good job with the movie too but you can never capture everything in the book.  For example, the bishop who shows Jean Val Jean his first real kindness is such a rich character in the book but only plays a brief role in the musical.  In the musical we know very little about Fantine and what brings her to her circumstances but the book meticulously describes her story and the fineries of her character.  These are just a few examples and don't even begin to address the depth of French history in the novel.  It's well worth the investment of time to read!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game was  very good entertainment. I had a lot of fun playing this game it was NOT frustrating at all it was nit to difficult but it does not have levels
0785163174|5.0|I got this as a Christmas present, and couldn't wait to pick it up and start reading it. I missed the entire comic series due to college, and this omnibus definetly made up for it. If your interested in getting this, get it here, b/c its about 40.00 cheaper than what i have seen it for in my local comic shop.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|While somewhat predictable, it had some surprising moments. McGregor was excellent as usual. Not Academy Award winning, but worth the viewing.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I was looking for an app to organize my files on my kindle fire and this app was perfect! I was able to add links to my &quot;notebooks&quot; so I could have all my pdfs and word docs organized by  class for college. It's also a bonus to be able to decorate the pages instead of just staring at a boring white page.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an amazing book... I was on my toes the entire time. I finished the book just a minute ago and right away I started searching to see if there was going to be more movies. I was so excited that catching fire is coming out soon, but I was also mad because of the fact that it won't be until November 22nd that it come out... errrgggggg I just can't wait!!! I have to say, I think I'm officially obsessed with the hunger games.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I had heard so many good things about this book.  It started out so promising, and there were many nights I stayed up to continuing reading it.  But it all just fell apart.  It ended horribly and I can honestly say that I utterly disliked the whole book because of it.
B006OFN0SE|3.0|The movie itself is great..Dicaprio played it so well that  I forgot that he was acting and it was not J. Edgar himself...but I thought I had purchased a new copy...not a copy from some public library.
B004U8ZH8S|4.0|Enjoyed by my teenage grandchildren who would ordinarily disdain such fare.  Beautifully rendered.  A positive Lasssiter production of superb craftsmanship.
B009FXIICK|5.0|A simple no-brainer game. Connect three things in a row. Fast paced and fun! High level of replayability! I keep trying to beat my high score of course 113,000 for now!!
B008HTQ28K|3.0|I found this book rather ordinary, not written with the fire and excitement that he used to write with.  I probably would not recommend it to anyone, unless they are totally bored and had nothing else to read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Somehow missed this series all this time so tuned into season 3 and then promptly realized we needed to see the 1st 2 seasons!  Good decision!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another great book by Grisham. Interesting characters and plot. Grisham has a way of gripping my attention and holding it throughout the book.
B008KNZ6X0|5.0|Not much in the way of plot or acting, but if you are looking for excellent martial arts action with some serious suspense, I would recommend it.
0765316889|5.0|I love this series!<br />I would recommend to everyone who loves to read!<br />I have read the WoT series by Robert Jordan and when I read the last few books I fell in love with Brandon Sanderson and looked for more of his writing--Glad I did!

B003O86FMW|5.0|well worth reading the entire series--keeps you wondering what our society is like.<br />the movie version is ok but the books are much more worthwhile
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Has comedy science true facts comic book talk! This show has a little bit for everyone! You'll love the characters as you follow them and how they progress with in the story line. Every character is unique and brings their own sense of comedy or dram to the table work the buy!!!
0670451495|5.0|great story for all generations-I had it read to me when I was a child; I read it to my children and now I'm passing it along to the next generation
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Young Victoria is a beautifully done film.  No stuffy speech and the acting of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend is wonderfully restrained and poignant.  None of the overacting we see in so many historical/drama/romantic movies.  The costumes are gorgeous!  A must see.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I liked this product when I had my andriod phone. It settled a lot of disputes (bets) on the name or artist of a song being played.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|This is a lovely story that is gentle in guiding people to accept themselves and others.  Christina Ricci does a great job of telling the story of a young girl uncertain of her looks and how she finds her way into the &#34;world&#34; and breaks the curse.  A definite fairytale for the 21st century.
0375869026|4.0|I bought this book for my grandsons but decided not to give it to them until I've read it.  I started to read it, but have not finished it. What I've read I like; however, I'm curious about how Auggie looks.
B00004XOWM|1.0|thank God that the whole rap-metal scene died down! \\"rap-metal\\" is no substitute for real metal. and that closet queen diva fred durst should go sing wit da Village People! i am docking one star just for Fred Durst being on this! the other 3 stars are subtracted because this crappy record is just a contrived record company caca scheme.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have enjoyed this series.  It`s not just for teens<br /><br />Have enjoyed this series. Not just for teens. Adult fantasy readers will enjoy this series too.
B000005GWE|4.0|it's heavy, smooth, and sublime all good stuff here. the music gets heavier and more complex and the cd progresses. if u like dis, check out trio of doom by john mclaughlin, jaco pastorius, and tony williams
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I really could not stand this book. It kept coming up in forums / lists for those that liked 50 Shades. WTF? Just because Travis knows how to fight doesn't mean he is a strong male lead. Continously he wimps out and backs out, surrendering the woman he loves. Turn. Off.  50 Shades... he SEIZES the woman. Hot sexual tension. You keep unwrapping / discovering more about a complex male character full of his own demons. What possible comparison can there be between these two books I can't imagine. I got to 50-60% of the book and then I started skimming. By that point all there was to know about Travis all laid out. The endless breaking up and bickering between these two was so damn boring (after most breakups/reconciliations you learned nothing new, just same old problems/doubts/fears/blaaaaaah), without even good sex scenes to make it worth it.  Endless cycles largely due to an idiotic female lead and wimpy romantic male lead. I just don't get what is considered sexy about this book. I don't. I skimmed to the end just to say I finished the book but I was bored out of my mind.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|my grandson loves it. even though its hard for him to play. if he has fun that's all that matters. its a fun little game.

B00A6RVRXG|3.0|With no news about Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon reconciling their relationship circulating, it's probably safe to assume there won't be another Sonic Youth album for a while. Thank goodness for Yo La tengo then, who now remain one of last bands still making music together who were around during the inception of what came to be called Alternative Rock. Yo La's continuing existence is not simply something to rejoice for sentimental reasons though, because most importantly like the NYC veterans they have consistently put out records of such a high caliber throughout their lenghy tenure that we'd be severely impoverished if they also decided to finally pack up and call it a day.<br /><br />\\"Fade\\" is the latest offering from the Hoboken favourites and although it doesn't quite round off what could have been a trio of brilliant late career releases it's another solid effort from a band that couldn't suck if their life depended on it. Stylistically \\"Fade\\" falls somewhere between their last out and out masterpiece \\"And Then Turned Itself Inside Out\\" and the slightly underrated \\"Summer Sun\\". If you've heard those two records you'll know by that descriptor that this is Yo La Tengo in ambient mode; soft organ drones, hummable guitar melodies and whispered vocals are all delicately splayed over the ten tracks on here, aside from the clattering krautrock indebted opener \\"OHM\\".<br /><br />These songs are all sweet and undenaibly pleasant but do feel a little too familiar at times, almost like Yo La have tweaked previously existing material in their colossal back catalogue and tried to repackage them as something new here. In fact i'm pretty certain that's happened subconciously on almost every Yo la Tengo album post \\"Fakebook\\" so it would be unfair of me to criticize them for being self referrential on principle, as it's a formula that's definitely been working for them for well over 20 years! \\"Fade\\" like the previously mentioned \\"Summer Sun\\" is just lacking a little bit of inspiration that's all and therefore it's relatively indistinguishable amongst their mostly brilliant pre-existing discography. Still, tender heart warming moments are smattered all over \\"Fade\\" and it's approachable nature make it a fine entry point for newcomers and a satisfactory purchase for long time fans.
0316224588|5.0|I'm sad!  Very sad!  Not because I did not like Rebus's return but because I could not stop reading Standing in Another Man's Grave...  What a comfort to visit once more this irascible old friend and the people, with whom he interacts, often to the point of just being a tack in their back sides.  Now I need to search for another diversion...  What a pleasure to bump into Rebus and to delight in his antics!  More, please and soon!
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Saw the second season first and totally intrigued. Can't wait for the third season but lacking that, ordered the first season and got to know the characters from the very beginning. Fascinated by them all. Great show.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Lots of air play at home and in the cars.  Another piece of solid work from Fagen.  Too bad the album was so over-priced, CDs are sonically challenged.
B005LAJ16I|3.0|It took me three episodes to begin to get interested in the characters. I don't like red-haired men so that takes warming up to. Grew drawn to the love affair between the two leads but hated Danes becoming goofy at the end of the season. Pretty convoluted plot that turned me off.
B005VPRDAY|3.0|It's a box of Lego's, what more can I say? Arrived promptly and undamaged. Lego's are SEVERELY over priced and these kits are a slightly more cost effective way to purchase versus those themed kits (i.e Cities, Architecture, Super Heros, etc). Amazing what a box of plastic can cost. If my kids weren't already into Lego's, I would have started with a more cost effective brand and stuck with it. But, since we need compatibility, we will remain Lego's for now.
B00973902K|4.0|My daughter's dance team used this song and she really wanted a copy of it.  Great tune, kinda catch myself singing along
B00AIBZM40|5.0|Mama is one of those movies where you end up saying to yourself, \\"Golly gee, I feel just a little sexy,\\" after seeing it! This is absolutely ironic because this movie is not a p/o/r/n feature at all, but, rather, yet another vehicle to give Jessica Chostein's fledgling career a major, main-event push. I think that Mama probably fits into the family-film genre, on account of its heartwarming message and moralistic storyline.<br /><br />In essence, Lucas and Annie are a couple that's liberal and just shacking up with each other instead of being married and doing the relationship thang right. You could say that they just enjoy having sex with each other. Their wholesome relationship, however, is turned upside down when Lucas' two nieces are found in the woods by some Girl Scouts. They are promptly taken to live with Lucas and Annie, and then that's where all the awesomeness starts.<br /><br />At Lucas and Annie's house, they begin to do all sorts of weird sheet, almost like they were raised by wolves or something (which they probably were). They scratch the furniture, sleep at the foot of the bed, and drink water straight from the toilet bowl. In short, they are turning into disruptive, liberal kids that need to be spanked 24/7. So what do Lucas and Annie do? They start to discipline them by slapping them, beating them and, yes, making them watch Rachel Maddow on MSNBC as a last resort. All hell then breaks loose, though.<br /><br />As soon as Lucas and Annie begin taking revenge on these kids, the poltergeist that really raised them and was their \\"mama\\" begins to take revenge on...Lucas and Annie. It starts to have sex with Annie, and then coldly leaves her alone in bed when the morning comes, without even calling her the next day!! B/a/s/t/a/r/d!!! It also starts to have sex with Lucas, embarrassing him by forcing him to prematurely e/ja/cu/l/a/t/e all the time. The movie ends with social services finally taking the kids (named Sasha and Malia) away from Lucas and Annie, as Lucas and Annie are left to have sex with the poltergeist in perpetuity.<br /><br />This movie is easily better than Schindler's List and The Exorcist put together. One thing I absolutely loved about this movie was the Boyz II Men song \\"Mama\\" being randomly played all throughout the movie at the most unexpected parts, probably once every 5 or 6 minutes. I felt this helped the flow of the film tremendously, so more power to 90s R&B, yo.<br />Please see this movie if you enjoy good-quality, family-friendly movies. Now that Obama's being inaugurated again soon, you should finally have accumulated enough Obama Money to afford seeing this film in a theater near you!nie, as Lucas and Annie are left to have sex with the poltergeist in perpetuity.<br /><br />This movie is easily better than Schindler's List and The Exorcist put together.

B0090SI4KG|5.0|The Last Stand is a movie that must be nominated for 2014's Oscar for Best Picture or at least shortlisted for that. The reason is that Arnold Schwarzenegger himself puts in a performance worthy to net him the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Oscars, the People's Choice Awards and even the Golden Globes. When you read my review of his mighty fine piece of thespian method acting, you, too, will understand why.<br /><br />The plot is simple, which alone should give this movie plaudits because it follows the \\"Keep It Simple, Stupid\\" formula. Schwarzenegger plays a retiring border sheriff by the name of Gerhard Knoblauch, and his deputy is none other than another equally highly regarded method actor, Johnny Knoxville. Together, they make up the law enforcement team in the tiny, American border city called Los Brokeback. They have to face a drug cartel boss called Felipe Calderon, who busts out of an American courthouse to hightail it back to his homeland of Mexico, that cesspool of murders, drugs and unbelievably unfettered corruption in all walks of society (are Club Med's down there still honoring coupons?)<br /><br />Of course, it's up to Knoblauch and Knoxville to stop that burrito from making it into illegal alien land, AKA, Mexico. The plot unfolds in such a seamlessly perfect way that explains why I'm calling for acting awards for Schwarzenegger. For example, every time Schwarzenegger opens his mouth to, I presume, deliver a line or two of dialogue, there is always this ungodly-sounding, thick, unintelligible Austrian accent that distorts everything and makes him speak in non-stop broken English. I mean, for an actor to be able to produce this fine piece of showmanship that has him looking like he's an Austrian refugee who's only pretending to be an American actor is breathtaking. Absolutely breathtaking.<br /><br />And don't even allow me to start on that brilliant supporting thespian named Johnny Knoxville; he is easily a cross between Lionel Barrymore and Jack Nicholson! Throughout The Last Stand, Knoxville's character comes up with increasingly intellectual ways to try and stop the Mexican burrito drug lord from making it back to Mexico. For instance, in one pivotal scene, Knoxville actually staples his balls/a/c/k to some cattle, which promptly stampede away, thereby elongating his body part. In another equally high-minded scene that is extremely relevant to the highly complicated plot development of this movie, Knoxville actually staples his butt cheeks together, then shoves a toy car into his a***, all the while dangling out of a helicopter and bungee jumping. All of these actions of brilliance work to actually stop the Mexican burrito from making it back to Mexico, thereby allowing Knoblauch to apprehend him and send him back to where he belongs (Barack Obama's White House, which makes him a citizen through the Dream Act!!).<br /><br />Folks, please, please, please do yourselves all a damn favor and see The Last Stand. I know, I know, I know that you probably have no money at all since Obama has failed to bring the unemployment rate down from January 2009, when he was inaugurated, but you at least caught a break through Obamacare, which raised your healthcare premiums! Yes. If you want to see the greatest movie made in the last 70 years, see The Last Stand.k Nicholson!

B000022TSY|5.0|If you can't handle the counter culture movement of the late 60s and early 70s and all that went with it (hippies, drugs, free sex and communes) I suggest staying away from \\"Easy Rider.\\" For everyone else, this is an excellent period piece from 1969 that explores the nature of freedom and the quest thereof.<br /><br />Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper star as Wyatt and Billy, two hippies who travel by choppers from Los Angeles to New Orleans to attend the Mardi Gras. Along the way they experience gorgeous landscapes, a commune, jail, new friends, unexpected enemies, drugs galore and a whore house when they arrive.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson stands out as one of the friends they meet; while the beautiful Karen black & Toni Basil star as two prostitutes in New Orleans.<br /><br />What makes \\"Easy Rider\\" great is that it's more than just a road adventure with a modern Western garnish (i.e. cowboys on motorized \\"horses\\"). The film has depth that separates it from the typical biker flicks of that era. It's really about freedom or the lack thereof. Wyatt and Billy certainly have some grasp of freedom - and they desperately pursue it - but they're ironically so shackled by their OWN carnal desires and growing addictions that the most they attain is a piece of it. Wyatt laments near the end of the film: \\"We blew it; we really blew it\\" as he realizes freedom has slipped through their fingers like water. Nicholson's character, George, has more of handle on what's going on, but he obviously has his own issues.<br /><br />The hippies at the commune seem to have escaped society's shackles but to what end? There's a reason communes never really caught on in America, and the film shows why.<br /><br />In an interview with Rolling Stone in the early 70s Fonda pointed out that Wyatt represented everybody who feels that freedom can be bought, that you can find freedom through other things, like riding motorcycles across the country or smoking pot. He confessed that \\"Easy Rider\\" is actually about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization. Wyatt and Billy are not right, they're wrong. The only thing the writers (Fonda & Hopper) could do in the end was kill the characters. In a sense, committing self-destruction, which Fonda claimed America was doing. He said viewers often respond to the end by lamenting, \\"Look at those terrible rednecks, they killed those two free souls, blah, blah, blah.\\" But \\"Easy Rider,\\" he pointed out, is a Southern term for a whore's man, not a pimp, but the dude who lives with her. He's got the easy ride. And that's what he claims happened to America - liberty's become a whore, and we're all taking the easy ride.<br /><br />So what's the answer? The answer's there and it's pretty clear, but don't expect me to hand-feed it to you. Seek and you will find.<br /><br />In any event, this might give you some food for thought the next time you catch the<br />film.<br /><br />Some modern viewers with ADHD criticize the film as boring, but I find it strangely engrossing from beginning to end. The climax is equal parts sudden, powerful, shocking and unforgettable.<br /><br />The film was shot in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah (Monument Valley) and Louisiana and runs 95 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: Ay about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Most of the negative reviews of the movie are based on its plot. As a writer, I can say that the plot is actually not bad. There are scenes early on in the movie and you forget about them till the end. Every scene had its purpose.<br /><br />As a writer, I know that some stories are propelled by plot and others by characters. I actually consider this to be based more on the characters. Each of the characters bring something to the plate. The acting was very good, in my opinion. Yes, Robert Downey dominates the screen when he's on, but to me it's like Michael Jordan on the court -- the others did a great job complimenting him. Mark Ruffalo's Banner was not what I expected, but I liked it, and the Hulk was great in the small doses he showed up in. And I loved Tom Middleton's interpretation of Loki both here and in Thor.<br /><br />Related -- I think Josh did a great job with the intro scene of each character. Nobody beats Spielberg, but Wheldon holds his own here. (Though I wonder how much Gweneth Paltrow got paid for her three scenes.)<br /><br />Two movies that can be compared are this and Watchmen. Both are superhero movies with half a dozen heroes that last two and a half hours (the cast size may . To me, Watchmen seemed like it was that long. I didn't look at the time at all on The Avengers. Watchmen was a drama/character study with action; this was an action movie with drama/character study.<br /><br />I watched Iron Man and Thor and bits and pieces of the second Hulk movie. I do want to see Iron Man 2, and seeing Chris Evans portrayal of Captain America makes me interested in that movie (though my gut feeling was Thor and Captain America were done to set up for this one.)<br /><br />Now, let me add my Christian worldview. Could this movie be more wholesome? Yes, but not by a lot. The action is what earned this a PG-13, but I'm not worried about teenagers on this one. (I always give the caveat that I believe parents should watch any movie with their kids). Loki gave an excellent picture of Satan and his strategies in this movie (especially his conversation with the Black Widow). And I loved the boldness to have Captain America say there's only one god. (And a comment on Stephen Hawking in addition to that.)<br /><br />I didn't take the time to see it in the theater, but it was worth the wait.gave an excellent picture of Satan and his strategies in this movie (especially his conversation with the Black Widow).

B000OZ0NXA|1.0|One of the worst books I've ever been exposed to. The plot is stupid, the characters are cardboard cut-out stereotypes, and the main character does the most ridiculously unbelievable things. One example - he kills two men who are following him, seemingly the first people he has killed, or at least the first ones as a civilian, and just walks away from it to go hang-out with his police officer girlfriend who is not at all concerned that he killed them. It makes zero sense start to finish. It is simply not worth writing an in-depth review of - too much time wasted on it already.<br /><br />Thank you Audible for implementing a returns policy - this book was the perfect candidate for it.

They are incredibly invested in the characters and their stories. The moans of disappointment when I put it away each day show more emotion than having to miss recess. As an adult, I read ahead because I just couldn't help myself! This is an amazing story and something that not only engages young readers, but is a story they can relate to on many levels. There are not enough good things I can write about this book, you just have to read it for yourself!

B00966TN1Q|5.0|This was a compelling read, and a real page turner with all the usual attention to detail and process that makes these books so special. Bosch has become more human, less superman-meets-troubled-soul in the recent books and they are the better for it. It's interesting to see how his daughter is becoming more and more like him and bodes well for future stories. The only fault I could find is with the poor English of the Danish contacts, which didn't ring true to me - a different nationality would have worked better perhaps, to that end - but that's a small thing and didn't impact on enjoyment of the book. The police politics piece was covered brilliantly as always. Bosch just gets better and better.

B001EBV0OY|4.0|The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it is 2 hours and 22 minutes long, and builds slowly. I liked this very much. My students, however, were mostly unable to concentrate on a movie like this. It is a sad commentary on the attention span of the social media generation, but I think my students are fairly typical and that many readers will want to know that if you are not a reader as well as a movie-goer, you may find this a bit challenging.

B008AX1HD8|2.0|It's easy to see why this is the last of Nesbo's Harry Hole books to be translated into English. The characterisation is flat and stereotypical, the plot is ludicrous and the book way overlong and poorly edited. The Australian setting stretched credibility and the Harry Hole character seemed to be missing something when deprived of the Oslo backdrop. Poor stuff, not a patch on the later novels.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I had the audio version of this book (which is read really well, by the way). I won't put in any spoilers, but the story did not support the ending. My wife and I listened to most of this travelling on vacation. The trip ran out before the book did so I stayed up late and finished it. We played the final chapters the next time we travelled so my wife could finish, too. Hearing the end for a second time didn't help but I could see the attempt the author made to work in supporting details to make the final outcome more plausible. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. We were both disappointed. My wife said, \\"That's it? It's over? Why didn't you just tell me?\\"
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Love the audio version! Strongly recommend to readers / listeners of all ages. Hope they do the rest of the series in audio.

B007THA4FI|4.0|If you insist on a happy ending, do not read this book.  If you insist on sympathetic characters you can relate to, do not read this book.  But if you are intrigued by the idea of getting J.K. Rowling's caustic take on English village life, The Casual Vacancy will pull you in with a cast of characters who are highly varied in their selfish and opportunistic reactions to the death of, apparently, the only decent man in the village.  In truth, there are a couple of teenagers and a junkie who will spark some sympathy, despite their own bad behavior, because they are arguably more sinned against than sinning.  I found myself caring what would happen to them, and even what would become of some of the more venal characters.  Most were entirely believable, although occasional unmotivated cruelty by adults sometimes rang untrue.  Involving right up to the, you guessed it, bitter end.

1455523003|5.0|If there is one thing people should learn in light of the Lance Armstrong scandal is that hero worship will make people delusional.  Regardless of what comes out, people will defend their idols to the very end.  Even after Lance Armstrong's very own admission to cheating, people are STILL defending the bastard by justifying the means with the ends.  It's mind boggling.  And the sad reality is that there were a few detractors from the very beginning.  People who KNEW what a fraud Lance Armstrong was, and tried to sway the masses to get over their delusions.  I commend the bravery of those people, because in spite of it all, they risked their reputations and sanity for the almighty truth.  More so than these frauds, they should be rewarded for their unwavering conviction.<br /><br />And this is where I come to this book and Hitchens.  It's mighty unsavory for anyone to hear that their idol or role-model is a straight up fraud or an a#@hole.  But, for the person making these claims, it's possibly a death knell.  To come out so boldly to challenge a highly regarded icon, an institution as well, with convincing evidence and arguments makes me admire Hitchens more so.  He is like the early detractors of Lance Armstrong.  He is the voice of reason, and yet, sadly, there may never be any resolution to the enigma that is Mother Teresa like there was to Lance Armstrong.  That is, no matter how well written and convincing the Missionary Position may be, it is no Oprah Winfrey.  Regardless, that shouldn't dissuade you from reading this book.  It is an eye opening read.

1451695195|5.0|I believe Dr. Eben Alexander experienced a wonderful super-physical afterlife when he was in coma. This proved the existence of human soul and heaven.

This provides some evidences of prelife. Human body is just like a precious clothes for soul.<br /><br />I am an electronic engineer from China. I am not good at expressing myself besides English is not my native language. It is hard for me to write such a wonderful book as Dr.Eben Alexander.

Soul not only goes back to heaven, but soul also comes from heaven and be infused into baby's body just before birth.<br /><br />Only a small percentage of people experienced the afterlife.

B005LAII80|5.0|The world of MegaCity started in a comic book series called \\"2000 A.D.\\" in 1979 as a black & white ink outline style.  It was a British/Spanish artist's idea to create a new sci-fi comic off the heels of '77's Star Wars craze, because Sci-Fi was not selling well in the comic market.  The fan-favorite character in the comic was \\"Judge Dredd,\\" labeled as the \\"Judge, Jury, and Executioner\\" in what the Brits (emphasis on Brits) felt as a \\"right-wing\\" Fascist Police State mentality at the time.  (Fascism is more of a Left-wing thing, actually...Big Government telling you what to do and how to act, etc) But anyway, some of the uniform and symbols of the Judges and Command Central were big Eagles, which have been symbols of European Fascism thru-out the centuries (Roman, Nazis, and to an extension America.)  The stories in 2000 A.D. and Judge Dredd have generally been more about everyday life in MegaCity and the surrounding Cursed Earth areas, rather than just on Judge Dredd, so the stories are pretty much endless.  Dredd is just there to clean up the mess.  Which leads us to the story portrayed in this 2012 Dredd rebbot film.<br /><br />In Dredd 3D, we have a MegaBlock (a 200-story cubical shaped towering mass of concrete with a open central core for sunlight and ventilation purposes surrounded by businesses and slummy apartments) called 'Peachtrees,' that is being run by the Ma.Ma Clan.  A drug clan ran by Lena Heady's character whose drug of choice is Slo-Mo (a drug that slows your brain's perception of time down to 1% of real time.)  Their rule is ruthless and involves some very graphic actions of murdering poor folks that get in their way.  Well, in a Crime Call to the Judges that involves the murder of 3 Judges in Peachtrees, sends Dredd and his new female Rookie Judge into this MegaBlock to investigate.  Well, to make a long story short.  The Ma.Ma Clan lock-down the MegaBlock, trapping Dredd and his partner inside, with a bounty on their head. So the rest of the film involves them trying to get out and killing as any bad guys as they need to.  Think Die Hard with an all-purpose hi-tech 9mm auto-pistol.<br /><br />But what makes this Dredd so superior to Stallone's '95 outing, is that it adheres to the dark and gritty atmosphere of the comics, along with a bright, but gloomy (and grainy) comic book color palette, akin to the Ray Stevenson \\"Punisher: Warzone\\" film. This film actually looks like you're watching a live-action motion comic.  And quite frankly, it works brilliantly.  The slow-mo parts (4000 fps) also emphasize this comic book feel.<br /><br />Unlike the '95 film, this one absolutely deserves a follow-up....telling an all-new story, as this story wraps up with the death of the villian.  I'd love to see them go into the Cursed Earth Saga.  That'd be cool as hell.  Maybe not in the next film, but perhaps in a 3rd if this iteration goes that far.lm involves them trying to get out and killing as any bad guys as they need to.

B0057UA486|5.0|Quick delivery. Quality was exactly as advertised. Thumbs up. Can't say much more cuz when people do exactly what they promise these days they should be recognized these days I guess.
B005LAII12|1.0|I was told that this was a very funny movie, I was misled, it isn't close to being funny.  It's stupid and I should have realized that before I bought it but I used to think that the person who recommended it had some degree of intelligence.  I guess I was mistaken.  This would be a good movie for children if it weren't for all of the profanity.  Actually it sort of bridges the gap between being a good children's movie and a bad adult movie, or maybe not.  If you are thinking about buying it, don't.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I was concerned about how well this would work, but we have had great luck. It works wonderful in our smaller room. We have had no problems with it...a charm.

B000FBFN1U|3.0|Kind of a combination sci-fi / midevil fantasy book as is the whole series. Interesting read though sometimes hard to follow as it's written from the perspective of each character one at a time. have to admit there are always plenty of twists and turns.

B007M45PMU|4.0|This was an easy to listen to album.  The one stand out song would be Ho Hey, which is probably why people are looking at this album.  The rest of the songs are good.  This didn't end up as one of those albums you buy for the one song and the rest stink.  I thought they were all nice and I enjoyed listening to it.

B000LTAY1U|3.0|Updated:  It just died one month shy of three years -- this is pretty good on my wrist.  I'm nortoriously hard on wrist watches, and this one performed reliably until the day it died, keeping pretty good (not as good as a battery watch) time, losing three or four minutes a month.  This is an old-school self-winding watch with a spring movement, but unlike the old self-winding watch you can't actually wind it via the stem.  So if you're like me and don't wear it all the time, it stops running.  It doesn't have much of a spring -- even after a day's wear, it won't continue running for a full day on the dresser!  If I had realized this watch had a spring movement (which you can't actually wind), I wouldn't have bought it.  Beware.  If you wear the watch full time you'll like it.  The price is right and it looks good.  But for me the spring movement presents a bit of a problem: Each time I want to wear it it has stopped and has to be reset -- which means not only setting the time, but the day and date as well, which takes a bit of doing.  I foolishly assumed that no inexpensive watch today has a spring movement.  A word to the wise: &#34;Automatic&#34; means self-winding, not battery-driven.  I'm adding this after a couple of months' use: The watch is quite accurate -- not as accurate as most quartz crystal battery watches, but good enough that  I don't need to keep resetting it.  It's about a minute fast in about a month.  But I question why Seiko chose to put a spring-powered movement in an inexpensive watch.  It's yesterday's technology and since it can't be wound it via the stem it requires pretty consistent wearing to keep running.  Update: I've given in and now wear it full-time (except when I put on my &#34;fancy&#34; watch for a night out -- it has enough spring for twelve hours or so on the dresser).  I'm hard on watches and in the past my spring movement watches have always failed, usually within a year.  It's been about a year and this watch is still doing fine.  As I noted, it's not as accurate as a crystal movement watch -- it runs a bit fast and needs to be reset every month or so.  But I really like the way it looks (and its price) so I put up with its inaccuracy, but still wish it had a crystal movement.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Excellent to have an old favourite return to Star Trek TNG!  Great story and loved that the old favourite's daughter may become part of the storyline - sorry I'm trying not to spoil the story for those who haven't read it yet!  This trilogy is very much worth reading.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Graphics are super but wish weapons were a little cheaper love the character choices and type of weapons just great
B001B68XRY|4.0|IF you like Adam Sandler movies you will find this is a good watch.  I liked the original Longest Yard but my 2 teenage boys wanted to see this version.  I am a huge fan of Happy Gilmore but never saw this film because I had been duped by several other Adam Sandler movies.  My boys thought it was hilarious and I did too at times.  Worth a rent.
0765325950|4.0|WOW what an ending!<br /><br />I miss the characters already.  Can we have a small get together to let us say goodbye? Banquet?  Funeral?  After so many pages over 16 years, I want to spend some time just enjoying the characters without all the endless squabbling and positioning over who has the most power, or title, etc.  Maybe that's what this posting is all about.  I'm not ready to say goodbye yet.<br /><br />Egwene: awesome job Amyrlin!  Way to go.  One of the few Aes Sedai with a focus on the big picture!  Miss you already!  Love your statement.  Was rooting for balefire to reverse the clock somehow.<br /><br />Lan was the eventual highlight reel.  Classic hero, almost cliche, but I like it.  You got to sheath the sword to accomplish the mission sometimes!<br /><br />Where was Morraine and Nynaeve?  After so much conflict they disappear.  Mat heroically saves Morraine as the primary plot of the last book, but she only gives some advice and pats Rand on the head at the end.  Would love to have learned more about what she experienced, how perceived things etc. rather than all the time on Androl and Pevara, or the hundreds of pages of non-stop trolloc charges.<br /><br />Which brings up another potential rant!  How can you raise millions of 9 foot beasts without grain or food supplies, and the human populations only have 1/10th their numbers with 10X the land?  Never remotely explained.<br /><br />Demandred and Graendel were cool villians.  Finally they kick some butt.  Seem much smarter and more well organized than the forces of light, who have no real plan, no spies in the enemy camp.  The Sharans were hinted at in the appendices of a later book, and I wondered why until they popped up at the field of Merrilor (reminded me of Fields of Pellinor from Lord of the Rings).<br /><br />I am saddened by the death of so many friends, so suddenly, and abruptly.  Siouan and Gareth, you deserved more.  Gawyn fought off 4 supernatural assassins but couldnt scratch Demondred?  Good try though.<br /><br />All the endless shifting around from Perrin was confusing after awhile, and sort of labored.  Get on with it. When I see how many other key characters got short changed, its hard to imagine why so much time chasing Slayer around for three books or more.  Wasnt that complicated at the end.<br /><br />Well, thanks for a long, enduring love-hate relationship with some great characters (love) and some tedious or annoying filler (how many dresses were described?  How many arguments about trivial crap? Can anyone grow up other than Lan, Garyth, or Rand?)

B000JZ3TYA|4.0|Michael Douglas once again allows a pretty girl to draw him into dangerous waters, expose his flawed thinking, then provoke him to marshall his forces to fight evil.  The twist is that she turns out to be a pawn in an even larger scheme.  The last 5 minutes becomes a little silly, but there is effective tension and suspense along the way.  A \\"playa\\" gets \\"played.\\"

B004GHNIRK|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  I purchased this ebook to save my tattered paperback.  The translations included are a plus!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I really like this app. ive read the other comments and I went and checked the terms of service, and everyone is right, they can access your personal information. For me this isn't a problem because I don't keep personal info on my kindle or ipod (the only two devices I own that have this app). however I don't reccomend getting it if you plan on putting it on a device that has contacts or any other personal information on it. its pretty simple and easy to use, but I haven't rippled it with data yet so we will see if it decides to delete everything or not. over all for me its a pretty good app.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|[First draft of my review appearing in Jung and India, Spring: a Journal of Archetype and Culture (vol. 90, Fall 2013, guest-edited by Alfred Collins and Elaine Molchanov)]<br /><br />Still attracting full houses to its stunningly beautiful 3D visuals, Ang Lee's Life of Pi (2012) is a largely faithful cinematic rendering of Yann Martel's fantasy adventure novel (2001) of the same name.<br /><br />Born a Tamil Hindu in the former French enclave of Pondicherry, Piscine (Pi) Molitor Patel, named after his Uncle's favorite swimming pool in Paris, becomes obsessed with the meaning of life and seeks his answers by \\"converting\\" successively to Christianity and Islam, and attempting to hold on to all three religions simultaneously. Unlike his indulgent mother, the skeptical father, who owns the town zoo with its prize Bengal tiger, sees this as a sure formula for inextricable mental confusion. Repulsed at first by the irrationality of the faith, Pi is irresistibly drawn to the sacrificial figure of the crucified (Son of) God and his Eucharist.<br /><br />Circumstances oblige the family to move with their animals for a better life in Canada, only for their Japanese freighter to capsize in mid-Pacific. When the raging tempest finally clears, Pi finds himself the sole human survivor adrift on a life-boat with a wounded zebra, a female orangutan, and a spotted hyena. After the frenzied hyena has mortally mauled its defenseless fellow creatures, the hidden tiger suddenly springs forth powerfully from beneath the tarpaulin to finish off the small time terrorist.<br /><br />At the far end of his odyssey, the adult Pi describes himself as a Catholic Hindu, who teaches Kabbalah at the university. Instead of attempting to make sense of the unlikely ocean-crossing in terms of the author's spiritual quest, some otherwise educated commentators seem obsessed with figuring out the most favored path, through what may be characterized as `religious' bean-counting. Internet Hindus, for example, are not quite sure whether to feel proud that Patel remains a steadfast practitioner of their ancient all-inclusive dharma ('religion') or to accuse Piscine instead of being a treasonous proxy for a sly U-turn by his Western creator. For, having earlier praised Vishnu for bringing him to Christ, he now thanks the Preserver for coming to the rescue in the avatar of a fish that he kills to nourish the tiger and himself. But why would a story of traversing the ocean for 227 days with a Royal Bengal Tiger make any listener believe in God?<br /><br />Taunted as \\"Pissing\\" at school, he shortens his French name \\"Piscine\\" to the more respectable \\"Pi\\" and strives to prove his intellectual prowess by working out this foundational fraction to its umpteenth decimal on the blackboard. But the Cartesian brain that deliberates upon and resolves the most complex equations is but the cortical appendage to a spinal column that remains rooted in and sustained by the most primordial instincts. When Pi challenges this menace that has leapt out as it were from the cage of his own unconscious, the tiger suddenly turns its back and literally drowns his self-composure in a rain of urine. Or is it the `Hinduized' Martel's zoo-logic pissing on his own \\"I think, therefore I am\\" Enlightenment rationality? For \\"in that elusive irrational number with which scientists try to understand the universe, I found refuge\\" (p.???).<br /><br />When the Japanese insurers of the freighter refuse to believe such a fantastic itinerary, this sole survivor invents an alternative phantasm of human brutality: he was adrift with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg, and the ship's cook, who killed both sailor and mother to cut them up as bait and food. His Canadian interlocutor deduces from these human-animal correspondences that Pi himself could only be the tiger, appropriately named Richard Parker through a clerical error at the zoo. For the key to this forced cohabitation of socialized man and untamable beast is the ultimate identity of the two.<br /><br />At their first zoo encounter, the still 'innocent' teenager held out some raw flesh through the railings as one might coaxingly to a pet dog. The father disabuses this naive projection of civilized emotions onto the bloodthirsty creature by forcing his child to witness the inevitable fate of a live goat. The 20th century Russian mystic Gurdjieff expressed the inner predicament of the spiritual quest through the riddle of having to transport, one at a time, a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage on a small boat across the river without the goat eating the cabbage or being devoured by the wolf, when left together on the bank by themselves. Here, the mortal challenge for the human steward is to deliver his onerous charge to the other shore without being consumed by his inner beast. Pi is eventually so successful in contriving a modus vivendi--feeding the tiger but not with his own body--that the dangerous pet even sleeps with his head cuddled and scratched on the human lap. Yet, the ungrateful Parker merely pauses, without looking back, before disappearing forever into the thickets, leaving his rescuer somehow disappointed at this lack of acknowledgment. Ancient Chinese manuscripts show enlightened Buddhist monks, though overflowing with universal love, accompanied by a fearsome tiger rationalized to the laity as pacified protector. The happily married Pi, who recounts this 'unbelievable' story from the beginning, has confronted and transcended his own inner demon.<br /><br />The Pondicherry zoo serves to juxtapose the human and animal worlds, preparing us for the confrontation between reason (ego) and instinct (id) within the lone survivor cut off from the rest of society. Beneath this appearance, however, zoology has become the handmaiden of theology. [to be completed]<br /><br />Thrown into the swimming pool at an early age, Piscine owes his survival to the mentorship of his 'Uncle', who was so attached to breathing water that he had to be swung in circles by his feet at the moment of birth to expel the amniotic waters from his lungs. For Freud, the \\"oceanic feeling\\" at the heart of all mystical experience is induced by a regression to the maternal womb, and some subsequent psychoanalysts have emphasized the importance of reliving the trauma of birth and even of 'killing the mother', a motif that has abundant resonances in the symbolic life of Hinduism. Not only does the orphaned boy have visions of his beloved mother sleeping within the wreck at the bottom of the ocean, her orangutan counterpart on the lifeboat is soon mauled to death. For the Life of Pi is an initiatic voyage of shedding one's humanity to confront, embrace, and transcend the beast within. What opposes the silent, sinewy, and beautiful tiger to the garrulous hyena, whose rabid bark is even worse than its repetitive bite, is what distinguishes raw power reduced to its pure, pristine, dangerous, and sacred essence from the petty mutual violence of men. In the 'humanized' retelling, it is Pi himself who finally kills the hyena-cook.<br /><br />Violence here is not so much a question of ethics, much less of cinematic aesthetics, but foundational like 'original sin' (ontological). Hailing from the ancient land that produced the Mahatma and the extremes of Jain self-denial, Pi's vegetarian family has hardly anything to eat in the galley, where they are aggressively taunted by the racist French cook (the visceral Gérard Depardieu) for their almost natural aversion to meat. But adrift with dwindling rations, Pi is before long obliged to sink his own teeth into the raw fish he feeds his ravenous ward. Vegetarianism is deliberately deconstructed on the idyllic island where the bioluminescent algae turn out to be carnivorous to the point of digesting shipwrecked humans, so much so that even the fearful tiger flees back to the lifeboat.<br /><br />A highpoint in the 3D effects is the primordial tiger unexpectedly leaping out from the screen at us, titillated viewers, as though we were the one cast adrift on that endless ocean. On Dec. 16 after having followed Pi's otherworldly itinerary at a Delhi cinema, a young woman tried to take a passing bus back home only to be gang-raped to the point of being disemboweled. Richard Parker, who had seemed so human but refused to become so to Pi's ultimate despair, had pursued her on his senseless rampage...<br /><br />Sunthar Visuvalingam
B001LF347E|5.0|I'm a Medievalist, so, on the one hand, I'm very snooty about my arthurian reading, but, on the other hand, I like to see new masterpieces made out of older works, in the medieval style. This version of the youth of Merlin is very much in the medieval tradition, while appealing to the modern viewer. FIrst of all, it satisfies, like much popular medieval literature, the people's curiosity about the youth of its heroes. In this way is is typical of the medieval spinoff.  It also uses all the old forms of romance and fabliau, but the boys, Arthur and Merlin, are lovely. You wish they would never grow old, and the Dragon is enchanting, although gruff, at times - and who can blame him, being chained to a rock like that! He's much sweeter when he gets free! The baby dragon is adorable! The series is all together charming.
B0094WK9EC|4.0|My friend has been wanting this CD for a long time. I got it as a Christmas present for him. Delivery was extremely quick and I was satisfied with the purchase.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Not quite what I expected but a great story.  I watched it twice to be sure I understood everything.  It was great!
B00005JM02|5.0|Took me months to finally find this in DVD only (not Blu-ray).  Since they received it at Christmas they have watched it dozen's of times.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the book.  It was very entertaining from start to finish. I was sad when it ended. Looking for my next awesome read
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|the game was fun and engaging but a bit short.for the price, I would have expected a little longer gameplay.
B004Y042N8|4.0|If you want something simple to learn, fast to use, and variable in difficulty then this is for you.  I have not yet explored past the classic mode.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I bought this book, having read the summary, and thought it sounded like an interesting story. Unfortunately, the basic idea for the plot was the only decent thing about it. This book is filled with spelling and grammatical errors, showing that the author just didn't care to get it right,  or that they simply aren't intelligent enough to spell correctly. Names change at times, then change back. All of this would be tolerable, if the writing was any good. Unfortunately, it isn't. The characters have no depth, no development, no life to them. The plot is predictable and boring, and everyone the main character meets is automatically good or evil, save one, who switches sides almost immediately, with no real transition. In addition to this, the main character instantly has a \\"very strong connection\\" to each person he comes into contact with. Personally, I feel that I wrote better work in middle school than this book. I am very angry that I spent any money on this, and advise everyone who reads this to read some good Brandon Sanderson instead of this waste of digital space.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I highly recomend this movie.  It was very interesting.  I still can't figure out if this guy is blind or not.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|good game. enjoy playing it in my spare time. have had no bugs or anything so an overall of five stars for me.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I spent hours looking for a case to go on my new Kindle Fire, and decided on this product. I am very satisfied with the fit and function of the case. It's cute, but also does it's job! The Kindle just snapped right into place, and I was ready to rock and roll.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am SOOOOOO addicted to this game!  I think that it is fun, requiring a little skill and a lot of patience, however, being a new player, I am not understanding some of the &#34;little extra&#34; bonuses and techniques of the game.
0307730697|5.0|Normally a (semi-) slow reader, I devoured this book in a day and a half. The writing is good (an issue with more than a few of these more recent SEALS books), but beyond that, after every page and every chapter, I felt like I couldn't put it down.    Adam Brown is the kind of man that we should all strive to be. He was fiercely loyal to not just his friends and comrades, but also to the \\"little guy.\\" I get the feeling that if ever you got to know him -- even a little bit -- he would have your back to the very end, and would do anything for anyone.    This man is a true hero, in every sense of the word. In fact, he tragically was killed after taking enemy fire, but in doing so, he went out in a mad dash, bullets flying the whole time, in order to protect the rest of the men in his unit, who were pinned down.    In the end, he made the ultimate sacrifice with the sole purpose of protecting his friends and fellow soldiers. I can't think of anything more loyal and selfless -- two words that describe Mr. Brown perfectly.    Brown was -- and is -- a man among men, and Eric Blehm, the author, does an outstanding job reflecting who this American hero was. I was truly inspired after finishing this novel.    One of my favorite SEAL books I've ever read -- and there are quite a few!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was hooked from page one.  An honest and funny look at how people find strength they never thought possible.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a really fun app. It has plenty of levels and games to keep you interested. the best part is it was free.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I'm not one for romances so it started out a bit slow for me but then gets intense and I found myself not putting it down!

B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I'm a huge fan if these types of games and G5 rarely disappoints....this was another good one. As always, my biggest complaint is the storyline...I'd really like to see a hidden object adventure game that isn't based in supernatural occurrences and the occult. I don't find it offensive...I'm just bored with it. Otherwise...it was great!

0765325950|4.0|From start to finish, or at least once the battle began, it was just a roller coaster rush.  I would have thought some of the characters could have been handled more carefully. Also, instead of the book being centered on Rand, it became centered on Mat. At least that was how I felt.<br /><br />Sadly, I found at least two instances of miswriting. I have read the series from the very first book, so seeing those two errors really rubbed me in the wrong way. And I thought the ending could have been better.<br /><br />The book somehow made me feel that Sanderson did not really treat this last book as if it was his own.  The one before this was so much better. Here, it just felt like Sanderson was a little careless with it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|One of my least favorite Grisham books. It just went circles; needed some way to condense the moving of the golf.
B008CRC506|5.0|It was a long wait to get SMASH on dvd but here it is and the wait was well worth it.  I fell in love with this show from the first second of the first episode with Katharine McPhee singing the intro to SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW.  I love the theater and was so excited that a tv show was actually going to honestly display what went into the production and making of a musical.  This show is different than any other on tv.  The cast is amazing.  Debra Messing, Angelica Huston and Jack Davenport are stars known for other tv roles and these roles are like nothing they have ever done.  And we get Megan Hilty and Christian Borle direct from the Broadway and theater world.  All shine.  Borle and Messing in particular have a great chemistry.<br /><br />The plot takes many twists and turns and will keep you totally enthralled.  What holds it all together like glue are the amazing musical numbers.  There are some current songs performed but the best are the songs written for the musical MARILYN that the show is about putting together.  And for me the true star here is Katharine McPhee.  I have always been a fan but the dimensions of her musical talent are astounding.  Her voice is strong, beautiful, powerful and emotive.  When she sings BEAUTIFUL tears will come to your eyes.  But what is most exciting is how well she meets all the demands of music within a Broadway show.  Her singing of the show tunes in combination with her superb dancing is the highlight here for me.  She's definitely got the IT factor.  Each episode has shining moments and the whole cast is exceptional but for me the whole season builds to the superb final episode and in particular the closing song.  What a high note to end the season on.  There are only 15 episodes here but they perfectly build a story of relationships, drama, dreams, fears, trials and tribulations while showing all the steps in the making of a musical.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that the show was only released on dvd.  I was waiting in high anticipation for a blu ray of this.  The show with all its glitz and glam and superb musical numbers definitely merited it and I also think all true die hard fans would have gone with the blu ray.  But I will settle for the dvd.  I've already rewatched the entire 15 episodes twice and I highly recommend getting this show on dvd.  And don't think you have to love the theater to like this show.  As stated the acting is superb, and the music will pull you in.  The rivalry between Hilty and McPhee is a fun factor in the season but just a glimpse into the whole story line there is.  I can't wait for season 2 in February!  Ane more McPhee!aiting in high anticipation for a blu ray of this.

142311339X|5.0|My son loves these books so this was a hit for a Christmas present.  It arrived by Christmas which was fantastic.
B004J4X32U|5.0|Everything I hoped it would be. Solid, practical information presented in an easy-to-read way, and with genuine examples (not the &#34;fluff&#34; you often get in this type of book). I've been recommending it to everyone I know and I really believe it will make a long-lasting difference to the way I help my children learn to cope with life and its complexities.
1616960922|5.0|I still think the price for the book is a little much, since it was too short for my taste. But I loved the story, and I hope the author can revisit this world and revisit the characters as a longer novel. I will buy it.
B00280LYIM|4.0|This was a wonderful Percy Jackson book.  I'm re-reading it, and its still my favorite.  Great read,and you should read it goo!
B0049VZ222|5.0|I came late to the game, but finally watched The Walking Dead.  What a great Series so far!  Will definitely keep watching!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I got this flash for my Nikon D5100 and it works perfectly. It fits and locks nicely and provides might better illumination than the built in flash. The mane advantages are speed--it recharges A LOT faster than the built in flash--and the ability to tilt the actual flash unit upwards (up to 90 degrees) which usually makes for a lot nicer pictures. It's also very light and rather small so it doesn't make the camera much heavier at all.

B009JNXK88|2.0|The gameplay is fun and can be challenging and that is why I am giving it a 2nd star.  Beyond that, this game is a mess.  Whenever I play, typically one of 2 things happen.  Either the game freezes or I play and turn off my phone at the end of the day.  When the game has to be manually closed out, and when that happens, any progress made is completely erased.  In addition, when you play this game, after every level you beat, the game takes longer and longer to get to the \\"move on/replay\\" screen.  It can take up to a minute after playing about 20 levels, and that's assuming the game doesn't freeze.  So if you don't mind the delays and inability to save the game if you have to close it out, then go ahead, otherwise you are wasting your money.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This book had 3 different time periods, that went back in forth and I did not like it when I started reading.  If I had not been reading for book club, I probably would not have finished.  It took almost 1/2 way through book to get good.  I usually only give a book 30% before I give up.  However, once I got into it, it was a very rewarding experience.
B009Z5975A|5.0|Nice to re-live your childhood with these flicks and to see the clean-up on blu ray.<br /><br />Ended watching all 3 in one day!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|If you like strategical games, you will enjoy this one. It can be OK for 2 players, but it's way better when you play with 3 or 4.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I use this backpack with my Nikon D5100 and it's been great. It's small and lighweight and can fit more than enough equipment--I can fit my DSLR (with lens attached) + two more lenses, the external flash unit, a number of filters, lens cleaning supplies, as well as another add on or two. The inside dividers are attached with velcro so you can adjust them by moving them around which is a great feature. When you take into consideration the low price, you cannot go wrong with this backpack.
B007A2O3FO|3.0|Nice story with excellent acting and Maggie Smith. Can't get better than that! Nice location and good flip flop between era's
B0041KKYGU|4.0|I saw this movie when it was in theaters and thought it was pretty funny. Raunchy in only the best way! When I found a great deal on it during the holidays on Amazon I had to make it mine! I received the movie and the first time I watched it I found it was a bad copy that kept freezing and skipping. Contacted Amazon who sent a replacement right away- great customer service!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|With twists and turns galore the plot takes the reader on a journey of intrigue and  horror.  Who could have imagined that the murder was a member of Dr. Scapetta's team.  But who?  I've enjoy reading Patricia Cornwell's books from the very first story I  read, which was so long ago.  Now, I must wait for the next book to be published.  Hopefully, my wait will not be too long.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Of all of my kids' iPod games, this is the only one I can tolerate playing for any length of time. Maybe it's the classy music, or the pretty graphics, I don't know...but it's great fun!<br />Works perfectly on my HTC Incredible...
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good book.  Fast read.  The story ended a bit abruptly for my taste but I still enjoyed the story buildup.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|i bought this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson who loves diggers. he moves it around and digs up dirt piles! Also great for the snow piles!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an interesting read. The plot had lots of twists and when you thought you knew what was going to happen the author changed it up. It was a little wordy at times and somewhat repetitive but still interesting.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|50 Shades of Grey was my first experience in to erotica. If you are looking for something to follow up this check out [[ASIN:B00B1V144S Sex at the Sinky]]
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I must admit I'm somewhat new to Doctor Who. I haven't seen an episode of the classic series, and I hadn't followed this show when it premiered, but the amount of friends I have that are Doctor Who fans is immaculate, and the first six seasons of the new show were on Netflix, so I decided I'd start watching the series just to see how it is... and immediately off the bat, I was hooked. As of writing I'm on the third series, and thenshow really is that addictive.<br /><br />It's probably obvious what the show is about now: an alien known as The Doctor takes companions with him and travels the world, dimensions, AND time with his spaceship disguised as a police call box named the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension In Space). Every episode is something new, but from time to old enemies, such as the Daleks, show up. Which is what is really exciting about he show; it's fresh and every episode has you excited to watch what adventure will come up now.<br /><br />The performances are absolutely excellent. In this season, Christopher Eccleston is fantastic and very quirky, very flamboyant as the Doctor. He has a charming personality, and he Makes the season exiting. Billie Piper as the sexy Rose Tyler is awesome too, and really fits into the role, and the acting from her mother and Noel Clarke as her boyfriend Mickey are great too. And the story of each episode is fun, twisty, keeps you hooked throughout. The only drawback is the obviously low budget, but then again, that's just a minor gripe, and is overpowered by the excellent storytelling and great performances.<br /><br />Well, I now officially want my own sonic screwdriver and TARDIS!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a great book!! Keeps you on your toes to find out what happens next!! Can't wait to read the next one!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is a really good way to eat up a bunch of time without having to turn on your brain. I do wish that there was a bit more in the way of achievements and long-term play though. You can complete the full score of the game in a few hours, and after that, all you can do is repeat the same achievements over and over again.
B004WDRSO2|5.0|Great value for your money, Blue ray & DVD included, Brand New.  This is the cheapest price I found online.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|As always Van Morrison is a bluesy rocker that hits all the right notes! Bought this as a gift for my husband and now it's in my car!

B0097UGXFK|5.0|The books were great. The movie was great. Can't wait for the next movie.<br />It was great to see who played which characters from the book.
B00311G2C0|5.0|Got this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it and watches it on her psp almost everyday. Product came earlier than expected.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Was just looking for a good bargain for kindle. Got the sample and had to buy the book immediately. Haven't quite finished yet..reading as quickly as possible to see how it ends!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|If you want to read about the most oblivious, stupid main character ever that has no true conviction and can't figure out what 1 plus 1 is, then this is a good book. You will especially like it if you enjoy predictable plots with retarded supporting characters. What a s*** sandwich.
B004132HZS|5.0|Loved this series! Recommend buying this and sharing with your friends who will be hooked like you!!! Enjoy and share!!!
0765325950|5.0|I jumped on the bandwagon a little late, so I've only been reading the Wheel of Time series for 15 or 16 years (kudos to those of you have been at it since the very beginning).  There were definitely some times along the way when I really wanted to ditch the whole thing, but the last few books, and A Memory of Light in particular, have made me really glad that I didn't.<br /><br />I can't imagine a more perfect ending for this series.  All the major remaining plots were addressed, the major and supporting characters all had some resolution, and the entire book was extremely well written.  There weren't a lot of surprises in this book, but all 900+ pages were full of suspense.  I was pleasantly surprised by the way Olver's character was woven into the plot so effectively.  I'd often thought of him as nothing more than a bit of light comic relief, but I loved what happened with him in A Memory of Light!<br /><br />If you've read the first 13 books, is there really a chance you're not going to read this?  But if you haven't started the series yet and are debating whether you should, the answer from me is a solid yes.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great read from Vince Flynn. Coudn't put it down!!! Hope Vince continues to write great books, will buy everyone of them
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The application is everything you would expect, temperature - weather - 7 day look ahead. My only wish is that it had an allergy watch as well. Tired of having to toggle back and forth between an allergy tool with this one.
141690977X|5.0|Apparently, the information in this book is just what I needed to hear.  Thanks to the authors for taking the time to create it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have always loved this story, I seen a few live versions. I like reading it more, the reason I got it was free.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|My daughter got us hooked on this British Sherlock Holmes series! It's the best series out there. Can't wait for the third series to start!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|great book couldn;t put it down, Nicholas Sparks does it again! Very surprising ending. I recommend for all Nicholas Sparks fans!
1936891026|5.0|I read it in one sitting - couldn't put it down.  A terrific &#34;kick in the pants&#34; as well as &#34;soul-rally&#34; for the struggling writer.  Not only that, but there's lots of really great common sense motivational stuff in here.  Pressfield is a great communicator and doesn't have to use pages and pages to say what he means - I like that.  He get's a potent point across very well, and manages to get down to the nitty-gritty without any awkwardness or apology.  This book is worth the money and very much worth the short time it takes to read it.  The message of the book is worth it's weight in gold!
B004EPYZT4|3.0|This movie is entertaining enough, plenty of action and a lot of violence. The story is somewhat cohesive. The blood spraying out of seemingly every combatant was a little over the top. Rose McGowan is delightful as a villainess. Mamoa was a decent Conan but if you are looking for a classic, stick with Arnold and Conan the Barbarian.
B005LAIISA|5.0|really fun family movie.  the entire family was entertained.  grandma and precious were excellent.  ray romado was funny as always.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a phenomenal book completely blew my mind in eve everyway possible in my opinion probably the greatest boom I've ever read
B0091HVMVO|5.0|The box is excellent.A must for anyone interested in good music and very well interpreted.<br />Some people disliked it, for \\"metadata lacking\\". I can only say this: the subtitle of the box is \\"obsessed with sound\\"...... not with data.... Buy it while is still avaliable.
0525953728|5.0|I got this for my husband, and he seems to really like it.  He is still reading it, but I think it's a good gift!!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I like this game. It good, honest. But... it can be boring. Same as the free one. No updates. The knives SUCK CHEESE! But CHEESE is awesome so bad example. This is a great way to occupy myself and others with the multiyplayer mode. Which BTW DOESN'T WORK! when I tried multiplayer mode it first crashed, then detected 2 fingers at once, after that it showed.... A FREAKING POP UP ADD! WTF? IT SUCKS! DON'T GET! SAVE YOUR MONEY! HIGHLY DON'T RECOMMEND! thanx 4 reading my comment. And remember don't buy. *blows kisses* BYE!
B009POCFTG|5.0|Smart, very funny and original. It's dark and twisted, but in a good way. It will catch you off guard. Matthew McConaughey is maturing as an actor, along with his supporting turns in \\"Bernie\\" and \\"Magic Mike\\" he is growing into being a fine actor and not just a movie star. The supporting cast is also superb, I wasn't very familiar with the young actress Juno Temple (daughter of movie director Julian Temple), but this is a star making performance. I know worship at the Juno Temple.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
0385535147|4.0|i liked this book.  its a middle of the pack kind of book.  not john's best, but pretty ok.  its was easy to figure out how the book was going to end half way through.  i love how john writes.

B000HT38AS|3.0|Three Clint Eastwood \\"comedies\\". \\"Honky Tonk Man\\" is one of his best most underrated movies. As for the other two, \\"City Heat\\" is a broad and silly neo-noir that could have been really great if it had been taken seriously as it is it's only silly and never funny, but Clint and Burt are both great stars and good to see them together. As for \\"Pink Cadillac\\", the less said the better. Worth the purchase for \\"Honky Tonk Man\\" and \\"City Heat\\" if you've never seen it.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B0086900TI|5.0|You know how they say \\"Teachers have the hardest job in the world?\\"  Well this movie proves that's exactly 100% true.  The teachers that have to deal with students in the city are *especially* the ones who have the hardest job due to the aggressive  environment each and every day.  They have to find a way to get through to a group of students that are not only destructive but refuse to listen to reason concerning *anything* no matter how hard things are explained to them.  Not only that, but teenagers naturally want to test the patience of their parents and teachers because they feel like they've reached that terrible point in their lives when they've become big and bad enough that they think they *can*.  Test ones authority so to speak.<br /><br />I'm curious if some city public schools really *are* as graphic as the one portrayed here.  I imagine some of these incidents (that I won't spoil) are a bit exaggerated, but others -such as the one student who walks up to the front of the classroom where Adrien Brody is standing on the first day of the job and threatens to beat him up- are real.  I'd like to know if city kids are really THAT bad.  I spent all my years going to a public school out in the country that was significantly tamer than this school.<br /><br />Adrien Brody proves he's quickly becoming one of the best actors out of Hollywood since he can easily nail any role he's given, and his role as a substitute teacher here is downright terrific.  That's not all- he has to deal with an incredibly heart-breaking situation with his father in a retirement home and about to pass away that will leave many viewers in tears (especially me since I worry I might be in this exact situation some day in the future) in addition to meeting and taking in an underage prostitute on the streets that results in a *fantastic* ending (that I won't spoil, sorry!)  There's also a girl in the back of Adrien's class that's a special student and bonds with Adrien's character.  You don'trealize until later how important her character is.<br /><br />The language in this movie is REALLY bad.  These students take every swear word in the book and use them in the most graphic way imaginable.  And they direct these words *directly* at the teachers.  Yes, if this movie is similar to real public schools in the city, teachers most certainly have the hardest job out there.  For some reason, the scene that stands out the most is the one with the Asian guidance counselor and the teenage girl who comes in failing every single class and lacking ambition.  The woman literally explodes on the girl by giving her a reality check as a way to get through to her and amazingly, it works.  The girl walks out of the room aware that underperforming is wrong.  Also love the old man (not sure who he was- perhaps another counselor or a substitute teacher) that speaks exactly the same way his students speak to him!  He does a tremendous job getting through to the students.  A little *too* graphic perhaps, haha.  He had me laughing hysterically in one segment when he takes a sentence one of his troublemaker students says and uses it in several different ways, such as imitating a play in one segment, LOL!  I can't share this scene in detail because amazon won't allow it!  The man is doing this not only to prove that he isn't the least bit affected by immature threats, but to humiliate the student.<br /><br />Overall, this movie had me moved to tears a few times because it's not all about swearing and awful language.  There's a clear element of understanding, compassion and trust that takes place between the teachers and students through LOTS of patience.  The teachers learn to build a wall as a way to block all the swearing and criticisms these teachers have to deal with on a daily basis.  In fact Detachment actually portrays how hard it is to live in the city, so it goes beyond public school difficulties.  Highly recommended.
1416550534|4.0|Reminds me of Downton Abbey.  I love to read books about the period between the wars. The plot was complicated, with lots of what I call back and forthing.  I liked The Forgotten Garden better.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|4 stars because it is not a remastered edition and it includes the horrendous 4th installment. The bonus features are great, especially the behind the scenes footage with later interviews.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|Authentic. F Murray Abrahan. Michelle Pfheiffer. Steven Bauer. Bob Loggia & Alfredo Pacino:) any greater than this classic would be hard presses for its accuracy and Oliver Stones writing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My brother told me to get this app so I did. NO REGRETS!! Best game since doodle jump! #1<br /><br />  Have fun with your new and awesome app. Man I hope this gets top comment someday. Sigh. ENOUGH ABOUT ME GET THAT APP! YAY! You can even share this on Facebook! There are many characters to choose from. It is SO addicting. SOMEONE HELP ME STOP PLAYING THIS GAME! HAHAHA
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I chose this rating because it could have been more informational. The dictionaries we have at my middle school is a little more informational for me, than this. But I have to give it props it was pretty good, it had stuff I would have never had known without reading this dictionary. So that's why I gave it a 4 star rating. Don't let me get to you I'm just trying to help.Only why I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because take it to the next level, or even the next 3 levels! The sky is the limit,and don't go up to the sky and quit, but go beyond  the sky. Do  that, and then, but only then, will you have your 5 star rating.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|showed up on time for that i am happy, ive never seen the movie, i bought it as a gift as this was what was wanted by him.  so he was pleased
B005LAII08|5.0|Clean and family-safe movie that has a good enough story line to keep adults entertained.  This looked really cool in 3D.  If you have 3D capable equipment, I highly recommend this movie in 3D - you won't regret the slight up-charge from standard blue-ray.
B004LROMSO|5.0|VERY happy with shipment time, quality, packaging, product, truthfulness of sale information and item. My ONLY disappointment is that there is not a Season 2! = (
B00A757EFW|1.0|I don't really like this game.  I have discovered by playing it that it is really hard to do without a joystick.  I played this game for years as a child and doing it on a Kindle is not condusive to winning.  It is very hard to get past 2 levels. I wish I could get my money back or somehow attach a joystick.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Don't download this app! It won't let you search anything, it crashes all the time, my kindle almost got some virus from it. Download this, and you'll regret it.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|It came in on time and no damage and my 2 yr old loved it. It's a great, kind-friendly film. Not much else matters.

B00447G29S|5.0|Purchased movie very close to Christmas 2012 and used super saver shipping.  It came quicker than projected, so we had it in time for Christmas.  The movie was in good shape and the 3D graphics were really cool.  Fun movie for the kids to watch around Christmas time.
B003DF4582|5.0|This combo was a gift for Christmas. Pleased with the quality of items, the shipment time and packaging. Will use this service again when the need comes.
1603427244|3.0|I like the sheer variety of beginnings/ endings contained in this book.  However, a better index and better quality illustrations would help us visual learners (beginners) to improve our knitting better.  Good for beginners and intermediate level knitters who want to expand their repertoir of cast ons/ bind offs.  Would recommend it for most knitters.
B0086700CM|5.0|The first best is subway surfers. BUT THIS IS CLEARLY SECOND. I love this app. Buy it. Trust me. It's fun. You'll like it. No regrets. Get it NOW! LOL

1401235417|5.0|Amazing. The story was incredibly compelling and nerve-wrecking. I could not put it down. The artwork was great and the ending was breath-taking. Definitely looking forward to the next volume! A must read!
B000002AGN|5.0|This was given as a gift to a family member who requested it.  Says it is a great album, He gives it a &#34;5&#34;.
1932735410|5.0|Awesome, helpful, and easier to understand Project Management guidelines and processes than the PMBOK materials. Great resource for CAPM and PMP project managers.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use the Battery HD Pro on all my devices. Considering how many I have, I am more than getting my<br />two dollars it of it. It does everything I could  hope for. It's not difficult to install or set up. The free version was just fine, but I do appreciate the extras...plus I think the developer earned the small price I paid.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very User friendly with very little ad interruptions. Nice game options and features. Easy to play and easy to use. One of my favorite apps.
B00012QM8G|3.0|I choose this classic movie to add to 'My Favorite' movie group.  Liam Nissan is outstanding in his role as Oskar Schlindler, and Steven Speilberg once again showed his superior directing talents.  Upon inspection of the DVD I found a defect on the outside rim.  It didn't want to load, and I had to work with it multiple times before it worked.  Half was through the movie it stopped and would not proceed.  I had to reload (with difficulties again) and proceed via fast forward to the spot again, re-do entire procedure, but advanced it beyond the scene which I never was able to view.  It was without complete defect beyond that spot, but 'burped' a few more times.  It was quite bothersome and seriously deminished the movie experience, being interrupted as such.  It is in the process of being sent back and replaced.

B0076XDGZ0|4.0|I follow the guys in this band to their various projects: Transatlantic, Spock's Beard, Dream Theatre, Liquid Tension Experiment, etc.<br /><br />This is by far the most friendly and pop-oriented project. First 5 songs are solid, kinda uneven after that.<br />Songs are shorter, simpler and a break from the rock, progressive, metal songs that you might expect.<br />Great when I'm not in the mood for a 25 minute song.<br /><br />Maybe Flying Colors will get some play on the radio. I hope so.<br />But I doubt it since the songs are not simple or repetitious enough.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next CD from this band.

I especially love the listmaking function as I use Evernote for everything else already and now it is my go-to productivity app! I also love it for recipe storage so I can write/look up a recipe on my laptop, take my phone to the store to shop for ingredients, then view on my tablet for easy reading in the kitchen!
0765325950|1.0|I am just as disappointed as everyone else about the delayed ebook release....so I just went ahead and got the cliff notes version from wikpedia....seems like it might be a decent read...maybe not as good as earlier books in the series but decent....maybe when it hits $2.99 on the e market....it is really sad that such a great series has nearly as many one star reviews as fives for its final book....way to maintain the legacy there Harriet....

B007D15N1K|4.0|AS Byatt is undoubtedly a gifted writer, what to make up poetry by two poets so convincingly in addition to the narrator's voice in this book. It's a great story, but readers be warned: it does get very difficult to read at times, what with pages of poetry that one much read through to decipher clues about characters and their motives. Perhaps it's because I am reading it on a Kindle; I find it much easier to absorb books in actual book form. Still, it got quite exciting as the story moved on. Worth a read...don't give up during the earlier portions!

B000002BQK|5.0|Butterfly is Mariah Carey's best album. She herself considers Butterfly her magnum opus. The first single Honey, which was produced by Mariah and Puffy, which sampled Hey, DJ and The Body Rock was R&B/Pop with hip hop influences at it's finest and became Mariah's 12th #1! The second single Butterfly is the best ballad Mariah has ever written. It wasn't released as a commercial single due to her conflict with Sony at the time. Despite that set back the song peaked at #16 on the Hot 100 Airplay. The Roof and Breakdown received similar treatment. The fifth and final single My All, a Spanish inspired ballad, became Mariah's 13th #1 on the Hot 100!  The album is the height of  her elegance and hip-hop soul's too, to quote Slant. The Roof, Breakdown, Butterfly, Close My Eyes, Outside, Babydoll, Honey, and Fourth of July are lyrical and vocal masterpieces by a singer songwriter at her peak.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed every bit of the drama and the 360 explanation which ties the story together. I'm a fan! Intense and heart-wrenching. So well written I felt like I was a part of the story.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Best performance from talented, well respected actors all perfectly cast. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll find out that as Sunil says, &#34;Everything comes out right in the end. And if it doesn't, It's not the end&#34; Beautiful story about people who are at the end of life then find new beginnings.
0307352145|5.0|It's amazing how much you can relate to this book if you are a shy, quiet or introverted person. I was always hard on myself and realize now that there were some great people who were introverts and some of our most intelligent! You'll enjoy reading about this group of people even if you're not \\"Quiet\\"; it helps to understand why we tick this way. I received this book for free from \\"Blogging for Books\\",from Waterbrookmultnomah.

B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah Carey's return to the top of the charts is also a return to form for Ms. Carey. We Belong Together went on to become Billboard's Song of the Decade that is reason enough to purchase this album.

B007PFD90G|5.0|This is Rushdie's memoir of the years he spent after the death sentence was issued by Ayatollah Khomeini. It is a fascinating portrait of his experiences along with his critique of how much of the world bowed to the pressure of Iran and other fundamentalist ideas. Terrorism is still terrorism, whether directed in general or against a specific person. His defense of the values of freedom of thought and freedom of expression should be required reading.

B005N7CA3A|5.0|Will you like this album. Well, do you miss a true album format - a collection of songs designed to hang together conceptually, and not just a few singles with filler? Do you really, honestly love pop music? Especially pop music that is drinking from the Brit Pop, electro (but less than his other solo work), and Disco well? Can you appreciate a different take on common themes?<br /><br />Everything about this album was intended as an homage to great pop. The cover art was designed by the guy who did Michael Jackson's album art. The strings were arranged by the family of the folks that did Abba's strings. Darren went back to knock on the door of pop hitmaker Walter Afanasieff. He traveled to Sweden to work with Carl Falk. He got the attention of Rob Orton to mix the album (studio guy who mixed Lady Gaga's stuff). He wrote something like 30+ songs, and carefully curated which ones made the cut. (Many of those ended up on special edition formats).<br /><br />The DNA of this thing is pedigree.<br /><br />Add this to the already established ingredients of Hayes' freakishly beautiful voice, his prize in the genetic lottery. Some of his solo work strayed away from what made him so legendary in Savage Garden - that trademark falsetto, and the love of a good ballad. He embraces those elements of his song craft and vocals. He is the master of song arrangement and melodic lines. He also often uses aural irony- songs that sound peppy and are full of hooks, with lyrics that talk about heartbreak, loss, attempts at resilency in the face of struggle. There's moments of great, disco-biscuit, danceable fun on this album (\\"Talk, Talk, Talk\\", \\"Don't Give Up\\"). There are innovative, brutally honest meditations on some of the darker emotions in love and friendship (the mini-orchestral \\"Stupid Mistake\\", the anthemic \\"Bloodstained Heart\\" and wounded plea that is \\"Black Out the Sun\\"). There's the art pop (\\"Siren's Call\\" and \\"Taken By the Sea\\"). And there's positive, affirming ballads (\\"Cruel Cruel World\\" and \\"Roses\\").<br /><br />In the current pop landscape where a few interesting, but highly processed mega-stars rule the roost (Katy Perry, Rihanna,Taylor Swift), there are a few out there keeping us honest and being stewards of a pop legacy that endures longer than the few weeks a song is on the charts. Darren Hayes is one of those artists.

B006M4F67A|5.0|I had the previous version of this game, with easier tiles to match.  This one challenges me more.  I still play the older version, when I'm feeling lazy, but prefer this harder challenge, most days.  Give it a try.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I have been eating paleo for a while and was always aware of Whole9.  I am in the midst of the January Whole30 after reading this book, and following these eating guidelines has been life-changing!  The complex information is presented in a very straight-forward and logical way, and the meal map shows you how to put all that advice into practice. Recommended reading for everyone!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend this this book to my friends and family . I would also give it to people I know and tell them to read it.

B000S88JTS|4.0|Have har motorcycles for 60 years as an important recreation.  My bike buddies saw this film when it came out many years ago and along with &#34;Easy Rider&#34; I have never forgotten it.  I also ordered a set for another bike buddy of mine.  the extra background about making the film was very interesting.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Difficult to get started. I was told a little about the story and wanted to read it but when I started reading there was a lot that didn't make sense. As I continued reading more came clear. This one just takes time to get going. Amazing story of grace and redemption.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I put myself in Ana place and I felt like she did. I wanted to try n please Christian. Make you want to explore.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great best out of the series. Can't wait for the next series.<br />Great for11 year olds. I love these books.
B009ERK1T0|4.0|Koi No Yokan (Japanese for &#34;Love At First Sight&#34;) is a fitting title for the feelings the new Deftones album aims to evoke.  Although Chino Moreno's lyrics remain fairly cryptic - he never overtly mentions being in love - the music is rich and atmospheric, often succeeding in its quieter moments in conjuring that walking-on-air feeling of  intoxication which newfound love brings.  Being the veteran metal rockers they are, the Deftones can't resist pummeling the listener with their de-facto cruching guitar riffs and Abe Cunningham's superb percussive assault.  This time around, though, the heaviness of their music is blanketed with warm, euphoric, ethereal sounds and samples that paint a beautiful tapestry of love - love at first sight.
B000066744|4.0|I could tell that it was heavily edited though, there were some points where it seemed it should have kept going on. I read up on the film later, and yup, the producers got greedy and cut a lot out to make it shorter so that they could show it more times per day in theaters. Idiots.<br /><br />But a great movie! Just be careful with the kiddos, they drop a few F-bombs here and there...tastefully, but F-bombs nonetheless.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Enjoy the twists and turns!!! Fun show to watch!! Got addicted last season and had to continue to this season!!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|First levels super easy and I thought that the app would be a waste of time but it eventually got harder and that made it more challenging and fun for me. I love now that I can give my sis the game to play the easy levels to give her something to do that she will enjoy :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book to read and learn about the characters. It is exotic and exciting but very emotional when getting further along in the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  This was the first novel I read by this author, and I am going to purchase the other books that I have seen on Amazon.  The twists and turns you encounter in the story make it interesting, and the end left me unsettled (not in a bad way) and thinking.
0345803507|5.0|The price was less than in the stores, but not having to drive around and looking for the 3rd book made it an even better purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't know what to expect going into this book. But what I got was dark, deep and emotionally draining. This is not for the faint if heart. This is about a girl (Sky) who was sexually abused by her father when she was really young. About a boy (Holder) who has to overcome his sisters suicide. Holder is there for Sky every step of the way through her journey of discovery. It is a very compelling and emotional story. I would hope, that if someone DID go through what Sky has gone through, that there would be a Holder there for them to help them through the storm. Really loved this one.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch, Los Angeles detective,  solves a 20-year old cold case in his usual style by doggedly following clues the old-fashioned way, step by step.  Another classic procedural from Michael Connelly.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The main characters in the book the Hunger games are Katniss Everdeen, Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne. Katniss is sixteen years old.  She is quiet and strong.  She is pretty with long dark hair that she often wears in a braid. She is from District 12 which is one of the poorest districts. Peeta is also from district 12 he is confident and chromatic he has loved Katniss from the day he saw her. Gale is Katniss's best friend and hunting partner, they hunt illegally. He also falls in love with her and he has black hair like her and grey eyes.<br />In the book they are in a Forest where they are all hunting each other. It is to the death, each district has a team of two people that have to be the last team to be alive. If the one of the district teams win they get food to supply the district, and the winners also get a huge nice house to live in. Also they sometimes drop supplies for the players for them to get an advantage, but they only get if the people vote for them to receive that supply.<br />The thing I liked about the book is how it had a lot of thrill and mystery. What I didn't like about the book was the love drama like twilight that it was about two boys and a girl. There was a lot of action and death, and it made the book exciting! It was hard to put down.<br />What I didn't like about the book is there was a lot of love drama and that I found to me was boring. It reminded me of another twilight book. Overall I would give this book a 4 out of 5 stars. It was a really good book.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Works great on my kindle. Why did I have to install  by apk? Why unsupported? In fact, I had to install flash for ICS same way. The only browser that flash works in is dolphin. Embedded video is everywhere with no flash it's impossible to use the net.
B000MV8XPG|3.0|I purchased 2, for a 3 and a 3.5 year old. It is too large for both of them. It doesn't operate smoothly, a bit difficult for both of them. They both loved it and didn't want any other gifts. Only one lever moves anything, and it doesn't move well on carpet. Over priced for what it does, but how do you return something the grandkids love.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The storyline is good, the writer tends to drift off-topic quite a bit....and spends a lot of time describing a level of detail that doesn't even contribute to the story. Not a bad read though.....could be an interesting character to expand on....I intend on reading the next couple of books to see if it gets better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked reading 50 Shades, you will LOVE this series!! Intense and really hot scenen along with a great story.

B009OYTAL8|4.0|Just like the Green Arrow served as a stand-in for Batman during early Justice League comic books, Arrow begins as a sort of &#34;Dark Knight Lite&#34; television series that fans of Nolan's trilogy will appreciate. Hopefully as the show progresses, the creative team will find its own voice, which may require an entirely unique take on the character. Should be fun to watch, and the best thing going on the CW since Supernatural's first five seasons.
B007MB5OCE|1.0|I found this book tiresome.  The concept was clever for the first 5 pages, and then it got old, old, old.  Spare yourself the time and read something else.

0425252868|5.0|I found the complex intertwining of lives in the balance, and their ultimate fates, to be moving beyond words. For such a young author who is of a generation that is only now re-learning the terrible price of history and its consequences through no fault of its own, Adam Makos has done a remarkable job. He writes in a concise yet evocative and very personal manner that arouses tremendous empathy without excessive indulgence in graphic details, very much in the same vein as Peter Townsend's \\"Duel Of Eagles\\", John Bushby's \\"Gunner's Moon\\", Robert Denny's \\"Aces\\", Spencer Dunmore's \\"Bomb Run\\", N.J. Crisp's \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" and Martin Caidin's \\"The Last Dogfight\\", yet describes enough to leave the reader both shaken and deeply disturbed about some of the real costs of war. In the end, it leaves one saddened but wiser and perhaps hopeful that we, as a race, may learn from generations of foolhardy political ambition and unmindful pride that the destruction, suffering and dying --- the sheer waste --- are simply not worth it when there are better avenues, if only we had the courage to take the pathways against those who would lead us astray.<br /><br />Of great noteworthiness is the in-depth look at the very real humanity of the Luftwaffe's fighter pilots ; their hopes, dreams, fears and emotions, and their ultimate black despair in the face of the rolling tide of war that would drown most of these young men. There is a terrible, breathless inevitability in the chapters that cover the period towards the war's end. It is now better known that of 28,000 fighter pilots who flew with the Luftwaffe, only about 1,200 survived the war, an appalling casualty rate by any standard. The one salient feature that stands out from all this tragedy is the seemingly indomitable spirit of the \\"Experten\\" ( aces ) who fought and died with chivalry and honor against all odds, and never lost sight of their humanity and self-respect in the process. Thankfully, at least a small handful survivedto tell their side of history and impart many priceless, hard-won lessons to the rest of us. Legendary names such as Walter Krupinski, Hans-Joachim Marseille, Adolf Galland, Johannes Steinhoff, Hannes Trautloft, Gunther Luetzow and Gerhard Barkhorn --- both the quick and the dead --- are all there in the text, and seen in a very personal and human light as individuals in their own right.<br /><br />Another thing that Makos highlights, both directly and indirectly, is the indescribable physical and emotional toll the war took on the families of the aircrews on both sides, reminding us once again that the effects of conflict have an impact far beyond the front lines.<br /><br />The only issues I had with the book comprised mostly small but glaring technical errors such as the line on Page 169 describing Engine 1 on Charlie Brown's B-17F as being a Pratt & Whitney ( every B-17 ever built, with the exception of the prototype Model 299, XB-38 derivative and perhaps a few other experimental testbed aircraft, was powered by various models of the 9-cylinder Wright GR-1820 Cyclone radial engine ), and the reference on Page 174 to the aircraft's aluminum skin being a few centimeters (!) thick ( I think the author really meant to say millimeters, which would have been more correct ).<br /><br />Other than that, I feel that Makos has written a well-balanced and poignant account that encompasses on a very intimate level the threads of so many lives that have been inextricably entwined forever by fate and the winds of war.
1439152802|3.0|I want to state that I admire this author and have read her other books- which I thoroughly enjoyed.  This book sapped my energy and took me forever to read.  It flips between 1941 and 2011.  The characters are dim and lackluster until the end when you discover this is not just a love story but a serious and heart-catching mystery.  You must wade through the mundane verbal molasses until the last few chapters when you begin to appreciate the talent of this author.  I would have liked to enjoy the first part of the book as much as the ending.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I typically don't like historical books but love this one and pillars of the earth as well! The research he would have had to have done for these books is amazing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is the worst.  The character in this book is a complete dips***, why would anyone put up with that kinda crap?
1426308469|5.0|Bought this book for my 4 year old brother and he loves it. He always wants me to read it to him (or at least show him the pictures and make up a story) at night before he goes to bed. I think it is a great product for kids who are into dinosaurs.

B002U3CCBK|3.0|Initially I found this book hilarious, and was actually laughing out loud for the first section and settled down to what I assumed would prove a really worthwhile read.  Then the author seemed to lose direction and apparently could not make up his mind whether he was writing a political satire, a romantic love story or a travelogue.  The story jumped constantly from London, to Scotland and to the Yemen and back, which made it disjointed.  The characters never became convincing - the constantly absent wife made the wicked witch of fairy stories look like a tame bunny!  The ending was very unsatisfactory.  I feel it was a shame, as the start of the book had shown such promise.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I have gone through public school without reading a whole book, but as soon as I was forced to read this book with my girlfriend I got hooked on it the further i read. This is the only book I've ever read start to finish and it's amazing. Note nothing like the movie. I strongly advise reading this book. Excited to start the next one.
0811866351|3.0|This was purchased as a gift. I knew it was a good purchase when the recipients eyes lit up after opening the front cover.
B004P1JDJO|4.0|I thought this book was great at breaking down the three key drivers of Motivation 3.0 as Pink calls it.  Pink was good at making the book redundant, not repetitive.  What I mean by that is that instead of just repeating things the same way, Pink used many different ways to help you remember his main points -- the first half of the book is like a regular nonfiction book with how and why Pink finds these three key factors to be the root of Motivation 3.0, as well as what is Motivation 3.0.  Pink then spends the second half of the book talking about recommended steps to incorporate Motivation 3.0 into your life as a person, as a manager, as a parent or teacher, and even as an athlete or exerciser.  He also includes suggested further reading with brief synopses and talks about key thinkers and influences in the field.  Overall a worthwhile book, and the list-heavy second half means this is a much shorter read than it looks.

B007BVOEPI|4.0|A King Arthur style TV series with great a cast and complimentary acting. Season 1 ending only encouraged waiting to see the next season to come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Definitely recommend. Didn't think I wanted to read these books but once I started I couldn't stop! Nice surprises along the way.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book took many twists and turns.  I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  I would write more specifics about the story, but it could give it away.  You really start to identify with the main character and hope they prevail.  I would have rated the book a 5, but after pages of hanging on every word I was really disappointed in the ending.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think you should read this book because it is very funny like when Greg got the chicken pox I thought that was really funny
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Who doesn't like the story of A Christmas Carol?  This rendition has a twist for the young and old and follows the original story as much as any other retold story, but with animation...fantastic animation!!!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was just all in all an amazing book. But, I would recommend it to older, more mature readers. I, myself thought it was very very good, but some parts were not appropriate for younger children.
B009P5S11G|5.0|It's not my favorite of Rihanna's (Loud is my personal fave), however this CD is still good. People were too hard on her for trying out different sounds (she switches genres throughout the CD). But I think RihRih is trying out a new sounds, but there aren't all bad.<br /><br />Best Tracks:<br />Phresh Out the Runway<br />Pour It Up<br />Loveeeee Song<br />Nobodies Business<br />Jump<br />Right Now<br />No Love Allowed<br />Numb

B002UXRGM0|5.0|If you've seen the Planet Earth Blu Rays you'll know what to expect with this series.  But make sure to buy the David Attenborough version.  He's articulate, informative and just sounds nice to listen to.  If you get the Oprah version you will sorely regret it.  It's unwatchable as Oprah brings the level of commentary you'd expect from a second-grader.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|I'll start off by saying I am very critical of movies.  This movie is simply a fantastic original story that must be watched.  It is eye opening, charming and captivating.  A truly brilliant movie that belongs in the conversation with The Shawshank Redemption and Braveheart as classics.
B000002GAF|5.0|This one includes a bunch of Gino Vannelli's best tracks. One of his biggest hits and a song he's known for, &#34;I Just Wanna Stop&#34; is on this CD. I think he was at his most productive and creative during the Gist and Brother period.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read Perks of being a Wallflower in less than two days. Charlie is such a believable character that the entire book feels personal. You are truly going through his first year of high school with him. The ending also is completely not what I was expecting. Worth reading!

B002SSUQFG|5.0|This mechanical automatic watch is handsome and interesting. It runs a bit fast, as all self-winding watches do, but it's fun to take care of it. It's not really waterproof, so you can't swim with it, it's just water resistant. The band is comfortable, and it's a nice size. I like it.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|okay, if you haven't seen this yet, crawl out from under that rock and watch it.  very funny. love it.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|A solid movie about a boy who loses his beloved dog and then uses what he learns in Science class to resurrect him. The movie is classic Tim Burton, creepy with a touch of heart thrown in. This one is like Pet Sementary all over again. After the boys classmates find out he brought his dog back to life, everyone wants in on it, and it backfires. If you're Tim Burton fan, not sure how you could not enjoy this movie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK. So you should read it. Also check out \\"Out of my Mind\\" by Sharon M Draper.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is great.  If you started with Season three this will allow you to catch up.  If you have never seen this series and like British shows about the aristocracy during the early part of the 20th century, their lifestyle and support staff  and the British class system then get this.  Addictive.
B005R32L66|4.0|I got this for my son so he could play with it on his tablet. And he loves it so when we go on a vacation trip without them he can use this to see his parents. And he wanted it to see his grand parents that are out of state
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing!! I absolutely loved every minute of it! I could NOT put it down! It made me cry, laugh out loud, and smile like an idiot. It is very creative.  Best book I have read in a long time.

B003EYVXTG|2.0|So I'm really happy that I rented this movie instead of buying it, I'm a hunger games fan so when I would watch interviews they would mention this movie a lot so I decided why not, it has such amazing reviews. Boy was I disappointed, this movie was way over rated and I almost fell asleep. The only scene that made me go \\"wow!\\"was the scene where she has to help hold her fathers arm while they cut it. I had a hard time understanding what they were saying so I had to use subtitles. The acting could have been a lot better, I wasn't blown away by the acting. The storyline was good but just never got there, unlike the book which was amazing, it misses a lot what the book had. And ever time she would go meet someone to ask about her father I felt that I was re watching the first meeting. It just didn't live up to the book and the emotion it had. The movie was boring and the acting was predictable. Jennifer tried to make it emotional  by screaming and yelling cuss words. Most of the movie it looked as if she had not interest, like if she didn't care. I don't think this movie lived up to the hype at all.<br /><br />Plot<br />With an absent father and a withdrawn and depressed mother, 17 year-old Ree Dolly keeps her family together in a dirt poor rural area. She's taken aback however when the local Sheriff tells her that her father put up their house as collateral for his bail and unless he shows up for his trial in a week's time, they will lose it all. She knows her father is involved in the local drug trade and manufactures crystal meth, but everywhere she goes the message is the same: stay out of it and stop poking your nose in other people's business. She refuses to listen, even after her father's brother, Teardrop, tells her he's probably been killed. She pushes on, putting her own life in danger, for the sake of her family until the truth, or enough of it, is revealed.<br /><br />Living in the Ozark back country, seventeen year old Ree Dolly acts as the primary caregiver to her mentally ill mother, and her two younger siblings, twelve year old Sonny and six year old Ashlee. Her father, Jessup Dolly, is generally absent from their lives, he who earns a living primarily by running a methamphetamine lab. Without money from Jessup, Ree is barely able to make ends meet, and depends on the kindness of their neighbor, Sonya, to do so. Ree learns that her father is scheduled for a court appearance for his illegal activities, and he has skipped bail, putting their house and property up as bond. No one seems to know where Jessup is. Ree has to try and find Jessup to make sure that he shows up for his court appearance, otherwise they risk losing their home. As Ree goes on her quest, she finds that people seem to know more about his whereabouts than they are letting on, including her uncle Teardrop of who she is scared. Rumors abound that Jessup is dead, but a dead father without a body does not help her cause. But Ree's persistence in finding out what happened to Jessup makes her come face to face with the code of silence for which some are willing to kill.r to her mentally ill mother, and her two younger siblings, twelve year old Sonny and six year old Ashlee.

B005COO1X6|3.0|I bought this when I first got my Kindle since I'm a huge Stephen King fan - the content itself was not disappointing but I thought I was purchasing a whole book, not 80 pages - I've learned since to check the number of pages!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Worth the time.  Wonderfully descriptive settings, accessible characters, and enough surprises.  And inventive!  Best described as Harry Potter crashing into the Da Vinci Code...
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Overall a good story, I had a hard time getting into over half of it unfortunately. I didn't prefer the style of writing, but the story line was well purposed.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|It is a nice simple cover/case to carry.<br /><br />The stand to set it up does not work so great. It keeps slipping out of the slot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this series and that was a very brilliant way to tie it together! Thank you for such a great book!!!
0399157565|4.0|Since I gave a not-so-positive review of Red Mist, I had to write a review on The Bone Bed.  I actually enjoyed this book...finally.  I was a die hard fan of Cornwell until her characters became so tediously angry and obnoxious.  She must have listened to all her one-time fans and decided to let the anger go.  Or, perhaps, she is a happier person now than she has been in the past.  Whatever the reason, I was very pleasantly surprised with this book.  I guess going ahead and trying to read her books hoping for the best paid off this time.  Thank you, Patricia Cornwell, it's nice to have you back.  Still her characters have some anger issues but not so much this time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a Original, well written book<br />I am Waiting to read the next ones. The movie makes more sense now.
0553108034|5.0|If you like the first book in the series, this book is even better.  The characters are better developed and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00ANT6OK8|4.0|In \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" CIA agent Maya represents and channels the American subconscious desire to find and kill Osama bin Laden once and for all.  We know very little about Maya -- where she is from, what motivated her to join the CIA, and what her motivations are for doing anything really -- and what we do know does not form  a multi-dimensional character:  Maya is obsessed with finding and killing Osama bin Laden, and she's convinced she has to fight the world to get to him.  Early on in the manhunt she stumbles upon the name of bin Laden's courier, and without any proof or substantive evidence she thinks that this courier is the key to finding bin Laden.  She is ultimately vindicated, but in the process everyone around her thinks she's merely chasing a ghost and bending reality to suit her prejudice.<br /><br />Bigelow is a very subtle and courageous director.  She's not afraid of raising tough moral questions, and she's not afraid of testing the psychological and emotional limits of her audience.  The movie is intensely claustrophobic -- everything happens in small spaces -- so that when we are given wide angle shots we have to breathe with relief.  I suppose that close angle shots in tight narrow spaces is a hallmark of Bigelow's cinematography, but it also offers us an interior into Maya's mind -- as she must seclude herself away in Pakistan, away from friends and emotions.  There's not much violence in \\"Zero Dark Thirty,\\" as the movie is mainly just talk and innuendo, but when it does happen it happens with great shock and effect:  the torturing of a detainee, terrorist bombings, the bullets that kill the three men in bin Laden's compound.  But the ultimate violence is inflicted by Maya on herself, as she drives herself and all those around her insane with her obsession.  The obsession becomes so integral to her identity that when she is able to stare the dead bin Laden in the face she doesn't know how to feel, and when she boards a plane by herself she doesn't know where to go, and breaks down in tears.  It's very clear from Bigelow's long close-up that these are not tears of joy -- these are real tears, tears that she had to bottle up all these years as her obsession consumed her.<br /><br />Like Maya herself, Bigelow is very meticulous and detail-oriented.  \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a very slow, nuanced film that most viewers will find boring and aloof.  But I think that \\"Zero Dark Thirty's\\" focus on telling the story as realistically as possible is its greatest strength.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|I like the variety of choices, but some of the choices don't work on screen. The screen goes blank or the chosen feature doesn't come up. Its frustrating. The ones that work are good.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I never knew this show existed had heard everyone talking about it. Thanks to Amazon you can rent it per episode so that you haven't invested in the whole season. I watched the first 4 episodes back to back before I knew it.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This was an absolutely terrific documentary, compellingly told from the very first scene driving along the ocean road in Cape Town, South Africa with this remarkable music playing in the background. I went into it knowing very little about the story, which I think enhanced the experience. In fact, from the small part of the trailer I had seen beforehand, I thought it might turn into a murder mystery! Instead, it was one of the most captivating movies I've seen, and easily the best documentary. The story of a musician being spurned in his homeland and finding fame in a foreign country is not unique (think This is Spinal Tap), but the peculiar situation of South Africa at that particular moment in history made it possible for Rodriguez's stardom there to be unknown to the artist himself. It is truly a remarkable story that I won't say more about, except to encourage you to see it.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|For a Kindel Fire it has great graphics. It is easy to move around and fight.But sometimes it is hard to move the camera.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book I have read in years!!! It speaks for itself and I couldn't have read a better book!! Excellence!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is simply a wonderful read in that Louisa Clark is a wonderful character and her relationship with Will Traynor...well, their relationship hit all the right notes, I think. Louisa's Mum and Dad, her sister, nephew and granddad fill out the story with warmth, charm, and zest. Will's Mum, Dad, and sister aren't quite so warm, charming, or zesty, but they round out the cast and keep things from floating off into the ozone of sappy, I think. I am qualifying my comments with \\"I think\\" because I think these are some of the things that make the story come together so well; it's managed to be light and profound. And when I say light I don't mean shallow or breezy, I mean light-filled and when I say profound, I mean heart-breakingly profound.<br /><br />I simply loved this book.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Fun game for when you want to waste some time. Fun concept and well done. Can't wait for more levels.

B005IQZB14|5.0|One of the best books I've read in ages. It is not so much a book on wilderness travel but a book on finding yourself

B0081JPTCQ|3.0|I started taking notes on my Kindle Fire HE with a free notes app, which worked pretty well, but I wanted a more professional-looking app without ads that I could use to take noted during interviews. This app was recommended. First of all, I couldn't paste in some of my longer notes into this app - it would only display the first few paragraphs and the rest would be cut off. Also, most of the templates they have are not very usefulness the job they are recommended for. Lastly, typing a note in is slow and halting - I am usually two words ahead by the time the first word I typecast show up, which was not a problem with the free app. My advice would be to stay with the free notes app, especially if looking professional isn't an issue.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This is a great mystery novel.  Libby Day was only seven years old when her family (her mom and sisters) were brutally murdered in their own home.  Her testimony as a little girl puts her brother, Ben, in jail.<br /><br />It is now 25 years later and Libby hasn't really done much with her life.  She calls herself a \\"mean person\\".  With very little money, she agrees to meet with The Kill Club to see if anyone has any more information about the murders and she will be paid for appearances and old letters, etc.  The book shifts from the here and now to January, 1985.  With each chapter from the past, we learn a little more about the family and friends surrounding the Day's.<br /><br />This book was grisly at times in its depiction of violence.  I found passages hard to read, but it was an excellent story.  The ending made sense and there were no loose ends.<br /><br />I read this after I had finished \\"Gone Girl\\".  Both were excellent books and I was not disappointed with this one.
B00846REIS|5.0|I freaking love both the Crossfire Novels that have been published thus far. I cant wait till the third book comes out, I already have it preordered.
B007M45PMU|3.0|Decent Cd, but not as good as we had hoped.  A little more jump would have been nice, but it's a nice relaxing listen.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Life changing. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. It is inspired and a great read. Give it a try!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Difficult to watch this movie in home setting. Requires more concentration than you can get while family conversations, pets etc. prevail.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Best book I have read in a very long time. If you thought Fifty Shades of Grey was good then you will LOVE this book!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie has so much great one-liners to quote.  We kept saying them for days after renting it from Netflix.  I can see this becoming a cult classic.
0345531965|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. As a long-time fan of Grisham's writing, I found that I had overlooked this gem. I am so glad I found it! Some readers have complained (whined) that it departs from Grisham's tried and true formula of courtroom intrigue. I agree with the fact that he has varied the direction of this story, but I strongly disagree with the idea that this is a mistake. For a writer as talented as John Grisham to fall into the quagmire of only writing single themed stories would be sad indeed. The fact that he can explore (and conquer) a different style, story-type, and theme further demonstrates his skill with the pen.<br /><br />I was captivated by the story, as well as, the characters - both good and bad - and the adventure in storytelling. The surprise ending caught me by the throat, since I had an entirely different idea of what should happen with the two lead characters, but instead of disappointing me, it just reinforced Grisham's ability to develop creatively and to keep his stories fresh.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to any and all readers who enjoy a well written story with as many surprising twists and turns as the Pantanal rivers Nate O'Riley got lost on!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Beautiful game. Not too short and not to difficult but loads of fun. Well worth the $ you spend on this.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was a great follow up to 50 shades. I love the characters. I can't wait for the 3rd book to be released.
B006HAJ99K|5.0|I own a VHS version of this film for close to 15 years and I've seen it 30+ times.  Never got tired of it and got something slightly different with each viewing (maturing perspective from my own aging process).<br /><br />Over time I fell more and more in love with Millie.  Allison Elliot who played Millie, at first glance, is not strikingly beautiful like Ms Bonham Carter, just pleasant.  However, the more I see Millie the more I see beauty.  The purity of her heart sucks me in.  I see why she won a place in Merton Densher's heart.  She knew her time was up and she soaked it up like someone thirsty for water in the desert.  Like what Densher wrote to Croy \\"She's alive, more alive than anyone I've known\\".  Ms Elliot's role may not be as showy as Ms Bonham Carter's but it is a much harder role to play well, so delicate and subtle, like walking on a tight rope.  Ms Elliot did it brilliantly, a quiet strength from being young, orphaned, and presiding over a large fortune and a melancholy from being terminally ill.<br /><br />And we all know an untimely death can do to others, right?  The dead will be remembered forever, frozen in time, never would sin and age, like Marilyn, Lennon, and Jimmy Dean.  I don't see it as Millie's revenge.  She's too loving to want anything bad happen to Densher and Croy.  The outcome was sad but inevitable, just human nature.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|This game will not open, I click on the logo and it goes back to widgets.<br />I really would love to have this game.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This product not only has a great selection of individual sounds, but also has the ability to combine the existing select to customize your own ambience sound. The sleep feature is also great and when the time is up, it fades rather than just cutting off.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but the ending was really abrupt.  It was very gripping and I could hardly put it down.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter is by far one of the best series on TV.  I just can not get enough of it.  Outstanding
B008TMA1LY|5.0|It's really fun but the only part that really sucks about it is that when it gets harder and your level increases you have to buy characters. And the characters are REALLY expensive. To buy em you have to get points with real money. But over all I love it :3
B0058YPGL6|5.0|This was a great gift I would recommend this to any one warning a gift for there friend I would love it to be cheaper tho
B0011NVCSO|5.0|I had only partially listened to the album and that was enough for me to order it on vinyl. I must say, I have never been happier with a purchase! This album is simply incredible and it's been regularly spinning on my turntable ever since I received it. A must have for any vinyl collector!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|As the finales have been taken off of You-tube, I had to break down and buy the 25th Anniversary Concert.  I have seen Les Mis numerous times on stage.  I have recently seen the movie, along with most of you.  I think that we all need to remember that the stage performance is more about the incredible music and voices whereas the movie is more about the acting and the visual.  That said, I recommend that you see it on stage first...you will never forget it.. Then I recommend any fan to own both the 10th and 25th AND the movie when it's available.  The original cast was top notch with Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, Philip Quast, etc.  The 25th has the wonderful Alfie Boe, Ramin Karimloo,John Owen-Jones and the 1985 cast.  And the finales are worth it alone.  In several reviews I note the criticism of Nick Jonas.  I kind of feel sorry for him as he was so out of his league and he looks visibly uncomfortable at times.  I know he probably wanted to hide when Michael Ball sang his part and it was fantastic.  Many pop stars have done musicals: Donnie Osmond, Andy Gibb, Madonna, Ricky Martin etc.(I know I'm missing a lot) but unfortunately this didn't work.  However, it was a small distraction and the DVD is something I will cherish.
B00884GR0W|3.0|This game has a lot going for it... nice visuals, decent controls, tons of options, crafting, leveling, items, combat... after a few hours into my world however I'm sick of dying! The mobs aren't impossible, nor is the combat frustrating... what kills me us that within 10 seconds (no exaggeration) the mob I just slain spawns again right where I killed it. Ridiculous! If I'm lucky enough to find a lone mob I have a chance to kill it and run through the area, 2 or more forget about it! I really wanted to love this game...
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I had read a review of this book on one of the blogs that I follow and was excited to have something juicy to read. Unfortunately everything about this book was a complete let down. I found the author's story to be a bit unrealistic and felt that she only scratched the surface of each character. She also flip flopped between a breakup and relationship with the two main characters which was boring after the fifth time. I would have liked for a less predicable ending and would not recommend this book to anyone above 25. .

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book, the third in the 50 shades series has a lot going on. This one is deep and chilling. We get to learn the circumstances that created Christian Grey, his secrets, his feelings, how it all began. At the same time there is another story entwined with mystery, blackmail, secrecy and money. This series is worth the time, I couldn't put it down and after each ending I  couldn't wait for the next book.

0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson does not disappoint in this final installment of the Wheel of Time.  Deftly wrapping up story lines and characters that we have loved for two decades.  I feel that if Robert were still with us, he'd love the book too.

B001JU4S44|4.0|Good action thriller... If you like mystery and double and triple cross fake-out with killer special effects, this is a movie for you.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Awesome read. Looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.  Hoping she will continue the story past the third book.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I liked it for the action and mystery/suspense. I would have given it 5 stars If it had, had a better ending.
B003DZX3US|4.0|You're never too old to enjoy your favorite Disney movies. The inclusion of the previously cut songs is pretty cool. My only objection is the practice of forcing you to purchase the Blu-ray and DVD together. You don't need both.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|Miami Vice (2009). Unrated Director's Edition. Running Time: 2 hours, 19 mins.  Miami Vice (1984-90) ([[ASIN:B00005JLEY Miami Vice: Season One]])  was a crime-drama tv series that would change NBC television forever. It had updated camera techniques, quicker camera shots, filmed on location and incorporated today's popular music or an upbeat soundtrack to enhance the excitement of the show. The use of Phil Collins \\"In the Air Tonight\\" is a perfect, classic example. [[ASIN:B000005S6J In the Air Tonight]]<br />The tv series starred Don Johnson as \\"Detective Sonny Crockett\\", Philip Michael Thomas as \\"Detective Ricardo Tubbs\\", Edward James Olmos as \\"Lieutenant Martin Castillo\\".<br />  Now 22 years later since the beginning on Miami Vice, a motion picture version is made with a new cast.<br /> Colin Farrell as \\"Sonny Crockett\\", Jamie Foxx as \\"Ricardo Tubbs\\", Barry Shabaka Henley as \\"Castillo\\". Namomi Harris as \\"Trudy\\".<br /><br /> Best line: \\"I don't like Americans. Too good at what they do.\\"<br /><br />Audio Commentary with writer/director Michael Mann<br /><br />Option of language: English, French.  Option of Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.<br /><br /> Bonus features: Miami Vice Undercover. Miami & Beyond: Shooting on Location, Visualizing Miami Vice. Behind the Scene Featurette.<br /><br />The underground world of drugs and the drug cartels really bores me. I slept through this one. I tried to watch it again and ended up fast-forwarding it.<br />  The original tv series is still the best.<br /><br />If they had the original NBC cast star in this movie, it would have been a huge success.

B004ZN9ERI|5.0|Warning to the 20-somethings and 30-somethings!  This masterful album will be incomprehensible to those from the DIGITAL GENERATION WITH NO IMAGINATION.  There is no mention of b****es or hoopties in the lyrics.<br />You may find, however, that some of the musical phrases will eventually be sampled and used in the \\"music\\" that you are used to listening to.  Until then, keep playing with your iphone, posting your incognizant garbage on Twitter and Facebook and developing your repulsive, narcissistic personality disorder.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|As a person might guess from the title, this book is not light reading, and in some places is quite disturbing.  It is also profound and timeless.  No mature adult should leave it unread.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said?<br /><br />While I love the cowboys in space feel, the characters are the real reason that I fell in love with Firefly. Everyone is a complex individual with a past. They are all realistic, flawed, wonderful, everyday people. This is a show told from the point of view of some average people who may or may not always be on the right side of the law. Most of the characters are not easily categorizes as \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\". There are complications and shades of grey that add layers of interest. The stories told are interesting and realistic (well, as realistic as stories set in space in the future can be).<br /><br />The dialogue is witty, intelligent, and often downright hilarious.<br /><br />This is my favorite series and I will forever be sad that the many many questions have been left unanswered by the lack of additional seasons.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|Buying every season in addition to watching on CW and TNT. Watch repeatedly and never ever get tired of the cast in this show. They are amazing.  Thank you Ackles, Padalecki and Collins.
034580404X|1.0|I love the &#34;idea&#34; of this story.  I love the Christian Grey character in this book, including his creepy sides.  I HATE the writing and the editing was about non existent!!!  I have never bought a &#34;bestseller&#34; book that had such bad writing!!!  Everyone murmurs and other repetitive words like &#34;Oh my!&#34; in every sex scene and some! The inner goddess (yeah she gave her subconsciousness a character) crap got old real quick because she is mentioned obsessively!!!  The author runs out of material to write about, so you're left reading useless information about them going to work, having breakfast, day 1, 2, 3, then day 5, it's ridiculous!  You are actually reading the details of everyday from book one to three.... complete lack of creativity and the author obviously didn't care to try harder which is VERY apparent in these books.  The story consists of american characters in america, yet some English words and terms are used (I guess because the author is English).  I'm sorry but how do you mess that up?!<br /><br />It was utterly annoying!!! I started the read so I felt compelled to have to finish it.  The process was torturous and it made me grumpy right after reading some of it.  My husband would laugh at me because I would get frustrated reading, put the book down, light a cigarette, swear under my breath as I picked it back up and continued swearing every 5 min.  If I could beat the hell out of Anastasia, I would, over and over again, for being such an annoying idiotic character!!!  I waited a month before writing a review because I absolutely needed a detox.<br /><br />I'm hoping the movie version will redeem this story because honestly it had potential before the author decided to squat and crap these books out.  I understand it was her first book(s) and it was, at first anyway, self published, but that's no excuse to insult the reader audience with such BS material!  I'm insulted that the &#34;New York Times&#34; had the audacity to call ita bestseller.  I know it has more to do with the amount of books sold rather than its quality, but they should have made an exception here.  I have lost respect for the New York Times!  I regret ever purchasing and reading these books.  I hate that I contributed to this piece of crap AND everyone, including myself, lost some IQ points just for reading this dump!  In fact, I think I'll burn them.  Honestly, NO ONE can benefit anything by reading them.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I loved the play, the movie and the music! And as much as I love the songs on this CD, it misses the mark by not including the heart-clenching version of &#34;Do you hear the people sing?&#34;  Still an enjoyable listen, building on the emotions and mood I felt from the movie--that's why I gave it 4 stars.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love the Pendergast series and this one did not disappoint! Also nice was that Ms Green's mystery was explained, can't wait for the next one.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A well written story and a must read for anyone that has been a victim of abuse, that there is hope. Kate (aka Erin), the main character in the story is an inspiration that we all can find the couragous side of us if we believe.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome!  I think it would be even cooler if there were natural disasters.  Like floods up to 5 blocks high and tornadoes that blow your house to different parts of the world. There should also be volcanoes
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Okay, so I haven't liked something this much since Lost. Watched this on a whim, thinking it would be something my son would like but now I'm super hooked!
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was the first book i read from this author and i really enjoyed it. The details of the crime committed and the investigation was clear and engrossing.  Would recommend this book.
B002AT4K9G|4.0|This one is definitely up there with some of my favorite car movies, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel both do great, and Jordanna Brewster is a clean-cut babe. A little unrealistic with both times the cars Vin drives lift off the ground, but outside of that the race quality was pretty great!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A fabulous book with a wonderful history of the world.  Most enjoyable and informative reading as all of Ken Follett's book are to read.

B00005JSGU|1.0|For some build in reason the dvd would not play. Screen kept saying it had regional restrictions.<br />Do Not buy this Your just waisting your money. It will only run on your computer after you change the regional setting on windows media player and you can only do that a few times.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who likes great tv, or who liked the series lost. Again this is a great show.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Actually I liked it very much and found it most entertaining.  The whole book is very easy reading, entertaining and engaging.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The game adds a silly yet fun twist to the runner type games. I believe the name, Barry Steakfries is pretty cool. The game holds my attention which is a huge plus. It's easy enough that kids can play.<br /><br />Be warned parents, when the game starts Barry's jetpack is actually a machine gun. The scientist get shot (no blood or gore) by this. They are also killed by the zappers and some just pass out/die for no reason. It looks a little funny, Half Brick did not go into great detail to make them look dead which is a good thing.<br /><br />I found the game fun and I also play it on my Windows 8 computer.

B0037WP83M|5.0|I recommend the streaming option for those who are able to get relatively decent internet speeds. I watched this on my computer and TV. It can be streamed through the Xbox as well. I do not know if it is available through the Playstation and Wii yet but I heard it was in the works.

B00992CF6W|1.0|I love minecraft on the pc. Very bummed over the pocket edition. Its very hard to move and strafe, and trying to tap the screen to place blocks and break them is slow, tedius, and difficult. Fighting is very hard. I wish the kindle had a demo version like the google nexus and samsung galaxy. Do not waste 6.99 on it. Play it on the pc instead.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I did not watch the original Dark Shadows on TV, did not know the premise.  From the promos, I thought it might be really funny - did laugh some and Johnny was his usual great self.  Good story, didn't enjoy it as much as I expected to.
B001NN4162|5.0|Great movie - I purchased this for my kids for christmas - great movie for the whole family to watch.
0316228532|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed JK Rowlings series Harry Potter and was antipating the arrival of this book Casual Vacancy.  What a huge disappointment!  I tried to read this book, even skipped to the end but could NOT finish it.  It is filled with profanity and sexual content that disappoints.  I find this to be a book of filth and will NOT read or recommend it to anyone.  I hope that JK Rowling realizes that it isn't filth or profanity that sells to adults but rather a well written book, with a good plot.  Shame on JK Rowling for advertizing this as a book for adults, it's not fit for anyone.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I love this app it's so cool it tells me the weather the day the time it wake me up to go to school it's awesome!!!!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Great movie! I love the humor, and Shia is such a great actor. Definitely entertaining! It's something that you can pop in for company and not be disappointed in.
B009RX7IX8|3.0|CASTLE presented itself as a very promising show. It's light-hearted wit and slap-stick humor lit up the hour. Stana Katic emerged as a potentially great actress and this show suits her well. Nathan Fillion, one of the most funniest and surprising actors shines like Stana as the humorous sidekick of Detective Beckett as a Novel Author. Together their constant bantering and growing tension pays off as real genuine spark of fun. The other cast members, (two other detectives) Ryan and Javier serve as the comic relief of the show, and of course there Laine, the medical examiner. It was a promising show, but once season four hit, things took a downturn. It's hard to give the show a worthy watch when episodes continued to be poorly written and seemed more like they wanted you to hate Detective Kate Beckett and Richard Castle throughout the season because they constantly argue. I as a writer couldn't feel for these two being an actual couple. When it came to (little spoiler) the finale of season four, we are slapped with constant cliches of Beckett and Rick back and forth on their love for each other, until finally Beckett for an unexplained reason decides while sitting on a swing in the pouring rain that she needs Rick. This isn't how true love should be written as when she shows up at his door I didn't feel they were in love, but forced by the writers to be together. They also should've been together long before if it was indeed their goal of them being together. Though I prefer them apart as it's funny watching them tease each other. Season Five is alright, you can certainly check it out, but it's quite average and none of that sweet humor you get from the first 3 seasons seem to truly sparkle here. The humor pops in very little and it seems like these writers are again making Beckett question her relationship with Castle, so just be prepared for some repeated story lines and character develops you might have already seen. It's not a terrible show as it does do better then most cop shows now on tv from what I've seen. If you like some pure wit and hilarious humor, I recommend season 1 through 3. Give season 4 and 5 a try if you like. Castle has an uncertain road ahead of it, but we'll see how things play out.<br /><br />DVD wise of the first 3 seasons that I have are worth checking out. They contain cast commentary as well as some really funny outtakes. Season 3 gives a behind the scenes look with some of the cast as well as a extra special with Nathan Fillion himself. I recommend this to anyone who likes cop shows and those into romantic stories. I hope this review helps. Take care and see if this show is right for you.
1423140605|5.0|I bought this as a gift and really didnt have time to read it all the way, but was so good I bought one for myself.
B000M53GQS|5.0|If you're a Gerry Rafferty fan, then you'll really get into this 2-CD combo.  It has his big hits Baker Street, Right Down the Line, and Get It Right Next Time.  Along with those songs is a great rocker called TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (No, not anything like the hackneyed Steve Miller tune).<br /><br />It's well worth the price, and a great find for anyone &#34;getting into&#34; the one-time great Scottish songwriter.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this CD (it does have some lyrics that are not suitable for young ears)!  I have his first CD Hoodlums and DooWop (I think it's called) and love that one too!  Just love me some Bruno Mars!

0307744434|4.0|I was recommended The Night Circus by a number of people when the book first came out, but was working my way through a Sci-Fi binge spurred on by having read Leviathan Wakes. When it finally wore off, The Night Circus was patiently waiting for me on my desk, and I decided to give it a read.<br /><br />There are several strong points in the story that I will go into without actually writing about the story itself- I love going into books without knowing anything more than the title and the cover art. I don't now, it's just me.<br /><br />Storyline- The storyline I felt was very well made, romantic and dark. It was one of the strong points in the book, and despite some flaws, I found myself compelled to read into it. I almost feel as though many storylines could have evolved from the entire world setting, but the author choice to dive head on into the heart of the matter, which is perfectly understandable.<br /><br />Characters- The characters were a little too ambiguous at times, as though you were being shown a slice of life, but even then, a mere slice of that slice was truly handed to you as the reader. This allows a more forgiving interpretation of the events that transpire, however with the storyline spanning across several years, a little more concrete development would have been appreciated.<br /><br />Readability- This is important for any book. You can have a great storyline, great characters and still fail if your book is just hard to read. This is what The Maze Runner suffers from, subpar writing style in the midst of a fantastic storyline. However, the author in this case writes beautifully, and this shines moreso than anything else, making the book all the more pleasurable.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to the author's future works. I've read many new stories in 2012, but The Night Circus really left the biggest impact on me. I am hesitant to say that it was the best book that I read, however I can readily say it was my favorite book to read, if that makes any sense.favorite book to read, if that makes any sense.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Heartbreaking,spiritual and lovely. I would recommend this book to anyone needing to be reminded of the goodness in life and the true companionship that our pets bring to our lives.

B000002GJH|5.0|It's really pretty terrific, very strong song writting and some great musicians/friends working together. Songs lean more towards the slower, ballad Pearl Jam-esque than the loud/fast Soundgarden rock.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|It was written by Michale Connelly so why would I not give it 5 stars. He must write more so I don't have to wait so long from one book to the next.
B0031RSBS2|4.0|As good as the previous dozen. Same guy different stage. If you like any one of the books you will like them all.
B00005JKG9|2.0|I was excited to see this.  I love most of the cast (Spacey and Lemmon are tops for me and Pacino had a career once, and Harris and Arkin are uneven yet gratifying at times) and so I really wanted to see them dig their nails and their teeth into this critically acclaimed character study.  The dialog is raved as some of the best ever written and the film regarded by many as a masterpiece.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />I'm sorry, but this film is just overrated to the extreme.  I mean how is this screenplay so lauded?  It just felt like a lot of useless babble.  The constant barrage of yelling and cursing and accusing and defensive jargon didn't go anywhere.  By the time the film ended we really knew no depth of character.  It just felt so skeletal, so hollow.  The ensemble wasn't a whole lot better.  Jack Lemmon was superb, I'll give him that, and he really should have received the Oscar nomination over Al Pacino (who didn't do anything of note).  The way he developed his character's backstory was heartbreaking.  Other than that though, there isn't much to write home about.  Pacino regurgitates the same character he does in every film, Spacey is a robot, Harris merely yells (although he builds a scared little man rather well) and Arkin does absolutely nothing.<br /><br />I just don't get this.<br /><br />`Glengarry Glen Ross' is consumed with a cast of characters who are horribly unlikable (like, not one of them), but that isn't a problem initially.  People in general can be unlikable and so that in itself is honest.  That being said, the issue lies in the lack of depth brought to the characters and their plight.<br /><br />This was just empty rambling with no point or purpose.
B000WS4OZM|4.0|The American Records albums are so well crafted, well recorded and have more heart than 90% of what's out there in the past 20 years. Do yourself a favor and start picking these up. Often stripped down, raw and perfectly produced at the same time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I know if it is a &#34;good&#34; book when I am continually drawn back to it. Can't wait to start reading after tending to the rest of my life.<br />On the down side I was not able to put myself in the character's place..............thank goodness. Not the best of endings.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|just great, Lana is amazing, and the vinyl is 110% the way to go. The clarity and tonal quality is excellent, and the LP is worth the few extra bucks. Great addition to the collection.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|The mystery was secondary to the romantic tension between the two main characters, Heat and Rook.  (How is every literary female police officer beautiful and brainy?)
1579128955|5.0|Lots of great photos and little tidbits about each element. Brings out the scientific wonder in all! A fun book and educational too.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was more depressing but still a good book.  My favorite was Catching Fire.  It does have a nice ending though.
B004123CO4|3.0|I could probably boil down the actual useful info in this book to under a dozen pages, but it's still worth the price if you're new to flash photography.
0765325950|5.0|I started reading this series when I was 12 years old and I must say sitting down to the last book at the age of 35 had a sort of bucket list affect upon me.  I savored the story and enjoyed every moment, even the sad ones.  I was perfectly content with Rand's conclusion and it just felt right.  I am not going to add any details because if you were like me I forbid anyone from telling me about the book because I wanted to find out on my own what happened.  I loved the the last three books and I think Mr. Sanderson did a fantastic job with the legacy that was left for him to finish.  Well done sir, well done.
B008645YH6|4.0|This is the second album from Marina & The Diamonds. I think it's very good and I like it a lot, but I don't know if I would have fallen as head over heals for her based on this outing as I did her previous album, &#34;The Family Jewels.&#34; Just buy them both already.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This game was installed on my tablet, it would probably work well on a smart phone too, but a little small to enjoy.  The only downside is that when you complete it it has no replay ability.
B0080SSYUW|5.0|I was very impressed by the different stories told in this book. ;Grisham has the talent to write where we all live.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Awesome Lego model the details are so cool- fold out bed, curtains, mirrors, etc. took about three days to put together.
B00004WNYT|5.0|This album is really what got me into the Red Hot Chili Peppers. From there I looked into their back catalog and now have everything they have ever done. This album is completely different. The addition of Dave Navarro brought forth stronger, dark, rock oriented grooves. Some people may like this album and no others, other devoted Pepper fans I suspect won't rate it as high. I think it's terrific.
B002RZZIXU|4.0|This is one of the best books I've read in the last 12 months. The plot developed well and kept the reader's interest right up to the very end. READ IT!
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|it is nice to see the old crew back together again. This is a great movie for the whole family.
0767812166|5.0|I totally enjoyed this film when it first came out and also had it on VHS years ago. I was elated to find it on DVD. The DVD arrived in a timely manner and without any damage.
B0001932ZA|2.0|I'm a pretty big fan of Arnold movies but this one is actually pretty terrible, and not in the typical fun way. Just boring, looks terrible and plain not fun. How can an Arnold movie not be fun? By being The Runing Man, or maybe End of Days.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's not  a chicks book eventhough the main character is female. I loved the twists and turns of the plot. Very easy to follow and read but the story really grips you.
B008G59IKO|3.0|I love grean day !  Love em' love em' love em'.  Been a fan since day one.  However, i really wanted to love this album.  I figured UNO was awesome, this would be equally as awesome.  Not so, It has some great tracks, don't get me wrong. but not as fast paced as Dos.  good album, worth buying if you are a fan.  then again i'm not a music critic and don't work for rolling stone.  I wil however see these guys when they come to my city.  rock on green day !
B009VL28W2|5.0|Since I'm from Quebec City and I saw this show, it was a no-brainer for me to buy it. Great city, great crowd, great show!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Good Price and good quality. The whole harry potter film with a reasonable price and blu-ray quality.<br />Satisfy with this offer.

B00APUYN0I|5.0|Sat down with the wife and daughter to watch this. I was surprised. I thought I would be suffering the time but it was actually funny and the family enjoyed it as a whole.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Following Season 4's mind-shattering denouement (in which Dexter learns to prioritise other issues beyond his need to kill and sate his Dark Passenger), his life has been shredded by the death throes of the Trinity Killer. The ripple effect of his triple life as a father, vigilante and forensic blood spatter analyst come back to haunt him in a singular moment of revelation and horror.<br /><br />As one who has followed the first four seasons would expect, the initial episode focuses on Dexter and his internal struggle and debate on how and whether to move forward. Although this would leave less time to focus on the antagonists of these twelve episodes, the focus is on Dexter and a monumentally instrumental (though temporary) addition to Dexter's life and the series as a whole. The pace is breakneck throughout, and as always, the viewer is invited to put themselves inside Dexter's emotionless head once again.<br /><br />The rest of the cast (Debra, Batista, Quinn and LaGuerta) continue to develop, and though the season only takes a month or so, we see the stirrings of aftershocks that will be explored further in season six and beyond. A must-have for all Dexter fans. Debra finally breaks out of her neat and shell of rules and regulations. Her emotions finally shove her reason and detective training out of the driver's seat, and she is forced to confront a situation with many shades of gray.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a good game all together the only &quot;problem&quot; Is the goals. I don't want to Have to like them on FB or follow them on Twitter or post pictures of the game. Those type of goals are unnecessary. Otherwise it's a fun way to pass time. I never buy coins or fake dollars for games and thankfully in this game they didn't make it where it gets in the way if you don't unlike most of the others.
1457514508|4.0|I was interested in this book because I live in the neighborhood that provides the setting for this story. No, we do not have a Ladies Dog Walking Club, but there is a park in Gordonston that functions as a gathering place for dogs and their owners, and I found myself recognizing some of the characters (hmm, could that really be...?)<br />I enjoyed the pace of this book as it seemed to pick up in just the right sections. The many references to Savannah did become a bit monotonous, perhaps because I live here, I didn't feel the need to be reminded of location of the story. The different cities that were described added a nice contrast and the characters were diverse enough to be able to keep them separate in my mind as I read along. I found that some of the characters were developed more than others, and I would have appreciated more backstory on certain ones. The plot twist at the end made me laugh out loud. There were some parts of the story that could have been fleshed out a bit more; as written, some of them seemed like an afterthought, or an undeveloped story line, but I was left wanting to hear more! More of the characters' stories, what were their individual lives like before they were brought together geographically, and what will happen next? This book could easily turn into a series and I would be first in line to buy every one of them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pretty awesome to compare to other minecraft games you should buy this it's not a waste of money.<br /><br />Great for Minecraft lovers.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|it was great. I wish it was at the theater. its better than the first one, must see film for a good rainy day.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved everything about this book. It was good from beginning to end. I would recommend this book to anyone who lives a good romantic twist.
B009O2XY12|2.0|my granddaughter loved this game. She played it daily until she ran out of balls etc. Now i have to pay for more balls for her to continue. Thats not explained before you buy it. i would not recommend to get it.
B00000331V|3.0|Although this album captures some of the live atmosphere of a J. Geils show, it doesn't quite measure up the energy of their Full House live album. I bought this album with the hopes that it would be as much fun as Full House, but it comes up a little short. I still come down on the side of the fence that says &#34;buy it&#34;..I mean, afterall, it IS the J. Geils Band.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|This was awesome. the story line goes great with the first season. I could not stop watching it. I hope they come out with a third season.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie and now I can't wait to see what the movie has in store. I also loved the way it was written, in letters, but also disappointed because you never find out who they are written to
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|The game is not long. It is hard for my child to win. I don't recommend this game for kids under 6.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|For my money Meryl Streep is the greatest actor on the planet.  It's amazing how she manages to transform herself physically and psychologically into a totally new person with every character she plays.  I was reminded of her character in The Devil Wears Prada as comparison to the meek, quiet and rather ordinary housewife she plays here.  Her performance is always worth the price of admission.  This film is a bit bizarre and, at times, over the top with scenes between the characters that made me somewhat uncomfortable.  I mean who wants to watch two old people having sex?  Yet it is done very honestly and addresses a very real issue in the lives of many people.  Jones is always Jones to some extent.  He seems to have cornered the market on cranky old guys.  But he does it very well and it was fun watching him morph back into a different mind set.  This is a &#34;Must See&#34; movie for married couples over the age of 50.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Mr Nelson Demille takes you on a trip to Long Island makes you feel every twist and turn in the road.  It took lots of will power to put the book down in order to sleep.
B001HMSFFC|5.0|The best of friends in the best city in the world; NYC!  I love this movie...it's perfect for a great girls night in.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This book remains a comfort to come back to. Krakauer's voice does poetic justice to the life and plight of Alexander Supertramp, providing inspiration and a sublime sense of closure on what happened in and around \\"magic bus\\" 142.<br />This is a book that is all-too ready to jump off the shelf and into my hands. Pick it up if you haven't already, there is much truth to be found in these pages.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Being a fan of scni fi, I chose this series based on my curiosity and reviews by others and I was not disapointed in the least.  I can't believe that this show was only given one season.  The stories were great,  the acting was great, the settings were great, far superior to so many other shows currently playing.  I highly recommend this series!
0679805273|5.0|This is the product I was looking for.<br />I was happy to find it on your site, and have it sent directly to the recipient.<br />Always fun to get a Dr. Seuss book even when you are all grown up.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It starts off slow, but once you get in to it, its a great book, that'll have you wanting to turn every page.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just love these books. I am not a reader at all, but I gave in and began reading this book. I am not finished with it yet, but it is an awesome read!
B00117W1HQ|1.0|The price of season two was bumped up 3 times.  I will by DVD for now on.  Supernatural was great.  Amazon Instant Video failed.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Absolutely love this album! Alt-J is a great new artist! One must take the time to listen to the tracks :)
B00957T6X6|4.0|This set of books is a good choice for kindle since it is so. For a change I am watching the video series first, and using the book to fill in some details.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this book, giving into society, and I have to tell you, I hate reading, and I couldn't put this book down. It was a matter of days before I had the book completely read - the first book I've read cover to cover since High School. My husband is reading these books with me as well and it definitely spices things up for us. :-)
B002ZG974W|5.0|I wish I had watched this movie in the theater. I did watch the trailers for it before it came out, but I never found time to actually do. For parents or guardians wanting to watch it with children, beware, there will be nudity (female breasts) at the beginning of the movie. However, there is no blood from the delivery process. The breasts were shown when feeding the babies. The story and the camera moments were just fascinating to watch from beginning to end.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I really enjoy this 3 cd buy.  Definitely worth the money and a great buy.  Good &#34;grown and sexy&#34; music for our time.

B000YDE46Y|5.0|I bought into the hype and these boots are worth the money. I've worn them to work (I'm on my feet 8 solid hours a day) a few times and they're really comfortable. They look professional and rugged. I wear an 11.5 and was nervous about buying a 10.5 per the advice of other posts but it's true. The 10.5 fits perfect.

0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is a brilliantly simple book that you will, and should be able to at 120 pages, finish in one sitting. There's not much more to be said, just read it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|awesome game! can be replayed many times with different results each time. not a one time game that can be finished in a day.
1400031001|5.0|This book keeps the reader enthralled as it moves through the decades of the prime character's life. Must be seen with the BBC video edition which is both compelling and moving.

B007XNAOS0|4.0|Post-sludge metallers Baroness have finally followed up their wildly successful (albeit three year old) sophomore effort, \\"Blue Record,\\" with an even more colorful third record. The Savannah, Georgia natives experimented with progressive flourishes on that 2009 album, and 2012's \\"Yellow & Green\\" leans even more in that direction. It is a sprawling, epically epic double album that spreads across 18 songs, and is a whopping 75 minutes deep. And it actually owes as much to prog rock icons like The Cure, Queensryche, King Crimson (and even Pink Floyd and U2!) than from, say, Mastodon, Black Sabbath, and anything doomy or metallic, for that matter. A heavy debt is also owed to post/progressive metal titans Isis, Rush, and Pelican, throughout.<br /><br />All told, some metalheads will fear that this testosterone-depleting direction makes for a watered-down sound and/or makes it seem like the band is going soft. But the more adventurous and objective metalhead will realize that Baroness are unique in that they are able to recognize the value of contrast. And, from a creative standpoint, the band definitely gets the last laugh.<br /><br />The set kicks off with \\"Take My Bones Away,\\" a misleadingly heavy and aggressive opener that echoes out with a surprisingly brisk pace, thundering rhythms, and big, meaty, Mastodon-ian guitar and bass riffs. Then comes \\"March To The Sea,\\" a very progressive number with a bouncy, driving, martial-sounding drum beat, a grumbling bass, and some soaring guitar and vocal harmonies. \\"Little Things\\" is an equally-as-proggy piece, although it does underpinned by a propulsive, low, grumbling bass groove. Then, following another dreamy, unplugged guitar interlude (\\"Twinkler\\"), we are treated to two delightfully experimental and richly textured and innovative tracks: \\"Cocainium\\" and the misleadingly-entitled \\"Back Where I Belong.\\" Both are very innovative, experimental, and new-wavy numbers that feature more keyboards than guitars. That said, though, both do retain a certain level of satisfying metallic crunch -- in the case of the former, it is a strong, adherent, thundering bass groove; and in the latter, it is some infectious, bluesy guitar soloing. But Baroness then return \\"Yellow & Green\\" to its heavy roots, as \\"Sea Lungs\\" is an again up-tempo and deliciously crunchy hard rawker.<br /><br />Disc two is like \\"Blue Record\\" in that it is peppered with a handful -- five, to be exact -- of really nice and gorgeous acoustic interludes (see: \\"Green Theme,\\" \\"Mtns. The Crown & Anchor,\\" \\"Foolsong,\\" \\"Stretchmarker,\\" and \\"If I Forget Thee, Lowcountry\\") that really help to flesh-out richness and vibrant color to the record's value of contrast and texture. Of the proper songs, \\"Board Up The House\\" is a big standout, as it augments crunchy and distorted, Black Sabbath-esque guitar riffs with grumbling bass lines, some Rush-like swing, and Thin Lizzy-worshipping vocals (including some catchy, sing-songy choruses). And \\"Collapse\\" is another because it is perhaps the most progressive piece to be found here, and is highlighted by some new-wave-esque keys and dreary clean singing. But \\"Psalms Alive,\\" with its heavy, driving bass throb, jazzy drum beat, and exceptional guitar soloing, should not be overlooked, either. And neither should \\"The Line Between,\\" a very surprisingly heavy and hard-rocking tune with foundation shaking guitar and bass chops that evoke Mastodon's \\"Leviathan\\" days.<br /><br />In conclusion, Baroness will likely only get weirder (i.e. more progressive, melodic, and/or experimental) from here on out. But if \\"Yellow & Green\\" is any indication, \\"weird\\" is good -- very, very good, in fact.both do retain a certain level of satisfying metallic crunch -- in the case of the former, it is a strong, adherent, thundering bass groove; and in the latter, it is some infectious, bluesy guitar soloing.

145210655X|5.0|Seriously, this book was a fun read!! Everyday father-son situations, except with Darth and Luke? How could that not be funny...From whining &#34;are we there yet?&#34; while flying through the stars, to blowing bubbles in his drink in the cantina, every page was a laugh. As a bonus, the illustrations are great too! This is definitely a book to have in hard cover on your shelf.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|My husband and I watch this show as it is playing during season and Love it. This product was bought on sale at a great price and couldn't go wrong. It's great entertainment and isn't as crude and graphic as other shows on TV right now.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Could not put the book down.  Every chapter filled with mind twisting turns, leaving you in total suspense until the very last page.
B000NY12LO|5.0|&#34;Nineteen Minutes&#34; is a rivoting book; especially after the horror in Sandy Hook School. There were so many similarities. I've just discovered Jodi Picoult and as an avid reader I'm sorry I didn't do it earlier. She captures your imagination, your heartstrings, your attention, and once the book is started you race through because you can't wait to learn the ending.
B00782O7IY|5.0|My wife and I spent an enchanting evening watching this movie together.  The casting was superb and the actors' skills drew us into caring for their destiny in a make-believe world. That's what movie magic is all about.
B005LAII9O|5.0|Bought this as a gift and felt that it was a great value for all 3 copies especially at the time of purchase around Christmas.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A great quick getaway when you need it, beware though, you'll want to keep going! It's as easy or hard as you want it to be.

0547848412|4.0|Metaphors, themes, and symbolism aside, the audio version of this book taught me one thing: To hate the word \\"tarpaulin.\\"
B00887490Y|4.0|The town of Cold Rock has been terrorized by \\"The Tall Man,\\" who, the townspeople believe, is responsible for a series of missing children. A French-Canadian production \\"The Tall Man\\" centers on Julia Dunning (Jessica Biel), a widowed nurse respected in the community, whose young boy David is abducted by a hooded stranger in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, \\"The Tall Man,\\" set in a small Washington State ex-coalmining town, is less about the titular person and the truth behind the missing kids, than about the community's people trapped in this dying town - including Jenny (Jodelle Ferland), a lonely young girl Julia likes - and how the \\"truth\\" will be revealed to us in an unconventional way.<br /><br />Written and directed by Pascal Laugier (\\"Martyrs\\"), \\"The Tall Man\\" is suspenseful throughout, with enough surprises to keep us interested, though those who expected more orthodox-type horror might find it disappointing. Like Daniel Stamm's \\"The Last Exorcism,\\" much of the film's appeal lies in the flaunting, or disregard, of genre conventions.<br /><br />I am impressed with the way the film, without using fragmented narrative, tantalizes the audience's curiosity as to what is really going on, and Jessica Biel's fine performance. This is more a mystery than a horror and it works as such.
B006H5120E|5.0|3d wasn't bad could have popped out more Guess it wasn't made for 3d originally so making it 3d was only okay
B00A8KJK7G|2.0|I frankly do not understand why his cartoons are so popular. I enjoy the movies, Sleepy Hollow is one of my favourite ones, Sweeney Todd was also super-mega-great! But all the cartoons ... I do not connect to them and did not watch any of previous ones, so decided to give Frankenweenie a good try... and I could not, switched it off in the middle - everything is so dark and so unbelievably ugly, I constantly wonder why would you do something like that? There is clear disbalance between the super ugly \\"as if cute\\" heroes and the screenplay, such heroes would fit some adult-rated horror cartoons, but the screenplay looks very childish, happy and peaceful, completely not matching the way main characters are drawn. Probably this is the main reason why people like this, but I fail to connect. Try watching a trailer, and if you are hesitant after it, really, do not try this. I also do not think the cartoon is any good for kids due to freaky and ugly characters.<br /><br />And it is really unpleasant to know that Disney studio was making this.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|It is not what I thought it would be.  It's just ok.  I wanted something that would keep me interested longer.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a game right up my alley. There is something very therapeutic about all parts fitting neatly into the grid. I like the touch screen input and the way the pipes glow as you draw them. I like that just when you think it is impossible to create all the lines without crossing any, there is a solution when you think beyond the obvious.<br /><br />They get harder as you progress. There is a benefit (albeit in your own mind) to get perfects on levels by only drawing each line once. There are many, many levels, advertising is minimal and doesn't interfere and the game is free.<br /><br />Can't beat that.<br /><br />It is repetitious so I like it for chilling out but not for a huge challenge like a complex logic puzzle.<br /><br />A great app at the perfect price.
B00540G3G6|5.0|3d was great on the LG Tv. Saw it on regular 2d but was awsome on 3d. You won't be disappointed.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Worked well on my Kindle HD 7. Enough functionality to please most with this easy card game. Would recommend to others.
B003XT60KO|5.0|...I have ever read.<br /><br />Excellent read for the layperson. Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well. Explains the mess our government has created and why its continued destructive policies are leading our country to assured economic collapse. Policies based entirely on fallacies!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Nice and long, but not too long that you lose interest. There's a lot of running back and forth, but travel is quick so its really not too annoying. The story is well-written and keeps you interested and excited too see what happens next. The graphics are nice and the game ran very smoothly on my kindle fire. Can't wait to check out the sequel!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had the best time reading this book!! I couldn't put it down and had it read in 1 day. The only thing I didn't like is I felt  like her best friend Six (or Seven.. odd names in this book) needed a bigger part and I am really sad that the story is over and it doesn't seem like there will be more to Sky and Holder's story. Anyone on the fence on if you should buy this or not... you have to read it. The reviews on this book is so great with reason.. because it is one of the best books you will read!!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillip Phillips is extreemly talanted...he's kinda of Bluesy with Dave Matthews mixed in and he is right on with his guitar playing also.  This young man will go far!
B008Z9L94O|1.0|I purchased this for my husband for Christmas this year. He opened it and was so excited because he is a big fan of the Smashing Pumpkins. Well, he took it apart and started playing the music and this is where it gets disappointing. Some of the songs skipped, there were black blobs on two of the records so they wouldn't even play, and scratches. I would not advise in purchasing this product. HUGE disappointment!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting. You get to unlock a lot of things and you are constantly challenging yourself to get that better than ever score!

B00AMBH70S|2.0|$5 to rent this movie? New movies go for $4. Why the premium? This movie wasn't good. In fact I would recommend a $3 price tag on it. Definitely the worst Bourne movie so far. I was bored most of the movie and couldn't care less about the characters.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a pretty good game for preteens and smaller children. It helps your brain think I move through them too quickly.
0316223239|4.0|This book comes from the perception of a 5 yr old boy, which in a way is a breath of fresh air. It's not your usual narrator or perception when reading. Although the books back story is very frightning and unpleasant, you never really get the disturbing details cause the story comes from such young eyes.<br /><br />The first half of the book entails the story of this boy and his mother who are trapped in \\"room.\\" It slowly unfold how and why they are there. The second half of the book has to do with the adjustments made outside of \\"room.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed the young perception of life and things thru the book. I loved how the book makes you grateful for what you have and even who you are. It also left me thinking, wondering and discovering how we are who we are and how we got there in so many different un-thought of ways.

B00B1CGDTS|1.0|Everyone has an opinion (as obvious by the 300 plus Amazon editorial reviews by all the wanna-bes).<br /><br />Now you have to shovel away the pile to get to the real story of a product review.<br /><br />I love most John Wayne movies and this one I've purchased in every format through the years.<br />None of those release had a quality issue (or official release) like the Batjac / Wayne Estate issue a few years back - found here on Amazon [[ASIN:B000ITF86E McLintock]]<br /><br />Warning!<br />Pay attention to the product quality reviews.<br />If you don't, you'll buy this blu-ray issue from Olive Films and may end up upset if any type of quality is important to you.<br /><br />Two words - it's crap.<br />No remastering, no cleaning it up, etc.<br /><br />What I'm shocked to see is the description of the movie listed on the back of the label begins with \\"Batjac presents\\" making me think this may have been another Estate issue, but sad to see that if it is, it's a very sloppy and lazy effort to make money.<br /><br />Also, you're offered one of those \\"what's up with that\\" moments here when you compare this product with the blu-ray dot com review, and realize someone is blowing smoke up somebodys backside.<br /><br />I can't help but wonder how much bias and personal preference goes into reviews by people who receive free stuff - like the Amazon Vine people we so often disagree with.<br /><br />Tell the truth - for 22 or 24 bucks, you're being taken for a ride here.<br />Wait until it hits the $7.88 (or less) bin at Walmart.<br />That's the treatment this issue of the movie deserves.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing and even though I watched the movie first, it was still awesome. I can't wait to read the next book!!

B005FISBTO|5.0|I cannot knock this at all. Just another great season from Dexter. I do notice that he is not paying attention to little details like using peoples mobile phones, using a High School field house as a kill room, and maybe a few other minor things. But the show still cooks along just fine. If you are a Dexter fan, what are you readin' this for, anyway? You know that you are going to buy this, so go ahead. You will not be disappointed.
B005LAII8A|4.0|Time travel is possible but it is illegal to do for fear of changing the time line and thus altering future events.  In the future criminals have a difficult time killing their enemies as everybody is traceable and the disposal of bodies is impossible. The solution is to set up an organization in 2044 (the past) that you can send your victims back to and have them immediately terminated so they cannot change the future.....<br /><br />This is a good storyline with a deep Sci-Fi thriller built into it.  I won't ruin the story but just say that there are multiple twists and turns and the timeline implications will make your head spin.  The plot and scenario of the story will make you think so hard about what is happening that you may want to back the DVD up a couple of times and review and understand the possibilities.<br /><br />This is a deep movie and its imaginative script will keep you thinking of all the possible issues that the characters are facing.  It is well directed and produced movie and its surprise ending will keep you thinking about the complications of what might happen.<br /><br />My wife and I both like the movie and we rated it between a 4 and a 5 star film.  I give it a 4 star rating and I hope you enjoy it.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Hopping and flying through the same screens over and over gets monotonous.  I believe it would be better if there are checkpoints to continue through different levels of the game.
0446310786|5.0|I've never read the book, till my boyfriend asked for it for christmas. When it came, I started reading the book. I could hardly put it down!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I love buying a CD where all the songs are enjoyable to hear.  This is definitely one of those albums.  Adele will be hard pressed to top this one.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|GREAT APP! It's easy to use and the features it has to offer are more that you get with some apps that you pay for. More bang for your buck and in this case a free buck. What more could you ask for?

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is really fun to play. I see kids playing games like Farmville and I don't like those games. But this one is different from them. It is awesome.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|All three age groups in this household love it. It has every human emotion, quirk, points-of-view,  goodness and badness. The castle is magnificent, and the costumes were perfect! I will be sorry if it ends anytime soon.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|It's an amazing album, and every song is worth listening to - some you'll listen to hundreds of times.  Enjoy.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Loved the game for free but definitely worth .99 for no ads popping up all the time. Great way to pass the time when waiting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|its a great book i think every one should read it,it has action, love, and suspense so you will want to keep on reading
B007HACDLK|5.0|I will admit to having some reservations in the past about Flynn's seemingly fairly rigid political and philosophical views - with the characters seeming a little too simplistic for my tastes. But I was pleasantly surprised to find this novel was a lot more flexible and thoughtful in some of the morality issues. Sure it's just a fictional thriller but I find it much more enjoyable when the characters have some depth instead of just a \\"kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out\\" mentality.<br /><br />This story is no more outrageous or fantastical than most thriller fictions but it is a pleasure to see some character development in addition to the usual action sequences. Best thriller I've read in a while and definitely worth the price in my opinion.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After waiting for several months, Season 3 is finally getting underway with more intrigues, suspense, unexpected twists and turns, subplots............all the things that make Downton Abbey a program that keeps one anxiously awaiting the next episode.<br />Although I've only been able to watch the first 3 episodes of Season 3, it hasn't failed tailed to keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen among the inhabitants of the Abbey, both aristocrats and downstairs servants. There's plenty of exciting things going on among the Abbey's residents. The addition of Shirley Maclaine as Lady Grantham's American mother stirs up plenty of new excitement and contention among the family with her sarcasm and disdain for the stuffy ways of the English aristocracy although she proves to offer a novel solution to the Grantham's spur of the moment dinner party disaster. Lady Mary continues to be headstrong and even takes a stand against her mother when Downton's future seems doomed, offering a glimpse of just how deeply English tradition is ingrained in some of the Granthams despite a seemingly hopeless future for their privileged way of life. Lady Judith's husband finds an unexpected ally among the blue-bloods when he returns for Mary's wedding. Things take an ugly turn between former allied trouble makers downstairs and keeps the suspense up between O'Brien and the duplicitous footman.she once plotted with to wreak troubles amid those in service as well as the Grantham family. Edith's role as spinster is finally resolved............maybe. I'm not saying any more. Just watch and you will find the Season 3 to continue offering excitement that keeps you impatiently waiting for the next episode. All the things that made the first two seasons entertaining continues right on with new and unexpected story lines in Season 3.
B003GK22D4|4.0|E xcellent story line and plot. I would highly recommend this and most other books by Ken Follett. Just purchased my next book by him and looking forward to reading it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I am in love with this puzzler. It offers fun gameplay with beautiful graphics (especially on a Kindle Fire HD). Even better, the game is supported with minimal ads so I get it for free with little hassle (unlike the iPhone version).<br /><br />Recommended for all puzzle and casual game fans!
0765325950|5.0|So many people have written so much already that it's hard to add a lot more of the details without giving anything away.  Surprisingly, one of the critical reviews mentions a comparison to Tolkien's Two Towers.  I had already noted that Sanderson had been able to do what Peter Jackson did, take things happening in different places and go back and forth so the reader knows what's going on all over the place without separating out a timeline for a specific army or character.  I got the book on a Friday and finished it on a Thursday - my husband insisted that I pay attention to him for at least a little time each day.  Unlike some other reviewers, I think Sanderson did a great job with the battles and thought the last battle deserved its length and breadth.  Like one reviewer, I was as exhausted as the fighters by the time the book had \\"an ending.\\"  I agree that an entire culture appeared with no explanation or description of its culture, but don't think this was really a problem.  I loved the fact that Loial and Thom fought to stay alive because they had to write a book and a ballad respectively.  I especially liked the twist in Min's story and wonder how she's going to deal with that and another role she may have to play after the last battle.  The ending was interesting and satisfying, but I would have liked one other character in on the twist. I don't think the book would have been as satisfying if it had been shorter.<br /><br />Like many others, I was very disappointed that the Kindle edition was not out right away.  I would have paid full hardcover price not to have to carry around a 912 page book.  But, luckily, I'm retired and only had one afternoon that I couldn't stay at home and read.  It was a fight to put the book down and go to sleep, but I woke up each morning wide awake and racing to return to my reading.  This reminded me of the beginning of the series (which I thought got very bogged down in the middle).  As I read the book, I heard the tv in the background talking about Mali and Algeria and wondered if we aren't headed for our own Tarmon Gai'don.  If so, I'd hope that we could have the strength to fight for balance of light and dark like the characters in the last book.  Yes, some good people die, but that helps put some realism into the story.  Yes a bad person lived and got a perfect ending to her storyline.  I think Sanderson did a great job in dealing with how the dark one is finally treated - it goes perfectly with the banner of the Dragon and the symbol of the Aes Sedai.<br /><br />I would not suggest that you read this book if you haven't read the others.  Because the Last Battle had to take up almost the entire last book, back stories you might think are missing have been set out in earlier books.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|AWESOME ACTION AND SPECIAL FX, PLOT WAS GOOD AS WELL. I'VE BEEN A JOE FAN SINCE THEY CAME OUT IN THE 80'S.
B001TXWJ4M|3.0|This show is very action packed and twisted. Although fiction it gives you an insight into the complexitys of paying for a cancer treatment, and how a High School Chemistry Teacher and his X student make crystal Meth and sell it.....and then they get mixed up in the Mexican Drug Cartel. This show is for Adults 18 and up. Don't get any idea's, Meth labs have this bad tendency of ruining buildings, and blowing up.

B001LPNW8K|5.0|This cd is an Excellent example of early melodic death metal. They should have stuck to this death metal formula.
B001NIC0A6|5.0|This 1997 movie depicts what can happen when you build a city next to a large &#34;dormant&#34; volcano, and the kind of damage that can be done. It shows the scientific side of the study of volcano's as well as keeping it a nice Hollywood drama with a love story.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I had the first lep's world it stunck but this one is awesome.if I were you I would get this app.
B000SEFNMS|2.0|Got the book today for my kindle fire HD by \\"one-click\\".  Too disappointed that the text-to-speech doesn't work.  That's the best feature of Fire HD.  The book is hard to read, with unfamiliar names, places and vocabs.  Having text-to-speech would really help.  Returned for refund quickly.  I'm fascinated by the story.  Will definitely buy it if Text to Speech is available!
B006TJXZ30|5.0|This function is very easy to use.  You can check your email easily at any time, and without any difficulty.  I recommend this app for email access.
B002NLY0V4|5.0|As a whole, supernatural takes a look at the scary and mystical legends, myths, and even religious aspects of life, and then shows these &#34;monster hunters&#34; Sam and Dean Winchester saving the day. Season Five shows Sam and Dean as well as the Angel Castiel trying to stop the Christian Apocalypse from happening in our current or modern time. If you pull your Bible out you will see that a lot of research went into making this season as scripturally accurate as it can be. The only part that a Christian may take issue with is the fact that they say God has stepped out of the building so to speak. (which I am sure every Christian has wondered about at one point in their life or another when there is a tragedy in the world) Now the arc angels and Lucifer try to start the Biblical Apocalypse while Sam, Dean, Bobby and Castiel try to stop it from happening. This season should not be watched by a youth or adult who is weak in their Christian faith, because it may make them believe that there is a God, he just doesn’t care anymore, which is not true. This should be watched by individuals 15 and up.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I confess, I am a music snob. The first CD I ever owned was the original cast of Phantom. So when the movie version came out a couple years ago, I was absolutely horrified by the performances and the way they made the background characters into caricatures. So I was thrilled when I found that there was actually a professional recording of the stage version. This does not disappoint. Christine has a good voice, and her acting is wonderful. I adored Hadley Frasier as Raoul, and Ramin Karimloo was a wonderful phantom (though I found his Canadian accent a bit jarring at the beginning juxtaposed against everyone else's British). Every singe face Carlotta makes is golden.<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I didn't like about it was the way they changed the scenery around. Instead of the full solid set they substituted large TV screens and projections for some of the background and for the mirror scene going into the title song. I'm pretty sure it had to do with the configuration of the stage, but I did miss the old set.<br /><br />All in all, probably the best experience you can get without actually going to the theater.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Couldn't put down the book.  Much like the first book, this one held my attention from page 1, can't wait to read the third book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had never played this game until my son downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire.  It's not hard to get the hang of, and can be addictive with continued use.
B0044KI79S|5.0|As with every season of supernatural, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what will happen next, I would recomend anyone with an intrest in the supernatural to watch this season.
6304698798|1.0|Amazon should make itself sure of what it offers.  As French is my first language recently ordered A Carstreet Named Desire and lately The Good, the Bad and the Ugly because in the advertising and on each boxe I received it is writen that French is between the languages you can select - and it is why I ordered the dvds : for the first it is only English spoken - of course - on the dvd and for the other English or Italian in the second. Once is much twice too much. At least it is not fair, and I may say dishonest.<br /><br />Sure I can sent them back but you imagine the waste of time and the disappointment, especially as I am not not a current resident in the Sates.  And I don't mention the fact that at the same period I ordered a wach I did not receive in the parcel!<br />Even if I was reimburse.<br />Please pay some attention !<br /><br />The one star is for the merchandise not for the movie.
B004Y042N8|5.0|I have been enjoying this app.  I guess it really depends on what kind of puzzle games you like.  For me, this one is relaxing.  I really don't mind not having any music in the background.  I usually keep the sound down on games anyway.  I like the tap feature instead of dragging the lines.  I gave it five stars because I love puzzle games that challenge you and make you think.  This is a keeper for me.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I enjoy having this on my phone; however, the one problem that is irritating is that it does not return to the book and the last page read if I don't get back to it in a day or so.  Then it is time consuming to find where I ended at the last reading.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I ordered two copies of this series. One in standard format and one in Blu-ray. I was able to buy both of them for less than one copy of the Blu-ray version was selling for at the local mall. Shipping was fast and the item brand new. Great value!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A new perspective on the place of \\"time\\" in our lives. At times it was almost rueful of humanity's maniacal focus on this reference concept. Overall a good read on a flight back home.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|A beautiful sequal I can't wait to read book 3 James dashner has me on the edge of my kindle lol
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and appreciated the way the author presented his experiences.  In some ways it validates what others have written about Heaven; yet he also had different experiences.  The fact that he had been dubious about the experiences of others, and even about the existence of Heaven,  but then had his own experience and tried to quantify it scientifically in order to convince himself also adds validity.  This was a huge risk for him, as an M.D., to present his experiences to the world since some in the medical field might consider him a &#34;flake&#34;, etc. I admire his courage.
B0000032LS|5.0|I ordered this used but it was described as &#34;like new&#34;.  It was as described and I'm very happy with it.  The music is awesome.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Got this movie for my oh friend fr Christmas. Now he has all the set. Would recommend this to anyone.
B002FOAVGC|4.0|It's an excellent film.<br />It transforms you into a totally new world and hooks you each and every moment.<br />The direction, production design, performances are spellbinding.<br />A powerful film
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like playing online against people its awesome. I would request it. also there are no freeze ups which is nice
0316056863|3.0|I thought since the author of this book was Tina Fey, it would be very funny. There was a little humor in the book, but I didn't think it was as funny as some of the reviews made me think it would be. As a biography though, it was really good. She didn't hold back as she took the reader on a journey through her career.<br /><br />I loved reading about her family. Especially the parts about her dad and the time her and her husband's family spent together each Christmas.<br /><br />My one complaint is her potty mouth. I can handle most cuss words, but this book had words that men should never say, much less a woman. Just isn't necessary!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Got this movie for my boyfriend for Christmas. Now he has the whole set. I would recommend this to anyone.
0060557818|3.0|In Neil Gaiman's fantasy \\"Neverwhere\\", Richard Mayhew, an average guy living in London with a job, an apartment, and a fiancee, is cast out of his life for the simple charitable act of caring for an injured waif he finds on the street.  He loses everything and more - people can no longer remember him, see him, or hear him, he's fallen through the cracks of reality.  In desperation, he seeks out the waif, a girl named Door, and joins her on her quest to find out who murdered her family.  Door has a special talent, as did the rest of her family - the ability to open doors and locks.<br /><br />Their quest takes them to London Below, a strange world of talking rats, odd people, strange creatures, an angel, heat-sucking vampires, ageless nobility, and some persistent murderers tracking Door.<br /><br />The book is rich in imagination and description and Gaiman presents the reader with a puzzle: is Mayhew experiencing these things, or has he had a psychotic break, perhaps schizophrenia, that makes him join the legion of homeless, invisible to normal citizens.<br /><br />On balance, I give the book 3 and 1/2 stars.  Gaiman writes well and creates a rich world, but the characters are two dimensional at best.  Door should have been one of the richest characters, but shows no emotion and seems to be completely defined by her clothes.  He ties London Below to the regular world, for example, by having black monks at the Blackfriars Tube Station.  That trick was cute the first couple of times, then it got old.  There are twists and turns that seemed to be tied more to how many pages it had been since the last crisis than an organic part of the plot.  I was taken by the motivation of the primary villain and the action he took that caused his punishment - that was clever and entertaining.  Gaiman's background in graphic novels seems to show through - perhaps what he wrote would be clearer if he had an illustrator to work with.  I'm rounding my rating down to 3 stars; I don't think I'll re-read this.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|This book describes very well and in a very interesting way the efforts made by the US government, intelligence services, special forces, and the persons involved, in order to achieve their goals in defense of their Country and mankind. My only objection is that the author uses too much initials the we civilians are not familiar with, and that is somehow confusing. Anyhow, I enjoyed this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|An incredibly intriguing cast of characters makes this a must see.  You can't help but become invested in the lives of the Downton residents - upstairs or down!
B008673ZAQ|1.0|Their relationship is so unstable ans makes me anxious at every turn. I won't give details away but their relationship makes me tired and the ending of the book make a me fear for the girl's sanity.
B00A7LNOB4|4.0|I really enjoy this book and I am glad to have bought it for Kindle. I also bought the paperback version because my teacher did not allow electronics. While I am not in class I use the Kindle version and the pages correlate to the paperback version so I can always match my progress from the ebook to the paperback. For some reason I read the Kindle version much faster and this helps me with bulky reading assignments so this is great for me.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|The game itself works great and is fun. After 2 weeks of play now I can't get to my allies bases. It makes it impossible to earn hearts which are required to make certain stuff in the game
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, great and unusual plot with an ending that your never going to guess. I would watch this one again!
B005ARYEPK|3.0|Not as good as the new one.  It lacks the color and does not explain why he is so determined to dance
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love all of the games. I haven't yet found a reason to dislike it! It's amazing, considering how critical I am.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Other than a shared world there is no real relation to it's predecessor. Despite the lackluster box office performance this movie is well worth the time.
B007L96VCY|5.0|Great memories when I hear this album. Possible my #1 favorite  from Paul, after the Beatles. The music is fresh and just happy and fun to listen to.  A true reflection of who he was,  and Happy to be with, Love of his Life, Linda and their growing  family. Give your ears a present and listen to it. Very Special!!!

B0053JJLLC|4.0|An initial disclaimer: I'm a fan of the micro world and always love stories set in it... Now, I don't see why the reviews are so bad. Yes it lacks a bit more science than usual, but I find the story to be enjoyable and not unlike some of his (Crichton's) prior works, 'Prey' for example. Perhaps readers expected more of a thriller/mystery novel, as this one is pretty straightforward. Maybe they expected Crichton to miraculously write the book from his grave... Nonetheless I enjoyed it. I loved the imagery. The writing style is different, but the story in a whole is entertaining. You must love the concept of the micro world though to fully enjoy this book. Don't expect a Crichton novel through and through, and then you won't be disappointed. MUCH better than Pirate Latitudes at least haha.
B0086700CM|5.0|If you're having trouble tilting,you have to shut the kindle off by pressing the button for a bit longer and it will ask you if it you want it to shut off press yes. It will take longer to turn on, but you can tilt after that.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|very amazing mostly.  only thing is Navigation on tablet sometimes frustrating.  if you are away and computer logs out, freezes etc, i am locked out.  A fair replacement for quick keys or repetitive keyboard stuff, as you can really get comfy and put tab wherever.  id definitly get again.  i initially gotit as a crude controller for music aps, but just brought it in to show tech guy at work so hed intal streamer, saving me a trip many a day.

B0000636NQ|5.0|If you are aware of Ten Years After then this is the album to have. This is their best album in my opinion and showcases Alvin Lee's guitar playing at its best, its peak. Woodchoppers Ball or Going Home. Unbelievable!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. So many twists and turns , I loved it! Definately a good quick read. The thing I loves most about it was that it was so unpredictable. I can most of the time predict the ending of a book and this had me so surprised.
0756407125|5.0|This is an exquisitely crafted novel.<br /><br />I'd never heard of the author but George R.R. Martin recommended him so I ordered the books on a whim. Having just finished A Dance With Dragons, I was in desperate need for more book-crack. Thanks for the good recommend, George R.R.! And thank YOU, Patrick Rothfuss! I devoured the Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear. The world Rothfuss creates is rich, detailed, and peopled with wonderful characters. However, my favorite thing about TNOTW and TWMF would have to be the beautiful language. It is at turns clever, lyrical, and heartbreakingly poignant.<br /><br />I am a voracious reader but I have not read a lot in the fantasy genre. These books inspired me to pick up Neil Gaiman so now I am plowing my way through Neverwhere and American Gods. It's wonderful. A big fat chain of wonderful books because this author recommends this author who recommends this author...<br /><br />I plan on taking off work the day The Doors of Stone comes out so I can read it in one long, uninterrupted gulp.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|A very refreshing change from the predictable boring music \\"Hip Hop\\" has become. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis just create good music. They do to Rap what The Civil Wars have done to Country/Folk.<br />On this album they run the gambit from party song to strong, hard hitting banger. I can't stop listening to it. Check out the song Same Love on the Youtube.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Interesting book w/ nice fact.  Love the section on chicken sexing.  No pun intended, but it was memorable.  Would have liked more specifics on memory techniques.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have not finished this novel as of this date, but Patricia Cornwell is my favorite author.  As usual, it draws me in to look for clues and seems to have authentic information about the world of forensic science.  Her books always seem to be well researched.  I find myself caring about the characters.  I would recommend this book to all my friends who are interested in this genre.

0345803507|4.0|Completed the love story. Best of the 3. Makes you understand why Grey is like he is. Finish out the series.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|changed out cpu in a laptop.  This was the most economical thermal paste I found.  I now have enough for the next 20 computers but that's ok!  comes with a nice little self-sealing applicator.  Shipped ahead of time.  Thanks Amazon.
159562015X|5.0|This book is awesome it has really helped me with my job.  I have recommended to all my co workers.
B002MVS18S|2.0|I was a big Saxon fan back in the day and recently I just purchased the two box sets The Carrere Years and The EMI years. It was great hearing all of the albums again with exception of this one and Destiny. This was my least favorite one,of course with Destiny coming a close second. It's not bad when you're listening to the first couple of tracks but as I went further I realized that all of the tracks kinda blend together. Also I found the production of it to be pretty flat. Honestly there is nothing that really stands out for me on this album. If you're looking for some good classic Saxon I definetly recommend picking up The Carrere Years and not to bother with this one or the EMI years all together. Well maybe except for Rock the Nations, I have always had a liking for that one for some reason.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|At first, it seemed just too simple to be very interesting, but it's actually really hard to put down, despite the fact it sometimes won't restart without closing and reopening the game.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I have two granddaughters that love Taylor Swift. They were very pleased with their cd's. They have a habit of playing them over and over.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|As my title references, a big part of this movie that really makes it stand out is the perfect balance between giving the viewer enough information to enjoy the film, but still keeping the dark plot vague until the last possible minute. This is so important because the fear and fascination that comes with the unknown is what really drives the pressure and build up to keep you on the edge of your seat and scared as hell.<br /><br />Without giving away anything that could make this movie less enjoyable, it's about a man and his family moving into a new house where the protagonist plans to write a book about the terrifying murder that happened there. But when he finds some old films of people being killed in the creepiest ways you could imagine, he unveils something more.<br /><br />They do a great job with walking you through the story at the same pace as the protagonist Ellison, played amazingly by Ethan Hawke. Seeing him slowly break down, trying to balance the yearning to leave, but the importance of writing his book in order to support his family and have fame is done great. I really love that they tell you everything you would ever want to know about the back story of this... let's just say monster, for sake of spoilers, even though it is much deeper then that.<br /><br />You may be turned off to this movie when you hear that you have to watch these families being murdered, thinking it's just mindless gore. But it's really not, it serves a purpose to the story and the creators did a fantastic job with showing you enough to understand what happens and feel the brutality, but at the same time not overdoing it. A very respectful way of going about it.<br /><br />So in conclusion I loved the story and Ethan Hawkes performance, thought it was scary, enjoyed the ending, and would recommend it to anyone that is interested.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love the spontaneity of the marriage and the undeniable connection between them. Sucked me into their reality. Wish it was longer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the diary style and the personal entries of the two main characters.  It was exciting that way waiting to find out what would happen from the next person's point of view.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Basically a collection of tenuously linked short stories arranged in a Russian Doll format that added nothing significant to the reading experience. The individual stories were good but the connections between them were tenuous at best and they could just as easily have been written one after the other. In my opinion, nothing about the nested stories added anything useful to the outer stories. If they had simply been written in series, they would have been easier to read and nothing important would have been lost.<br /><br />Having read all of the reviews, I came to this book with high expectations but left it wondering what all the fuss was about. As I said, the individual stories were quite a good read but the complex organisation added nothing and subtracted a lot. If I had a paper copy and was going to reread this book, I would probably read the stories in order but that's not all that easy to do on a Kindle.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Plot line was pretty much non-existent.  Seemed to be more about being eye-candy for women but what do I know.. I'm a man.  &#60;Yawn&#62;.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Great song selection on this live album.Beck's band is tight. Great guitar you've come to expect!! The cover of the Beatles A Day In The Life is awesome.Recommended!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show season 3 is the best yet, more action more gore and great acting the writers are setting up a compelling second half of season 3.
1575666286|5.0|Very informative.  A highly disciplined procedure for overcoming serious diseases such as cancer.  Very informative DVD's are available on Netflix about Max Gerson.
1250006341|5.0|This is a 303 page book, which is the Companion Edition to the Masterpiece Theater presentation of Downton Abbey on PBS,  is printed on quality glossy paper with ample photographs and is a must for anyone following this popular mini-series.  Authored by Jessica Fellows, with a forward by Julian Fellows, the creator and author of the series, it contains much information about the series not available anywhere else.  There are excellent photographs of the cast and the locations where the series is being filmed, with much background information regarding Highclere Castle which serves as Downton Abbey in the series.  I was delighted with this book and highly recommend it to all Downton Abbey aficionados.
B001YV506S|5.0|I recommend this movie very much. Well acted with a great script.A good family flick.Also a true story about Seabiscuit the racehorse.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Even thou most of the pieces on this cd sound allot alike I still enjoy it. She is special and when watching her videos she looks like she is enjoying what she is doing. I like up beet music and I like the violin. I look forward to more from her in the future maybe a Christmas Album.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I don't usually write reviews on here, but this book begs for it and since he's an independent author I thought I'd toss a good review his way.  THIS BOOK IS AMAZING.  Fine literature which will probably be taught in every university?  No.  Riveting?  Captivating?  Absolutely.  I haven't had my heart pound during a book in years nor had this much fun.  I practically cried out at points the tension was so high.  This book screams to be made into a fantastic movie provided they don't screw it up, IE \\"Red Planet\\" or get too artsy.
1439153663|4.0|I was truly engaged while reading The Kitchen House by Kathleen Grissom. It is a riveting story that compels the reader forward, not wanting for the book to end, but intrigued to discover the conclusion. The novel takes place during the 1800(s) in the south where slavery was considered normal and a right. There were parts of this novel that were difficult to read because of their graphic nature and because they vividly illustrated man's inhumanity. This was not a time period to be proud of, and the cruelty, heartlessness, discrimination and racism displayed made me cringe. However, the author also provided characters that represented the very best in people.<br /><br />The reader comes to love Mama Mae, a black slave that is an integral part of the kitchen house and the heart of the novel. This kindhearted woman stole the story for me. Lavinia is a white indentured servant who is raised and loved by the black women of the kitchen house and their families. However, the fact that Lavinia is white changes her relationship with her \\"family\\" once her service contract ends and she is schooled in a different way of life. Lavinia is constantly torn between what is expected of her and what she feels for the loving family that raised her.<br /><br />This is not a heartwarming story by any stretch of the imagination, although there were scenes that were touching, meaningful, and will stay with the reader. The tragedies and violence experienced are incredibly disturbing and haunting. This period of history deserved to be treated brutally and harshly. I had wished for a different ending, but the one provided was clearly more realistic.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I would have rated it with 4 1/2 stars if given the option.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Everything you'd expect from a Muse CD. But where all the other albums sound like nothing else, this one sounds like they've been listening to a lot of Meat Puppets.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Makes you happy listening to his music.  He can handle the standards, Christmas music, and rock equally well.  We listened to this several during the holidays.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|If you teach anyone how to do anything, this book is a must read for you.  I am a riding instructor and horse trainer and I found the information on how the brain learns new skills and more importantly how long it can take (as this is something my student always want to know:  how long do I have to do this before I get good at it?) to learn skills to the point of mastery was just what I needed to answer the questions I had.  It also debunked the myths of child prodigy which I found very interesting...I can be just like them!  With 10,000 hours of practice that is....and it better be proper practice as you can practice wrong and learn something wrong just as well as right.  The author does say to not be afraid of making mistakes however.  Just like the childhood game of Hot/Cold where you are looking for something and when you go in the right direction it is called &#34;hot&#34; and the wrong way is &#34;cold&#34;, sometimes you need to know what isn't right in order to know what is!  And since animals learn in a similar way to how we do, this will help with my work with the horses themselves as much as the riders on them.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great series for the sci fi fantasy lovers. The story line keeps you anticipating what will happen next! After one episode you'll be hooked :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is a challenge.  i love it!  no problems at all in the two weeks since i've downloaded this app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I fell in love with the citizens of District 12 in book one. Felt Katniss and Peeta's pain through the first Games. And felt horror as they were thrown into the nightmare that was the Quarter Quell. But by far the best part of the story, for me at least, was their struggle to free the people from the oppression of President Snow. All of the twists, betrayals, and secrets kept me hungry for more. Admittedly, it got to the point where I did almost nothing but read. This is a story that will be continually read by my children and their children.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Better than I expected. If you like Family Guy, you'll enjoy it. If Family Guy isn't your thing, skip it.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|First off-casting!  Alex Pettyfer was a great choice as John.  I'd never seen Pettyfer in anything before, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'd only seen photos of him, and feared an over wrought, pretty-boy performance.  I was happy with his portrayal, and look forward to seeing him in future films. I'm a fan of Timothy Olyphant, and only wish he'd played a bigger role. Dianna Agron was almost exactly how I'd envisioned Sarah while reading the book.<br /><br />I was not as impressed with the Mogadorians.  I found them repulsive, but not in a very interesting way.  I suppose I'm glad they weren't heavily reliant on CGI, but I thought they lacked depth.<br /><br />I was pleased to not have to sit through a pandering teen romance.  The love story was sweet and believable.  The performances were solid and not overdone.  So many teen flicks are overacted or syrupy, and this was neither.<br /><br />The movie isn't Oscar material.  It's not complex or deep in subject matter.  However, it was a fun action movie.  I will definitely read the sequel and check out the next film.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. lots of fun fast paced and mindless enough to be a background game. haven't found one I like better.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Well written book, loved the story and how it kept me interested. Can't wait for House of Hades!! Love all of these books and highly recommend Percy Jackson and the Olympians and Kane Chronicles.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|It's kind of the same thing as dungeon Hunter.it's honestly cool and I like it a lot.but I think they could have done way better.
B00A23MYCC|1.0|This movie is Not nearly as funny as it looks, don't waste your money like I did. I have a very hard time watching a grown man talk to a teddy bear, it is almost sad.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I like the ease of operation. It allows me to follow my purchases on the go. I would buy it again.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I was a little disappointed in this novel compared to the first ,but plugged through it regardless to finish the trilogy.  Something about the plot changing constantly through me off a bit and really, how much sex can a person have?  I would rate this for woman, ages 18+.  Any younger and it might be a little too much...
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Works as intended, I am no expert on sound and I started with this.  Picks up sound well seems to not pick up every little thing in the backround well enough.  Sounds good enough for my youtube videos.
B004I744AS|4.0|Free Dictionary has a good cover page that has interactive word games. There are also quotes of the day and day in history. The page can be customized. It allows you to look up definitions easily.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is the best book, you have to read it. I love the story so much I wish it was real and I was in it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you read the first and second, you absolutely need to read the third.  In my opinion, it was the best written, the best plot, and the ending is beautiful!  I actually cried, which never really happens.  I love how the author showed it from Christian's point of view.  Read this book! You won't be sorry!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not the reading type, but this book really sucked me in. I enjoyed it so much that I read the whole series. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked this series. The love triangle was a bit immature, but I liked the premise of the story. this second book was my favourite of the 3.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LOVE all of the characters!!...cant wait till the show returns next month.....I am addicted to this show and so is my family..
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I've only seen Tina Fey in a handful of SNL skits, but she is a HILARIOUS writer.  The way she tells stories and throws in little one-liners is epic.  I literally laughed so hard I cried on a few different lines.  If you need a good laugh in your life, you need to read this!! I would recommend it for women ages 20+.  Tina - your book makes my life better!!
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Of course I loved it. Dr Who is awesome! The tenth doctor is one of the best. Dvds are great!
