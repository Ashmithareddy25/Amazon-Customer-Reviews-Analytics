B00008NRI8|5.0|I love Sandra Bullock. She is one of my favorite actresses. I think she is so funny. <BR>In her newest film \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" she as is funny as ever, alongside Hugh Grant, they romp through this movie with funny jokes in almost evey secene. Grank, and Bullock have such great chemistry and are so funny together. <BR>It was writtwn by Marc Lawernce who was the scribe for Bullocks last three films \\"Forces of Nature\\", \\"Miss Congrniality\\", and \\"Two Weeks Notice\\". He also directed this film.<BR>It was solidly written, and directed. The cast gives a solid performences and the sets were great, they were all live in NYC. This is a great film and I can't wait for the DVD, which arrives on April 29th. If you havent seen it yet be sure to rent, its great!
B000002KOO|5.0|Fleetwood Mac had a handful of  genius original tunes that simply have no category: 'Oh Well', 'Rattlesanke Shake', 'Black Magic Woman', and 'Green Manalishi' will never be equaled for soulful, virtuosic originality. Two of those are on this cd, making it a must have.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have been looking forward to this album since the first time I heard Amy Lee's haunting voice on &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; on my local alternative radio station.  I went to my local cd shop early this a.m. and I'm not disappointed.  This cd has a great mix of sweeping ballads and guitar-laden rock tunes all punctuated by Amy's amazing voice.  I'm not the biggest fan of this genre of music but am always on the lookout for female artists with a haunting lyrical quality....Tori Amos, Sarah Brightman, and Fisher are a few that come to mind.  I hope this is just one of many more offerings from this band.  I highly recommend this cd.
1573225517|3.0|I decided to give this book a read after seeing the excellent John Cusack film for the second time (and shame on you if you haven't seen it!).  I wasn't sure what to expect of the novel, knowing as I did that, among other things, Cusack and director Stephen Frears had taken the liberty of relocating the story from London to Chicago.  What other things might have been messed with? <br />Not much, as it turns out.  Never in the history of book-to-film translations (with the possible exception of Fight Club) have there been fewer alterations and deviations from the novel than in the case of High Fidelity.  This is aided, of course, by the fact that the book, in trade paperback, consists of a slim 323 double-spaced pages.  The end result is that in the film, no important scenes are omitted, and hardly any characters got the axe either.  The flip side of the coin is that the book, as fiction, is a bit of a light lunch.  Like the movie, the novel is narrated by Rob, the beleaguered owner of one of those wonderful out-of-the-way (translation: customer-free) used record stores, this one being named Championship Vinyl.  After being abandoned by his pretty and smart girlfriend Laura for an aging, hawaiian-shirt- and ponytail-sporting, incense-burning New Age hipster named Ian, the perplexed Rob - who thinks in Billboard-style lists - goes on to tell us the stories behind his &quot;all-time desert island top five&quot; breakups, while in the present day desperately trying to win back his skeptical ex.  Comedy ensues. <br />This sort of story's been done before, of course, but one of the neat little twists is the tour Hornby gives us of the musical culture, where respect is earned by stumping people with encyclopedic knowledge of bands like Echo and the Bunnymen, and the undisguised contempt that the music elite, like the elites of all niche groups, express towards the everyday civilian.  The pop culture at large permeates every facet of High Fidelity - certain passages don't make much sense unless you know what Rob means when he says, for instance, that someone reminds him of a character from Reservoir Dogs.  This, of course, makes the book very much a novel of the 1990s - probably not something to be read twenty or thirty years from now - but unlike similar name-dropping books and movies, this novel is introspective about its own inseparable connection to the transitory.  And this cuts to the heart of Rob's problems, because he's let the worship of the impermanent take over his life.  &quot;Do I listen to pop music because I'm miserable,&quot; he muses, &quot;or am I miserable because I listen to pop music?&quot;  Like all mass-culture junkies, Rob mourns for the loss of old favorites while simultaneously trying to get his hands on the next big thing.  So it is with his love life. <br />Rob could easily come off as a narcissistic jerk, but Hornby neatly pulls off the trick of making us see where he's been sabotaging his relationships with women with sympathy rather than scorn.  And the mistakes Rob makes are the mistakes that many men have made, though perhaps not so hilariously.  The book is short (another way of putting it, of course, is that it never outstays its welcome) and full of suitably quotable lines.  The London setting really makes no difference to the story one way or another (though the British school system continues to confound me: for a while I was under the impression that the &quot;sixth form&quot; was akin to our sixth grade, and thus was in for a shock when Rob's youthful counterpart began indulging in heavy petting).  As a comedy, High Fidelity is excellent, though as literature it's basically junk food; but for the eight or ten hours I was reading the book, I was fully under its spell.  If we're being honest, how many other books can we say that about?  I don't want to seem like I'm damning with faint praise: good comedy is harder by far than it looks, and even rarer is a book that leavens the humor with thoughtful characterization and crisp prose.
B000002NHN|5.0|This is the only LM CD I own. I bought it without knowing anything about the singer or the songs, and it has permeated my brain. I hear the songs before I fall asleep, and then again when I wake up, and I even hear them in my head at work. I have been recommending this CD to nearly everyone I know. &quot;Marco Polo&quot; makes me wish I knew how to belly-dance.
B000067J1H|4.0|For a long time after seeing it, I found it difficult to put together a coherent opinion of FIGHT CLUB.  It so completely defied my every expectation that the collision between my preconceptions and what was actually there was catastrophic.  I could only blubber: \\"gol-dang, that there moving picture shore was sumthin'.\\"<BR> <BR>Edward Norton, who's been a favorite of mine ever since the classic AMERICAN HISTORY X, stars as the nameless \\"Narrator\\" of the film, which is based - for the most part, faithfully - on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk.  His character is an anonymous Gen-X office drone who works as a recall coordinator for a major car manufacturer.  \\"Which car manufacturer?\\" asks a woman sitting next to him on a plane.  \\"A *major* car manufacturer,\\" he reassures her.  This generic-ness is deliberate: many important characters go unnamed or misnamed, and the city most of the film takes place in is, like the city in SEVEN, completely unrecognizable.  But like the city in SEVEN, the environs play a crucial role in setting the tone - where every building in SEVEN was weathered, rain-soaked, and Gothic, Fight Club's burg is full of giant glass-and-steel towers, yuppified apartment complexes, light, and motion.  With a few plot-crucial exceptions, nothing looks more than ten years old; it's a town without a past.<br />    Norton, our hero, suffers from severe insomnia.  His job is wearing him thin and he's trying to find solace in Ikea catalogs.  (One memorable shot shows his empty apartment gradually being filled with designer furniture, complete with catalog-style photography and text descriptions.)  His doctor flippantly advises him to check out the testicular cancer survivors' support group - \\"now those are some guys with real problems.\\"  Norton goes, and in short order finds his head being clung to the overdeveloped chest of a sobbing, massively overweight survivor named Bob (played by Meat Loaf, woohoo!).  Then Norton opens up about his own, totally fraudulent, pain.  The experience proves so cathartic that the narrator's insomnia is temporarily cured.  Addicted to the experience, he begins to attend more groups (using a different name at each one)...which works fine, until he discovers Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) another voyeur like himself.  (He's clued in by her appearance at the testicular cancer group.) Knowing that there's another faker ruins it for him, and his insomnia returns with a vengeance.<br />    Then, one night on a plane, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the charismatic owner and sole employee of the Paper Street Soap Company.  Tyler, who offers trenchant criticisms of capitalism and corporate society, seems like a charming flake, until the narrator gets home to find his apartment a blasted ruin.  Needing a place to stay, he calls Tyler, and the two of them begin to form a special bond, culminating in a bloody fistfight outside a local bar.  Exhilarated by the atavistic thrill of hand-to-hand combat, the two men agree to meet each week for another bout.  Pretty soon other patrons start getting in on the action; after a month, they found Fight Club, an organization dedicated to liberating men from their day-to-day drudgery by allowing them a chance to beat the snot out of one another. <BR> <BR>As Fight Club grows, Tyler becomes more and more messianic, organizing increasingly bold raids on what he sees as the symbols of an oppressive modern existence: running magnets over the tapes at Blockbuster, blowing up computers, and stealing human fat from a liposuction clinic to make bars of soap to sell to classy department stores.  At first the newly liberated narrator follows Tyler enthusiastically, but his doubts increase as Fight Club expands exponentially, becoming a nationwide underground movement trying to undermine every aspect of society.  New inductees are stripped of their identities and given shaved heads, black muscle shirts, and jackboots.  The fascistic overtones of this revolution, and his mounting jealousy of Tyler's marathon sex bouts with Marla, pushes Norton's character further and further to the periphery of his own creation, until he decides he wants to cut Tyler back down to size. <br />FIGHT CLUB has a new and unique energy to it, galvanized by Fincher's energetic photography and the throbbing music of the Dust Brothers.  But what I really loved about this movie is the way it turns the tables on the Tyler Durdens and Gen-X whiners of this world.  While being brutally honest, and funny, about the bleak realities of corporate life, this criticism is balmy and mild compared to the savaging the movie gives to self-appointed malcontents.  Instead of liberating its members, the Fight Club simply offers a different kind of slavery, one that doesn't end with the five o'clock bell - \\"conformity in nonconformity.\\"  But this message is still delivered with wonderful, wonderful humor.  In its own way, FIGHT CLUB was the best comedy of 1999.<br />Unfortunately, I have to dock this DVD set a star because of Fox's unfathomable decision to release this stripped-down version.  The original FIGHT CLUB DVD set was a groundbreaking accomplishment that set the stage for any number of memorable, high-quality releases later on.  But not only has Fox chosen to undermine that standard, they've made the original nigh-impossible to obtain.  It's a terrible shame, and one that I hope will eventually be rectified.
B000002N2P|5.0|This is my fav album of all time. Yeah, its dark and pessimistic. No it doesn't go down like a spoonful of sugar. But, its a part of me for better or worse. I think better, but I'm biased. The beginning of the holy trinity. Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning. This album starts off (not quite literally [because of a line or two]) with the statement &quot;I must insist on being a pessimist&quot; and Warning ends with the closing lines &quot;Because I'm thinking about A brand new hope The one I've never known Cause now I know It's all that I wanted&quot;.<BR>    Pessimism to Hope. Now thats a powerful message and a powerful transistion to move through in the space of three albums. I've grown up with Green Day. These three albums are my soul. Hope you enjoy them too.
0393307050|4.0|The first clue you have that Master and Commander is not a typical sea adventure is when a sailor is hanged in the opening pages for sexually molesting the ship's goat.  This kicks off a gritty, realistic, and scrupulously-researched historical adventure that smashes C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels like a broadside from a seventy-gun frigate. <br />I first heard of Patrick O'Brian when he died three years ago and was movingly eulogized in George Will's column.  Now I don't normally read historical fiction, especially military historical fiction, but Will made such a strong case that I felt obliged to at least check O'Brian out.  I'm glad I did; Master and Commander is a well-written, powerful book that succeeds as a character study, an obsessively-researched recreation of early 19th-century life, and as an adventure.<br />The novel, the first in a twenty-book series, opens with Jack Aubrey, a young lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy, being granted his long-awaited promotion to the rank of captain (or officially, \\"master and commander\\") and the command of the Sophie, a modest little vessel in the Mediterranean.  At a concert, Jack nearly comes to blows with the haughty intellectual Dr. Stephen Maturin, but the two quickly reconcile over breakfast and Jack, whose ship is desperately undermanned, offers the penniless Maturin a post as ship's surgeon. <br />The two men eventually become best friends, despite their being a sort of seaborne Odd Couple.  Aubrey, unlike most fictional heroes, is not a silent, craggy-jawed Adonis; he's fat, red-faced, good-humored, and a bit of a buffoon, the kind of person who laughs maniacally at his own jokes.  As his second-in-command says, \\"He can be a very agreeable companion, of course, but there are times when he shows that particular beefy English insensibility.\\"  Aubrey's counterpart Stephen Maturin is a doctor, a natural philosopher whose idea of a good time is to obsessively catalog his lepidoptera...the very caricature of the effete intellectual.  As Master and Commander unfolds, though, O'Brian shows us that both men have hidden depths.  Aubrey, so clownish and naive on land, is a brilliant seaman and warrior, with an instinctual understanding of leadership and strategy.  And Maturin, treated by everyone as a harmless eccentric, is eventually shown to be a master spy, fluent in a dozen languages and a cold-blooded killer with sword and pistol.  Aubrey and Maturin are great characters, and they elevate this book to greatness with them.  Their conversations are witty and interesting, and we resent it when they're interrupted by another battle or momentary crisis. <br />That's why, though marketed as a historical adventure, Master and Commander is much more the story of these two: how they interact with one another and with the war-torn but genteel world around them.  The fighting is often incidental to the plot, dispensed with in a few sentences...though when he wants to, O'Brian can deliver a white-knuckled chase or a roaring battle as well as anyone.  His writing comes across as a sort of widescreen, modernized version of Jane Austen's formalism, combining gritty, bloody reality with arch diction and mordant wit.  O'Brian's writing in this book is certainly not without its faults - he glosses over or summarizes conversations and situations that would have been compelling had they been played out, and the book is far too episodic, moving from one incident to the next without enough direction.  Most of MASTER AND COMMANDER's flaws are unique to the book, however, and have vanished by the second and subsequent volumes.  The fact that O'Brian could polish his literary art to such a high sheen in such a short time is one more testament to the man's vast talent.<br />This book is a great introduction to a great series by a writer whose stature is only going to grow as time passes.  Do yourself a favor and pick it up now.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've been addicted to Evanescence ever since I heard their single &quot;Bring me to Life&quot;, and they also performed at Connecticut's local phenomenon, &quot;5 bands for 5 bucks&quot; concert. I was very excited to find out that this group would be having two songs on the eagerly awaited Daredevil soundtrack, and fell in love with &quot;My Immortal&quot; the second I heard it. I cry every single time I listen to it. I rushed out to purchase this CD and found it to be a very good investment. My personal favorites are &quot;Going Under&quot;, &quot;Tourniquet&quot; and &quot;Taking Over Me&quot;, though this whole CD is perfect in every way. With the deep lyrics, and amazingly powerful voice of Amy Lee, this CD is FANTASTIC and I encourage every one of you who read this to buy it.
0783225881|5.0|Some people have pointed out that in this film, Joe Jackson pitches with the opposite hand he did in real life. This character is loosely based on Joe Jackson, it is not a biography. Hollywood changes some things from time to time to in the long run make better films. This film is a classic. James Earl Jones, Kevin Costner, and Burt Lancaster are great. It is NOT a baseball movie. It is about realising your dream. It is a very well made film, and will live on as a true classic of cinema. Facts are sometimes changed to enhance a film, not because the film makers have made a mistake.
B00007LTIL|5.0|The Grateful Dead's first four albums earned them the reputation of being another jam-oriented, hippy-trippy band from San Francisco.  But their two classic albums from 1970--WORKINGMAN'S DEAD and AMERICAN BEAUTY--showcased their strong songwriting talents and their country, folk and bluegrass roots.  The album prominently features Garcia's pedal steel playing--there is not a single Garcia guitar solo to be found anywhere!--and friend David Grisman adds mandolin on &quot;Friend of the Devil&quot; and &quot;Ripple.&quot;  Songs like &quot;Sugar Magnolia,&quot; &quot;Friend of the Devil&quot; and &quot;Truckin'&quot; became permanent fixtures in their live shows.<br /><br />This HDCD remastered edition by Rhino is the same one that was included as part of the 2001 box set THE GOLDEN ROAD. As such it is packed with with nearly forty minutes of bonus material, including the single version of &quot;Truckin'&quot; (which peaked at No. 64, making it the highest charting single of their career until &quot;Touch of Grey&quot; went Top 10 in 1987), as well as five live songs from various concerts from 1970:  &quot;Friend of the Devil,&quot; &quot;Candyman,&quot; &quot;Till the Morning Comes,&quot; &quot;Attics of My Life&quot; and &quot;Truckin'.&quot; There are also two hidden tracks:  a live version of &quot;Ripple&quot; and a hilarious 60-second radio spot promoting the Dead's then new album, which encourages listeners to buy the record and &quot;make their duck a grateful duck.&quot;<br />In addition, there are some terrific photos included with the 16-page booklet along with an essay by Deadhead David Gans, who wrote last year's &quot;Conversations with the Dead: The Grateful Dead Interview Book.&quot;<br />While there are several live albums available that would give you a broader view of the Grateful Dead, this album along with WORKINGMAN'S DEAD are the finest studio albums of their storied career and belongs in any serious music fan's collection [Total running time:  79:56] ESSENTIAL56] ESSENTIAL
B000069HK2|5.0|This cd is my favorite cd of my entire collection.. which is a more than I can count.  While their first single, the taste of ink, did have a pop-punk sound, which I dislike, its an awesome song, and their other songs are immeasurable to that single.  The mix of screamo and the intense lyrics make this a must have cd for any scream/emo/punk listener.
B000009VOL|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite CD's.  ITs music ranges from mellow and soft to a slight beat that moves you.  A great purchase.
B000089RVX|5.0|I don't know where the Tori Amos type references come from.  Evanescence reminds me more of Stabbing Westward with a female lead singer.  Powerful and emotional, I hope to hear a lot more from these fine folks.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I'm really enjoying this CD.  Although many comparisons have been made by other reviewers, Interpol sounds most like Kitchens of Distinction to me.  Loved that band, and miss them, so this was a great find for me.  If you liked Kitchens, go get this CD!
B000089RVX|5.0|Where did these guys come from?  They're awesome!!  Every song on this CD is great.  I have listened to it over and over and there isn't a single song that i've gotten bored with.  Everyone should give this CD a try.  It's so different than anything else that's out there that I think everyone will find something to like about it.
0312305060|2.0|This book is totally contrived and I cannot BELIEVE it won the Pulitzer. What a bunch of drivel.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is the BEST that I have heard in a very long time.  The mix of hard rock/metal with alternative, and Amy Lee's beautifully unique voice seems to create a new genre of music.  The melodies are all completely different, and each song would be a great single...every song on this album is a hit.  Don't be surprised if these guys make a sweep at the Grammy's next year!  Bottom line, buy this album.  It has something for everyone.  It's flat-out addicting.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|I wouldn't recommed this film to my friends because they don't have a very wide span of interests but I do think this is a good movie for a parent or adult. I liked this film because it had a lot of truth about their relationships and their image.  Jamal(Rob Brown)is a good student in tests but just passes in class. The famous writter William Forrester(Sean Connery)is a goraphobic and doesn't leave his house. Jamal is dared to go into his house and that is how they become friends. I think this is a good story about friendship and showing how friends and family can have a great impact on your life. I think that they did a wonderful job on casting and the new comer (Rob Brown)Jamal was a good choice.
B000002OX3|3.0|If you like the Who's later work-- the guitar-smashing stuff-- you probably won't like this album.  That said, A Quick One is my all-time favorite Who record.  The songs are weird and funny and a blast to sing along with.  Even though, as others have mentioned, the songs were written by various members of the band, the album has a distinct flavor of its own.  <br />Unfortunately, when the record folks put together the CD, they BUTCHERED the album. The original recording of 'Happy Jack' was not included at all (!!), and a whole bunch of irrelevant tracks were thrown in which completely shattered the mood and sound of the original album.  They did pitch in an acoustic version of 'Happy Jack' as if to make up for dropping the original track, but the extras should have been saved for a separate CD.  It is jarring to hear the Who singing the Batman theme on the same CD with 'Whiskey Man.'<br />I love this album and you should hear it and love it too-- so crank up your record player and go find the LP.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I got this cd about a month ago after hearing them on rock line... it has been in my cd player ever since. I love this cd! This is one of those cds where you can actually listen to the lyrics and know what they are singing about, it's not just singing about heartbreak after heartbreak. This is one of those cds that I can listen to all the way through without skipping any tracks. I think by far this is Incubus's best cd so far, I really do hope they keep experimenting though (after all, isn't that what music is about?). This is a band that definately has talent! I highly recommend this cd.
0395645662|5.0|The first time I read THE GIVER in 1994, I was absolutely mesmerized.  What a compelling idea--a story similar to 1984, only with a darling twelve year old boy (Jonas) who is selected to receive all the memories of his community. What on earth does this mean?  Evidently this story takes place in the future where everything is the same.  People are all drugged so that they have no emotions.  They no longer see a world in color; people who are old or sick are terminated.  Only one baby is allowed to survive from a multiple birth. Only certain women are allowed to give birth; the baby is given to a selected man and woman to raise.  When the child reaches maturity, the 'parents' are sent to live with other childless couples.  There is no love, no pain, not even grandparents.  The elders make all decisions.  People don't even select their careers. <BR>At the age of twelve, Jonah is chosen to receive all the memories of preceding centuries from the grandfatherly 'giver of memories.'   <br />Anyone reading this book will know immediately why Lois Lowery received the Newbery award, which is given to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children. The first review I ever read for this book was in the newspaper.  The article stated that THE GIVER would become a classic and suggested that readers immediately buy first editions (for an investment).  After reading my copy, I bought books for both of my teenagers for Christmas.  I loved the book and I really loved the fairytale ending.  But then, not too long ago, I started reading some of the reviews on Amazon.  People were complaining about the sad ending!  What did I miss?  When I read an outstanding book, I have a tendency to read way too fast.  I can't help it; the better the book, the faster I read.  I just can't wait to see what happens next!  Consequently, I miss a lot. But, if the book is really outstanding, I'll eventually re-read it, savoring every word.  Subsequently, I slowly read THE GIVER again, and now, I'm really not certain about the ending.  Did Jonas live happily ever after or was he 'released?'  Readers will have to make their own decisions.  As for me, I'm going to retain my original, warm fuzzy, happy conclusion and forget I ever read a review!
B000024D4R|5.0|. . . but everyone I know finds this or Meddle or The Wall as the Floyd's best.  I don't think it's overrated.<br />&quot;Dogs&quot; is the best song ever written, and Pink Floyd is the greatest band of all time.  <br />&quot;Pigs&quot; is catchy and politically stinging.  What else would you expect from Roger Waters, the #1 name in political lyrics? <br />The &quot;Pigs On The Wing&quot; intro is excellent.  A great precursor to dogs, but I'd rathered they put the second half in front.  It doesn't sound right right after &quot;Sheep&quot;'s climactic uber-riff.<br />In which case, put on your headphones, kids, and listen to the bouncing dark bassline of Sheep.  This album (and the next two Floyd albums after) are very much Roger's baby, but the bassline makes the song, and then at eight minutes, I feel like my older relatives, who saw Floyd live many times, and it IS STADIUM ROCK.  Sheep is GODLIKE because it is the epitome of playing in-fronta 60,000 people, and that makes Dogs TITANLIKE (the Titans were above the gods in Greek mythology :) ) because of its ULTRA-intense climax.<br />I got way too into that.  Time to go to bed.<br />Buy it for all of the work.  Easily the best Floyd album.  The cover is wonderful too.  Ha ha.  <br />Dogs is amazing.  It'll take too long to download, you'll have the CD at your house before it finishes.  Even with DSL.<br />Buy it for Dogs and the other four tracks are just beneath it, in the POWER that IS Pink Floyd.<br />Yes, I really did get way too into that...
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence's major-label debut &quot;Fallen&quot; is one of the most beautiful rock albums I have ever heard. Vocalist Amy Lee has the kind of voice you only read about in tales of angels; her voice sent shivers up and down my spine when I first heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; on the Daredevil OST. On the strength of that song alone, I bought &quot;Fallen&quot; and it hasn't left my car CD player since. The dark, brooding guitar riffs and haunting choruses harmonize beautifully with Lee's intense lyrics. Evanescence scores a perfect 5 stars with &quot;Fallen.&quot;
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Tatu should be extremely proud of their debut offering - the only way is up for these two.<br />The musical arrangements and production on this album are truly a breath of fresh air through the stale fug of &quot;R&amp;B&quot;, tired old rap, cheesey trance and the ubiquitous and empty sound of two-step.<br />They also give a kick in the pants to some of the rock/metal bands - so no-one is safe!<br />The voices are pleasing when not forced to the tops of the girl's developing ranges, where they tend to sound a little chipmonky - probably due to transposition software - and they both appear able to carry melodies. I assume that they actually wrote some of them, although it's absolutely evident that the musical arrangements and production are done by experts - very well indeed, it has to be said. The collection of music on this album is very varied - it may be a tired phrase, but it really does have something for everyone. I mean - a cover of The Smiths!<br />The outstanding moments are Trevor Horn's masterful reworking of &quot;All The Things She Said&quot;, which spent many weeks at the top of the UK charts - a notable achievement these days.<br />None of how the music came about matters - and hasn't mattered since the Mowtown/Spector days of putting attractive girls with pleasant voices into recording studios to sell records. The girls have plenty of latent talent - and a potential for a spellbinding stage presence, if the numerous videos are anything to go by. It is a mistake to dis them as having &quot;no talent&quot;, even if it is obvious that they did not do all of the musical work. It would be very interesting to find out how much they did write. <br />Whether they have longevity is uncertain - the marketing gimmick they have will only last so long, then a fickle music-buying public may well simply drop them, as they did the Spice Girls, etc. The sense of dark humour and irony that runs through the whole album is a streak they should keep a hold of - and never take themselves too seriously.<br />This album shows so much promise in the girls, and is a work of art in itself that goes way beyond the catchy pop hooks and studio &quot;magic dust&quot;.<br />The marketing people behind them are absolute geniuses!<br />Buy it - it's fantastic!
B00006RCNJ|5.0|This is the best video Andre Rieu.  I would also recomend La Vie Est Belle.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Put aside whatever feelings you had for the film. This soundtrack is a triumph in and of itself. Whether you adore or abhor Lord of the Rings, if you enjoy rich, sublime music, this is a must-have. Admittedly, as a fan of Lord of the Rings, you will enjoy the soundtrack moreso than others. But don't let that stop you if you're not a fan. <br />All the tracks are good to excellent. Stand-outs being, in my opinion, the utterly angelic theme Aniron (found in the Council of Elrond) and Lothlorien, the rich and powerful Bridge of Khaszad Dum, and The Breaking of the Fellowship. My favorite on the soundtrack has changed about 12 or 13 times, but I think I'm finally settled on Track 10 - The Council of Elrond (especially 0:37-2:11~ Aniron). If you have The Two Towers soundtrack you can listen to the two in conjunction with another and hear the various themes evolve and develop (as the plotline does so) for added pleasure.<br />This is simply an outstanding CD. Don't hesitate to buy it.
B00005QIPH|3.0|A pretty good CD. Simple, catchy tunes. The songs are short and repetive. Good for a few listens and the Strokes are defintely worth seeing live. The comparisons to Velvet Underground are definitely deserved since they have a real retro sound. <br />The &quot;saviors&quot; of rock ? Hardly.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I havent PURCHASED the DVD yet, but I will say that I saw this verision METROPOLIS in a special screening this past summer at a theater and it was so moving that at times, I had wipe away some tears. The story, the composition, and the music. I am so thankful that a team of geniuses painstakingly reassembled this movie - which was a joke for years - into a beautiful masterpiece.<br />I am going to buy it right now.
0451167716|5.0|All should read this book.  There are so many references in our society today to this book that those that do not read it will feel left out.  While many have seen the movie I much prefer the book.  I pull the novel off the shelf every few years to read it again, and every time it is just as exciting, suspenseful and unforgettable as before! Quite possibly the best book ever written!
B000089RVX|5.0|I've been a big fan of Evanescence for about a year now. After a friend played their previous release, Origin (on Big-wig records), I was in love. The two main players, Amy Lee and Ben Moody, met at a church camp while she was messing around on the chapel's piano. In an interview, Ben said how blown away he was by her playing. If you've heard 'My Immortal' (Daredevil: Soundtrack) you know exactly what he's talking about. I was unable to get 'Origin' but I was stoked to see 'Whisper', which originally released on 'Origin', on 'Fallen'. 'Whisper' is an unbelievably awesome riff-driven headbanger. I guarantee you'll be hearing Amy's haunting vocals going 'Don't turn away, don't give in to the pain, don't try to hide, though they're screaming your name, don't close your eyes, God knows what lies behind them, don't turn out the lights, never sleep never die'. If you have 'Daredevil' and are afraid that this just some nothing band that got a few lucky tracks, fear not, you're wrong. If you love 'My Immortal' and 'Bring me to life' you'll be glad to know that the whole CD is that good. The mixture of Moody's deep, driving guitar mixed with Amy's classically trained vocals and thin piano make a creepy sound that no can resist, even my Mom likes this stuff. Though it seems oxymoronic that a band that is often mistaken for goth-rock is made up of Christians (add onto this that they're from Arkansas) the Christian messages work really well with this music. And don't think this rock's answer to P.O.D., trust me, the entire Satellite album (including the insane Crystal Method remix of 'Boom') is matched in three of Evanescences songs. If I had to compare this CD to something, which is diffacult given how rare it is to find these guitar-works without some [one] screaming over them, I'd compare it to Thomas Harris' book 'Hannibal'. Beautifully haunting and somehow finding a balance between the elegant and the brutal. My one disapointment is that 'Fields of innocence', another songfrom 'Origin', wasn't on here. Buy this CD, even if you don't like Christian music. It's like Charlotte Church singing Marylin Manson and the pay-off is incredible.
B0000047CW|5.0|This is an amazing jazz album. You got Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz together, making the first bossa nova jazz record in the U.S. It got a Grammy, it made thousands of listeners transport themselves to a calm South American beach. To top it off, the lead drummer, Buddy Deppenschmidt, is my own drum teacher. How boss is that?<br />Awesome jazz with a twist. All instrumental. My greatest discovery out of Brazil since Sepultura.<br />Pop it in and chill...
B000065MTC|2.0|Okay, call me a muggle, but this DVD just ain't my cup of tea. I suppose I'm used to normal, comprehensible DVDs where if I want to see deleted scenes, I can get them without even thinking. As for this thing? Heavens! My brain practically blew up trying to find the darn things! Okay, so I have to buy a magic wand, enroll in potions class, mix the right potions, select the right bat...AUGH! IF I WANTED A COMPUTER GAME I'D HAVE BOUGHT ONE! Frankly, the deleted scenes weren't even worth looking for anyway.<BR>On to disc one, the movie (which is okay) looks exactly as you'd expect it to look: pristine. The bright, widescreen (2.35:1) image makes even that awful Quidditch match look watchable.<BR>Among the easy to find extras are trailers and interviews.
B000089RVX|5.0|Well this is one group i was glad to have ever heard.  There hasn't been a band with the main vocals being from a female singer that i've really enjoyed, but Amy Lee has an incredible voice.  I'm not sure what type of music this is classified as, but it has a rock-ish sound, pretty unique.  ...check out their hit single, Bring Me To Life, if you like that you should like the rest of the CD.  Check it out!
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is, as Entertainment Weekly states on the back of the box, \\"The Sistine Chapel of Sitcoms.\\" John Cleese is a master of comic timing, acting, and (with Connie Booth) writing. The gags come faster and furiouser as the episode goes along, and the performances are spot on. These twelve episodes are some of the funniest things ever to be on TV. And for my money, \\"The Germans\\" is the best episode, followed by \\"Basil the Rat,\\" \\"Builders,\\" and \\"Psychiatrist.\\"<BR>The DVD looks about as good as any of the old videos. While being reasonably clear, the colours all look a little bland and sometimes bleed. Pixelation is visible occasionally. The special features are the main asset of this DVD. The crown jewel of the extras are the interviews with John Cleese, Prunella Scales, and Andrew Sachs, which are all insightful and funny. There is a good documentary about the man \\"Fawlty Towers\\" was based on, some slightly short biographies, outtakes, and several featurettes which are essentially selected scenes from the show edited together. The least interesting extras are the audio commentaries, which are very, very slow and uninformative.
B000089RVX|5.0|How can you resist a group that's on the same label as groups like 12 Stones, Finger Eleven, Seether, Drowning Pool, Creed, etc.  Wind-Up Records always seems to have great bands.
B00005JKDR|4.0|DONT BE FOOLED! this movie is a powerful stirring film people say,&quot;This is a kids movie!&quot; but it is not, it is for both kids and adults the humor will make an adult laugh and the cute slapstick will make any child laugh! Its a great movie I am 17! 17! And,I almost cried where *Spoiler* they shred boo's door :( but it gets happy though! so don't worry be happy...BUY THIS FILM! For your kids. and even if you dont got em' yu'll love it!<br />Even if your a grownup. :)
B000050IE6|5.0|As I come for a Metal background in music, but have many other tastes, this album can captivate any listener for it contains far too many styles.  This album as other Opeth albums are is a true masterpiece, as only that word can describe.  <br />The low vocals might take a few minutes to get use to, but you'll understand why they are used, and the clean vocals are the best you can get, spine shivering.  <br />Words can not describe this album do to its amazing diversity, just listen and open you mind to other music besides the top 50, there is a lot more to be heard.  <br />As a note if you ever get a chance to see them live you must, an amazing band in all cases.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I purchused this CD few weeks ago, and I have enjoyed listening to it so much. The lyrics vary from very,very funny, to sad and touching. The beats of a majority of the songs are great to listen and dance to, not matter what type of music fan you are. Plus, music from epidsodes other than, &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot; are included. Such as, the should-have-swept-the-Emmy-awards-episode &quot;Hush&quot; and soft melodies from Season Fives dramatic moments.
B00005A0N5|5.0|Not much to be said here except buy it!  I can honestly say there is not one person that I have played this for that hasn't liked it in someway.  Nightwish falls in the category of Opeth (Must Buy also), there both Masterpieces.
B0000009S3|5.0|I recently purchased this CD as my primer to Zappa, feeling that (at long last) I ought to give a listen to his material. So happy to have made the introduction! I am absolutely floored by the complexity, artistry, and beauty of this album. I just wasn't expecting such breathtaking composition and musicianship. If 'Peaches en Regalia' and 'The Gumbo Variations' were the only two songs on the disc I'd still call it amazing and more worthwhile than half of the others in my collection. I realize that more 'serious' jazz/fusion musicians had/have been doing this sort of thing for ages (and maybe better), but that level of material has always seemed too dense for an uninitiated listener (like me). Even for someone, such as myself, with a bent (admittedly) toward less 'challenging', more pop-oriented sounds, this album is immediately approachable. What a gem!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Although as a whole it pales in comparison with OK Computer and Kid A, Amnesiac features a few outstanding tracks: &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot; are arguably some of Radiohead's best stuff; &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; is wonderful, as is &quot;Packt Like Sardines...&quot; Some other songs are charming but ultimately wanting. This is not Radiohead's magnum opus, but it is certainly a necessity to own.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I once read somewhere that Stephen King said every time he watches this movie, he gets [ticked] off at River Phoenix for dying so young and tragically. It is easy to understand why. Phoenix's outstanding performance sparkles in this movie and reminds us what a talent the world lost. In addition, the brilliant performances by the rest of the lead actors (Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland) make this movie a must-see for any person, especially teenagers. It is a glorious story that will make you laugh, cry, and sit back and remember what it was like to be young and determined to make your place in the world. One of the best movies ever made! Rob Reiner and Stephen King and all the actors have given us a wonderful gift.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Bought this about three months ago. I have to say im still listening to it to this day. At work and at home, its just great music to listen to while you are doing anything!<br />All the songs are the bluesy-rock that really are great! I would give it five stars if it was a little longer. I really enjoy when an artist can fill a cd with 74 minutes of great tunes.<br />You know the hit songs of this cd. But the none released songs are also really original.
B000089RVX|5.0|Every song is catchy; the lead singer's voice is angelic; and the band can rock out when it has to.  After hearing their first hit &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; I HAD to hear what else they did; and it didn't disappoint.  Get this album now, you won't regret it!
0060926317|1.0|I started reading this book at the suggestion of a friend and very quickly felt that something was wrong. Although I have never read any other books about Australian aborigines I had a gut feeling that much of this was made up. I did a quick search on [the internet] under the author's name and came up with a critique by an Australian anthropologist which should be read in its entirety.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I love metal and I love horror movies so this movie really appealed to me. The soundtrack to this movie is awesome and plays throughout a large portion of this movie. The gore isnt heavy but i expect more from a movie based on a Resident Evil game. Im not a messed up person but the gore was one of the things that made the game so different. I had to subtract a star for the acting quality though. Rodriguez can do better, I know she can because of her acting in the Fast and the Furious.Still, this movie is good fun for a few times through.<BR>Movie Rating-8/10
1573229725|5.0|Wow!  What a fantastic book!  I don't usually like \\"Victorian Murder Mysteries\\" (my Mom tends to pass them along to me) and I'm not really sure why I decided to start reading Fingersmith (given to me by a friend).  I guess it was sitting on my nightstand when I needed a new book.  However, Fingersmith is NOT a Victorian murder mystery, though there is a murder late in the book.  In fact, it's a really difficult book to classify.  It's set in Victorian England, but it's not anything you'd expect it to be.  It's a crime novel/love story if anything.<br /> In the beginning of the book we meet a \\"family\\" of thieves.  A friend of the \\"family\\" (\\"Gentleman\\" or Richard, depending on who is talking about him) concocts a scheme to bilk an heiress (Maude) out of her fortune (which she receives upon her marriage) and one of the main characters, Susan, goes to the country to serve as  Maude's lady's maid in order to accomplish this goal.  The plan is for Maude  to fall in love with \\"Gentleman\\", he will marry her, then he will have her committed to a madhouse and take her money.  Susan, of course, will get a cut for her role in the scheme.  It all seems pretty straight forward (as long as it works), but the plot twists and turns like a roller coaster (including the upside down multiple loops!).  I don't want to give ANY of the twists away, so it's hard to get more detailed or to go further into the story.<br />The book is divided into three parts.  The first part is from Susan's point of view through the commitment (so the scheme does work - or seems to).  The second part is from Maude's point of view through the commitment.  The final part is the story of what happens to both Susan and Maude from that point forward.<br />To sum it up, while I don't feel like I can go into a lot of detail without giving too much away, I stayed up far to late reading this book for several nights.  I've recommended it to both the book clubs I belong to.  I'm planning to purchase and read Sarah Waters' first two novels after reading this one.  I think it's a great book.
0451191153|5.0|This book is Ayn Rand's gift to the world, and to any person, young or old, who strives to live an individual and independent life free of the societal forces that want to crush the bold and spirited energy of the creative mind. This is the book that has changed so many lives, and it does so because it provides a vision of an uncorrupted life: a life based on love of living, and the joy in experiencing one's ability in the face of the corruption and conformity that are so much a part of modern life.<br />I first read this book when I was in Vietnam, and it was love at first sight. It gave words to all the adolescent dreams I aspired to, but had no ability to explain. More than anything, this is a book of liberation, a guide to living in a, many times, confusing and hard to understand world. Here, one gets a vision of the unfettered individual spirit soaring through life, so in love with his work and his vision of what he wants to create, that he is blind to the world of The Banner, the New York newspaper that caters to the lowest common denominator: the gossip; sexual fears and guilts of Mr. and Mrs. Jones; and the hatred of the free and the noble found amongst those whose lives have tumbled into oblivion.<br />If you are a timid conformist, worried about the crowd and what others may think about your behavior, this is not the book for you.<br />But if you are fresh of mind, curious about life, interested in going beyond the stagnant views of everyday life, then \\"The Fountainhead,\\" is your book. It was written with you in mind, and probably is everything you are seeking for your journey here on earth.
B000003N89|4.0|&quot;All for You&quot; is the album Diana Krall came to prominence with in 1996. It scored a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album and although it lost out to Cassandra Wilson's gem &quot;New Moon Daughter&quot;, remains one of the best releases of the talented Canadian singer/pianist.<br />Krall's piano skills shine here as on none of her other albums. She has a reputation of hitting fewer notes with great effect, but on this tribute album to the great Nat King Cole her pianism reached heights close to virtuosity.<br />Both on uptempo songs and ballads her style emits joy and intensity and, unlike with her later release &quot;Love Scenes&quot;, the listener is not falling asleep at the end.<br />This is Krall pianist at her best and singer almost there as well.
B000089RVX|2.0|Granted, very few people have heard Evanescence's previous album called \\"Origin.\\" If they had, there would be very little reason to purchase this new album \\"Fallen.\\" At least 4 tracks have been re-used from their former album, and all four have been \\"improved.\\" The problem is that there was nothing really to improve. The tracks sounded perfectly good before, and with the addition of some violins here, some additional lyrics there, and a few other extras, they have been kind of watered down. <br />That being said, there are SOME good tracks on this album. \\"Going Under\\" is interesting, and Amy Lee continues her string of excellent piano ballads with \\"Hello.\\" <br />...<br />However, this album will undoubtedly sell well. With a hit single like \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" it would be a little hard not to. ....<br />Anyway, I can't really say I recommend this album. I thought that Origin was so much better, and this one doesn't really stand on it's own without the additional tracks.
B000089RVX|5.0|i have been anticipating the CD for a while. i have many MP3s of the band.  this band rules.  buy this cd
B0000640VO|5.0|Yes! The french invented the cinema. Yes! Godard was right(\\" I pity the French Cinema because it has no money. I pity the American Cineam because it has no ideas\\"). I don't want to repeat the storyline of the film because the the other reviewers already did it for me. But I will tell you that , indeed, the new millennium in World Cinema started with this movie: Amelie. For those of you who have not seen this movie, run fast and get it. By all means, watch it, even if you have to risk your life for it!! Don't miss it !But not just once, watch it as many times as you can, and then you will see what I am talking about. Thank God for Jean Pierre Jeunet!!!Jean Pierre Jeunet thank you because you exist!!
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard of this band about a month and a half ago while previewing some tracks for the upcoming Daredevil film. The Evanescence single \\"Bring Me To Life\\" as well as their other song on the album, \\"My Immortal\\" really stood out from the rest of the soundtrack. After that, I happened upon a demo copy of this album, and then the final version. It is simply amazing. Amy Lee has immense singing talent as demonstrated through the entire album. She doesn't sing \\"flat\\" or in the same range as a lot of other female singers do. (Or fake it and just scream the whole time.) The band can go from hardcore (Tourniquet) to soft (My Immortal) and it all works great.<br />This is an album you won't get tired of. If you like alternative, hardcore, or even a little goth rock, this album is for you.<br />Just a side note, I've heard a lot of people compare them to Linkin Park, but I don't see the connection at all. Sounds nothing like them.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd=the greatest conceptual band of all time.<BR>Dark Side Of The Moon=The most wonderful journy in music ever written.<BR>What more is there to say? Go buy this album now.<BR>(also get Wish You Were Here, Animals, Meddle, and The Wall. They are all brilliant.)
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is worth your money. I have heard Evanescence for a couple years now on the local radio station here in Little Rock, so it was a no-brainer to purchase the cd. The familar track of &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is a sure standout, but every song on the cd rocks. I would expect several singles to make the radio. The songs are filled with Amy's amazing vocals along with creative beats and turns that keep each song fresh.
0807281956|5.0|Of all the books that I have read, not one has caught my attention as much as this book has.  This highly entertaining, and extremely vivid book kept me up all night until the very end.  This book teaches several lessons to the children it is aimed at.  It is a story of an orphan whose life magically changes.  Harry Potter learns that he is actually a magical wizard with many powers, which he is unaware of.  At first his horrible uncle tries to stop Harry from attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft.  With the help of an unwelcomed visitor, Harry is swept off his feet and taken to this magical school.  He then meet up with two of his fellow classmates, who he shares most of his adventures with.  From school bullies, to saving the school from extreme disaster, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone shows that children can make a difference in this world.  This book also teaches children lifelong lessons they could not find in any ordinary children's book.  This book contains the \\"intellectual backbone\\" which most books lack.  Kudos goes out to Rowling in creating this book.  He has really captured the essence of what a children's books should be.  I consider myself a very selective reader, and if this book caught my attention as much as it did, I can only imagine what it did for avid readers.  I encourage any person, young or old, to read this book.  It would be time very well spent.
B000089RVX|4.0|This Album is awesome!  A Linkin Park feel to the music bundled with a voice comperable to Tori Amos.  A great combination and A great album to just crank up and jam in your headphones.  I expect good things to come for this group with a unique sound like this.
B000089RVX|4.0|I just picked this gem up today and have been letting it soak in for the past few hours. I can honestly say that it was money well spent. After hearing some of their music in one of the Daredevil trailers, I immediately wanted to pick up the soundtrack JUST to get the two Evanescence tracks. I quickly thought better of that and decided to wait a few weeks until their album was released. Fallen has definitely lived up to my expectations. It's rare nowadays to find a band that can rock and still be confident enough to allow orchestral pieces to play prominent roles in some of their songs. Groups like Nightwish and Moonspell come to mind. (Also great bands) The temptation to stumble into the Durst-centric rap-rock stable in order to generate some buzz and a quick buck has thankfully been sidestepped with Evanescence. Lush,passionate,and commanding vocals by lead singer Amy Lee resonate undiminished track after track. The musicianship of this band is to be applauded. To my knowledge, this is their first big commercial release. A now out of print EP was available a couple of years ago-and I'm frantically trying to track down a copy. I wish these kids all the best.
B000003N7G|5.0|This is my favorite jazz album ever. Granted, until recently I was only a casual jazz fan who didn't actually listen to much of it. Lately however I have been exploring many definitive jazz works -- I have loved all of them, but _A Love Supreme_ stands above even the other deserving classics. If any jazz album is worthy of a Divine Power, it's this one for sure. Few albums are so engrossing -- be it mentally, spiritually, or emotionally. _A Love Supreme_ is a celebration of a relationship with a higher being, but it is also about inner emotional states and life challenges so even atheists and agnostics can have a deep spiritual experience. John Coltrane pours an ineffable beauty through his sax, and even when the key-centeredness vaporizes with his aggressive tenor epiphany, it remains elated and radiant. The final movement, &quot;Psalm&quot;, is a meditative, stately thematic climb where Coltrane sings to the heavens in a composite language of jazz and prayer. Blessed is Coltrane to be accompanied by such an empathetic group of musicians. They feel the love too. Elvin Jones is an exact, splashing thunder. His drum solo on Part 3 sounds like a temple rising from the earth to focus the forthcoming praises of Part 4, &quot;Psalm&quot;. Tyner McCoy's piano is a thing of complex beauty and grace. Jimmy Garrison's heavily melodic, intimate bass is an earthy fixture to enable the heights for which Coltrane aspires. The consummation of their intense interplay and support for Coltrane's praise to God makes for one of the best musical experiences ever. I've only had this for a short time but I find the spiritual power of this CD viscerally electric. You really should own this if you don't already.
B00006SFLV|3.0|Enough people have talked about what a great show this is.  So I won't.<br />What I do want to know is why this set of 19 episodes is significantly more expensive than similar sets (Felicity, Buffy) yet offers very poor quality audio and video and zero bonus features?<br />The show: Five stars.<BR>The DVD quality: Zero stars.
0316096199|4.0|Im a seventeen year-old student from Boston, Massachusetts and I read Lucky by Alice Sebold as part of an assignment. Alice is a college freshman and the main character of this book. The first chapter describes how Alice gets raped in the entrance of an amphitheater. The author is very graphic and detailed and eventually she uses that narration form throughout the book. The story itself tells us how Alice had to deal with societys lack of comprehension towards her rape and how her life changed after such a horrible experience. A sense of irony is added to the book when people constantly remind Alice how lucky she was that she survived the rape. I recommend this book; I found Alice Sebolds memories to be very courageous, strong and realistic. You definitely will end up admiring the author of this literary piece.
B000001Y5J|5.0|If you don't enjoy loud, brash, industrial rock, then don't buy this album. Much stronger, much angrier, much better than Pretty Hate Machine or The Downward Spiral! Despite being an EP, this is by far the best NIN album.<br />Angry, physical, and enough rage to keep your head banging all night long, this infectuous album will stay in your CD player for weeks on end. Pinion is one of the best intros and you can feed off the energy from Wish. Listen to this album, and when you recover from the blow, play it again!
B00006J3WH|5.0|The episode &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot; was one of the best hours in television history, and now we have it CD. Listening to the soundtrack is just as exciting as it was watching the show. Joss Whedon proves again he is one of the most hardworking, and creative writers today as he penned all the songs, music, and lyrics himself. From the opening number &quot;Going Through The Motions&quot; to the finale &quot;Where Do We Go From Here&quot; the soundtrack is full of funny, dramatic, and beautiful songs. While Sarah Michelle Gellar won't be heading to Broadway anytime soon, she is certainly capable enough to carry a tune. Emma Caulfield(Anya) has one of the best voices and is hilarious when she rocks out about Bunnies, and her duet with Nicholas Brendan(Xander) is very sweet and charming. If there is one performance that standsout it's Amber Benson(Tara). She has a gorgeous voice. Joss penned an incredible song for Her, &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; and she sings it beautifully. James Marsters(Spike) rocks out on &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; and not only looks like Billy Idol, but sings like him. There are quite a few hilarious excerpts, most notably &quot;The Mustard&quot; and &quot;Parking Ticket&quot;. The opening is more about making us laugh but slowly we get to the dramatic ending, and the most heartbreaking song is the reprise of Under Your Spell and Standing sung by Anthony Stewart Head(Giles) and Amber Benson, and Buffys &quot;Something to Sing About&quot; where Buffy confesses she wished she was never brought back. This soundtrack will make you laugh, dance, cry, and a whole lot more. A must have for all Buffy fans, and a great way to remember one of the best hours on television ever.
B000002UDB|5.0|I got into this album about a year ago, and it simply changed my whole perception of life.  These songs are all classics, and I would take each by itself over complete albums by other bands.  It is a musically diverse album that is psychedelic not only as a musical genre, but literally (mind-expanding).  Here is the breakdown of the tracks:<BR>1.  Magical Mystery Tour - The title track, remarkable in its bridge with an interesting chord progression with piano and horns, it is your introduction to the album.<br />2.  Fool on the Hill - A ballad about a misunderstood intellectual, with a great flute part and deep lyrics.<br />3.  Flying - Dismissed by many as a &quot;throwaway,&quot; it is certainly not the album's highlight, but it is a catchy instrumental and was quite complex for its time.<br />4.  Blue Jay Way - the most underrated song on the album.  This is a classic psychedelic song.  George put a phase shifter across the whole recording, making it really spacey cool.  The way the organ drones and the repetive progression, and the great cello accompaniment...this is one of my all time favorite Beatle songs.<br />5.  Your Mother Should Know - archetypical Paul tune.  This is one of the less psychedelic songs on the CD, but also is catchy.  This is another song where I like the bridge a lot, but you can get impatient because the next song is<br />6.  I Am the Walrus - The background here is John found out everyone was analyzing the Beatles' lyrics, and decided to give them something utterly bizarre.  The stream-of-consciousness song was written.  This song is full of layers, from electric pianos to strings to bizarre chanting choruses...the song terminates with a clip from a radio broadcast of King Lear.  A great song.<br />7.  Hello Goodbye - Constructed quite well lyrically; the song is a discourse of one person on the other's disagreeableness.<br />8.  Strawberry Fields - What hasn't been said about Strawberry Fields?  This song is pure art made by the Fab Four and brilliant technique on the part of Sir George Martin.  <BR>9.  Penny Lane - Paul's response to Strawberry Fields, this is a song of nostalgia.  It's another classic.<br />10.  Baby You're a Rich Man - Pretty good song, not up to the standard of the rest of the songs, but it would be the best on most other bands' albums.  This is a song John wrote about the Maharishi, and sort of about enjoying all that you have.<br />11.  All You Need is Love - A good conclusion to a stupendous album.  <br />Anyone who has heard of the Beatles has probably heard about half of these songs already, get this cd to continue your journey into the music of the Beatles!
B000069HK2|5.0|I first heard the Used back during the summer on late night MTV (the best time to see some new bands) and they were playing a song called \\"A Box Full of Sharp Obhects\\" I took a listen to these guys and heard beauty. I know my music, and The Used are one of the best bands I have heard in a long time. A perfect blend of punk and screaming, which is what we need out there in the world. If people say these guys suck, or are too mainstream, they have never seen the Used live. I have seen them twice so far and they give it all. If you like The Used, please buy the new Finch record, my hometown heros from the place where all alternative dwells, San Diego California. BUY THE USED NOW, and GO BUY FINCH TOO. You will not regret anything.
B00005JL5S|5.0|Terrific! I saw this movie 2 times and I really think is a GREAT movie... you have a lot of fun but also some dramatic moment... well, drama is in Stephen's way, so you can imagine... To really appreciate this movie you have to watch it in chinese; anyway, you can't watch a Stephen Chow's film in any other language or you will miss the best! The movie is also filled with cool special effects... totally worth the money!<br />And no wonder that for this movie Stephen won for Best Director, Best Actor and Outstanding Young Director at the 21st Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. <br />Stephen Chow is so hot!
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence will keep on top of the charts for a while it seems. Personally after listening to their &quot;promotional&quot; songs in the soundtrack for Daredevil the movie, I was looking forward for their album to be released. With their debut album, Evanescence successfully manages to melt some strong riffs with the soft, consistent and original voice of highly talented Amy Lee. At the first spin, &quot;Going Under&quot;, &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;Tourniquet&quot; and &quot;My Last Breath&quot; are my favorites. One last note: If you liked this album and don't want to wait for Evanescence's next album, try &quot;Sebnem Ferah&quot; where available. Sebnem Ferah is a Turkish vocalist, who worked with Apocalyptica and Therapy on various albums. Identical with Amy Lee.
B000031XCR|3.0|Some artists really deserve a greatest hits collection. Celine Dion does that, much because she has released many records and all of them have great songs, and there isnt any..official greatest hits from her as far as I know and remember. <BR>This one does the job just so-so, the best songs are in the beginning of the record, and the album slows down towards the end, but its an okay collection. <BR>The lack of many great songs hurts this collection. Where is \\"Think Twice\\"? Where is \\"Falling into you\\"? Where is \\"Where does my heart beat now\\" and \\"The Reason\\"??? These are songs that are loved and played by so many, so it is weird why they were excluded and replaced with the uninteresting songs in the end. <BR>But the biggest question is of course...<BR>Why, just WHY did they cut and edit \\"It`s all coming back to me now\\"?! I was so seriously furious when I heard this shortened version, which lacks all the beauty and grandiose in the original. The Ending comes to soon, it has changed to a hurried and tragic ending, and the whole song, Celine Dion`s BEST song is ruined. <br />Now...if you excuse me for my little uproar back there, I`ll continue. <BR>I do not think this cd deserves more than three stars. It would have gotten five if they didnt touch Jim Steinman`s diamond, and if they included the rest of her REAL great songs. But now it gets away with three stars, and that is more than enough for this medicore collection.<br />Worth it..? Nah...depends. Check out the actual tracklisting first, you might end up getting disappointed. If the lack of many of her best songs arent enough, then the shameful version of \\"Its all coming back to me now\\" will surely leave a bitter taste.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is there fourth (though the first that was widely releasesd) and i have to say it is there best. Bring Me to Life is getting good airplay finally and it is just one of many strong tracks on the Cd.  Haunted is also good, but Imaginary is my favorite song, good vocals instrumental, everything about these guys is wonderful, i think that windup released some jinxed copies of their work onto [a website] so if you want to preview the tracks you can try them out there (they have breaks in them).  Anyway i would suggest for all of you to try this one out, oh and check out Twelve Stones, who's also on Wind-Up
B0000214F0|4.0|Mad, over the top and ridiculously extravagant, I loved every minute of it and highly recommend the film to lovers of the bizzare and extreme. For all those who always wanted a Roman epic to tell like it really was, this is a must see.
0064407667|4.0|Were it possible for me to portray the adventures of the Baudelaire children in a more positive light, I would attempt to avoid telling you how they become unlucky in their travels. Indeed, the Baudelaire children start out with an unfortunate event, and some would say, the most unfortunate of all. Mr. Poe comes to find the Baudelaire children-the inventing 13 year old Violet, the infant Sunny who likes to bite anything and everything, and young bookworm Klaus-playing on the beach where Mr. Poe informs them of a fire and the passing of their beloved parents. <BR>From there, the children are taken to live with Poe's family. Though given itchy clothes and share the house with Poe's two sons, they are soon removed to live with Count Olaf, a relative. The count treats the children poorly, and is quick to devise a scheme by which he can get his oily fingers on the money they've inherited from their parents. I want to tell you the ending of their tale was a happy one, but even if true, I cannot tell you.<BR>These books are a delightful read. They don't take much time to read and are fairly rivetting. They are not the cheeriest books you can by, but quite humorous. Purportedly written for children, they are a delight at any age, though not necessarily appropriate for youngsters.
B000084T18|4.0|THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST LYRICAL CDS I HAVE HEARD IN A WHILE. 50 IS LIVING UP TO ALL OF HYPE THAT HAS SURROUNDING HIM. ALL OF THE SONGS HAVE TIGHT BEATS, AND EVERY SINGLE SONG IS TIGHT. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SKIP ANY SONG ON THIS WHENEVER YOU ARE LISTENING TO THIS CD. IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE THIS CD YOU NEED TO HURRY UP AND GO GET IT.
B00004XONN|5.0|**Updated 03/17/03**<br />Original Review:<BR>\\"Kid A\\" was released to be the number one album on certain charts, despite being sooo... \\"difficult\\". Ironically, in conceiving this album, Radiohead delved into music that has been virtually ignored by the mainstream press for decades. Can, Public Image Ltd, Joy Division, early Frank Zappa, maybe Kraftwerk...it's all here, sometimes to the point of being a bit derivitave.<br />Radiohead had the balls to release this album, and the subsequent \\"Amnesiac.\\" For that, I salute 'em. But when compared to the previously mentioned artists, it doesn't diminish in quality...but a bit in originality.<br />As the Velvet Underground personified the shady underbelly (pun unintended) of the `60s, and the Post-Punk movement articulated the dissatisfaction of the late `70s \ Early `80s, this album gives voice to the 21st century. That is the voice of dis-passion. The music of \\"Kid A\\" can be very warm, very beautiful, but the overall feeling is a sense of dread, and of not caring about the doom approaching. For that, this album is commendable. And bleak.<br />New Comments: <BR>I have just heard \\"OK Computer\\" for the first time recently. Although I know I should give it futher listens before making a judgement, I have to say that I think this is the better album. Up until this album, I really think that the traditional song structures which Radiohead worked under held them back. <BR>Although \\"OK\\" was impressive in it's own right, I don't (yet) see it as a great album. The freedom and space the group allowed themselves on both \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" has done them a tremendous favor in terms of sheer creativity and diversity. I felt that \\"OK\\" had a somewhat homogenous feel to it; in fact, there was not a single time during my listening when I knew that one song had ended and another has started. They simply seemed to blend together, which is okay but I would have liked a bit more of a schizo feel (which is why my favorite Radiohead album is\\"Amnesiac\\" --you never know what to expect first time thru).<BR>I am raising my rating of \\"Kid A\\" to 5 stars from 4; in terms of their own creative progression it is deserved. They may be standing on the shoulders of giants, but they are quickly becoming giants in their own right. Here's hoping their next album is another progression!
B000000OPW|5.0|Siouxse and the Banshees never were truly a punk band, I think, simply because the musicianship was too good and the song structures were far too intricate.  That being sai, they did make a fine showing of themselves as a punk band in the seventies and early eighties, but, by the time  &quot;Hyeana&quot; rolled around, they had clearly gotten tired of the restrictions. Still, one could claim that they were just playing around on &quot;Hyeana&quot; and &quot;Through the looking glass,&quot; but not here.  On &quot;Tinderbox,&quot; thier sound is clearly harder, icier, more dissonant than ever.  The playing is nothing short of excellent (around the time that this was released, I remember some referring to them as the &quot;Rush of Punk&quot;), and the production (&quot;Party's Fall&quot; aside) is stunning.  Both the lyrical and sonic concepts in each song are allowed to develop fully, sometimes maturing over the space of two to three songs.  There is a definite mood about this release - think of a hard rock recording reaching for - and attaining - a goth mood, and you get the idea.  The B-sides, for the most part, hold up on thier own, with &quot;The Quarterdrawing of the Dog&quot; being the low point and the danceable Arabesque of &quot;Umbrella&quot; being the highest.
B00000IPAX|4.0|Well, look, this is no Astral Weeks, no Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, no Joshua Tree.  That's a given, but neither is it just disposable pop punk.  The boys of Blink 182 have made a record here that is not just for kids. Instead, they give a 12 snapshot, thirty-five minute insight into male adolescence trying to figure out its way into maturity -- and not finding any of it easy.  Girlfriends are a particular confusion of course; they dump you by leaving for college (Going Away to College), they dump you because they've found someone who thinks about issues (Dysentary Gary), and they dump you for reasons you don't have a clue about (Don't Leave Me).  But these boy/men are also haunted by childhood fears (Aliens Exist) and trapped by depression in their rooms (Adam's Song).  And, of course, parents are an annoyance at best (Anthem).  So, faced by all this, what gets them through?  Music of course, singing and playing about it all.  In Blink's case that means simple three-chord thrashing at guitar, bass and drums, nasally vocals that remind me a bit of the Ramones, as they sing lyrics that at their frequent best are at once whiney, witty, and full of longing.  I come out of this CD thinking these boys are gonna be alright -- though they'll want to do something about those tattoos in years to come -- just like most all of our children.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This album is very good indeed. Gimme Shelter has to be not just on of the best stones songs ever, but one of the best songs ever by any band. It's certainly mine. I have not heard the latest remastered version of this album, but i don't need to. I know this is album is top. Add this to your collection and be stunned!
0316666343|5.0|I loved the originality.  This book was a great read and a wonderful departure from the standard.
B00005JM1D|5.0|I am so tired of movies that start off as comedies only to degenerate into sad parodies of Personal Triumph stories.  The first 30 min or so will be funny, then the main character spends the rest of the movie tyring to 1. get the girl back, 2. redeem himself in the eyes of family/boss/school or 3. save the world.<BR>This film is refreshingly free of any of that.  It ends the same way it begins.  With a group of idiots.  Will Farrell  in particular has absolutely no shame.  Blessed/Cursed with an aging middle age type body the streaking scene will haunt you for days once you are finished laughing.<BR>Basically the story, Man comes home early from trip, man breaks up with girlfriend due to fact girlfriend slept with half of internet while man was gone.  Mans friends decide to relieve youth after he gets own place, hilarity ensues.<BR>Check your brain at the door and enjoy.
B000083C49|5.0|First of all, I want to set the record strait. Reviewer stinky-but-nice said 9 minutes were cut out. Maybe someone somewhere made a running time mistake, but I just bought and watched this DVD, and it is, minute for minute, scene for scene, the ORIGINAL movie. Nothing was cut out (I've seen this movie MANY times.)<br />That being said, WOW. Great stuff. Nimoy and Shatner's commentary was a bit personal, and sometimes off subject, but never boring. The 6 hours of bonus footage comes mostly in the form of well produced featurettes, some of which were downright educational in a Science Channel kind of way. But it's all on topic, and GOOD. I enjoyed it all immensely.<br />On a final, bit more personal note:  Most DVD's I buy or rent that have added features lack something very important to me:  subtitles on the featurettes. I am hearing impaired, and often have trouble understanding all the stuff being said. To date, all the Star Trek special editions have full subtitles for the hearing impaired on their featurettes. With over 6 hours of added features on Star Trek IV, this obviously enhances my experience of the DVD greatly.<br />If you are a Star Trek fan, or just someone who saw this movie and loved it, this will be a great addition to your library.
B00007JVBI|4.0|Up until last week, I had never heard of Chan &quot;Cat Power&quot; Marshall. That was until I picked up her latest album, &quot;You Are Free&quot;. A collection of beautiful songs composed of slightly distorted guitar, jangly piano, and the occasional drum accompaniment by (who else?) Dave Grohl. Every song has a sort of fragile feel to them, like they may break at any moment. Eddie Vedder also lends his voice to the mix but rarely is it actually audible; usually it's used to harmonize with Chan's voice. <br />There's some duds on the cd but for the most part, it's top-rate material, suitable for rainy days and cold nights. My biggest compliant isn't the songs on the cd but rather the packaging - it's some cardboard gatefold that feels like it might fall apart at anytime. Not due to poor construction but rather the stress that is placed on it every time you take out or put in the cd or put in or take out the linear notes. I guess everything can't be perfect.
6305609705|1.0|I understand why people consider \\"Apocalypse Now\\" a great film.  I really do.  From a cinematic perspective, it's a powerful, even riveting piece of work.  But from my perspective (that of a child to a Vietnam vet, of a reader who loved \\"Heart of Darkness\\", of a student in a class studying literature of the Vietnam War), I think it's a decadent piece of [junk.] The first (endless!) shot was amazing - trees blowing in the wind generated by landing helicopters, the Doors' \\"The End\\" playing to haunting effect.  From there, it descended into a piece of self-indulgent [junk] in the mode of an auteur on an LSD trip.  Those dramatic shots of Brando in darkness, dramatically raising his face to the light!  Sheen dramatically emerging out of the river, face blackened!  Sheen parading dramatically down the fire-lit corridor!  The truly decadent and hideously smug scene in which Kurtz and the bull are simultaneously (and, of course, dramatically) slaughtered.  I could picture Coppola just out of camera range - \\"Wow, aren't I cool!  This is so...dramatic!\\"  An art film that mocks its subjects, annihilates a literary classic, and turns the Vietnam War experience into a circus freak show.  I'll respect the right of others to disagree and to perhaps think I'm crazy, but there's my two cents and I'm sticking by it.
B000066C87|5.0|I see Gosford more as an athletic event than as a movie. I have never seen the physical movement and gesture of the human person shown as beautifully and as subtly as Altman does it here. To me this masterpiece is about movement and how it explains personality and character. Elsie picking up the little dog and handing it off to Sir William in the hall is every bit as impressive as any double play that Chavez and Tejada have ever turned for the A's. (and they turn the most beautiful around the horn double play in baseball.) And Altman gave every character at least one move that I would say was all their own. Maybe the move is just standing there a certain way, like Constance's butler in the first scene did as the car drove away. I've seen it ten times now and the more I see it, the more I see it as a dance. Even though the dialogue was brilliant, I think its purpose was to accent a distinct manner taking place at that moment which is why if some piece of conversation is not heard or followed or understood perfectly, it ain't that big a deal......
B00005JLF5|4.0|I love the Star Trek series. I hope that they come out with every single episode of Star Trek in all 5 series on DVD. They did a much better job of extras on DS9 than they did on TNG. One thing that I hope they would do is have a play all for each disk. That way, we could just put a disk in and watch all 4 hours. I know there weren't many people that were DS9 fans. I have to admit, I wasn't much of one when it was on until the Dominion wars started, but I think this collection is worth it.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is a fantastic cd.  It has all the great music from the movie, except for a few pieces, but all in all, I'd say it is worth the cash.  I like to listen to it while doing housework, driving in the car, or reading books with lavender candles luminating the comfy livingroom with the sounds of Orcs running through my livingroom...the elves creeping across the back of my armchair...Arwen kissing Strider...Bilbo yearning for the precious...I tell you, it is L.O.T.R. bliss.  Ahhhhh, the preciousness of this cd is a worthy purchase.  Just make sure you get the Original Soundtrack and not that other ... Lord of the Rings cd, it is not worth the plastic it's burned on.
014043786X|5.0|This is a book of stupifying and mind-blowing set of events, in which the incredible Sherlock Holmes is called forth to solve the mystery of the hound that has haunted the Baskerville family for generations. Death and puzzlement will arise as Holmes investigates the mysterious death of Sir Henry's father. He stumbles across the most mysterious case yet. I rate this book a five because of the way it keeps you thinking and guessing. I recomend this book not only for mystery lovers, but to people who like to think and guess as well. Three reasons you should read this book are: it is sophisticated reading, (it is a well known fact that reading expands your vocabulary); It makes you think, which will help you at some point in your life; and it is full of every category in reading: romance, excitement, comedy, etc.  I've always said books are little worlds of knowledge. If we use them right we could all become more sophisticated and mature. (This review written by Brian Jerz, age 13)
0553381709|5.0|This series just gets better and better. A storm of Swords is darker, grittier, and moves at a faster pace than the prior two novels, and for the most part, that is a good thing.<br />Even with more characters, Martin never fails to make all of them interesting. Catelyn continued to support her son Robb while awaiting the return of her daughters. She grew stronger, and maybe weaker, but all the while makes us love her. Bran journeys north to search for the three-eyed crow while his sister Arya is becoming more and more dangerous and lovable. Sansa still suffers through at the hands of the Lannisters along with the ever funny Imp, Tyrion, who must face the malice of his sister Cersei.<br />The writting in this book is fantastic. Rarely have fantasy novels offer such strong dialouges and realism. Martin effortlessly weave characters together into one incredible tapastry of murder, incest, magic, love, and the cold abyss of human nature. Clearly he understands that the most effective way to grasp his readers into a imaginative world is to refer to our own.<br />Years after A Game of Thrones came out, there are great debates whether this series is better than Lord of the Rings. Debate no longer. Martin, through three books not only surpasses the trilogy, but all other fantasy series ever written so far.
B000002I25|5.0|Few bands could claim to be as moody, dark, or sardonic as the Doors were in their heyday. Although the Doors are often mentioned in the same breath as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and other 60's American psychedelic acts, it's pretty clear that Jim Morrison (vocals), Ray Manzarek (organ, bass), Robby Krieger (guitar) and John Densmore (drums) were tapping into a totally different source of inspiration.<br />No sitars, no peace and love, no A Day In The Life studio effects. The atmosphere of the debut is one of an almost darkly comic air. Although much of the lyrics consisted of the typical rock 'n' roll topics (women, blues, and beer) there was also philosophy and allusions to literature. For example, the 11-minute finale The End is almost a modern-day version of the Greek tragedy Oedipus, and was easily one of the most subversive songs of 1966 with its themes of murder and incest (\\"Mother, I want to...\\").<br />Manzarek was an organ legend (his 2-minute solo on Light My Fire is one of the coolest pieces of music ever) and Kreiger an underrated guitarist, but \\"The Lizard King\\" really established what the band was about. Morrison's ghostly voice, charisma, and sinister prescence established the blueprint for many future frontmen--Iggy Pop (Stooges) and Ian Curtis (Joy Division) were two of his most notable followers.<br />As for the Doors' first release, it's a classic. Only their sophomore release Strange Days would approach the consistency of this one. Highlights? The entire album. Favorites of mine include Soul Kitchen (a song about a restaurant in Venice), the eerily psychedelic Crystal Ship, and the two blues covers Alabama Song and Back Door Man. Buy this one, and also buy Strange Days. The rest of the catalog is far less consistent and recommended only for fans.
B000001EPB|5.0|This is a great cd!!!!  I do Irish Step Dance, and in the performances, all of the best dances are always to this music.  Cry of the Celts and Gypsy work especially well.
B00000099Y|5.0|*Change of oppinion* Sorry for offending some when i said Lateralus was better. NO WAY! Yep Aenima is the best Tool album now.. First impressions definitely dont last with this masterpiece. It just keeps getting better. Wow! hooker with a penis, eulogy, stinkfist, H, forty six and two, aenima and Third Eye are all awesome! I purchased this album 2 months ago and didnt give it a fair-go in the cd player - now that i have, its definitely worth it. Absolute must-have album for any Tool fan and any fan of rock/heavy metal/prog. Danny Carey is awesome!!
6305949980|5.0|It's been said more eloquently by others that this movie is simply magical. Detailed, intricate and whimsical animation combined with a just-twisted-enough fairy tale plot. <br />One of my favorite inclusions in the SE DVD is the foreign language track. The French voice acting is superb, for those who like to mix it up a little. Jack and Sally's voices are smooth and sweet and the songs work just as well (sometimes even better!) in French. <br />But even if you don't like that, all the other goodies on the disk are well worth it.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This CD is to say the least amazing..Y'all say its not as good as their old stuff...but who cares? its still absolutely awesome...i tend to put it on the same level as Smash(also an amazing cd) you want song by song breakdown? you got it.<BR>1. Intro-Ok they needed to fill up a track...its just what it says, an intro<BR>2. Have You Ever 10/10-everytime i listen to this song i hear another amazing part or nuance i never noticed before...its my second favorite song on the cd, and has one heck of a message...its also notable because they dont cuss in this song fave quote from this one &quot;When the truth walks away, everybody stays cuz the truth about world is that crime does pay.<BR>3. Staring At the Sun 9/10-used to be my favorite song on the cd, but the sheer simplicity of it will get old quickly..still good though<BR>4. Pretty Fly For a White Guy 6/10-Absolute worst song on the cd...it was overplayed and overpublicized..if they had never released it, it might still be good<BR>5. Kids Aren't Alright 9/10-Scary rendition of what happens to todays kids...quite good and good vocals<BR>6. Feelings 7/10-what the heck is this? good song but very out of place and odd soundin<BR>7.

Walla Walla 8/10-narrative of a kid getting arrested...pretty good for a stupid song<BR>9. End of the Line 10/10-THE BEST SONG ON THE CD by far..i could go on for hours bout this song but i wont cuz i'm limted to 1000 words<BR>10. No Brakes 9/10-Strategicaly placed on the album to give some hard metal b/w the mellow End of the Line and Pop Why don't you get a job<BR>11. Why Dont You Get a Job 7/10-Loses points for ripping the beatles..still though, i cant help but sing along<BR>12.

0553208845|2.0|The breadth with which Siddhartha covers Eastern Philosophy could be conveyed in a Discovery or PBS special.  It does not even hint at its own limitations.  This serves as an introduction to Eastern Philosophy, but by reading the text one might think they are an expert after finishing it.

B000089RVX|5.0|Sometimes there seems to be too much polarization in music, especially among bands with female singers. On one side of the spectrum there's the Lilith groups like the Indigo Girls and Shawn Colvin and the pop princesses like Britney, Christina, and Michelle Branch that produce light, bland music with no edge. On the other side of the spectrum there's groups like Kittie and Otep that have female singers, but don't take advantage of them. They simply scream and grunt instead of singing. There's very few female singers or female fronted rock bands that actually rock. The only few that come to mind immediately are Lennon, The kidneythieves, and Plumb to some extent. (Of course, there's a few chick punk bands like The Donnas too, but I'm choosing to ignore them right now.) Evanescence belongs in that small group of bands. Their new CD, Fallen, is amazing. Amy's voice is fantastic. A second soprano or alto I'd say, with plenty of power. The songs are dark and very atmospheric. The guitars are quite heavy at times and soft and subdued at others. A piano is also used on many tracks and there are other various effects throughout. The lyrics are deep and poetic and some seem to contain Christian themes. Most, however, are romantic in nature. All of the songs on the album are excellent, but the standout tracks include &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; from the Daredevil Sountrack, &quot;Tourniquet,&quot; &quot;Haunted,&quot; and &quot;Whisper.&quot; Any fans of good alt-rock or chick bands should buy Fallen immediately.
B000031WBV|5.0|The mention of Rubinstein invariably recalls to mind his fellow countryman Chopin, the greatest composer for the instrument of all time.  Although the Russian school is well-known and still in existence, there was once an enormous Polish school that thundered, whispered and sang with that machine of ebony and ivory.  <br />No one intoned those inner voices like Frederic Chopin and perhaps no one understood them better than Artur Rubinstein. Many claim that the Nocturnes are the apex of Chopin's oeuvre.  This would be true if it were not for the Mazurkas, Ballades, Scherzos, Preludes and Etudes. But it is true that the Nocturnes are the pieces that one instantly associates with the artist. They are in turn dreamy, stormy, languid, lush and touching.<br />Of course, in Rubinstein's capable hands they sound easy - and they are anything but simple works.  One needs a totally free hand, mobile fingers and that special touch that Chopin requires.  Then there are all those pesky rhythms - 2 against 3, 3 against 4, an undulating flow of sound. The adjective that comes to mind when listening to Rubinstein's  interpretations is &quot;silky&quot;.  The perfect cover for this set is an upturned wine bottle (long neck) with deep red liquid flowing over the pages of the music.   <br />Needless to say, the CHOPIN COLLECTION is without a doubt a towering achievement in the annals of recording.  There is no doubt that if you purchase this set, the others will be right behind.

(Pardon the alliteration) Stephenson's prose is quick and to the point, his mathematics are easily explained and his characters are vivid. But... where's the plot?

If you're going to read to this techno-tome, please try to ignore giant plot holes and silly &quot;twists&quot;, enjoy this novel for its edu-tainment.
0743243153|4.0|The way this book is writtenat times light, nurturing, and joyous but often heavy, challenging, and confrontationalis a metaphor for Scott Peck's perspective on life. The first sentence of the book, \\"life is difficult,\\" reflects Scott Peck's idea that spiritual/mental growth must be worked towards, that human beings are generally lazy, and that growth of consciousness is a life-long process. Everything is generally working against our growth: laziness; defense mechanisms employed to maintain the status quo of mental illness over the struggle for accepting responsibility; confusion over the true nature of love; resistance to \\"grace\\"  (the idea of being open to our unconscious and the symbolic language of God); lack of discipline; adults being mentally and spiritually immature; poor parenting resulting in nuerosis and character disorder; and a culture that generally defends, accepts, and nurtures sickness over health.<br />Sometimes Scott Peck's language is a little heavy, but it's only because he packs so much valuable information and insight into each page. The first chapter on Discipline (a tool to solve our problems. Another great Peck idea: see problems as challenges, and it is in our response to problems that life takes on its meaning and color) was a bit dry to me, but contains excellent information on delaying gratification, balancing and bracketing (attempting to listen to others/view situations with objectivity), dedication to the truth, and a key to anyone seeking to grow: ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY.<br />The second section on Love was fascinating to me. Scott Peck does a great job debunking the myth of romantic love, but perhaps most valuable is the idea that real loving is about nurturing your own or another's spiritual growth. Love is an action and a decision, not just a feeling. It's so easy in our culture to imagine love as a feeling, red roses, wine, dinners, etc. That is the illusion of romance but has nothing to do with the work and courage of real active loving (Scott Peck says if an action doesn't involve courage or work, it's not loving!). Also in this chapter are a few controversial ideas, namely open marriage (Scott Peck's extension of the idea that loving involves encouraging an individual's total development...hmmm...sort of vague extension to me to involve plural relationships. what happened to discipline?) and even Scott Peck's suggestion that he would have sex with a patient if he felt it would further both their spiritual development! (do not agree with this at all. any person in treatment is not in a position to navigate such power dynamics)<br />The final section on Grace reminds us to look to our unconscious for information and guidance. Dreams, nagging thoughts, sudden insights, etc. from our unconscious, which Scott Peck says knows more than our conscious ever could, are signs that there is a God, and he/she/it is a loving God interested in our spiritual development (reflection of Scott Peck's idea of love, and a good idea if you ask me). These signs are meant to prod us into action.<br />In general, although at times you will be re-reading pages to make sure you got the meaning, and sometimes Scott Peck's language will seem heavy and plodding, this book will help you see where you can expand the boundaries of your spirit, your mind, and your life, how you can love bigger and better (and make it mean more to everyone), how your life can have meaning and consistency, and how to be a loving, conscious person, parent, lover, mate, and friend. I underlined a LOT in this book, and going back to read just my underlines I am amazed at the amount of loving, valuable insight in this book. Growing and truly accepting responsibility for the quality of our lives is not as easy as it sounds. Scott Peck is very aware of this and gives a lot of support to keep on journeying this road less traveled.real active loving (Scott Peck says if an action doesn't involve courage or work, it's not loving!).

B000089RVX|5.0|Being from the Little Rock area, I have been privy to this band's music for a few years. Now everyone has a chance to hear what we in Arkansas have had the opportunity to fall in love with.<br />Amy Lee has a voice that will put you into a dream state that is hard to break from. Coupled with Ben Moody's subtle, yet strong guitar, Evanessence is THE break out group of the year. Their song's from this album, \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" are on the Dare Devil soundtrack and are the obvious standouts of that album. Here, they are the bookends to even more fantastic music. Hard driving guitar, synth and piano, help to flow with Amy's soul filled vocals. Each song is an emotional road to a different place that many of us have visited once or twice in our lives. <br />It is good to see a local band break out like this, even more so with such a high quality offering.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|If you where to tell me a year ago that one of my favorite bands would be a pop band I would have thought you were crazy.  But after hearing just one song off 200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane I fell in love with this amazing group.  Before listening to them the only types of music I listend to was Heavy Matal, Rock, and blues.  In my opinion All The Things She Said, 30 Minutes, and Stars are the best 3 songs on the cd.
0684803356|5.0|There never has, and never will be, another writer with the lucidity and inestimable genius of Hemingway.  Hemingway's characteristic laconic, terse, and fluid prose and dialogue shine radiantly throughout this book for the ages.  Seeing our country in the midst of the war on terrorism and a growing divisiveness amongst Americans, I feel, regardless of one's stance on war,  For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great book to pick up right now.<br />To stereotype and routinely categorize this great work as nothing more than a \\"war book\\" is to do it a grave injustice.  Hemingway touches on, among other things, love, loyalty, sacrifice for the greater good, rape, suicide, altruism, and social injustice.  For Whom the Bell Tolls manifests itself as a book that speaks to the reader in many indescribable ways.  Hemingway's character development is masterful and unparalleled in literature.  We come to know not only our intrepid protagonist Robert Jordan, moreover we come to know the inner thoughts and feelings of Anselmo, Maria, Pablo, Pilar, and Lieutenant Berrendo as Hemingway ingeniously flips from 3rd to 1st person narrative and then back to 3rd perdson on the drop of a dime.<br />Perhaps the only negative of the book is the annoying censoring of curse words throughout the text such as, \\"I obscenity in the milk of science.\\"  Ironically, Hemingway's hero Robert Jordan fights for the Communist Republic(which of course mandated censorship), and his own book ends up censored.  Go figure.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this powerful tour de force and recommend it highly.
B000089RVX|5.0|I am so excited that Evanescence has finally released their cd Fallen. Every song is absolutely wonderful on it. Whether you like the alternative rock sound or the more relaxing type. There is something on this cd for everybody no matter what mood you are in. Their music if full of so much passion and feeling I guarantee that you will love it.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is without a doubt the first time I've ever liked every single song on a cd.  I've never even like alternate rock before.  I only got interested in this group because of Daredevil.  I was blown away.  Buy this cd, no matter what your taste in music.
6302775302|5.0|For Dire Straits to have not done too well in 1991, this was an excellent video to come out. Paul Franklin added a lot to the band during their tours that year and put a lot of soul and oomph into the music. Mark Knopfler is outstanding (I don't see how he can make it look so easy). I'd definitely get this video while I still could.
B00005ARDC|4.0|Just like most of the other reviewers on here, BRMC reminded me instantly of 'Jesus and the Mary Chain' (a much better and solid band). However, BRMC seems almost like a 'J&tMC' cover band, where all there original songs sound like '.....' of the band they sometimes cover - and I don't mean that in a negative way, just a factual way. I enjoyed BRMC's debut album for first of all having a cool name and secondly (and most importantly) of reminding me of a band that used to be (and still is) one of my favorites (J&tMC).
B000089RVX|5.0|We all got a taste of Evanescence (excluding the lucky people in the Little Rock, Ark. area) on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack with &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal.&quot; In my case, it was more than enough to get this album as soon as possible. Trust me, if you liked what you heard on Daredevil, you will not in any way be dissapointed. Ms. Lee hits the nail square on the head when she says their music is epic. Every song, with the exception of &quot;Hello,&quot; (which is in no way a bad song) has pure energy rushing through it. Another positive is that there are actually guitar solos in some songs...A definite rarity in today's nu-metal era. Not to mention Ms. Lee's vocals and lyrics are simply stunning. Its been a while since ive felt like i spent my money well on a CD. Favorite songs &quot;Going Under, Haunted and Tourniquet&quot;
B000050FEN|5.0|Director David Fincher made up for his dreadful directorial debut Alien 3 with this superbly crafted thriller that became the most unnerving serial killer film since The Silence of the Lambs.  Veteran detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is teamed with young detective Mills (Brad Pitt) to track a serial killer who is basing his murders on the seven deadly sins.  Freeman and Pitt are both great in they're respective roles, but Gwyneth Paltrow is mostly wasted as Pitt's wife.  The best performance however goes to Kevin Spacey as John Doe, the seemingly insane killer that we soon find out may not be so insane after all.  This is where Fincher began to display the skills of the type of director he would become in his later films like Fight Club and Panic Room.  The look of the film honestly, is pretty depressing, but that mood sets the tone of Seven perfectly, and the atmosphere of the film carries a sense of dread almost throughout the entire film.  Freeman's characterization of the weathered and disenchanted Somerset is one of his best roles in his distinguished career.  Pitt's characterization of a hot headed cop is one of his better roles as well, but as I said before, Kevin Spacey gives the best performance of the film and is purely chilling.  What makes John Doe chilling however, is not his crimes, but the fact that when he speaks his reasons why, he makes a frightening sense of it.  The DVD itself is packed with extras including four seperate commentaries and an alternate ending (plus an un-shot ending done with storyboards) along with tons more, and is possibly New Line's best produced DVD to date.  All in all, consider this essential viewing.
B000089A07|1.0|Oh this is so scary. Also recomended is The little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Timmy the Tooth.
B00005JM1D|4.0|Old School is a very funny movie for fans of this type of comedy, but its storyline is pretty much the same.  You have the good guys, the evil dean, and the girl that almost gets away.
B00005JLK1|3.0|This is a 3 star horror movie that isn't that scary, but is severly underated. Yes it ripsoff better and scarier movies, but it was alot better than Fear Dot Com, Swimfan, Abandon, and They. This is one I'd recommend you seeing. It's got gore, lots of laughs (most of them are unintentional) and maybe a few scares, but nothing that will mess you up, so that makes this a perfect party movie that you sit back and watch with your buds and laugh at it. Highly recomennded. I actually really enjoyed this movie. It's gory, it's got alot of action, and it's fast paced, so die-hard horror fans need to see this. I would buy it.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The fact that the lead characters in this movie could have been played by lesser-known but more talented actors who could sing and dance better is not lost on director Rob Marshall.  But, as he has pointed out in countless interviews, the effort that went into making this movie would have been futile had he chosen actors with the right combination of pipes and dancing ability, but whose screen presence falls flat (I've been to many musicals and I regretfully agree with this assessment).  Therefore, his instincts to cast the movie with bankable actors first, and then to work with them on their singing/dancing abilities second, was right on the money.  Let's face it, Chicago the movie would not have surpassed the $100 million mark with Bebe Neuwirth as Velma Kelly (only purists would have appreciated her playing the part, but then again, musical purists make up only a paltry fraction of the moviegoing public).<br />Forget what the skeptics think.  That the movie owes much of its success to the \\"Gee, I had no idea Catherine Zeta-Jones could belt and dance like that!\\" phenomenon should not deter anyone from enjoying the movie or the soundtrack.  So run--don't just walk--to the nearest theater featuring this movie, sit back, enjoy the next couple hours as you are transported to Prohibition-era Chicago and all its jazz and corruption, then run again to the nearest Wherehouse and grab a copy of the CD soundtrack (which I would gladly have given 5 stars were it not for the 2 pathetic tracks in the end).
0800187792|4.0|My chief criticism of this movie is that it takes a while getting its feet under it, though it's understandable in light of the many personalities and situations that have to be established in the first half of the story: Thomas Alden (Daniels), an environmental activist and eccentric artist (mostly in metal) who lives in Southern Ontario; Amy (Paquin), his 13-year-old daughter, whom he hasn't seen in years, and who comes to live with him after her mother, a recording artist, is killed in a car crash in New Zealand; David (Kinney), Thomas's brother, and Susan Barnes (Delany), his lady friend; and assorted background information regarding the habits of Canada geese and the Dominion laws regarding them.  Spurred by the threat that the local wildlife officers will clip the wings of the hatch of orphaned goslings she has adopted, rendering them unable to fly, if she tries to keep them as \\"domesticated,\\" Amy resolves to find a way to help them migrate south each winter.  It's Thomas's friend Strickland (Graham), a hobbyist in ultralight flying machines, who provides a possible solution, but it takes Thomas's inventive mind to make the final link: because the geese have imprinted on Amy, they will only follow *her*, so a plane must be built for her and she must be taught to fly it.  (\\"You'll follow me,\\" says Thomas, \\"the geese will follow you, and we'll get them there.\\")  Complications are added by the fact that the wildlife sanctuary in Maryland where David and a professorial friend propose to settle the mini-flock is scheduled to undergo development if migratory birds aren't induced to go there within a very short timeframe.<br />The best sequences in the movie are those that show Amy interacting with her flock--dashing across the lawn or the nearby field (on an ATV) with the whole band galloping frantically after her, sitting quietly in their cage with them facing off against an invading wildlife officer--and, of course, the flight south.  You'll gasp as Amy, Thomas, and their geese blunder into a downtown field of skyscrapers in a fog and go driving down the canyon between soaring high-rises, to the stunned amazement of office workers.  You'll be on the edge of your seat as they unknowingly throw a USAF base into full alert by bearing down on it without making radio contact.  The interpolated sequences featuring voiceovers and onscreens by assorted American newscasters add a sense of reality to the unfolding story.  And then there's the triumphant climactic sequence when Amy, left to do the last part of the flight alone after Thomas crashes his plane and dislocates a shoulder, arrives at the sanctuary where birdwatchers and environmentalists are staging a sit-down strike in front of the threatening bulldozers.  Besides sensitively addressing issues like divorce and parental death, \\"Fly Away Home\\" can also be seen as an allegory of growing up.  Though not for audiences with a short attention span or a liking for non-stop action or suspense, it *is* an excellent family film and well worth seeing.
B00005MP58|5.0|If you are an Austen fan you will watch this movie over and over.  Colin Firth's best role!  He is Darcy.
B00008973A|5.0|I thought this movie was terrific.  I have it on VHS but am now going to pre-order it on DVD.<br />I am not one of the fortunate ones that was able to see the original Broadway version, so I have nothing to compare it to. <BR>Maybe it's a little like reading a book then being disappointed at the movie they've made from it.  Or maybe it's just that I like musical's that much!<br />So for you out there like myself...enjoy this movie it was a real treat.
B0000640SA|4.0|I bought the dvd having no idea what the movie was all about except for the &quot;backwards&quot; concept. After watching the DVD, i'm glad that it was well worth it. It's one of the best films made.<br />The storytelling is undoubtledly one of a kind. the movie actually starts at the end, where Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) successfully finds his wife's killer and executes him. No spoiler here i guess. Then the movie moves backwards about 10 minutes at a time leading to the events happening previously.<br />In between these 10 minute reversals are black and white segments that actually move forward. these black and white segments more or less kinda introduces the character and his illness bit by bit so that the viewer can make sense of what is happening to the character as each of the 10 minute segments are being played in reverse.<br />as the black and white segments move forward, and the normal segments moves backwards, they converge into the climax of the movie.<br />The Memento LE DVD set is a definite collector's item. it has a lot of features that you'll really appreciate. A special feature on this DVD is on the second disk where you can veiw the Original short story and an easter egg where you can actually view the movie in its chronological order! Also, the director's commentary is a useful feature that lets you in on insights into the making of - and the meaning of - Memento.<br />The DVD's navigation system can be a bit tricky for some users. upon opening the dvd, a series of words flashes by, and you are required to remember those words to navigate the main menu, which is a test of text retention. Actually you don't have to remember a thing since the correct answers are the only ones you can select. Disc 2 is the same but instead of word, it flashed a series of images. no memorization here actually. This can be a challenging and rewarding exercise letting you fully interact with the viewing process. This exercise can actually become frustrating. Because once you've cracked the puzzles on disc 2, this feature becomes inconvenient and irritating whenever you want to access the features again. That's basically why i gave this 4 stars instead of 5<br />For the technical aspects of this DVD, the sound quality is great. This edition has a DTS 5.1 track on top of the Dolby 5.1 surround track. DVD is presented in high definition anamorphic screen and the picture quality is very good.<br />If you're a Memento fan or a lover of &quot;intellectual&quot; movies. This DVD is an absolute necessity.

B000002H97|4.0|Four stars for the amazing production!...I was a huge metallica fan in 1988...when and justice came out, it blew my mind! even today i listen to it very often...but this black album! well not really.....I think I've only listen it around 10 times in my life.....I don't like it..they change completely! ...
B000002897|5.0|There is some darn good musicianship here, some great lyrics...But what does it for me is Mark Lanegan's voice. You can't really say his voice &quot;shines...&quot; It's more like a smoldering glow. It's good on songs like Nearly Lost You and Sweet Oblivion, but give me something moody and slow from Mark any day. Dollar Bill is probably my favorite, but Shadow of the Season makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up as well. There's really not a bad song here. The Trees were an extremely underrated band, just as Lanegan is an underrated solo artist. If you like one, definitely check out the other.
B000002H6C|5.0|Bad production, no bass....so! This album sounds great...this album rocks!!!!.....This is metallica's crossover between technical trash metal  and more percussive, riff based hardcore structure. I love the first 5 albums (including garage days ..not the black album!) ....they are all great, influential and diferent from one another , but this is the album I listen the most......I love it..and anyone who doesn't, should open up their ears and give it a try again...because is just amazing!
B000089RVX|5.0|After hearing this up-and-coming band's two tracks on the Daredevil Soundtrack, and being blown away by them, I decided to check out their debut album. I haven;t been this impressed with a new band in quite some time. Every track on the album flows wonderfully together and their are no dissappointments. The vocal talents of Amy Lee are breathtaking, and the bands moody rhythms flow surprisngly well together in contrast. While all the tunes are strikingly fresh and wonderful, &quot;Imaginary&quot;, &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, &quot;Whisper&quot;, and &quot;Haunted&quot; stand out as the cream of the crop. All in all this was an explosive debut and I hope everyone shows my enthusiasm for this wonderful band. While this bands name may mean a dissipation or disappearance like vapor, I doubt they'll be disappearing anytime soon.
B000089RVX|5.0|This group has brought something so new and so fresh to the music scene I actually listened to the whole CD twice so far from track 1 to 11. This CD has the perfect mix of harmony and rock that will just blow you away. Totally get this CD and listen to it!
B00007J5VN|5.0|Universal has really done a spectacular job on this DVD, giving this underrated musical film the presentation it deserves.  The transfer is excellent, with vibrant colors and detail, and rich 4.0 Surround sound.  The Overture and Intermission Entr'acte are included in their entirety.  And in the supplement department, they give us the unused Alternate Ending, and TWO original featurettes: one revolving around Bob Fosse directing the film, and the other Edith Head and her costumes for the film.  Both have lots of behind-the-scenes footage, including costume tests, rehearsals and filming on the New York locations. Universal could have easily charged twice the price for this DVD.  Highly recommended.  For a DVD NOT marked &quot;Special Edition&quot;, this is, at a minimum, the way ALL classic films should be treated on DVD.  Bravo, Universal!
0316666343|5.0|They say that a ghost remains tied to the world of the living either to avenge its death or to comfort those left behind. The heroine of Alice Sebold's haunting, sweet novel \\"The Lovely Bones\\" isn't out for revenge, but her ties to the living family and friends make debut an amazing, uplifting story.<br /><br />Susie Salmon is dead. On a day like any other, she was raped and brutally murdered by a seemingly harmless neighbor, who hacked up her body and buried it. Now she exists in a surprisingly simple and pleasant heaven, watching her family and friends after she vanished, and watching their lives unfold even after hers has ended.<br /><br />Her parents cling to hope that even though a lot of blood and part of an arm has been found, that Susie is still alive. But eventually, they must give up hope. Susie watches the police investigate her death, while her father pokes around to find out whodunnit. And just as importantly her family and friends stumble through the various stages of grief, trying to deal with a horrible, senseless crime that has touched each of them.<br /><br />When someone is kidnapped and/or murdered, the news usually focuses on the criminals and the gory details. Not much attention is given to the victims and the lives they once led, or how their loves ones are dealing with the tragedy. Other books would be self-conscious or miserable dealing with that kind of story, but \\"Lovely Bones\\" is something very different.<br /><br />Instead, this book possesses a quiet, comforting tone and a poetic style. Sebold's writing has an innocent charm; one enchanting scene has Susie trying to make a flower bloom for her father, and filling a celestial room with flower petals instead. The only really gritty scene is the rape-and-murder, which is all the more shocking when you realize that things like this happen in real life.<br /><br />Susie herself is a truly unique character, a narrator completely removed from the events she describes, and yet so wrapped up in the people she loves, and has left behind. And Sebold explores the many characters as they go through the grieving process, with different thoughts and actions as they try to deal with it. The parents, the siblings, the teachers, and even the kid who was enamored of Susie.<br /><br />Alice Sebold's \\"Lovely Bones\\" shocks you at the beginning, and spends the rest of the book drying your tears.

0060977493|5.0|I came across this book accidentally and it was one of the most pleasant accidents to happen. Having spent the first few years of my life in a Bengali region but raised primarily in Texas, I was delighted to find that the vocabulary (or as some call it- &quot;non-standard English&quot;)used so often in the book is the same that I used growing up. I understand that it could be hard for many to grasp meanings and for the first half of the book, I too was asking &quot;where is she going with all this?&quot;. If it hadn't been for the vivid details and the childlike (but not childish) fashion that she used to uncurl the story, I would've dropped it a long time ago. It is the second half, closer to the end where the reader is slammed with the missing pieces and, at a loss for better words, this is when things got &quot;juicy&quot;. When I completed the book, I was anxious to re-read it, to trace back the knowledge that I have now with the incoherence of the first few chapters. Roy has a way of molding a cultural story without force-feeding excessive culture down readers' throats. It should be a nice read for folks if they stick with it.

B000089RVX|5.0|Eventhough they have been around the Little Rock area for several years, I can never get enough of their music. Every song on THIS cd is great, but the true standouts are &quot;Going Under&quot;, &quot;Bring me to life&quot;, &quot;My Immortal&quot;, &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, &quot;Imaginary&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;,and &quot;Whisper&quot;. This cd is worth more than you paid for it - so buy it now. Also, go see them in concert, very few bands sound as good in person as they do on their cd so check them out - they are really great musicians. I never thought it was possible to have a lead singer who makes you feel every single word that she is singing like AMY LEE does. The heavier songs show this emotion, but the slower songs will really take you for an emotional ride. Check out EBAY for more of their music, thier first CD is Origin.
B000083C49|4.0|I actually just picked up this DVD today and can't say that I've had a chance to view it yet, but I was compelled to write this now to hopefully dispel what can only be considered a misguided rumor at this point - &quot;stinky-but-nice&quot; cites that this edition is 9 minutes shorter than the original; this isn't true, this edition does have a running time of 118 minutes, (I can say that I have seen an advance promo incorrectly stating the 109 minute figure).<br />For those of you who don't already know this, yes, Star Trek IV was the best of the movies with the original crew and this edition is loaded with bonus features - perhaps the most important being the addition of commentary from both Nimoy and Shatner.
B000002H6C|5.0|This cd is one of the best Metallica cd's ever! With songs like One, ..And Justice For All, Dyers Eve, and one of my favorites, To Live is to Die. This is an awesome cd and I highly recommend it for anyone into metallica or anyone not into metallica that should be. Rock on
B000089RVX|5.0|Like the review title states, this disc is simply amazing. The album has a gothic, yet melodic feel to it. If you have heard the Evanescence songs on the Daredevil soundtrack, and liked them, you will surely enjoy this disc. There isn't much more I can say, other than to listen to the samples, and if you like them, order the disk. You won't be disappointed.
B000089RVX|4.0|Amy Lee has a nice voice, and her supporting band members do a pretty good job as well. This could be an interesting band to watch down the road. The album is well produced and has a somewhat &quot;commercial&quot; feel, but I still enjoy it quite a bit. There's just something about women and big guitar riffs - though there are a couple of slower tunes on the album, too. It rocks &quot;medium&quot;. I prefer this band to the similarly styled band Lacuna Coil (there's just something much cheesier about their arrangements and vocals)
B000002H33|5.0|There's not much I can say about this disc that everyone else isn't already raving about. This is undeniably Metallica's Best record ever and most likely the greatest thrash Metal record ever created. Sure there are only 8 tracks on it, but each isn't a little old 3-5 minute song, each is around the 6-8+ minute range but are great all throughout. Kirk Hammett really shines on this one with the BEST guitar solo's I've ever heard in my life, they're just so fast, furious and pulse pounding, after 1 listen to this, you won't turn back from it. <BR>I honestly cannot see any fan of REAL rock music not glowing about this record. When I say real rock I don't mean the Linkin' Park/Korn/Slipnot/Limp Bizkit crowd of Nu Metal. I'm talking the real deal. So if you're into thrash metal or any type of good rock music (I don't imagine you already owning this record), do yourself a favor and BUY THIS NOW! I GUARANTEE IT!!
B000089RVX|5.0|My first reaction to Fallen: WOW! Now, I have had the album for awhile (2 weeks) through Windup Records connections, and have listened to it nonstop ever since, but I never get tired of this music! Amy Lee's voice is so passionate, beautiful, and strong! It's amazing, and the guitars and keyboards are outstanding as well. Some of the tracks:<BR>Bring Me To Life- The band's first single, it definitly shows fans what Evanescence sounds like...the song starts with  slow, almost creepy keyboards, and Amy starts singing with that lovely voice of hers...and the chorus is strong,you can feel the energy in it. The song ends with a duet with Ben Moody (lead guitarist). This is the song used in Jennifer Garner's training session in Daredevil. <BR>My Immortal- A masterpiece, a truly beautiful song...Amy Lee's emotion is in this song completely, and the only instrument used is the keyboards. The lyrics hold alot of meaning, and there is even a secret morse code at the end of the song, as it finishes.<BR>Haunted- This song is quite eerie, all you have to do is listen to it to know what I mean...the lyrics, the instruments, Lee's voice... all mixed together just makes me  shivers,it feels as if someone is there watching you...a very cool effect! this song is probably the most gothic on the cd.....but it's great, and the way they have Amy's voice echoed before the chorus really sets the mood!<BR>Tourniquet-This is one of my personal favorites...this song can really be about whatever you want it to be about...although the lyrics suggest it's about suicide, it may also be about lost religeon, among other things. This song is brilliantly put together, once again with Lee's voice shining through.The guitars used in this song are very strong, too, and I love the keyboards at the end! They sounds like something out of Final Fantasy, an the way they drift right into the next song:<BR>Imaginary-This is a great song,with a good melody and awesome lyrics. Especially the way Amy sort of chants the lines from the chorus at the beginning and the end!<BR>Hello- Another song done completely by keyboards, and another of my favorites. This song has lyrics that many people can easily relate to, if they listen close enough for the meaning of the song. Very Touching.<BR>My Last Breath-Yet another favorite of mine, My Last Breath starts out with a strange, techno sounding keyboard effect, and at first you dont know what the song will sound like...but then the song's sound changes, accompanied by guitars and emotional lyrics. This song really paints a picture in your head, you can see Amy dying, and her love fallng apart. This song brought tears to my eyes, I felt like I was actually there!<BR>Whisper-Probably the heaviest sounding song on the cd, it's magnificent...the effects of the whispered voices, chorus, anmd Latin chants really take your breath away!<BR> Fallne is the best cd out this year, in my opinion. It is like dark rock, with a gothic twist. A truly wonderful album that everyone should have, Buy it today!
B00007G207|5.0|So many reviews have been written about this film, but since reviews for both VHS and DVD are all mashed together, it's hard to know which version they are referring to.<br />The restored complete version of this film, nearly 3 hours long, completely fleshes out the film with 51 minutes of added footage.<br />Most of the restored footage comes near the end when the grown &quot;Toto&quot; finds his lost love, Elena.(&quot;nuff said!)<br />Suffice it to say that a great film has been made better, and will certainly replace the theatrical version on your shelf!
B000003CKH|5.0|Just when i thought that there is no hope for new music ( after eighties )i discovered Cake, which were introduced to me through an American marine serving his duty in Slovenia, where i m coming from. Frank Sinatra is just brillant, but top of the top is the cover of I will survive with that edgy - funky rhythm at the end. The problem is that i cant get their albums in Slovenia!<BR>Cake are unfortunately completely unknown here, but that is good for me, cos i can have them all for myself...( ha ha ha )
B000089RVX|5.0|I can't believe that I'm the first to write a review for this awesome CD. Fallen is a work of art. From the Linkin Park esque &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; to the haunting strings of &quot;Imaginary&quot; this CD delivers nothing but quality from each song to the next. Amy Lee's voice is magnificent. The songs are well put together. I just can't say enough about Evanescence and Fallen. If you like &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; from the Daredevil soundtrack then this CD will be well worth your investment.
B000022TSV|5.0|Just wanted to point out that the &quot;beautiful recitatives&quot; that the previous reviewer missed were actually not written by Bizet.  The original Carmen did contain spoken dialogue which was later reworked as recitative by someone else.  (Unfortunately the the name of that someone escapes me at the moment.)   So the film version is actually a more accurate version of Bizet's opera.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love all the songs, and I'm strait myself, but it doesn't stop me from loving the songs at all. In fact, the songs after listening/concentration to what the girls say, it makes you feel as if you are them, and it makes you care less about what others think about how they feel.Now, my favoites personally, are Show Me Love,Clowns(Can You See Me Now?) and Not Gonna Get Us.
0399144137|4.0|Over the course of the past year and a half, Ive been slowly working my way through the Tom Clancy novels. Now that I have finished Rainbow Six , I only have two left. If you have read other Clancy novels, you know what kind of book this is. The pacing is somewhat faster than other Clancy novels, but nowhere near as fast as Without Remorse. Now that Jack Ryan is President of the United States, Rainbow Six switches the focus back onto CIA operative John Clark. Clark has made appearances in most of the Jack Ryan series, as well as being the focus of Without Remorse.<br />With the permission and blessing of multiple nations, John Clark is the head of a multi-national anti-terrorism group named Rainbow (Clark, being an intelligence man, has the code name of Six). Rainbow is split into two teams, one of them headed by Clarks partner and former CIA office, Domingo (Ding) Chavez. These teams are trained and authorized to respond to terrorist actions across Europe (or anywhere else in the world). As Rainbow is formed is begins to come together, there are more high profile terrorist actions. Rainbow responds, perfectly. At the same time, there is a plotline focusing on a team of scientists developing a virus to kill most of the population of the planet (yes, weve all seen that movie before, but Clancy makes it semi-believable). Tom Clancy weaves together several plotlines into a gripping narrative and makes for very interesting reading.<br />Im reluctant to put this book near the top of the list in terms of Clancys best work, but this is a very solid novel and Clancy seldom writes [poorly]. This is far from [poor] and is quite good. Definitely worth a read, if you are a fan of Tom Clancy.

B000002G23|5.0|What more could you want? Every disc is packed with great music. So nice having everything just on 4 discs. A must for any fan.
B000069AUI|5.0|Cold Play's a rush of blood to the head is and always will be one of there most memorable albums. This album was lent to me by a close relative who is also an avid music fan. I am not a big fan of todays music but after listening to this cd I am compelled to write a reveiw. To put it bluntly! This is a Great album!! Take some well written heartfelt songs and add that special spark of a string section and &quot;WOW&quot; this is what you get. These guy's really know the importance of using the piano as the main instrument to center all there music around. Some really talented musicians at play here. But in my humble opinion the keyboards and strings are what set's this band apart. Many musical influences can be heard in Cold Play's music. Beatles,Moody Blues, Alan Parsons,Al Stewart etc. This of course only adds to the charm. Song favorites: Clocks- powerful bass/drums,beautiful piano and string arrangements. God Put A Smile Upon Your Face- Fantastic everything!! Daylight- solid moving drums,Beatle's style string sounds with a hint of mystery. Green Eyes- magnificent acoustical guitar's and meaningful heartfelt vocals. This album ends with a wonderful flowing piece called Amsterdam- vocals are the centerpiece which build up nicely around various keyboards. Final thought: A magical mystery tour all it's own. Buy It!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Neither the band's name nor the album title predict the fate of Evanescence. They will neither fade or fall if they continue to release the well produced and well written material found on their major label debut. The seemless blend of metal, pop, techno, and choral vocals ala Carmina Burana twist, twirl, ebb and flow, drawing the listener into a musical landscape that is both familiar and foreign. Accessible and yet deep enough to get lost in. Amy Lee's vocals are strong, her lyrics sentimental without being sappy. Equally impressive is the musicianship of Ben Moody and John LeCompt on guitars, and the drumwork of Rocky Gray. This band reeks of too much talent, and they express it to the fullest limit on what is sure to become one of the largest albums of the year. Little Rock is Rocking Big in my book.<br />Mark, Dallas
0451207521|5.0|After I read Hornet Flight I got more interest in Ken follett's novels, this book is about brave women, who is risking their lives to blow up a Telephone system that can connect to anyone, anywhere. And it also tells about the Resistance fighters, love stories, the Gestaspo, and there everyone is talking about the Invasion. I still loves war history, but this is more than a war history.
0060254920|5.0|A great short story that children, young or old, will love to read. It connects to children's lives. It is a story that is brought forth through imagination. Children using their imagination to create their own world and what life would be like in their creative world. A Wild Rumbus in a forest filled with Things, how exciting to be apart of it. The exhilarating illustrations draws the reader to be part of the wild Rumbus. Reading the story brings out the Wild Thing within, making the reader become the character in the wolf suit. It encourages children and adults to explore and make up their own world. A truly terrific story for adults and children.
0066214122|5.0|Michael Chrichton has done it again with the amazing and hearpounding book prey! i could NOT put this book down. i finished it in about 3 days. i practically read nonstop. anyway i highly recommend this book. ENJOY  :)
B00007KQA3|1.0|I was so excited about getting this movie on DVD that I sold my VHS version (in retrospect a terrible mistake) as soon as I heard it was going to be released on DVD. The movie is a wonderful movie and timely as ever. The video transfer to the DVD medium looks very good. However, and this infuriates me, the soundtrack of the Eurythmics which complemented the orchestral soundtrack and the visuals of the movie is completely missing!!<BR>If you are going to put out a DVD, do it right and don't butcher it!! The DVD is ruined in my opinion. For those of you who have this on VHS and plan on getting the DVD version, you should hang onto your VHS copy if you enjoy the TRUE soundtrack.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Whether you're a QUEEN fan or you are new to QUEEN or you know nothing about it, this compilation is just for you.You'll get  the essence of QUEEN from this three discs.Don't miss it!
B00005JLIU|5.0|Thoroughly Modern Millie is a hilarious 1920's type comedy.  Its about a young girl in the city who wants to be \\"modern\\" and her adventures with her friends Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore) and Jimmy (James Fox).  It has everything you could ask for in a movie: laughs, music, romance, mystery, and excitement.  Although I may be a bit biased, considering I'm the worlds biggest Julie Andrews fan! She does a wonderful job portraying Millie! Very cute, not for the serious type though.  What it lacks in plot and substance, it makes up for with humor and well...Julie! A great movie, I definitly recommend it!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a great ablum. Vocals and music all come together really well and this album really does deliver. Amy Lee keeps her voice in check and is a welcome change to many other female vocalists. The vibe of the band is one of a Dark Rock genre but it is not grunge and is really tolerable. If you want some good music I would definitely suggest this album because it delivers.
B00000J6AG|5.0|First of all, those who rank this album anything less than a five haven't a clue.  This album teases the senses of all music genres.  Full of beat, soul, and sounds, Moby has proven himself a musical genius.  I cannot recall a time when so many tracks off one album (all of them if i am not mistaken) have been used for commercials and/or sountracks.  Eclectic, for sure........ingenious, without a doubt.  You will find yourself listening to this album, track after track after track.  Without a doubt, his strongest album, and easily one of the overall best albums in the last five years.
B000089RVX|5.0|In a time when most music lacks poignancy, grace, and the ability to touch someone, Evanescence arrives with an album that has taken my breath away. The lead singer's voice is very soothing, and the songs are beautiful. Take in the sounds of this band - you'll be amazed.
0393039765|4.0|I really LOVE Chuck but I thought this his least wonderful work. Maybe I have to give it another go. I didn't much care for the movie Fight Club then I read the book and I liked that a lot. SO I had to see the movie again and I loved it. Go figure. Moody isn't the right word but it's the first that comes to mind. So I highly recommend this book but I would read Choke and all Chucks others first.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is an absolutely brilliant album. I just love it so much. I've been longing for it ever since I heard it's first single 'Bring Me To Life'. Every single track on this CD is excellent and won't get you bored at ANY situation. Amy Lee's vocals are perfect for these rock melodies of tragedy and the music is by far the best that I've heard ever since Nickelback's new CD came out. This is a MUST for every rock fan out there.
B00000JG41|5.0|The first time I listened to this one, I was more than a little confused.  Was this the same Mr.Bungle that I listened to as a little kid? It sounded less like the last two albums and more like they had kidnapped the Beach Boys.  Well, hmm.  After a few listens, I didn't really care.  It was still great.  While it's quite different from their first, which is one of my favorite albums ever, this one still has that same listenability that can and WILL become an addiction.  I will admit that I miss the death metal bit, but that's just me.  There's more than enough here to make up for that little whine, and it doesn't really take away from my overall enjoyment of the album.  I'm waiting on their next one now, which based on the pattern in which they release one (every four years) should be sometime soon.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I saw this movie in a theater when it came out years ago. I've since then longed to own a VHS copy, but it never was available for under $... Glad it's coming to DVD...
B000089RVX|5.0|wow, i bought this cd yesterday and havent stopped listening to it yet.  only one word can describe this album, awesome.  their sound is almost like Linkin Park meets opera, and the two meld together flawlessly.  while the cd is rather heavy in nature, the two songs that i seem to be playing the most are the two softer songs, tracks 4 and 9.  these tracks just feature the lead singer, who has an incredible voice, singing with just a piano and an orchestra.  if you buy this cd, you will not be dissapointed in any way.
B000089RVX|5.0|I saw Daredevil on Sunday, and I have heard Bring Me to Life before, and I was thinking of buying Fallen, but I wasn't sure. Until the part in the movie ( I won't spoil it...) when the lady is singing a sad, song and I realized that it was Evanescence, I knew I had to get it. The album itself takes a couple listens to appreciate, but when you do, you'll be glad you bought it.
B000088E6M|5.0|5o Cent is a Contreversial rapper and when u get this cd u know why. He is not afraid to call his enemies out onwax and he never let's his gaurd down. This Cd is very gangsta and u will not skip one song. this is one cd that is worth ur money. The DVD is not worth ur money it is just basically concert footage photo shoots and  a interview with him on his grandmothers stoop and a brief cameo with his grandfather and his grandfather's friend. It is telling you things u already know so if they was 2 put the DVD seperate i would not have bought it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I heard the daredevil song: \\"bring me to life\\" and it was awesome, a great song.  I immediately wanted to hear her other stuff, and Amy has got it going for her.  She mixes great rock with some of that gothic type stuff, but not too much of that Gothic crap.  Evanescence still reminds me of a female version of linkin park (favorite band).  I still cant pronounce the name though, lol!
B00000AFFF|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I'm not much of an Elvis Costello follower (though I do know a great deal about Burt Bacharach from his songwriting days with Hal David and their often frequent collaborations with pre-Psychic Friends era Dionne Warwick for that matter). However, I was moved to purchase this particular album from several recommendations on here because I've always admired Bacharach's work and figured that I'd be in for a pleasant listening experience.<br />That's pretty much what I got out of this well-crafted delight. I wasn't sure what to think of Costello in this collaboration at first, but now I feel as though I should become more aware of him from this point forward. His songs are quite emotional and often display a sharp sting of bitterness throughout. Plus, the quality of his singing is actually pretty good considering how challenging it can be sometimes to interpret a Bacharach-influenced tune. He obviously doesn't knock every single one out of the ballpark, but the amount of feeling and professionalism that he vocally lends on every song can not be taken lightly, whatsoever (This House Is Empty Now, Tears At The Birthday Party, My Thief, and God Give Me Strength are just some of the ones that Costello TRULY shines on). Bacharach's knack for weaving exquisite melodies into tricky chord changes can definitely be found here for old times' sake. It's amazing how much of the classic pop-styled arrangements still hold up upon repeated listening after all these years. It just goes to show how timeless a work of art can be when it's done with heart and skill, as it was done on Painted From Memory.<br />Granted, this album is probably not for the hardcore Costello fans given the number of reviews panning his sudden direction towards more sophisticated pop stylings, nor even for the die-hard Bacharach followers who feel that such an unexpected collaboration between two widely respected yet musically contrasting personalities borders on sacrilege. But for thosewho have a real appreciation for music that's well done and doesn't insult the listener's intelligence, this album is as close to indispensable as it gets.
B000089RVX|5.0|Every song on this album is worth 5 stars. Amy Lee's vocals are amazing. Piano peices are scattered over the record and 'My Immortal' is the definite highlight. It's a must-have. =)
B00005QZH2|5.0|The exact kind of album which makes you fall in love with, if you're the type of person who constantly seeks for nice music to relax to, then &quot;Revancha Del Tango&quot; ought to be one of your first choices. With a very own and original 'nuance' over a world-famous musical genre - Tango, Gotan Project have brilliantly come up with a great variation. However, the passion of Tango is still present within the CD, combined with an extremely relaxing beat, this album definitely won't go unnoticed to all kinds of chill-out lovers. I'll be looking forward to &quot;hear&quot; from them again. :) Enjoy it as much as I do.
B000089RVX|5.0|Every song on the album is beautiful and electrifying. Amy Lee's voice is gorgeous and couldn't flow better with the music. There are paino peices through out the album that brings it a unique touch. 'My Immortal', slow and emotional, is the highlight of the record. Definitely a must-have. =)

B000089RVX|5.0|So much hype surrounding them...could they deliever? &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is the best radio single so far this year...but COULD they live up to the hype with the rest of their CD? The answer...YES. This is by far the most mature debut release from a band in recent history. Every song on &quot;Fallen&quot; is a work of art. Even if &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; didn't grace this CD with their presence...&quot;Fallen&quot; is a force to be reckoned with. &quot;Going Under,&quot; &quot;Tourniquet,&quot; and &quot;Taking Over Me,&quot; &quot;Haunted&quot;... It's all so unreal. &quot;Fallen&quot; from Evanescence proves what a debut releases can be...a work of art, worthy to stand with the rest of the music out there.
B000003TBP|5.0|When most people write about Beck they usually know exactly where to start - his diversity.  Generally regarded as Beck's best experimental album before his latest, more serious record Sea Change, as well as a general classic of the 90's.  And I don't mean experimental in an inaccessible way.  Everything here is accessible to the average listener and gloriously bizarre and interesting.  Odelay stands as a melting pot of different genres.  From the edgy opening track Devil's Haircut to the soul of Hot Wax to country on Sissyneck and rap on Where It's At, Beck defies all attempts to pigeonhole him as anything but different.<br />Although the album is highly consistent, there are several stand-out tracks, though these will probably depend on your faovured genres of music.  The New Pollution is too eclectic to be put into words, the gentle Jackass is brilliant - ending in a donkey's bray - and of course Devil's Haircut and Hot Wax are true classics.  Sampling other songs Beck eschews a variety of pop culture references so that Odelay often seems like he's taking you on a journey of pop culture of the last few decades musically.  The real credit though is that all of the songs here merge so well and Beck never comes across as being pretentious or arty.  What he's produced here is amazingly original and something that no artist, not even him, has really been able to rival.  It showcases Beck's diversity better than the previous Mellow Gold or the later Mutations and occassionally misguided but still fantastic Midnite Vultures.  With Beck set to take a more serious note - his lyrics here are often indecipherable or just plain silly - given his last album Sea Change, it's well worth taking a chance to listen to his other masterpiece.  Indeed, when seen alongside the intelligent lyrics and mastery shown on Sea Change, Beck's diversity on Odelay seems even more impressive.  This is an artist that feels free to flow free with his musical moods, sometimes even within the same songs, and Odelay is Beck at his pinnacle.
B000069KGM|5.0|Much better than the worn old vinyl 2 disc set I have. This comes packaged with the inside exactly like the original release.Rhino has really done a superb remaster here in fact there is so much here that never came through on the vinyl.If you are familiar with Chicago's later sound this is different....yes you have the wonderful brass but you have a band that is much harder rock.Very strong lead guitar amazing bass and drums.Strongly recommend when you get this you rip a copy minus &quot;free form guitar&quot; 'cause if this track comes up on your mega changer your company is going to think you are still doing acid.It is the only track on my vinyl copy that is not worn but the rest of this cd is going to provide you years of enjoyment as it has for me.
0316666343|5.0|Love filled this book. The perspective of a girl writing not from earth but from her Heaven was neat. Good characters...real as your own relatives. For how the whole book reads, don't be expecting it to change at the end with revenge either. Bring a new view to your own life and family while you are still here on earth. You may even think of those you lost, but they may not be so far away as we think. Thank you Alice! I came away with more then I began with.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|The cd is good but sorta weird.  I very much enjoyed it.  Here is a list of the songs and there ratings:<br />1. \\"Not gonna get us:-  Not a bad song.  It starts out chipmonk sonding.  The song is about two people who are in love but shouldent be.  One of the more pop sounding songs.  8/10<br />2. \\"All the things she said\\"-  The first time that I saw this video it was premiring on mtv and I thought nothing of it.  The song did grow on me but it isnt the best.  I guess this is the big hit song.  9/10<br />3. \\"Show me love\\"-  Not a bad song.  Not a great song eather.  This song starts with a russian phone call.  Then once the song starts, It goes slow.  After that, when the corus plays, it seems to speed up. 7/10<br />4. \\"30 minutes\\"- The first slow song on this cd.  If I were judging this on what I personaly thought instead of what the song really deserves, then I proble wouldent even listen to it,  but it isnt a horrable song.  I am just not into slow songs.  7/10<br />5. \\"How soon is now?\\"-  This song is the same song as the one in the opening of the wb show Charmed.  Since the show is my favorite show ever,  I just had to have this cd.  To my suprise, this song was redone very well.  Of corse I dont think it is as good as the origonal but it is very good.  It is my favorite song on the cd. 10/10<br />6. \\"Clowns(can you see me now?)\\"-  This song represents the forbidden love that the girls have and what they think of others comments of them.  Nice song.  8/10<br />7. \\"Malckick gay\\"-  One of the better songs on the album.  This song is mainly talking about how one of the girls is all the other one needs, and how she wants the other to stay with her forever.  10/10<br />8. \\"Stars\\"- This song has a russian corus and an english everything else.  It sonds like rap when they sing in rissian.  I dont care for this song. 6/10<br />9. \\"Ya shosla s uma\\"- This is the russian verison of \\"All the things she said\\" and it is about the same.  Why listen to this scince you have theenglish vesion.  There voices sound odd in this version also.  8/10<br />10. \\"Nas ne dagonyat\\"-  This is the russian verion of \\"Not gonna get us\\".  I dont care for the russain versian because I dont know Russian.  7/10<br />11. \\"Show me love (extended)\\"-  I dont get what the major differences between this and the origonal are.  They sound the same to me.  The only difference that I noticed is that there is no phone call at the beginning.  Also, if there was a song to do a extended version to, this isnt it.  7/10<br />I hope this reveiw helped you in your decition on wether to buy this cd or not.  I would deffently recommed it.  On the cd the is a enhanced versian for the computer with interveiws and a video.  Thank you for reading this.
B00003CXAA|5.0|If you're a Godfather virgin (and thank the gods!), quit reading other reviews and at least rent the movies (or very least, part I on VHS). Despite the fact the gore and violence here isn't as gut-nauteous as Final Destination II (but very intriguing) and seemed snail-paced like your grandad's opera records, the clever plot-twists, slick direction and monumental acting will reward the best three hours of your lives (or six, or even hell, almost-impossible, nine). <br />Part I gets you intrigued with the greatest mafia figure in film, Vito Corleone (&quot;I'm gonna make an offer he can't refuse&quot;) with such wisdom  and fatherly authoratian that you will regard him like a real godfather instead of a mafia head. &quot;Sonny&quot; Santino Corleone, the eldest son who is so temperental, brash and a terrible contrast of his father that you may wonder how the world will turn if he takes over Vito Corleone as the Don. Fredo Corleone is reputed to be the weakest in the family, but you must watch Godfather Part II to know further more. Al Pacino's career launched as the legendary Micheal Corleone who doesn't want to follow his father's footsteps, yet he assumes his father's position later on and became a figure that never knew would become; a colder figure than his father. Part II goes back to the roots of the Corleone family; the rise of Vito Andolini from his humble beginnings after running away from a Mafia head who wiped out his whole family. Also side-by-side with this &quot;prologue&quot; is Micheal Corleone continuing to running the family, with his paranoia of betrayals tightening his Machiavellian approach. Part III is reputed to be flop and some Godfather fanatics even recommended complete exile from Part III, yet it is just as good as &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; for Star Wars. Despite some pretty superficial acting by Coppola's daughter in potrayal of Mary Corleone, Al Pacino as the aging Don Micheal will touch your hearts at the very least and he saved themovie from being a total disaster because of dissapointing casts (where is Robert Duvall and why is elderly Tom Hagen silent throughout the movie?). Furthermore, the story is still commendable despite parallels with Part I.<br />There are some pretty personal complaints. Part II, despite the classic usual Al Pacino's performance as Micheal, feels a bit of a let down. That is because storywise, Part III is more intriguing and Vito Corleone's story lacks creativity and is downright predictable. I also had to watch the movie some three times because the plot in Micheal's story is somewhat confusing (yet still had clever plot twists). However it will be an abomination if similar dissapointment is expressed in superb casting and the terrific debutant Robert De Niro as young Vito. De Niro really mirrors Marlon Brando's elderly Vito, from the voice, characteristics to the some parallels to Brando's &quot;Cleenex&quot; cheeks! The picture quality is dissapointing, some images are downright murky and some scenes are too dark to view anything. Also, the lacking of chronological order of &quot;The Godfather Saga&quot; and my biggest complaint; overzealous reviewers spoiling the movie by revaling crucial plot-twists and even endings. Yet all of these are minor and please watch, even though you grew up being fed by Titanic, Matrix, or even Jackie Chan movies.

6304082428|5.0|If you are a fan of Jane Austen you should have no complaints with this beautiful adaption of Pride and Prejudice. The movie follows the book to the letter and allows Jane Austen's sense of humor and rich characters shine through. Partly this is due to the casting of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, as the main characters, who have wonderful chemistry. You will want to own  this one to watch over and over again. Plan for a weekend as you won't want to stop in all six tapes as the suspense grows. I applaud the BBC for a polished piece of what entertainment should be.<br />I recommend Emma Thompson's adaption of Sense and Sensibility. And for those who prefer realistic tragedy I recommend Tess of the D'urbervilles starring Justine Waddel. Also high on my list is Wives &amp; Daughters starring Justine Waddel.

1559408855|1.0|Salo:  The 120 days of Sodom is often referred to as \\"brilliant\\" and \\"haunting\\".  Why?  I really want to know why.  Would we, as a people, have paid money to watch the Nazis torture the Jews?  Would we have paid money to see the Stalinists torture and kill the Croats?  What about any other culture where torture is used as a device of pain and humiliation?    I know.  I know.  This is art, because it is based on deSade's great works - but de Sade wasn't a great author or a great man - he was a man reviled and feared.  His place in history exists because of his infamy not his fame.  To revere the man through his works is amazing.    I don't know about the rest of the civilized world, but for me, watching children eat feces and be raped and tortured at the hands of adults is not art, not matter how you dress it up or strip it down.  It's a sick endeavor.    I was given this film as a present by a friend.  I soaked the film in acetone to destroy it afterward, then I bathed and scrubbed myself vigorously trying to get the sick feeling off me.  Finally, I distanced myself from that friend - because there is no way I want to associate with anyone who would enjoy a film of such a purile and disgusting nature.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|I bought this cd after I downloaded most of the songs and thought it would be worth the cash.  I was partly right.  Out of 11 songs, I'd say 8 are worth it.  However, out of the 8, 3 are just remixes of three other songs!  The good part of the cd is the faster paced psuedo-electronica-pop-chick vocals.  However, if it had more electronica/techno, it would make those songs better.  Also, I have to say now, I'm a sucker for chick vocal techno, i.e. fiori, plummet, engelina, etc., so, I am a little biased for this album.  They're voices are very haunting and sound good, but the album is only average, because you've heard it before and only 8 of 11 songs are good.

B00000K413|5.0|After not listening to this remarkable cd for a very long time, I was prompted to return to it again after recently running into Roland in New York.  What a nice fellow he was and unfortunately I was too shy to tell him what a fan I am.  No matter, now that I've heard the album again I can literally not believe how amazing it is even after all these years.  I can recall listening to it over and over when it first came out and how it shaped my tastes in music forever.  I'd never heard anything like it and don't think I have even since.  Just a teenager at that time, the only music out there was so flat and pedestrian; I still can't figure out how TFF actually came to be in the first place.  With deep and compelling lyrics and thouroughly melodic arrangements, The Hurting is one of the best albums ever, even today.  It makes me melancholic and nostalgic to have yet another listen and be moved each and every time.
B00004U30D|5.0|the first time i saw this i wondered if it wasn't too slick. second time round, the slickness didn't seem to matter. contains superb performances all round and an outstanding script. it's funny, true and, right from the beginning, pretty subversive. anyone who's ever been a temp will have cheered when the Spacey character points out to the burger bar manager that he has burger flipping experience.<br />this is a didactic film too. in this film the bag matters! the message would seem to be that the way to live life is to drift on it, like the bag, to let life carry you, rather than impose your will on it. this is the philosophy that the Spacey character embraces and the film demonstrates him to be an enlightened man - he puts other people's needs before his own; and he's seriously chilled out!<br />the damage that occurs in the film comes from people who are too busy trying to impose their own will on life. they have forced their lives out of shape by this act, which seems to have occurred out of a desire to meet the expectations of society. the prime example is the army bloke who has bent his will on denying his sexual nature.<br />Spacey's character's wife also tries to impose her will on life and we're shown that she's wrong to do so - she takes gun classes, cops off with a man called CAINE, and returns home with a gun in the car. her attempts to control her environment bring damage to herself and potentially to others. the portrait of her as the crazy girl before she got obsessed with home furnishings and material success is much more sympathetic.<br />deeply serious then as well as being entertaining, this is a brilliant piece of film-making.
B000069AUI|1.0|completely derivative and uninteresting music, that proves that obviously most music buyers don't listen to music that closely, because they've obviously forgotten that this cd has come out by other bands about three hundred times before. this band deserves none of its hype. its utter nonsense for a band that again promotes the mass consumption of utter mediocrity. not a single good song on the album.
B00008BXJF|4.0|This album rocked, and I think it's the most definite album since 'Discipline' (1981). I've had this album since late January, so I've had quite a bit of time to listen to everything deeply.<br />The album starts off with 'The Power to Believe I: A Cappella' - a short 30-40 second lyric with distorted vocals by Adrian Belew. The rest of 'The Power to Believe' tracks (II - IV), all rock! They all start off slow, and TPTB II was my favorite of all four. The other ones are great too.<br />Next is 'Level Five', which is definitely one of the best tracks of the album. I must admit, Pat Mastelotto's drumming just gets better and better with each album. Of course, Belew, Robert Fripp, and Trey Gunn shine throughout this track and through the album.<br />The third track, 'Eyes Wide Open' (which also appeared on the 'HWWYHTBHW' EP, in an \\"acoustic\\" version), is awesome, but is not too much different from the EP version. But I do prefer this version over the EP.<br />Next, 'EleKtriK', starts off slow and quiet, but is a rocking track.<br />'Facts of Life (Intro)' and 'Facts of Life' are very heavy tracks on this album. THe only complaint here is that I don't really see the intro going anywhere, but that's just me, I could be wrong.<br />'Dangerous Curves' took awhile for me to appreciate and I first considered it a \\"dead track\\" - but after a couple listens I've learned to love it!<br />'Happy With What You Have to be Happy With' is about the same as the EP album (same title). The only difference is a few production tweaks, and the first chorus is cut out (the first 'happy with what...' lyrics).<br />Overall, this album was really awesome, and it gets 4 1/2 stars from me. If you were dissappointed in \\"the ConstruKction of Light\\", this seems like a good rebound album.

B0000057C5|5.0|Rammstein is a german band that combines heavy rock with strong lyrics and a bit of techno, thought not to much. This is, in my opinion, their best album. It includes their most popular song Du hast(You Have(and yes, its have, not hate, trust me, I know german)) It includes others of their best music like Engel(Angel) which has a good beat and overall tone. I also like Ich Will(I Will) which starts nice and slow and takes its time to work into a good pace. There are many other good songs on this Album. Its great for techno or metal fans, and becuase its in German you don't need to worry about the lyrics.
B00008IAMD|4.0|This CD is for every Johnny Cash fan - and some who aren't.  He features a number of covers (Hurt by NIN, Bridge Over Troubled Water by (originally?) Simon &amp; Garfunkle).  Certainly the most powerful hit on this CD is the Hurt cover.  Gritty and meaningful, just like Johnny has proven to be and is loved for.  You can hear his age and tiredness show through the songs - but certainly the Man in Black doesn't disappoint, but rather proves old age has only made his &quot;vision&quot; better.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I felt compelled to write a review of this film for several reason. First and foremost because this is one of my all-time favorite films. I never tire of watching this film over and over and sharing with others that have not yet had the pleasure of watching it. I also wanted to write this review because so many younger movie fans immediately dismiss older films and especially black and white films. And lastly, I wanted to put my two cents in after reading the \\"professional critic's\\" review... mis-cast??? HOW could there ever be a more perfectly, better cast film???<br />  Gregory Peck, who I had come to revere as Atticus Finch in \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" (he is the reason I wanted to become a lawyer when I was child), and Audrey Hepburn has the perfect mix of innocence and fearlessness for her role as the rebellious Princess. Even Eddie Albert as the comedic side-kick was ideal.<br />  This film follows a Princess who, at first glance, lives an enviable life of wealth and fame and glamour. I have always had a hard time finding any compassion for the complaints of similar people be it in real life or on film, but somehow Audrey Hepburn pulls it off and it is not difficult to cheer for her as she experiences such basic things as deciding how her hair should be cut and eating an ice cream. While Gregory Peck is undeniably smooth as the rogue American journalist, he also is able to pull off the needed sleaziness to make his role beleivable. You have to be able to understand his initial motivation does NOT come from a \\"good place\\", but merely out of greed and selfishness.... but then you have to also beleive his change of heart and its subtleness. And it works. He doesn't suddenly wake up and have a change of heart. You can see his transformation, or relevation as it may be, over the course of the film.<br />  As a closet romantic I have to say I always secretly hope there will be a better ending (and by \\"better\\" I do not mean in terms of movie quality. I mean in terms of a classic \\"happy ending\\"). The final scene is heart wrenching, yet the only plausible possible way it could end. I am always left wondering what the heck happened later, despite knowing full well the answer... and it isn't necessarily what we'd all like to imagine. But I respect the fact that the movie doesn't spell it out and doesn't wrap it all up in a lovely bow. Still a tear-jerker ending, but exactly as it should be.<br />Please see this movie. You will want to own it afterwards I promise. And don't be fooled, it is not just some old, out-dated \\"chick flick.\\" It's just good. Oh yeah, and that *sigh factor*... HUGE! Enjoy and share with younger audiences so this classic will never be lost to modern blockbusters.of a classic \\"happy ending\\").

B00006ZSAD|5.0|For some reason, the British music scene has been throwing out a huge number of talented bands and musicians for the last decade. Beth Gibbons threatens to steal the spotlight from all of them. This amazingly talented singer is just starting to achieve her full potential, and it is a beautiful thing to see. After two solid and unique Portishead albums, Beth Gibbons' first solo CD finds her refining her singing technique and achieving hornlike volume and consistency. On almost every track, Gibbons' uncanny ability to sing without vibrato will send chills up your spine. This is a technique that many singers don't achieve until late in their careers.<br />This entire CD is a standout, but some tracks excel. \\"Tom the Model\\" is perhaps the best example in the otherwise worn-out break-up genre ever written. Many tracks make innovative use of strings and eerie backup vocals, framing Gibbons' voice beautifully, with a beautiful horn section in \\"Tom the Model.\\" In \\"Tom,\\" Gibbons' interplay with the backup vox is simply breathtaking. At this point, the CD reaches cruising altitude and stays there. \\"Show\\" is the perfect example of Gibbons using her voice like a woodwind instrument. Not many singers could pull this off. This is what Billie Holiday was known for. But Beth creates her own sound. Some of Gibbons' vocal moves on this track are almost beyond description. This is where her maturity as an artist is becoming very obvious.<br />Gibbons answers the bell for the 15th round with the muscular \\"Funny Time of Year,\\" which should become a standard. What a great song, starting quietly and building to a fine pitch of cacophony as Gibbons wails away in front. The live tracks on the import release are another treat.<br />The production on this CD lifts it beyond the normal rock-oriented fare. Use of the live horn and string sections helps break Out Of Season into wider musical areas. I'd like to give this 6 stars. All in all, I hope we will hear much more from Ms. Gibbons.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is a very mellow album. After starting with the rocker &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, this album takes a more laid-back, folksy direction when compared to their other albums. Admittedly, some of these songs may be just a tad too mellow, even straddling boring (sorry, but I never liked Michelle), but any album with &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, and the great &quot;In My Life&quot;, can not get anything less than five stars.<br />Some reviews I've read consider this to be The Beatles &quot;misogynist album&quot;, and in a sense that's true. There's a lot of rejection songs, breakup songs, and songs where the singer is blase toward the object of his affection. This theme sees its apotheosis in the final song, &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;.<br />This strikes me as highly symbolic. The early part of their career consisted of boy-girl songs and love songs, the later had more universal themes. By making an album of mostly breakup songs, RS sounds like The Beatles trying to purge these love songs out of their system, before moving on toward the future.<br />Lennon is unfairly compared to Dylan here. Sure Dylan was an influence, but in RS Lennon finds his own voice. Lennon's genius is to describe (and induce in the listener) a powerful emotion or profound idea in simple, succinct words. Harrison also donates his two best songs up to this point, with special mention going to the shimmering guitar in &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;. McCartney delivered one of The Beatles great rockers &quot;Drive my Car&quot;, but besides that and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot;, I'm not impressed with his contributions to this album.<br />Admittedly, not for everyone. But it's certainly for me.
B00003CXXM|3.0|Matt Damon provides for a fast paced, start to finish action movie.  The characters provide a realistic and exciting look at the world of the professional assassin.  The backdrop of Europe was well done and very entertaining to anyone who has travelled.  All and all a great movie.  Unfortunately though I read the book.  The big screen adaptation is horribly different than the book.  The story was amazingly accurate of a genre some twenty years ago, since it was written in 1980.  I know the people who I watched the movie with were quite entertained.  I wasnt.  The screenplay was so different that the screenwriters should have changed the name.  Other than the names Jason Bourne, Marie, and Treadstone there is almost no similarity.  In some cases, this can be accomplished wonderfully where the Movie gives more life to a rather dull written work.  That didnt happen here.  Bottomline is that if you read the book, dont spoil your memory.  If you didnt read the book, see the movie you'll love it!
B000000OQ0|2.0|With songs like &quot;Still of the Night,&quot; &quot;Here I Go Again,&quot; and &quot;Don't Turn Away&quot; I figured this album would be one awesome album. Every song seems to be the same, all about love, but for some strange reason it only works on the above songs. The other 6 songs on the album are decent enough to listen to but they just don't rock.<br />1 great song, 2 good songs, and 6 mediocre songs do not = a good album.
B000089RVX|5.0|With 'haunting' chords and original melodies, this cd is one of the best ive heard in a long time. i love the daredevil tracks which pulled me to this cd; after those i heard the rest, and it left nothing to be desired!! a definate must have cd.
0780020685|5.0|I'm a 22 year old movie buff.  As such, I don't really have a frame of reference for this movie because I grew up with special effects-laden, plotless &quot;epics&quot; that seem to always fall short of their scope.  I didn't think there was any way I could connect with Seven Samurai, a movie made 50 years ago.  Luckily, I was very wrong!  This movie is amazing.  Although I love movies with huge battles (Two Towers and Braveheart, for example), there was something refreshing about watching a climactic confrontation between less than 100 people.  The movie is more intimate and dramatic because you get to know almost ever character who is fighting.  You care about everyone and it actually affects you when someone is killed.  The acting is great and the character development is impressive.  The parallel stories of love, honor,  family dynamics, etc work perfectly with the overarching tale of a fight for a village.  Some of the scenes and vistas are surprisingly stunning, even in black and white.  I definitely think that this movie has to be approached with a certain perspective to really be appreciated by someone my age, but it definitely rewards!  It is truly worthy of it's place at the forefront of Japanese (and world) cinema.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Every disc is worth the money!!! Simply the best war movie ever made.. Nothing will top this one. I would give it 7 stars if I could.
B000089RVX|5.0|Don't be fooled by the above references to Cranberries and Tori Amos, this is an album of hard, emotionally wrenching ROCK.  \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\" are two piano ballads that show off the amazing versatility of the band and also highlight Amy Lee's vocal talents (perhaps even more talented than Amos or the Cranberries).  Amy, Ben, and their various collaborators have written songs that are about hurt, loss, love, betrayal, redemption, death, and salvation. Ben Moody's guitar playing is exceptional, although much of the album only reveals 1/10th of what he can do.  Each and every song deserves to be a single, they're that good.  The haunting lyrics bring up powerful images in the mind, many of which linger long after the track has ended.  These images evoke serious emotions, an effect missing in much of today's popular music.<br />\\"Bring Me To Life\\" got the ball rolling for Evanescence, but is in no way the best track on the album.  Other stand-outs are \\"Everybody's Fool,\\" \\"My Last Breath,\\" \\"Whisper,\\" \\"My Tourniquet,\\" and the probably next single, \\"Going Under.\\"  The album as a whole is very tightly conceived and intricately produced with a bit of electronica, latin choral sections, and other mood-setting effects.  \\"Fallen\\" weaves a story that plays out like a tragic, but ultimately life-affirming movie.  Quite impressive for such a young group of musical talents.  Expect even bigger works in the future.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of the best new bands that I've heard in a very long time. Singer, Amy Lee, has a crystal clear, strong, powerful voice that will reach right down into your chest and wrench your heart. They move between pounding hard rock and simple piano accompaniment, and all the songs are winners. Haunting and inspiring are the best words to describe this music. <br />Standouts from the album include:<br />\\"Bring Me to Life\\" - this big radio hit is just the beginning of an amazing album.<br />\\"My Immortal\\" - another cut from the Daredevil soundtrack, this is one of the simplest songs on the album. Just Amy Lee's big voice and a piano. <br />\\"Tourniquet\\" - this is my personal favorite. This song is a desperate cry for salvation and such a moving song. There's such a tangible emotional quality to the song...it's amazing when they perform it live. Lee really takes her voice out for a spin on this track and the lyrics are fantastic. <br />\\"Imaginary\\" - another incredibly intense song. It ebbs and flows between soft instrumentation and full-on rock. It's an irresistible combination.<br />I'm amazed at the songwriting and performance on this album and will definitely be a long time Evanescence fan. They have something very special to offer and a different sound than anyone out right now. I also recommend seeing them live if at all possible.
B000002JS7|5.0|I used to listen to it all the time. I would listen all the way through one side, flip it over and listen to it, and flip it again for hours at a time. I even took it to school to listen to it, that is until somebody stole my new Sony walkman with it inside. I've been without that great album for at least 2 years now. I figure I'll get the new release of it on cassette.<br />From the beginning till the end this album is awesome. Hells Bells is so grim sounding it sometimes sent chills down my spine. Given the Dog a Bone and every other song are also great, some are slower than others while some have been played on the radio too much. After my copy got stolen it was hard for me to switch back and forth between AC/DC albums because none of them really matched \\"Back In Black.\\" Now \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" stands alone because I have nothing to switch with it.
B00005JLXC|5.0|Everything about this director's cut is better. There's more action, more story, and more Foggy. Almost every fight scene is extended. It's way more adult oriented. Don't get me wrong, I liked the theatrical cut of Daredevil, but this one blew it out of the water. The director's cut just flowed more smoothly than did the theatrical. With the added subplot, a lot is explained for that wasn't in the theatrical. There's way more of Matt Murdock lawyer by day stuff. You see Foggy and Matt a lot more in the court room. You really get the feel of lawyer by day, vigilante by night sort of thing, like in the comic book,  which really makes it a great Daredevil movie. If you haven't seen Daredevil yet, than watch the Director's Cut. If you have seen Daredevil, than watch the director's cut to see the true nature of Daredevil and the way it should have been in theaters. Damn Fox.
B000089RVX|5.0|Wow. Hearing this band for the first time on the Daredevil soundtrack, I was completely blown away by the beautiful &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; and the equally mesmorizing &quot;My Immortal.&quot; So needless to say, I was eagerly anticipating the release of this album. It did not dissapoint. From the raw &quot;Going Under&quot;, to the softer, elequent &quot;Hello&quot;, lead vocalist Amy Lee left me speechless. What is unique about this album is the way the band rocks so hard, yet still finds a place for beautiful melodies and harmonies. For those of you who have never heard of Evanescence, think of a combination between Linkin Park and Sarah Mchlachlan (Spelling?). I literally had this playing non-stop in my car CD player the first two days I got it, there is not a bad song on it! The last CD that had me listening non-stop was Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory. Anyway, enough of my babbling, because there are no words that can describe this album accurately. For a debut album, I can only imagine the heights this band can go in future endeavors. This album is a treat, do yourself a favor and pick it up.<br />Personal Favorites:<BR>&quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;<BR>&quot;Hello&quot;<BR>&quot;Going Under&quot;<BR>&quot;Tourniquet&quot;
B000000WCX|5.0|Deft use of drum n' bass, tantalizing work on keys by the master Mike Garson, Reeves at this best on guitar and the indomitable David Bowie sounding edgy, inspired and hyper active at fifty.<br />This album takes full advantage of surround sound speakers. Not sure if that was intended, but you'll discover many wonderful audible surprises along the way.<br />&quot;Little Wonder&quot; is one of the most explosive, enjoyable singles ever and Bowie's performance of it on Saturday Night Live is a memory to cherish. Good, because my VCR failed at the time.<br />This is Bowie's exploration of electronics merged with rock and he does it quite well.<br />High energy, inspiring music to move you. Great work.

B000089RVX|5.0|If you found out about Evanescence through their work on the Daredevil Soundtrack (like I sort of did), you will be amazed by &quot;Fallen.&quot;<br />You will be BLOWN AWAY.<br />You will be OVERJOYED with your purchase.<br />Rarely - if ever - does a new artist burst onto the scene with such refined, cultivated, and delicately manipulated talent. Evanescence uses every bit of their signatures from more widely-distributed tracks (including piano breakdowns, crunchy guitar chords, and ethereal female vocals) to enhance every song on their newest CD. The creative use of stereo harmonies and synthcore-style programming lends a depth to their creation unmatched by any band - old or new - that I have ever encountered.<br />If you have trouble defining Evanescence's proper place in the genres, don't feel ashamed. This CD - if nothing else - completely deconstructs the popular notions of several types of alternative rock. At times Amy's voice and David's keys play off each other in such a way that you might think you're listening to a delicious version of new age. But just when you're settling into total relaxation, Ben's guitar wails in the background or thunders to center stage with staggering fortitude. In fact, Ben's work may lead you to describe this CD as doom metal. Choose to limit Evanescence to that genre, however, and I call your attention to track 10 of &quot;Fallen&quot; ('My Last Breath'). Specifically I point out its synthesizer intro, backing strings, and the lead guitar riffs that could easily fit into a Stabbing Westward or Staind track. Clearly, Evanescence is a band that distorts definitions, upends conventions, and enthralls the listener.<br />Poetics aside, if I were forced to give Evanescence a single genre (based on &quot;Fallen&quot;) it would be Nu Metal. (Feel free to dispute this to your hearts' content.)<br />Just in case your curiosity hasn't peeked yet, I'll add one last bit of observation: 'Bring Me to Life' (of Daredevil fame) is NOT the best track on this album. It's in the upper half in quality, but there are better things to be had from a tour through &quot;Fallen.&quot;<br />&quot;Fallen&quot; has made a true Evanescence believer out of me, and I am confident it will do the same for you!<br />So, what are you waiting for?

B000089RVX|5.0|Ever since I heard the song \\"Bring Me To Life\\" (which I may add is on the DareDevil soundtrack) I knew that I had to find out as much as possible from them. This CD is absolutely marvelous!Amy Lee's voice is so haunting and amazing. She can make anything into a work of art. Ben Moody, John LeCompt, and Rocky Gray make the instrumentals come to life in a way I have never heard before. The whole band together sends chills throughout my body with their dark rock vibe. I find myself listening to every song and not disliking anything. There is definitely no going wrong with this band. If you like this I suggest you listen to many of their other songs. They have had previous albums...\\"Origin\\" being a well known one.
B00006NSGX|5.0|When Eric was recording with Cream, some of the best music I have ever heard was put on vinyl, but their live music was sloppy. Eric has spent the last 30 years perfecting his craft, and getting his band tighter and tighter. This 2001 live recording shows just how far he's come. This recording is a masterpiece. His sound is music from heaven. I don't understand how so many mediocre albums get 5 star ratings and this one only  got a 3 1/2 star overall rating. Come on people where's your taste in music? It doesn't get any better than this. If you like good music, like music was back in the sixties, this is a must for your collection. Clapton rules!
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks is about a boy named Landon Carter and a girl named Jamie Sullivan.Landon is a kind of preppy guy who one day  finally gives a chance to the un-so-popular girl, named Jamie.Soon he falls in love with her.Jamie and Landon start dating and fall in love with each other, but soon Landon finds out she is very sick.There are lots of adventures when falling in love.Jamie is my favorite character because she is loving and a caring person and because she is so much in love with Landon.<br />I can relate to the charater, Jamie Sullivan, because she is soft, sweet, pretty, down to earth, and cares about everyone like me.I have been through some of the things that have happened to her in this story.For example to let go of the one you love,and try to not be scared of what's going to happen when you leave that person for good.<br />I love this book. My favorite part of this book was how you can change someone for the best to love,learn and grow together.My least favorite part was how Jamie has to go so soon and leave at part of the story where its going to be the best years of her life ever.I  wouldn't change anything about the book.It grows with you and becomes a part of your life, as well.I definitely recommend this book to everyone.It will touch your heart.You have to read this book!!
0316096199|5.0|What a strong woman who managed to overcome her past, even with considerable obstacles.  I loved this book, it is even better than THE LOVELY BONES.  It was very difficult to put down!
B000089RVX|5.0|All of the music cd's I have through the years, I never heard a band like them befor. One word describe this band is \\"Amazing\\"!!! The music & lyric's there no words describe it. It's just amazing! It take you deep in your soul with most beautiful sounds, lyrics, & her voice. \\"What a amazing voice Amy has\\". The rest of the band what a great talent! If you haven't gotten your copy yet, what are you waiting for? You will not be disappointed.:)
B00008IAMD|5.0|This is a great CD and I highly recommend it to fans of Cash and, well pretty much anyone. It's an older Cash with an older voice and like wine, he gets better with age. Actually you can not say it's better, it is different and great in its own light. This should certainly be added  to any collection and this CD helps everyone rediscover a legendary singer.
B000063UR2|4.0|Finally bought the DVD - very impressed. One the main reasons I never fell in love with Legend was the shortness of the US theatrical release which left major gaps in the plot. I also NEVER liked the Tangerine Dream score, especially that dreadful song at the end. I liked the theme and the basic plot. Who could not love the dance and Darkness himself. The only pleasing Tangerine Dream music is the dance itself. <br />Jerry Goldsmith's score opens the film to new dimensions. It brings a classic feel to the story. Lily always presented herself as a snob - we now know why. She was a spoiled princess. Hence the haughty look she threw Jack as she approached the unicorns. I personally enjoyed her singing. She is not the greatest singer, but that would have been too much. She sings like an innocent young girl. Her character fleshed out considerably in the full version. In the US release, Jack and Lily are shown kissing - a lot - in the beginning which clearly undermines the idea that she is 'innocent'. The full cut lets them be the children they are meant to be, which is why it must as it does.<br />We learn why Gump has such an annoying and clearly dubbed voice in Ridley Scott's commentary. The making-of portion is very enjoyable. I did like having both movies side by side. It clearly shows how the original cut is better. It's very mysterious and spooky to never see Darkness until Lily does herself. <br />I say - buyt it.
B000002UWP|5.0|I'm afraid I don't know much about their previous albums, but I grew up with this tape in my dad's car for years and have never grown tired of it. One of the most upsetting things when I was 13 was when my dad got a new car and put the tape in the new car. And it chewed it up. So I searched in vain for 6 months for it on cd and finally found it hidden in hmv! All I can say its my favourite and album and always a must for long car journeys.
B00003CXI1|5.0|EXTREAMLY WONDERFUL story.  Its engaging and fun.  I highly reccomend it and the books are even better. <br />Great story thats up there with The Wizard of Oz and the Chronicals of Narnia.
B000089RVX|5.0|What can I say about this band?  They absolutly ROCK!!  They remind me alot of Garbage with their moody attitude.  At times they are quiet and brooding, and all of a sudden will pull the carpet out from you and land some really good riffs that make you just want to headbang like crazy!  As I said in the title, this is the first time in a long time that I've actually wanted to buy a CD, when most CD's nowadays have only 2-3 good songs, I feel like my money was well spent on this album.  If you like Garbage, Linkin Park, or similar style music, you WILL love this CD, I guarantee it!!
B00005JKZT|5.0|I have been, and always shall be, a Tolkein fan, having first read the Lord of the Rings in 1967 and at least once a year since then.  But .... I also have enjoyed the movie version of LOTR as another story, not totally true to the original story, just another story loosely based on the original.  In an of itself, it is enjoyable, but it has certainly driven me back to enjoy the \\"truth\\" of the story, back to the books themselves.<br />By themselves, the movies are great.  Some of the best fantasy story telling ever.  The locales, and the blend of computer generated and real characters are almost seamless.  The story can be enjoyed without noticing changes from \\"real\\" to computer generation.  The movies can stand alone (well, actually as three parts of a whole) for enjoyment, quality and excitement.  But, as has been mentioned before, are not totally true to the books.  For that, you must pick them up and enjoy the life's work of a word master.
B00003OSU4|5.0|From the very beginning of the documentary, one can see the creative license of the producers by focusing the cameras on the sun-baked, glistening ocean scene of Newport. This brings us back to a much more simple and appealing era. The color of this movie is vivid for its time and the music of jazz is very intoxication. I loved the way the cameras showcased the legendary artists of this era. Some were great for only that time but others, like Mahalia Jackson reveal why her appeal was  and still is breathtaking, never to be forgotton nor possible to immitate. Mahalia sang her heart out and with such humility,  looks at the waves of applause from jazz enthusiasts ,who were captivated by her dynamic performance and very humbly declares with a motherly wit \\"You make me feel like I'm a Star\\" Mahalia was more than a Star and she did not even know it. Jazz enthusiasts and gospel fans..this is one you do not want to miss!!!<br />Noel Serrano<br />Mahalia Jackson Group<br />Hi 5 Networks<br />Join today!
B000075BFK|5.0|As a Hip Hop fan I am always eager to hear any new/unreleased material from 2Pac.  With 'Better Dayz', you get a mixture of songs that remind you of Pac from his 'All Eyez on Me' period with current street flava's.  I strongly recommend this album to any Hip Hop fan who appreciates rap music (this album is better than most if not all current rap albums on the billboard? Dont believe me? Listen to the following  'Still Ballin', 'My Block remix', 'Thugz Mansion', 'U Can Call', 'Changed man', 'Who Do U believe in', 'They Dont Give A F*** About us' and 'Fair Xchange' to name a few.  Go out and buy this!!
B00005NOOH|5.0|This set has ALOT of information! I'm on disk one and I've learned more then I thought I knew. Pick this set up if you want something good on WWII!
B00005JLZL|5.0|Extremely powerful movie about an ideologically committed, but broken, man and his friends. Well-executed and beautifully acted by Spacey and the rest of the cast.
B00005OAIE|5.0|First, let me say that I am quite surprised at the negative reactions to this CD.  I think it is wonderful, warm, and young, and find nothing wrong with that.<br />I have been a Beatles fan my whole life, and this, frankly, sets the bar rather high when it comes to new muscial acts.  John Mayer is only one of a handful I would put in this catagory with the Beatles.  No, he is not experimental, but he's young.  I don't think you have to be muscally mature at 25, because you are still a baby.  I am looking forward to a long career for John and many, many more great songs.<br />The songs on this CD are wonderful.  No Such Thing is an song I wish existed in when I was in high school.  It's final verse it a great payoff.<br />Why, Georgia, Why?, contrary to the top review, does stir.  I feel it captures the the constant questioning of identity that really is what your 20's are about.<br />Your Body is a Wonderland is beautiful and sensous.  And the way he delivers the line &quot;and bubblegum tongue,&quot; is wonderfully retro.  The poetry is also quite lovely.  Right up there with And I Love Her, IMHO.<br />As for the complainer about 83, yeah, it does sound like an old luchbox got thrown away and that inspired this song, about wishing to be six again when the world SEEMED so much simipler.  I think it is cool that he left the inspiriation for the song right in there.<br />Finally, the melodies he writes are as catchy.  He pays simple homage to his influences (note the line &quot;the sounds of sirens&quot;) and this seems to have been mistaken for a lack of originality.  Just remember, the Beatles did a lot of covers in there early days, they learned their lessons well and went on to be the teachers.  I think John has this same potential.
0609610570|1.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book after having the privilege of hearing Larry Bossidy speak.  However, the book was a HUGE disappointment to me, so much so that I shelved it after 80 pages.  It was terribly written by both contributing authors.  Frankly, there was no need to write this book at all. The premise was so simplistic that I gained no more knowledge about execution in business than I had before reading it.  Having just earned my MBA, I had been exposed to so many great business books during the course of my studies.  I am glad that this book never showed up on any of my reading lists.<br />Take my advice and don't bother buying this book, if you have an ounce of intelligence, you will come away saying &quot;why did I waste my time with reading this&quot;.
B00005JKZT|2.0|I love Tolkien. And I love 'The Lord Of The Rings', which is exactly why ridiculing the book pisses me off. 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' was a thoroughly great movie, but the same cannot be said about 'The Two Towers'. <br />'The Two Towers', apart from being pretty boring (unlike the book), also manages to leave to boundaries of good taste, as can be seen most vividly in the scenes with ents and Gimli. The ents (who are, by the way, almost sacred creatures for every Tolkienist), instead of being portrayed as wise, are depicted as overwhelmingly stupid. Gimli is depicted as a clown, which is also absolutely unacceptable, considering he is a part of the fellowship. I definitely didn't expect seeing things like this after seeing the first movie.<br />I also don't see what's the point in showing Aragorn's dreams (???) or concentrating on Liv Tyler's bosom for several seconds (not to say it's not interesting, but what does it have to do with anything?). Still, what I missed the most in the movie was the spirit of Tolkien, which WAS present in 'The Fellowship'. There is none of it here.<br />I suppose I will go see the third movie, but only in hopes the producers will have learned from their mistakes...
B00000JPYD|5.0|Trowers the man<BR>a must have for the title cut, Lady love,<BR>day of the eagle, and my favorite..... fool and me
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm not big on listening to CDs straight through, but I could listen to this one all the way through REPEATEDLY.  <br />Yes, it's that good.  <br />The lyrics are poetic and flow like water.  The music stomps, tiptoes, crawls, and dances.  Amy's voice, believe it or not, is arguably even more beautiful than she is.<br />Favorite tracks: &quot;Everybody's Fool,&quot; &quot;Tourniquet,&quot; &quot;Imaginary,&quot; and &quot;Whisper.&quot;<br />I didn't include &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; or &quot;My Immortal&quot; to the list, because, let's face it, it should just be common knowledge how amazing those songs are.  (Thank you, Daredevil.)<br />Don't neglect yourself.  No matter your musical taste, Fallen will be stuck in your CD player for weeks.
B000089RVX|5.0|This Cd Rocks, I would like to say every song on this album is good even though there are only 11 songs.  In my opinion the songs which make it stand out are Bring me back to life, and Tourniquet. There is 2 slow songs which are also good and Amy lee's voice really shines in them: My Immortal &amp; Hello  .  If you buy this CD you won't regret it. It's worth it.
B00005JLF5|5.0|This is the first season of what I believe to be the most interesting Star Trek Series created. Unquestionably the most action ever found in a Star Trek series ever. The series that even a non-treky will appreciate.<BR>The first season may not hold the best episodes of DS9, but has the clasics. where you see the characters develope into who they are in the later ones. You get to see how the relationship between the Bajorins and the Federation develops, to see how it all began, and to see how the charactors really work.<BR>The best episodes would have to be Captive Pursuit, The Nagus, Vortex, Battle Lines, The Storyteller, and In the Hands of the Prophets. These are also the most influential to the comming seasons. I hope you enjoy the seasons as much as I do and be sure to make them a part of your collection.
6305327041|4.0|I was up late on night and this was the only movie on. As I started watching it I thought it was the dumbest movie I ever saw. But, As he moved on to the 3rd room I almost peeed my pants (LOL). It stayed the dumbest but, became most hillarious movie I ever saw. Tim Roth truely made this movie. MaDonna on the other hand.. well, see for yourself.
B00002E285|5.0|I am stunned by any review that claims this film is a failure in any way.  Director Alan Parker wisely puts the famous soundtrack up front, and rarely interrupts it with any dialogue at all.  In fact, most of the dialogue is also found on the double-LP set that inspired the film, back before CDs were the prevalent form of musical media.<br />This film and accompanying music are an attempt to explain and understand the rise and fall of Syd Barrett, original founder of Pink Floyd, a mentally unstable young man who unfortunately indulged in mind-altering drugs and is now out of touch with reality.  According to band members, Barrett lives in a house in a small town in England, is cared for by friends and family, and occasionally leaves his house and makes a sad, public spectacle of himself in one way or another.  The equally classic \\"Dark Side Of the Moon\\" LP is another glorious musical collection that focuses on the kind of madness that Barrett sunk into, although \\"The Wall\\" is more specific and oriented around one individual.<br />In any event, the film begins with the birth of \\"Pink\\" and the death of his father in WWII, follows briefly through his childhood with a smothering mum, abuse at the hands of cruel schoolmasters and the British education machine, and into his adulthood as the leader of a successful rock band.  He slowly loses his mind, relating his fame and the fans' mania toward him to a Hitler/Nazi type of self-image, and the imagery fits the music and theme perfectly.<br />It is impossible to listen to \\"The Wall\\" the same away after seeing the film.  Its occasional dark humor and generally dark characterization are ultimately shattering to the viewer who is paying attention, and that's the point.  Parker & the Floyd did a fabulous job of translating the subject matter to film, which is something nearly impossible to do.  Be warned:  It is not an \\"upper.\\"  You will be bummed at the conclusion of the film.  But then, Pink Floyd has never been known for happy themes.
B0000640SA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie for it's uniqe chronology, and for the numerous other reasons I'm sure have already been mentioned here.<br />I do, however, need to complain about the ridiculous nature of the \\"Limited Edition\\" DVD.  Making me navigate through numerous menu screens answering multiple choice questions to find the content is not my idea of good interface design.  If you must do this give me an option to see a real menu.  I had to find a website that \\"decodes\\" the stupid menu system to know if I'd watched everything on the DVD--I hadn't.  I don't think I should have to crack the Rosetta Stone to watch a movie I've paid for.<br />However, if you really like the movie, like I do, you may have to get the Limited Edition to watch the movie in chronological order.  To do so go to the sixth question in the clock choice and put the pictures in reverse order.<br />Enjoy.
B00005R62N|3.0|If this was really a live recording, its the best ever. If it was totally re-recorded in the studio, shame on you, Judas Priest!
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is one of the best I have heard since californication, but it has to be said, if John Frusciante wasn't there to play guitar, it wouldn't be the same. He has helped produce some the chili peppers best work. Rock on my friend! Rock on!! All of the peppers clearly Rule.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard the single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, I was immediately taken by surprise. I heard a dark, guitar-driven music much like early Nine Inch Nails and current Linkin Park, but, what's this - with the haunting vocals of a female (Amy Lee)?!  This duo out of Little Rock is about to explode on the scene in 2003. I had the pleasure of seeing them play live here in Chicago, and what a show they put on! With their heavy guitars, excellent use of sampling, light echoing pianos and even some orchestral music (with some background choirs even), you will be drawn into their dark (yet NOT depressing like Marilyn Manson) world. From the openings track &quot;Going Under&quot; to the last chorus on &quot;Whisper&quot; you will live in their world, if only briefly, a world I didn't want to leave. Standout songs to check out are &quot;Bring me to Life&quot;. &quot;Tourniquet&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot;. FALLEN is quite a debut album, one of hopefull MANY to come from this talented duo. Finally something to talk about from Arkansas besides Bill Clinton!
1558908382|5.0|One of the few comedies that doesn't feel like you're being spoon-fed joke after joke.  Grosse Pointe Blank sets you up with the obvious comedic ploy of a hitman returning to his high-school reunion, but that's where the obvious stops.<br />The movie is about Cusack's character coming to grips with emotion.  Not his emotions necessarily but emotion as a concept, and how it pertains to reality.  He feels it nagging at himself but is unsure or unwilling to admit what it is.  His homecoming is a return to where he left that part of himself behind.<br />Cusack's character begins to see himself as justified as he keeps running into people and situations that illustrate the absurdities of everyday &quot;normal&quot; life.  Through his old girlfriend and a few others, however, he begins to see the importance of connecting with people.<br />The ending device is rather contrived, but it was really the only way to advance the plot, and very very few movies can hope to escape some contrived story element to make a movie a contained package.<br />Grosse Pointe Blank has just enough ethical conflict, humor, action, and intelligence to make it a very entertaining movie without bogging itself down in anyone of the above too much.
B0000029DD|4.0|Jeff Buckley is one of many artists whose life was cut short by a sudden and tragic death, and who had a promising future. \\"Grace\\", his one and only album that he put out during his brief life, is an album chockful of grace and sadness. I never thought about it until I recently put in his cd how much Jeff sounded like a young Robert Plant, especially on the opening track \\"Mojo Pin\\". Jeff had quite an incredible vocal range, and obviously he got it from his late, estranged father Tim Buckley. The first time I listened to this cd, I wasn't so sure what to make of Jeff's high-pitched vocals but the more I listened to \\"Grace\\", the more I became accustomed to his unique vocals. I really enjoyed the title track \\"Grace\\" a lot because Jeff manages to restrain his vocals. His cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" is a stunning masterpiece. IMO there are only two artists whose Leonard Cohen cover songs surpasses the original, Tori Amos (\\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\") and Jeff Buckley (\\"Hallelujah\\"). VH1 used Jeff's cover of \\"Hallelujah\\" for a moving sequence when the terrorist attacks occured on September 11, 2001. That song fit the mood at the time. My personal favorite song off \\"Grace\\" has to be \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\". \\"The Last Goodbye\\" is another favorite song off the album. Rather ironic coming from Jeff. I haven't been really interested in the cds released after his passing. I don't think they are able to capture the magic that I hear on \\"Grace\\". For singer/songwriter fans, I definitely recommend checking out \\"Grace\\" it is a classic in my book.
B00008BXJF|4.0|This is a heavy album, and (for me) it heralds the maturation of this configuration of King Crimson. Of particular note is the degree to which Pat Mastelotto's percussion performance sets the tone of this disc. This is especially true when one takes into account that this rapidly revolving polyrhythmic battery of sequenced textures and acoustic and electronic drumming is the fruition of a considerable amount of live performance to similar effect. Overall, a more aggressive production makes its presence known as well, and the back line of Pat and Trey Gunn moves to the fore at times, even against huge raw guitar sounds from Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew. A new reference point for the \\"Crimson\\" ballad presents itself in \\"Eyes Wide Open\\", and the group never fails to carve intricate sonic details to delight the discerning ear. Borrowing (can one borrow from oneself?) lyrically at times from earlier Belew solo work and melodically from Fripp's work with David Sylvian, it is pointillism with ball-peen hammers and ice-picks, and as such may require a bit of stepping back to see the whole work.
B000002ADT|5.0|I'm 16 i love jazz and this has to be one of my favourite albums of all time. Everysong on there is a stantdard now, if u don't have this album and you are reading this page (you clearly are looking into buying it), BUY IT!! don't wait get it now!
B00008BXJ6|5.0|&quot;High Voltage&quot; was one of the first albums I purchased when I was in Junior High School.  I finally decided to replace my pop filled album copy with this newly minted remaster.  It sounds great especially without all the pops from my album version.  The US release of &quot;High Voltage&quot; was an eye opener in 1976 for the unknowing US buyers.  The Young brothers unleashed their patented blues/boogie riffs on the unsuspecting stateside public still accustomed to singer-songwriters.  The catchy riffs eventually became favorites of rockers everywhere.  The album is actually a compilation of two albums issued earlier in their Australian homeland &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;TNT&quot;.  &quot;High Voltage&quot; also features original bass player Mark Evans along with long time drummer Phil Rudd. Bon Scott's vocals provide a boozy swagger missing from the current version of the band fronted however admirably Brit screamer Brian Johnson.  The set contains a number of classics like &quot;It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'N' Roll)&quot;, and &quot;Live Wire&quot;.  My own personal favorites are the double-entendre filled &quot;The Jack&quot;, &quot;TNT&quot; with its &quot;Oi! Oi! Oi!&quot; chant and &quot;High Voltage&quot;.  The other tracks are also interesting. This is one of their best albums especially from the period when Bon Scott was in the band.  The new disk also contains a link to a website with more information about the making of the album, pictures, tour dates from their tour to promote &quot;High Voltage&quot; and other interesting items for fans of the band.  <br />My only regret other than the first song being edited is that no bonus tracks were included from either the original Australian release of &quot;High Voltage&quot; or &quot;TNT&quot; the other Australian only release that some of the tracks on the US version of &quot;High Voltage&quot; were taken.  Some of these cuts are still not released in the United States.  <br/>The remastered version also contains new expanded liner notes and photos including copies of the Australian covers of &quot;High Voltage&quot; and &quot;TNT&quot;.  This is the album that started it all. The rest as they say is history. The Young brothers riffs carry the day along with the vocals of Scott.  It is appropriate that this instantly recognizable band will be inducted into the Rock 'N' Roll Hall Of Fame.
B00008BXJF|4.0|I'm not going to give a full review of every song on this cd, because I just purchased it today, and like any King Crimson offering will require multiple listenings to fully digest and appreciate.  At first blush a good portion of the cd is the crunching, heavy KC sound that originated on the Red album nearly 30 years ago.  Frankly, that is not my favorite side of King Crimson, and this description applies to the tracks Level Five, Elektrik, and Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With.  However, there are three tracks that I immediately LOVE at first listening.  Eyes Wide Open is a melodious, delicate (by Crimson standards) vocal offering by Adrian Belew which holds up alongside Frame By Frame or Walking On Air, a sound which was unfortunately absent from the last KC album, The ConstruKCtion Of Light.  The Power To Believe II and Dangerous Curves are flatly two of the best songs that KC has EVER done, by any line-up.  TPTB II begins very quietly in a style similar to the beginning of Larks Tongues In Aspic Part I, and develops with a guitar theme similar to The Sheltering Sky.  When two songs can give me goose-bumps on the first listen, I know they will only get better with time.
B000084T18|3.0|I have to say... this was the most hype I've heard about an album in a long time. I have it, and it doesn't impress me much. There are a few tight songs here, my favorites being Patiently Waiting, In Da Club, Back Down, and 21 Questions. Everything else is pretty average... I will say he's had a hard time, but to compare this to Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, and Ready to Die? No, no... those are CLASSICS... this is not a CLASSIC by ANY means... it's good to have because it's hot, but will they be talking about Get Rich or Die Tryin' the way they are the aforementioned albums 10 years from now?
B000089RVX|5.0|How has this band been so little know for so long is completely beyond me... every song on this album is amazing.  Amy(the lead singer)'s voice is so amazingly suited for the music...and you just can't get the songs out of your head.  Some are your traditional rock songs, others are insightful slower songs...but you can feel the emotion in each.  If you are considering getting this, dont wait any longer.  Truly amazing, 2 thumbs up.
0767853636|3.0|Based on the comic strip, \\"Little Orphan Annie\\" which later became a Broadway show that, of course, finally became a big budget movie, \\"Annie\\" is the 1981 musical from producer Ray Stark and director John Huston.  Odd, that neither had much experience with the musical genre until this film.  Some of their inexperience shows up on the screen.  The dance numbers are butchered in the editing and some good talent, though competent in their roles, are wasted nevertheless with a genuinely simple handling of the subject matter.  But what about the transfer - Columbia has made the film available in both full frame and the original widescreen format, enhanced here for 16X9 televisions.  For the purposes of film purists, this review will concentrate on the widescreen version of the film.  Colors are rich and nicely balanced.  Blacks are sometimes weak but nothing that leads to any great disappointment.  However, there are some framing issues, specifically during the \\"Let's Go To The Movies\\" musical number in which it appears as though someone has accidentally reframed a full screen version of this sequence, instead of using the 2:35:1 aspect ratio image.  Actor's heads are cut off and there is some interfield jittering as the camera pans to capture the action.  Otherwise, the rest of the film appears to have the proper widescreen image framed.  The ending of this movie is still its best part, with a gala party at the Warbuck's mansion yielding rich colors and bold blacks.  Fine grain, dirt, chips and scratches inherent in the original camera negative are visible but not distracting.  Some scenes are softly focused but again, these are brief. The stereo soundtrack 2.0 is ample but scratchy in spots and strident with a slight hiss in others. No great shakes overall but still worth the price for those who truly love this tuneful, though at times top heavy, musical motion picture.  As pure film, this version is still better than Disney's direct to video remake.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought the CD last night at midnight fresh out of the box it was shipped in and have listened to it half a dozen times since then.  All the songs are beautiful and saturated with talent; not one leaves you with the feeling that it could have been done any better and Amy Lee's voice is as powerful, beautiful, and haunting as ever.  This group has to be the best thing to ever come out of the state of Arkansas.  ^_~
B00003CXAE|2.0|\\"Grease\\" is the phenomenally successful musical that made John Travolta a legend, put Olivia Newton-John on the US pop charts and brought hot pants back into vogue. It's the seventies slant on fifties pop culture and it moves like gangbusters. The songs are \\"electrifying\\" and the energy generated by all of the cast members is \\"greased lightning\\". Unfortunately, Paramount has given us the film in a really lack luster edition that is doomed to disappoint from the start. The print, although restored, exhibits grain, dirt and digital grit, along with aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement problems that really distract from the presentation of this film. There's also a couple of curiosities. Watch for the scenes that take place at the malt shop between Danny and Sandy. All the background ads (presumably Coke or Pepsi advertising) has been digitally altered or blurred so that it can't be made out. Like the Warner release of \\"The Devil's Advocate\\" one can only assume that whatever was hanging on those walls, Paramount did not own the rights to and was thus forced to do some digital manipulation to satisfy a law suit before releasing the movie to home video. The manipulations are obvious and horrible, drawing attention to themselves with aliasing, hard edges or halos appearing around characters as they walk back and forth in front of the obscured art work. The audio has also not been well represented. Dialogue is strident, scratchy and soft while the musical numbers explode from the 5.1 mix with too much bass and side channel information that drowns out the lyrics represented in the center channel of one's home theater system. Extras? - true to its penny pinching, Paramount gives us the same old tired featurette that accompanied its laserdisc release. That's it. All of Paramount's marketing has gone into hailing this disc as \\"The one that you want, the way that you want it.\\" I assure you, this isn't the case.
0385335482|5.0|This book is very awesome. I saw its curious & cute cover in the bookstore and picked it up during a travel. I couldn't put it down and had read it three times in two weeks. I just love Becky Bloomwood!!!! With every situation, with every event, with every shopping thought, I saw myself, and it is a hilarious book to realities of shopping and the female mind! Not that we are all superficial and only think of shopping, but this does explore that humorous side that is so important in all us females. Every female can relate to Becky. I recommended it to a friend and she saw herself in Becky within the first two pages! It's so modern and in today's times, I can just picture this book becoming a movie someday - a chick flick I would definitely see! Seeing Becky Bloomwood throughout the series is great. Her character develops more and more with each series. Although there are some points int he character that becomes annoying, I'm sure we all find some of our own flawes annoying enough. I cannot put the book down, even though I've read it more than a few times!
B00005RRG9|3.0|This delightful family film is full of engaging performances and beautiful photography that really makes me wish that Disney would commit themselves to making more live action family fair like this today. It also makes we wish that they had done a better job on remastering this Disney classic on DVD.<BR>Haley Mills plays twins, separated at birth but determined to get their divorced parents back together after they find one another at summer camp.  <BR>The transfer (thank heavens!) is anamorphic widescreen.  But the image is often pixelated and riddled with annoying dirt, scratches and color inconsistencies that are inherent in the \\"split screen\\" process shots (the technical term used to make two people appear out of one) in particular.  Yet this problem could most certainly have been minimalized or even corrected using today's digital wizardry. Sadly, we don't get that kind of committment from Disney Inc. so we're stuck with a print that at times is very harsh to look at.  Overall, colors are weak, though consistent.  Black levels are low and contrast is at times wanting. Audio, though dated, is nevertheless well represented. For extra features, Disney Inc. gets an \\"A\\" plus, plus.  There are documentaries, interviews, short subjects, musical tracks and a host of other interesting offering that really make the film come alive.  With all this thought and attention to extras, why wasn't more done with the actual print.  Ho-hum!
B000005Z0E|5.0|This was 2Pac's debut album, and it was definitely a great start to one of raps' most influencial artists. On this set, he really just lets his feelings show, in a way he likes best. This is definaely a classic album, and it needs to be remastered, the volume of recording is quite low, but never the less, it is still great.<BR>The second track, is Trapped. He talks about the government trapping him in the ghetto, and not being able to see the world, and what it has to offer him, but whitnessing violence on the streets. He says, 'They got me trapped in this prison of seclusion, happiness living on the streets is a delusion. <BR>It was one of the singles released from this album.<BR>...he really lets his feelings explode. The intro to the song talks of his friends getting jacked by the police, for stupid reasons. He talks of racism, by the public and government. He gives a story of when he tried to buy some chips to eat, but being watched by the store owner, because he is black. He mentions in the song that he aware of the conditions of America, 'Mama said there will be days like this, but I'm pissed coz it stays like this.'<BR>'Violent' and 'Brenda's Got A Baby', are probably the songs where he shows his greatest lyrically ability. In violent he talks about him and his friend being jacked by the police, because they didnt obey a curfew, it then turns into a gun fight. In Brendas's Got A Baby, we see the emotional side of Pac, where he talks about the life of a 12 year old teenage mother, trying to make it in life, after being kicked out on to the street by her family. He talks about her relationship with her cousin who left her when she was pregnant, passed her being kicked out, then to her having to resort to prostitution, then being killed.<BR>Words of Wisdom, he talks about reacism by the government, and how we as black people must oppose the racism, and not be victims to it. He talks about violence, being the only way, in some cases. He says, \\"No Malcolm X in myhistory text<BR>Why is that?, Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks<BR>Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?<BR>He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek<BR>I don't get it...\\"<BR>In the last track, he talks of his mother doing a part time job of being a mother to him. It is really deep.<BR>Overall, this album is incredible, and is one of the best debuts by a rap artist, ever. It is great, this is where we see Pac at his political self, addressing all matters he sees necessary to address, eg. Racism towards blacks, and fighting for freedom, etc. If you dont have it, you need to buy it, because you are missing out one of the top 3 rappers of all time's early years, where he wasnt afraid to show his true feelings, and what turned him into the man he was.
B000089RVX|5.0|Get this album..their music is deep and can touch you!give a change to this group..soon they will be famous all around the world!
B00002Z88D|5.0|After 15 years of success in the music buisiness, Metallica joined with The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra to record &quot;S&amp;M&quot; a two disc, live album with their greatest hits. Two hours of Metallica would have beem excellent in itself, but the two groups made rwo very different musical field collide. The music on this disc is truly unmatched by other discs. The towering sound of one of the greatest orchestras and the full-throttle metal of one of the greatest bands met on &quot;S&amp;M&quot;. This created one of the best live albums ever recorded!
B000005RYQ|5.0|For many artists, it seems, the US always gets the short end of the stick (literally) when it comes to greatest hits cd's.  On this cd, you get all the same songs that are on \\"Every Breath You Take - The Classics\\", minus the song \\"classic rock\\" remix of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and the 1986 version of \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\", which is not an improvement on the original.  Instead, you get \\"So Lonely\\", \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\", \\"Tea in the Sahara\\", and my personal favorite \\"Synchronicity II\\".  Now if it just had \\"Driven to Tears\\", it would be perfect!
B000089RVX|5.0|That's the only word that comes to mind and it doesn't do them justice.  I haven't even heard this band's CD yet, but I saw them live in concert about two hours ago &amp; now I'm ordering the CD.  Amy Lee's vocals are both emotional and mesmerizing, backed perfectly by brilliant guitar work from Ben Moody.  Their songs weave an intricate spell, often blending soft piano and raging guitars seamlessly into an increadible ballet of sound.  This is a CD that no rock fan should miss.  Their name may mean &quot;disappearing into vapor&quot;, but this band will certainly not be doing any such thing.  I can't get enough and I can't wait for their next release.
B000002UB3|5.0|(This refers to the LP version, with Side 2 beginning at &quot;Here Comes the Sun.&quot;)<br />Side two of Abbey Road is, to me, the culmination and pinnacle of the Beatles' creativity.  The Sun King/She came in through../Polythene Pam/Mustard &quot;medley&quot; is as eclectic as it gets, yet manages to remain cohesive.  'Here Comes the Sun' is my favorite Harrison song, and is beautifully orchestrated.  'Because' is the finest display of vocal harmonies ever recorded by the Beatles, and rivals that of any other pop artist I know of.  <br />Side One is a different story.  &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is one of the most annoying Beatles' tunes of the latter years.  It sounds like a White Album reject.  It is brilliantly arranged, like everything from Rubber Soul on, but there is something infuriating about the very core of the song.  &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; is, well.. it's a Ringo song; whatta you expect? Again, an incredible display of colorful instrumentation, and some cutesy harmonies, but it stinks of Ringo.  Luckily, side One has its savior, &quot;I Want You,&quot; which sounds like no other Beatles song -- a real sly song, almost Creamesque, but with a good singer.  &quot;Oh Darling&quot; and &quot;Come Together&quot; are two classics, but not as strong as anything on side two.  &quot;Something&quot; is great, but its forever spoiled in my mind by the image of a fat Elvis singing it incessantly in Las Vegas. ('Something in her smile she knows.. Thank you very much..  That I don't need no other lover..')<br />Just for side two, this album requires five stars.. It is one of the required Beatles albums, and shows the Beatles at their very finest.. It also shows them on their descent, and includes some tunes that should have been saved for B-sides or archives, or else thrown onto Let it Be..  But we can forgive those flaws and appreciate the perfection that they achieved, unmatched by any other musical artists.  (except radiohead...)
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is one of the best released recently!  From the time I heard &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; on the radio, I knew this was a band going places.  The beginning of the album starts with a hard rock, &quot;Going Under&quot;, and finishes with &quot;Whisper&quot; - a song that starts with a very Creed-like intro, but finishes standing higher... ;-)<br />The piano ballad &quot;Hello&quot; shows that the band can bring their sound down to the quiet, contemplative tone, and &quot;Haunted&quot; continues their gothic-rock feel.<br />Amy Lee can sing anything, and I would be impressed - her voice is angelic, and she is one of the few female vocalists that can pull off an alternative rock sound and still be appreciated as a vocal talent.<br />I highly recommend this album, and eagerly await their next release!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I loved this movie, and I think you will too.  This movie stands on it's own against even the best American blockbusters.  This movie is not just for Anime buffs.  In fact, I have yet to meet anyone who saw this movie and didn't like it.<br />The plot of this movie is simple, it's about a young girl brought to a mystical land and her journey there.  However, the beauty of this movie is not in the plot, its in how this plot is brought to life through the characters and scenes of this movie.  Each scene is skillfully crafted and filled with emotion.  The detail is simply amazing.<br />The only tripping point about this movie, perhaps it's only flaw - but even then not significant - is it lack of explanations.  This world in which the girl, named Chihiro, enters is never really explained in the story.  This isn't a bad thing though, once your swept up in the world it won't really matter why it is there.  In fact any explanation of the world might have ruined the story.  It's suppose to be foreign and mysterious.<br />If you love cinema, you owe it to yourself to check this movie out.
B000089RVX|5.0|I had no clue this band existed until I saw Daredevil, as soon as I left the theater I went and bought the soundtrack. I fell in love with Evanescence, there cannot possibly be a better album of the year. Every track relates to the previous, although it is only 45 minutes long, it is 45 minutes that will be a wise investment. Buy this CD...Now! This CD has not left my stereo since I went and bought it.
B00005Y228|4.0|FIRST TIME I HEARD \\"CANT GET U OUTTA MY HEAD\\" I FEEL OUTTA MY CHAIR. I WAS LIKE, MAN THIS IS HOT. I WAS ONE OF THE FEW AMERICANS WHO STILL KNEW MS. MINOGUE STILL EXISTED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. I WAS VERY EXCITED TO HEAR THAT THIS DISC WOULD SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY IN THE STATES EVEN AFTER \\"SPINNNING AROUND\\" FROM THE LIGHT YEARS DISC WAS SHUNNED HERE. ANYWAY, THE DISC HAS SOME GREAT DANCE TRACKS ON IT. LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ON THE DISC. \\"BOY\\" IS A HOT TRACK AS WELL AS \\"BURNING UP\\". THE ONLY SONG I SKIP IS \\"GIVE IT TO ME\\". I WAS ALSO SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT CATHY DENNIS CO-WROTE 2 A FEW TRACKS (OUTTA MY HEAD AND COME INTO MY WORLD, WHICH IS A GREAT TRACK.)SHE WILL NEVER GET THE ICON STATUS LIKE MADONNA BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE GIRL HER PROPS SHE HAS SOLD OVER 30MIL RECORDS WITHOUT MUCH HELP FROM AMERICA. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B000002C1W|5.0|I believe that this is one of his best i have the wall, this one, delicate sounds, and wish you were here but i believe that this is his best album next to the wall all because of on the turning way and learning to fly.
B00004RF9B|5.0|So spoke Lt. 'Doc' Ostrow (Warren Stevens) of the United Planets Cruiser C-57-D after it arrived at the planet Altair IV. The C-57-D, commanded by Commander John F. Adams (Leslie Nielsen), was sent to Altair IV from Earth to rescue a colony sent there two decades earlier on the spaceship Belleraphon because all contact was lost shortly thereafter.  When the C-57-D arrived at Altair IV, they received a warning from philologist Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pigeon) that they should not land.  He also claimed to be the lone survivor of the doomed Belleraphon.  However, Commander Adams had his orders and the C-57-D landed on Altair IV in spite of Dr. Morbius' objections.  After landing, Dr. Morbius and his robotic companion Robby (Robot the Robot) greeted the C-57-D crew, but Dr. Morbius continued to insist that they should leave immediately.  Unexpectedly, a beautiful woman, Altaira (Anne Francis), appears.  She is Dr. Morbius' daughter, whom he had ordered not to be seen while the C-57-D crew was on the surface.  The crew is delighted to meet Altaira, who have not seen a woman for 378 days while en route to Altair IV, but they were also surprised because she was not listed on the Belleraphon's passenger manifest.  Dr. Morbius explained that he was married by the Belleraphon captain, but that his wife died on the planet shortly after giving birth to Altaira.<br />Altaira was not the only thing that Dr. Morbius planned to hide from the spaceship visiting from Earth: he also had no intention of revealing Altair IV's biggest secret, but Commander Adams and Doc Ostrow forced the issue.  Reluctantly, Dr. Morbius explained that a race far more intellectually and techonologically advance than mankind, the Krell, once inhabited Altair IV.  Sadly, for hitherto unknown reasons, the Krell became extinct virtually over night as well as all other life on the planet 200,000 years earlier; but not all of the Krell's secrets had been lost.  As foretold by Dr. Morbius, strange things begin to happen to the visiting spaceship and crew similar to what ultimately destroyed the Belleraphon; and the isolated peace that Dr. Morbius and Altaira knew on the dead planet before the spaceship's arrival evaporates.<br />Taking inspiration from William Shakespeare's play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, writers Irving Block and Allen Adler created a brilliant story for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.  The Duke Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; became Dr. Morbius, his daughter Miranda became Altaira, the enslaved spirit Ariel became Robby the Robot, Ferdinand became Commander Adams, the island of exile became the planet Altair IV and Caliban became a monster bent on destruction.<br />Under the direction of Fred M. Wilcox, the acting, dialog and special effects for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; greatly surpasses nearly all other sci-fi films produced in the 1950's and 1960's.  Having been twice previously nominated for Best Actor in 1942 for &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; and in 1943 for &quot;Madame Curie&quot;, Walter Pigeon's portrayal of Dr. Morbius was exceptional.  &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; received a 1956 Oscar nomination for Best Special Effects, but lost to the only other nominated film, Cecil B. DeMille's &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.  It was not until Stanley Kubrick filmed &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; in 1968 that a sci-fi film surpassed &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; in quality and achievement.  The few films comparable to &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; from the 1950's include &quot;The Day The Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (1953).<br />Time has not caused &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; to lose any of its excellence. Sci-fi fans more accustomed to modern computer-enhanced special effects may regard the effects used in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; to be dated, but most will more than likely come to appreciate what Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was able to achieve with 1950's film technology.  For example, some may be surprised to see that George Lucas (in his 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;) was not the first to show what a holographic image could look like, as demonstrated in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.  Some may also be surprised to see Leslie Nielsen portray a serious character, instead of his more recent, bumbling comedic characters in films such as &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988).  Overall, I give &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; a highly deserved 5 out of 5 stars, as it will always be a timeless, landmark sci-fi film warning us to always beware of monsters from the id!
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard Evanescence it was on the radio going through Arkansas.  I had no idea who they were at that time but found that their mix of sounds consistant enough to nod my head.  My next encounter was an advanced demo of their song &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;.  My first listening of the song was followed consecutively by 10 more listens to the song.  I was hooked and immmediately looked to find more about the band and if they had a cd out.  I waited for 3 months to buy this album, and believe me it was worth the wait.  At first, the album seems to just be a bit melodramatic yet it keeps you in this zone of constant listening for more.  I was a bit put off by the slow melodies being this was a rock band, but it quickly grew on me.  I found within 10 minutes of listening to the album that I was singing to the songs and slapping my knee to the rythms.  Being that this Evanescence's freshman album, the price no where relects the quality of music you get from this album.  I've only had the album one day and i've listened to it 5 times.  If you are looking for something new and surprising then this album is for you.  Those looking for a hard rock band, Evanescence has some hard riffs and would probably not be the band for you.  Although, I would encourage hard rock enthusiasts to listen to this album anyways.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Just came from seeing this marvelous movie for a second time and can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  I trust that will be soon.  It's Bob Fosse at his best.  The entire cast is absolutely marvelous. I wish Bob Fosse was here to see it. He'd have been so proud.
0684833395|2.0|You have to be a certain type of person to like this novel.  I imagine many people are that type of person.  I am not.<br />For me, the problem with Catch-22 was that Heller never developed the characters in a way that made me like or dislike or otherwise feel a certain way about them.  Most of his descriptions of the characters focused on superficial qualities; he hardly developed the *character* of the characters (other than Major Major) at all.<br />These superficial traits, however, do not have universal appeal.  Different people have different opinions of these superficial qualities, and my opinions are evidently very different from Heller's.<br />Take General Peckem.  It was obvious that Peckem was supposed to be the epitome of annoying characters in the novel, based on his name alone.  Yet, when we finally met him, I hardly found him annoying at all.  In fact, I found him rather efficient.<br />Maybe there's a certain honesty about not presenting characters in a way designed to influence the reason's opinion of them.  But Catch-22 is a satire, and a satire depends on the reader feeling a certain way about the characters.  Much of the satire didn't work for me because I didn't share Heller's feelings about the charaters.<br />Now, having said all that, I will say that I think most people, especially military and other action types, will share Heller's opinions, and will understand the satire.<br />The other problem I had with Catch-22 is it's lack of temporal continuity.  It seemed that you could read most of the chapters in the book in any order and it would make just as much sense, which is not much.  Also, there was a ridiculous overuse of a certain figure of speech (mostly used to describe Milo).<br />On the good side, the book was quite funny, and the satire was amusing where it made sense to me.
0671646788|5.0|I wish I would have read this book in High School,but everything happens for a reason,so maybe this time in my life was perfect for reading it. I read alot of books on self help and motivation but this book takes the cake. I was getting energy surges with every chapter I read. I would take quotes and use them at work,and my co-workers would look at me with astonishment an say &quot;what the heck has gotten into you?&quot; If I could go beyond 5 stars it would get it. This book is on my list of reading every six months to get the drive and pump back. Thanks Mr. Schwartz.
B00005JL96|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It harks back to the innocence of Snow White yet does not fade into a period piece that will fail time.<br />Star Wars fans will get the boundless tie in jokes with the Galactic Federation and Stitch's escape; &quot;He's gone up the ventilation shaft!&quot; The Galactic Federation senate scene is done brilliantly.<br />Stitch is not a typical, loveable Disney character - he is a menace to the galaxy who runs things his way. However, it is his personal journey through the eyes of the Ugly Duckling story and Lilo's &quot;ohana&quot; that he begins to change from Military Experiment into loving family member.<br />As for Lilo, her struggle to fit in after the loss of her parents is equally real. She is cute without the treacle and unlike typical characters in her situation, continues to be a child in her approach to the larger world. One of the great things with the animation of Lilo is that she is not the beautiful and skinny, cute little girl from page 621 of the writers characterisation manual: she defies the normal by being normal.<br />The best thing I loved about this movie was definitely the fact that it wasn't sweet, sappy and gooy. It was simply heart warming and innocent. A classic movie that I place up there with Aladdin, the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is Evanesence's debut on a national label, and it's long overdue. Amy Lee's voice and Ben Moody's guitar form the centerpiece of a banquet of sounds, and while both are very young, they sound like seasoned professionals. Lee has obviously had some classical training and she displays it in the rocking \\"Bring Me To Life.\\" Her haunting voice and lush piano work complement the edgy guitar riffs displayed by Moody throughout the album. Lee and Moody have written the majority of the album's poetic lyrics, somber and yet inspiring, full of powerful images of a struggle to survive in a world they didn't create. <BR>    The ballads \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\" will no doubt be embraced by younger listeners dealing with all the travails associated with youth. They are beautiful, and deserve special attention among the gems that shine on this album.<BR>    Lee is strikingly beautiful, and the combination of her voice and Moody's ferocious fingering will make it difficult to label this band. Their unique sound defies stereotypes, and offers a welcome relief to those weary of the rap-rock genre.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is the first of six books in a series, and is definitely the best one. The others, I think, bring it down, but Dune is amazing. Paul Atreides of House Atreides is forced into the desert after House Atreides arch-enemy, House Harkonnen, aided by the Emperor, attacks the household. With his mother, he joins the mysterious Fremen, who, despite pompous Dukes who feel it's theirs, control the valuable resource known as Spice which makes it possible for Space travel. Paul is part of the prophecy and is the Kwisatz Haderach, which is what the Bene Gesserit have been trying to accomplish in their breeding programs. However, due to a glitch, he's come one generation too early, and the Sisterhood (known as witches to many) aren't ready for him.<BR>       This book was spectacular. I've read it so many times it's falling apart. It may be confusing at times, but that just makes it more interesting.
B00005JLSC|3.0|The musical story of Roxy Hart's fall and rise made for great Broadway when I saw it. Not being one who normally likes musicals of any stripe (I HATED sitting through 'Rent' but remember loving 'The Wiz' and liking 'Les Miz\\" a lot), I found 'Chicago' to be pretty darn good. Of course, I did see it while Bebe Neworth was performing...<br />The movie version, by nescessity, had to add on some dialogue, but not enough to ruin it. The musical numbers were fine. Most of the performances we middle-of-the-road, with Queen Latifa's standing out and Richard Gere's petering out (he was awfully wooden, especially during his numbers).<br />I know why the Academy chose to nominate this film, as it had to put something up there in what was an otherwise dull movie year (and God knows they'll never let a science fiction film like 'The Two Towers' near a Best Picture Oscar, no matter how much better it is). Most of the nominees had limited runs, and most of the moviegoing audience are still going 'huh?' over 'The Hours' and 'The Pianist'. So hence 'Chicago'.<br />But it doesn't deserve an Oscar; 'All That Jazz' deserved an Oscar. Oh well, there's always next year...
B00008BXJF|4.0|KC returns with a remarkably strong reworking of material and directions almost all of which were previewed on EPs over the past year or so. But it is a dramatic reworking. This quartet has set about developing and cultivating its own repertoire and in its 2 studio releases there is a very new bend in the Crimson river.<BR>Belew has broken the mold of his lone rhinoceros style and delivered sets of lyrics framed in haiku that minimalistically convey a powerful well of anxiety, release and and a leap of faith. At times, this quartet revisits the gamelan style of the 80's quartet and locks in more sublimely than even that remarkable ensemble did. Echoes of Soundscapes drift in the background, Dangerous Curves take hairpin turns, new levels of integration lurch the enterprise forward. This is a remarkable journal entry from a peripatetic King who refuses to rest on his laurels.<BR>In all respects, Belew, Mastellotto, Gunn and Fripp are creating with an intensity that is and always has been the exciting element of surprise in the soul of KC. This will do nothing to endear chics to them, but Fripp and his colleagues have long gotten used to serious men, some with facial hair and glasses, being the core of their support. Bruford once remarked that the King made dance music for epileptics. You'll have a joyous fit with this release. There are many rewards here for those who have placed their faith in the power to believe.
B00008BXJF|4.0|Haven't quite gotten through all of THE POWER TO BELIEVE (just three tracks to go!), but I can already say it's an improvement on 'The ConstruKction Of Light,' the last full-length studio album from KING CRIMSON. <br />To these ears, it seems that all of the ProjeKct experiments that fueled that last record have now been fully digested and implemented into more satisfying song structures.  Don't know that I'm particularly crazy about the various effects Adrian Belew uses on his vocals, but the idea almost makes sense on this record - at least more so than the TCOL, as it seems apparent that Robert Fripp &amp; Co. are determined to make intelligent metal for the 21st Schizoid Century.  It's all starting to make sense here.<br />With TPTB, Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn make their respective roles in KC their own, with Mastelotto probably being most key in furthering the overall production with his electronic percussive delivery. That's not to slight Gunn's ability on the Warr Guitar; the low end is deliciously represented and felt throughout the album.<br />If you're thinking about picking this up, get off the fence and give it a listen.  As for me, it's time to get back to those three remaining tracks...!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I've read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the Chamber of Secrets, and I just finished reading the Prisoner of Azkaban.  I loved reading these books I couldn't put them down and no book has ever made me feel this way.  You get lost in this imaginary world and it makes you wish you lived in one like it.  I just wish this came out when I was a kid.   I saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets and I just absolutely loved the movies as much as the books.  For the first time the movies actually went along with everything that happened in the books.  I saw the Chamber of Secrets in the theater 3 times and loved it each time!  I really can't wait to read the Goblet of Fire and i cant wait till the third movie comes out.  I know it will be just as awesome as the first 2 movies.  Everyone should read the Harry Potter books because they're so fun to read and there isn't one boring part in the books or movies.  I'm so glad that J.K. Rowling made up this amazing character and great books.  Harry Potter rocks!
B00008BXJF|4.0|Haven't quite gotten through all of THE POWER TO BELIEVE (just three tracks to go!), but I can already say it's an improvement on 'The ConstruKction Of Light,' the last full-length studio album from KING CRIMSON. <br />To these ears, it seems that all of the ProjeKct experiments that fueled that last record have now been fully digested and implemented into more satisfying song structures.  Don't know that I'm particularly crazy about the various effects Adrian Belew uses on his vocals, but the idea almost makes sense on this record - at least more so than the TCOL, as it seems apparent that Robert Fripp &amp; Co. are determined to make intelligent metal for the 21st Schizoid Century.  It's all starting to make sense here.<br />With TPTB, Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn make their respective roles in KC their own, with Mastelotto probably being most key in furthering the overall production with his electronic percussive delivery. That's not to slight Gunn's ability on the Warr Guitar; the low end is deliciously represented and felt throughout the album.<br />If you're thinking about picking this up, get off the fence and give it a listen.  As for me, it's time to get back to those three remaining tracks...!
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is in a word, stunning. I first heard &quot;Bring me To Life&quot; off of the Daredevil soundtrack, and got hooked. The album is incredible, it is really difficult to blend dark, heavy music with a female lead, because female singers lack the aggressive range men do. They need music that wont dominate the pitch and tone of thier voices, and so they must be the leading instrument. Amy Lee has a voice of an angel, it commands respect. Piano driven melodies complimented with some serious riffs and even the occasional choir arrangement. There are agressive songs such as &quot;Bring me To Life&quot;, &quot;Whisper&quot;, and &quot;Going Under&quot;, while a more acoustic sounds dominates with piano driven melodies such as &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot;. For those afraid that the first single sounds a little too &quot;linkin park&quot;, don't worry, it is the only track with a male backing. Given today's pop punk and teen queen climate, this band may have a hard time fitting in. However, given a chance, rock fans will welcome this amazing blend of melody, beauty, and agression as a refreshing, welcome change. This band deserves a chance, pick up this album and help focus Rock radio and music back to originality and melody, not formulas and turntables.

B00005QXDD|5.0|Even before this CD came out, I was a big fan of Jack Black as an actor.  But when I heard about this comical rock album coming out, I was a bit reluctant about buying it.  But I mustered up the courage to pay for it and was pleasantly surprised with the CD.  In fact, it's one of the best CDs I own.  JB and KG (Kyle Gass) are brilliant rock geniuses that sing songs of love, heroes, politics, and none other than; Satan.  And although the two main guys are Black and Gass, other popular musicians do appear (i.e. Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl, Phish's Page McConnell, Dust Brothers, and Steve McDonald).  Here, for anyone who doesn't believe, is a short overview of the 21 tracks (14 songs, 7 skits).<br />1. Kielbasa - starts off the CD with the line 'dude we gotta fxckin write something here'; letting us know they're singing without a care in the world.  The song is hilarious, and very catchy.<br />2. One Note Song - it's not really a song; it's more of a skit, as JB devises a plan for a song containing only one note (with a bendy).<br />3. Tribute - aka \\"the Greatest Song in the World\\".  Here's an excellent tale of JB and KG on a hitchhiking trip in which they run into a demon who asks them to play a song for him.  It was a single, and with good reason.<br />4. Wonderboy - this song kind of sounds like a comic book story.  Two characters are introduced: Wonderboy and Young  Nastyman, two enemies who later form the band Tenacious D.  It was the first single, although not the best.<br />5. Hard Fxcking - here's a skit about hard fxcking.  Pretty funny intro to...<br />6. Fxck Her Gently - this is a 21st century love song that talks about what women really want during sex.  It's very good, and as JB says: 'fellas, listen closely'.<br />7. Explosivo - this one is a short song with some catchy lyrics and music.  I don't really know what it's about; maybe girlfriends or a demon-Satan creature, I don't know.  It's good, though.<br />8. Dio - a rhyme about Ronnie James Dio, in which the D lets us know they'll be taking over for Dio.  No questions asked.<br />9. Inward Singing - JB again comes up with a brilliant plan for rock and roll in this hilarious skit.  I believe \\"Inward Singing\\" has more swears than any other track.  It's very witty, and leads us into...<br />10. Kyle Quit The Band - 'but now we're back together'.  This is one of my favorite songs on the CD, and it tells us how Tenacious D plans to spend the money they'll be earning from becoming famous.<br />11. The Road - the start has a country-feel to it as Jack Black talks of the hardships being on the road brings him.  It's one of the weak points of the album, though.<br />12. Cxck Pushups - funny, but too unbelievable to believe.<br />13. Lee - not about too much, it's mostly just words that rhyme with 'lee'.<br />14. Friendship Test - this skit is funny, as JB tells Kyle he loves him; only for him to realize it was a test.  It's not that great, maybe worth an F+.<br />15. Friendship - 'as long as there's a record deal we'll always be friends', proving time and time again how real the love in Tenacious D really is.<br />16. Karate Schnitzel - Jack Black doing karate in a skit; hilarious.<br />17. Karate - this is probably the shortest song on the CD, but also the best.  You'll find yourself singing along to the beautiful melodic harmony in this song over and over again.<br />18. Rock Your Socks - this song starts with a Dave Grohl shout of '1 2 3 4 5 6-6-6!' What more do you need to know?  It's awesome.<br />19. Drive-Thru - this is the best skit on the CD, where JB and KG go through a fast-food drive-thru and order anything from a 4-piece 6-nugget meal to a jr. western bacon-chee.<br />20. Double Team - here's the best love song I've ever heard.  Not really, but this song is so hilarious and pleasant-sounding you will certainly sing along.  For some reason, though, they finish it off with a 'hail Satan' chant.  Go figure.<br />21. City Hall - ahh, the epic ending.  This is a 6½-minute ode to a new world ruled by two kings: Jack Black and Kyle Gass, who rewrite the rules of man, transportation, and politics with ground-breaking decrees.<br />Hiddens. \\"Malibu Nights\\" (as it's dubbed by JB) evens the score at 1 to 1, going back to the \\"One Note Song\\" skit.  It's really a hidden gem.<br />***<br />As you can imagine, Tenacious D is not for everyone.  They are not your average rock & roll band, and their lyrics might be beyond you if lack a sense of humor.  But if you do have a sense of humor and you'd enjoy a new twist on rock, Tenacious D is for you.  All the songs/skits are good, if not excellent.  Jack Black has really taken his career to a new level; and he's taken us fans along with him.  Don't overlook the D because they lack real-life lyrical value or because they may be sexist bastards (not really).  Their music is very catchy and you will find yourself singing along to it; I guarantee it.minute ode to a new world ruled by two kings: Jack Black and Kyle Gass, who rewrite the rules of man, transportation, and politics with ground-breaking decrees. <br />Hiddens. \\"Malibu Nights\\" (as it's dubbed by JB) evens the score at 1 to 1, going back to the \\"One Note Song\\" skit.

B00008BXJF|5.0|The latest King Crimson release &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; is the bands first release in 3 years and is well worth the wait.<BR>&quot;Believe&quot; starts with the title track and the song is repeated three times in different forms throughout the new disc. The song starts with the soft spoken vocals of guitarist Adrian Belew and goes into the second track, an harder edged track &quot;Level Five&quot;. The song shows off lead guitarist and founding member Robert Fripp's amazing guitar playing, acccompanied by the driving beat of Pat Mastelotto on drums and Trey Gunn on bass.<BR>There is a few familiar songs off the band's 2002 EP release &quot;Happy With What You Have to be Happy With&quot; including the title track and &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot; which for me is great because they were two of my favorite tracks on that cd.<BR>Other great tracks are the instrumental &quot;Elektrik&quot; and Hard driving &quot;Facts of Life&quot;.<BR>This is a very well balanced recording and doesn't dissapoint this Crimson fan. And I'm sure most KC fans will enjoy it also.<BR>Pick this one up.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've been waiting for this album to be released for so long.  It's finally here, and it was all that I could have hoped for.  For those long time Evanescence fans you will be awed once again.  This album has several new songs while others that were released in limited edition, some have been remixed and give it even greater depth.  &quot;My Immortal&quot; is such a great song along with many others of the like.  Evanescence has had some greater background pieces, some more piano, and more strings.  I love this cd and would strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something more than the dime-a-dozen rock of today.  Amy has such a powerful and wonderful voice, and Ben's lyrics are just so awesome.  The songs evoke such emotion and most people can connect with the messages in each song.  Go Evanescene, hope to see you more and more!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is a great movie overall. It has a cool plot and funny characters. It's basically a movie that parodies all the fairy tale [stuff] we read and watch in elementary school (like Cinderella, Snow White, the GingerBread man, the whole chivalrous thing with the princesses and knights).<br />But the unlikely hero of this movie is a green ogre named Shrek. He's a huge, scary monster who lives alone in his swamp, guarding it from any intruders. But in this land where the movie is set there are lots of other fairy tale creatures. <br />One strange animal is the Donkey, who knows how to talk. He's been rejected by his owner, and now he meets Shrek. What ensues is a hilarious and cute friendship that brings these two characters together to save the princess for the prince.<br />This movie looks great and is all computer animated. They did a beautiful job making the scenes. The dialogue is witty and interesting.<BR>This is definitely a watch-again movie.
B000089RVX|4.0|I am so glad I finally had the chance to buy this album. From the moment I heard &quot; Bring me to Life &quot;, on the daredevil soundtrack, I knew these guys would be amazing. There songs revolve primarily around despair, however they bear a positive message. For once, a band that genuinely seems to care about their music vs. their commercialization. Amy's voice runs the range of emotion perfectly, and it really feels as though you are listening to a depiction of her soul through the complete irrationality that is music. Any fan of poetic yet hard hitting, dynamically flawless artistry, will surely enjoy this debut. As a side note, this band is not part of the Avril Lavigne bandwagon, due to the presence of a female singer.(Simply put, because an animal is quadripedal, does that make it a dog?). Anyone who fails to see the beauty in this album, try to step outside of your tiny bubble of ignorance, and learn to appreciate the fact that someone can bear their soul to the world and make it as surreal as evanescence has.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|What a WONDERFUL, funny, movie with a profound message about being vulnerable and willing to take chances. Scott takes a chance on new dance steps. Fran takes a chance on being rejected. Dad takes a chance to &quot;bend yer ear for a tic.&quot; What is SO liberating is how each character grows from their willingness to take a chance and how even the weak characters, terrified of change, find themselves redeemed and enlarged--beginning principally with Fran's courage enabling Scott to stop being a &quot;selfish&quot; dancer. I watch this movie at least 2 or 3 times a year. &quot;A life lived in fear is a life half lived.&quot;
B000001IPL|4.0|Smash is one of the albums where you can put it in your CD player, occupy yourself with something else, and listen to the whole CD several times through. There is not a sub-par song on the album. There are several outstanding songs (Self-Esteem, Nitro, Gotta Get Away) which would be good for even the casual Offspring listener. Great for the rock enthusiast, and catchy enough for the casual rock listener.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence entered the scene in 2000 with their amazing debut album, &quot;Origin.&quot; Since their first release, they have grown an incredibly distinct sound!<br />Fallen is an amazing record! I have never heard a female vocalist with such a powerful voice! The guitars sound something similar to CKY (a heavy/gothic/alternative combination)! You will LOVE this album! It has been playing in my CD player nonstop since I got it! Stay offa' the P2P and support the band! It's only a few bucks - GO FOR IT! You'll LOVE EM'!
B000002U8G|5.0|dark side is amazing, meddle isn't far off from it...i'd say the two albums tie for five stars.. the soothing sounds of this album could allow a listener to have it on loop for days on end.  Very relaxing, very peaceful, very very very awesome
B00004T0UT|5.0|Le dernier disque studio qui n'&eacute;tait pas un soundtrack de films c'&eacute;tait POT LUCK en 1962.Entre temps,ELVIS avait presque r&eacute;ussi a gacher son talent dans des films insipides.Cet album ,c'&eacute;tait un retour aux sources pour lui avec des pi&egrave;ces a saveurs country et soul, et pour les irr&eacute;ductibles du KING c'est la derni&egrave;re pierre pr&eacute;cieuse de sa discographie.H&eacute;las, apres ce coup de maitre,cela sera la lente descente aux enfers qui le conduira vers son dernier repos.C'est sans aucun doute avec cet opus la que notre ELVIS est le plus authentiquement lui-meme.
B000003TAL|4.0|there are alot of people who believe this to be SY's greatest album.  For me, it was dirty.  this album is good with wonderful songs like teenage riot, one of my favorite songs ever by SY.  i find this to be a combination of trademark SY yet rooted in traditional rock song formula which yielded some amazing results.  songs like  providence and candle are just so beautiful that words fail me.  this album is fitting for the newcomer and the collector although if your just getting into SY, experimental,  dirty and goo are a little more ear friendly
B00005JKZT|5.0|I have been thrilled beyond belief with Jackson's interpretation of my favorite story of all time.  I read the trilogy for the first of many times about sixteen years ago, and have been a die-hard fan ever since.  I have heard complaints from \\"purists\\" about Jackson not following the books exactly, but a script written from the novel page by page would be an impossible movie to film, and the result would be dreadful.  It is obvious that the filmmakers truly love Tolkien's work, despite slight deviations from the \\"way it REALLY went.\\"  Jackson has made Middle-Earth a place as real as this world.  Don't get bogged down on the details!  This series is truly a work of art.
B00003CXA2|5.0|First let me say that I'm not going to get worked-up over Tom Hanks' portrayal of a mentally retarded character.  Forrest was not retarded.  While he was not the sharpest tool in the shed, his IQ was not more than two standards deviations below the mean.  Besides, Mr. Hanks is an actor, and he was merely acting according to the way the author wrote the character, the way the director directed the character, and his own interpretation of both.    This is an exceptional movie--still my all-time favorite.  I haven't actually watched it in a while, but when I do, I'm moved every time.  How can one not be moved by a character so ingenuous, so resilient, and so good?  How can one not be moved by such an incredible story, so skillfully directed?  Bad things sometimes happen to good people.  \\"It happens,\\" as Forrest said.  Someone once said that \\"life is ten percent what happens and 90 percent how I react to it.\\"  Never has this truth been so accurately portrayed as in this wonderful movie, \\"Forrest Gump.\\"    \\"Is he smart, or is he. . . .?\\"  That scene clinched the Oscar for Tom Hanks, and I still can't watch it without getting a big lump in my throat and tears in my eyes.  Tom Hanks is the best, most versatile actor of our time, and never has he been more brilliant than he was in this movie.  No one with a pulse can watch this movie and not be moved by it--perhaps even changed.  I could not recommend any movie more highly.
6304493681|5.0|I believe Ghost In the Shell is one of the seminal films of recent Japanese cinema. The plot involves a female cyborg, named the Major, who works for a mysterious government agency named Section Nine. The Major is assigned to capture a superhacker known as \\"The Puppet Master.\\" What could have been a routine chase flick becomes a masterpiece in which questions about existence and what constitutes a soul are explored. The end of the picture is one of the most dizzying finales ever put on film. Don't miss this ground breaking motion picture.<br />Preston McClear, MalibuBooks.com
B000063V8R|5.0|This is where Star Trek TNG carved its own niche in television history.  This is where it finally grew its own identity and stood alone.  Dr. Crusher's return is the precursor to consistently good stories over the next season.  Many have already mentioned the classics, \\"Yesterday's Enterprise,\\" \\"The Best of Both Worlds,\\" and \\"Deja Q.\\"  In this season, Data will become a father in, \\"The Offspring,\\" Riker will be accused of murder in, \\"A Matter of Perspective,\\" and Spock's father will make an appearance in, \\"Sarek.\\"  We also begin a major plot thread concerning Worf and the Klingon Empire in, \\"Sins of the Father.\\"  Geordi falls in love with a holodeck woman in, \\"booby Trap,\\" not knowing that he'll meet her real version next year.  Picard finally gets more action than his first officer in, \\"Captain's Holiday.\\"  Probably the only episode I wasn't crazy about was, \\"The Bonding,\\" but it has its appeal.  The crew finally seems to attain that comfortable, friendly chemistry that eluded them in the first two seasons.  Picard has mellowed, Troi stops being a sex symbol and becomes credible and Worf finally gets more screen time.  This season combined the perfect blend of drama, action, suspense and character development.  It was TNG at its best and it foreshadowed the superior entertainment that TNG would give us until the end of the sixth season.  If you are only going to purchase one DVD gift set from TNG, make it this one!
6305558167|5.0|Excalibur is a magnificent retelling of Mallory's Le Morte D'Arthur. This is the best film version of the Arthurian legend to date. The film features a stand out performance by Nicol Williamson as Merlin, the doomed wizard who knows his fate and must follow it. If you go to see this film looking for historical accuracy you won't find it. Instead Boorman sets his film in the once upon a time land scape of the imagination. Excalibur is a sumptuous film about myths and legends. Make sure to look for the early performances by luminaries like Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart and Gabriel Byrne.<br />Preston McClear, MalibuBooks.com
B000063V8S|5.0|The fourth season of TNG begins with the rescue of Picard from the Borg collective, and ends with Worf leaving the Federation to join his people during the Klingon Civil War.  In between these two landmark shows, lies a fourth season drenched with superior stories and consistently good character development.  Star Trek really established itself in the third season and it never looks back as we go forward through the fourth.  I liked this season only slightly less than the third, only because of a couple of episodes I didn't care much for.  I didn't like &quot;Remember Me,&quot; and &quot;In Theory.&quot;  Data falling in love was good for a subplot, but not the main story.  Still, we get top-notch entertainment as the crew continues to explore places no one has gone before.  High-lights include, &quot;Reunion,&quot; &quot;The Drumhead,&quot; &quot;Qpid,&quot; &quot;The Mind's Eye,&quot; &quot;First Contact,&quot; &quot;Clues,&quot; and &quot;Future Imperfect.&quot;  We meet Tasha Yar's sister in, &quot;Legacy.&quot;  We meet Data's father in, &quot;Brothers.&quot;  Also, while the Klingons and Romulans still play vital parts, we finally meet the devious Cardassians in, &quot;The Wounded,&quot; where O'Brien finally has his moment to shine.  All and all, this is a superb DVD set and I highly recommend it to any fan, whether you are a diehard Trekor or just getting started.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue is back in the US. I still remember those days of &quot;The Locomotion&quot;.  Of course songs being written and produced by Cathy Dennis shows why.  I suggest buying this album you will be pleasently suprised.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I was born 10 years after this album came out. My parents were still in high school on its release date. But they knew it was good. It stuck with them. And they raised me on it. Countless trips to Grandma's house, giggling at the rumbling low-end notes of the baritone saxiphones in &quot;Why Don't You Write Me?&quot; Just like a rebellious teen raised in a morally strict family, I tried to run and deny my love for these songs . . . but for many years now I have loudly proclaimed it. &quot;The Only Living Boy In New York&quot; is, to this day, my favorite song of all time. &quot;The Boxer&quot;, &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied&quot;, and &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; still move me emotionally like few songs can. The only song I don't like is &quot;So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright.&quot; First of all, the purpose of the song doesn't warrant either songwriting or inclusion on an album in my opinion. But when all we had was this album on cassette, that song was the last one on side one, so we could just fast forward to the end. Now with CD's, it's even easier to continue disliking that song by never listening to it. When an album such as this is labelled as a classic, there is a very good reason for it. Those reasons can be seen as just plain ol' good songs, powerful social commentary, Billboard-topping singles . . . but for me, its the fact that I, primarily a fan of punk and independent rock, love this album that proves that it's a timeless classic.
B00005B36H|5.0|this album can be rephrased to: &quot;we are not alone, don't let yourself go&quot;. Some here say the album is not good enough because its songs are 1,too long 2,all the same; if so, they haven't listen to it. Theres a deep message in every song, from The Patient to Reflection, Lateralis is an statement about todays ways of life, the influenza that the media make on you... Muscally speaking this album is NOT for you Opiate/Undertow fan, this is Tool evolutionated, and &quot;reaching out for the random, or whatever will bewilder me...&quot;. Long tracks, meditation tracks, not for hardcore/rock fans, if you're looking for depressed tracks, don0t look here. Lateralus is Aenima's Big brother: the message is clearer, Maynard's mind begins to unify, and their music takes to a different level.
B00005JLSC|5.0|chicago is a musicial movie its a butiful movie that thrilling the audience. <BR>i really enjoyed watching this movie.

B000089RVX|5.0|This band rocks!  The vocals are haunting, drawing the listener further and further into the lyrics.  I find that the intensity of this music keeps me interested after repeated playings.  I tend to like &quot;softer&quot; music most of the time, but this one is different.  I keep going putting that cd back into the player, the one I wear when I go for a walk and need to think.  These people are musicians and poets.
B000089RVX|5.0|In this world of albums so rampantly produced and thrown into the public, it's a wonderful sight to see a well-produced, melodic frontier album that reaches a new era in the progression of music today.  With such powerful songs as Bring Me to Life and Haunted, it captures your ear and doesn't let go until you find yourself headbanging to an eerie trance.  In addition, this band has a wonderful diversity with ballads such as Imaginary and Hello which make you want to cry at the thought-provoking lyrics and beautiful paino melody.  Take the time to listen to this album carefully and lose yourself in it just as I have.
B000089RVX|4.0|I first heard Evanescence on the Dare Devil Soundtrack. I loved their two tracks \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\". Both of those tracks are also on this CD. The rest of the CD is just as good. Hard rocking and moody with emotional lyrics. Lead singer Amy Lee's vocals are beautiful and haunting.
B000089RVX|4.0|This is one of the most amazing cds I have recently purchased.  Combinding a mix of an almost heavy metal/progressive rock sounding guitar, drum loops, keyboards and strings, the music on FALLEN is some of the most moving that has been produced lately.  Amy Lee has one of the most captivating vocies I have ever heard.  I highly recommend anyone who is a fan of awome music and beautiful vocals buy this cd.
B000084T18|5.0|haven't gotten the album yet, wanted to review y'allz take on it.  Some of u liked it, some didn't.  I think ima get it, keeping in mind that everyone has different tastes.  But still, no one can compare to Pac!
B00008BXJF|5.0|has anyone else noticed there's a new album out by KING CRIMSON (!)? my god man! buy it! yes it's good. i got it today and i've already listened to it three times. if you couldn't comprehend the ConstruKction of Light (which if you don't own- shame on you), The Power to Believe may be surprising. it's considerably LESS disorganized than the previous album. it has more direction, and even more of those beautifully structured guitar soundscapes. and something NEW-- a digital &quot;edge&quot; (you'll see). i'll say nothing about the individual songs, except it's worth buying for the Facts of Life, or Eyes Wide Open, which are A M A Z I N G tracks. Robert Fripp is a genius, and the musicians he has surrounded himself with are equally brilliant, and they shine on this amazing album.
B00005Y1Z4|5.0|This is one of the best &quot;synthpop&quot; albums ever made and arguably one of the best albums of any genre.  If you like dark songs with poppy melodies, buy this...
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is amazing. It is worth everything. This cd has no bad songs. Each one is diffrent.There are some great slower songs, and others that are fast paced This is a great cd to add to your collection, and a must buy.
B000000OPW|5.0|This is probably the Siouxsie cd I listen to most often, and I have all of them, as well as a few Creatures cds.  It's one of those great, swirly goth records like Christian Death's Catastrophe Ballet that just makes you wanna get up and float across the dancefloor like the gloomy piece of seaweed you are.  &quot;Cities In Dust&quot; and &quot;Candyman&quot; I had already heard an ungodly amount of times before I bough this cd, so I pay much more attention to the beautiful &quot;Sweetest Chill&quot;, &quot;Cannons&quot;, &quot;This Unrest&quot;, &quot;Party's Fall&quot; and the others.  The music and lyrics are lucid, dreamy and ethereal.  Siouxsie really is the supreme goddess, not just of goth, but in general.  I strongly suggest this album also for a fan of fairygoth music, i.e. Rasputina, Switchblade Symphony, Cocteau Twins, etc.
B000089RVX|5.0|There's really no other way I can sum up this album than \\"wow\\".  I bought it figuring Evanescence to be a one-hit wonder with \\"Bring Me To Life\\".  I am the most eclectic music fan ever, listening to everything from Tori Amos to Deftones, Redman to Tim McGraw... This cd offers a glimmer of virtually every genre of music.  The backgrounds have a very metal sound, very much like (I hate to say this, but...) Linkin' Park or Crazy Town, with vocals that have to make Tori Amos jealous.  A weird mix, I know...but this is hands down the best new album I've heard in years...and I've only listened to it two times through.  Nothing at all \\"cheezy\\" about it, as I expected.  The song \\"Tourniquet\\" is dark and has a great sound to it...definitely my favorite track.<br />Enjoy...
0807282375|1.0|I wish that i could give \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" -1 stars. I will admit that I have never read this book. I however have read book 1 and book 2 in this trilogy. The Golden Compass seemed innocent, a little violent, but ok. The torward the end of book two (The Subtle Knife), i noticed that the darkness and evil in this book blew Harry Potter out of the water. Any book that rebels against Christianity is disgusting. If any person (i am twelve) ages 11-13 reads this book, by the end they will be hoping that God loses the war without actual recognition of what they are hoping for. In the beginning of this series Phillip Pullman introduces Lyra and Will as the good guys, the people you want to win... naturally them being the main characters, you want them to defeat their opponent in the battle- but what any innocent youth won't realize (like me) is that you hope that God dies. So, basically, if God dies, Heaven dies, and if Heaven dies, it doesn't mean we won't live anymore but it means we don't have a point to live, because at the end of every life there is death- and in death, where will we go to? HELL! So, literally, Phillip Pullman is trying to assist Satan in winning a battle, that traces back to Adam ans Eve, and any book that suggests that is horrible! that is what happens if God dies- and God dying is the ending that Phillip Pullman sees fit for this book. I feel sad for that man, because he is obviously twisted, disturbed, and creepy, because he obviously wants to spend a lifetime in torture with Satan. My interpretation may be a little bit strong, but being a Christian, i can't help my opinions. I showed my mom a few reviews off of this book, and she is completely warped in guilt that she bought his book for me. So everybody out there, beware this disturbing book.
B000089RVX|4.0|this is just like linkin park cept add a girl singer. my favorite song is the one from daredevil bring me to life!
0066214122|3.0|I should start by saying that I'm not exactly a fan of Michael Crichton's work. I used to watch ER, but in most of his novels it seemed that he was trying too hard for the reader to like him. DINOASAURS! TIMETRAVEL! FLYING DISEASES! O MY!<br />Anyway, I just got the feeling that this book was more of a screenplay than a novel. The descriptions seemed more like stage direction than real explanations. It was fairly predictable, like a good &quot;B&quot; movie. <br />However, on the whole, it WAS mildly entertaining. It would be great for a vacation to read on the beach or plane. It does get a bit technical here and there, but if you skip the science babble the story is still VERY easy to follow.  <br />This is my first reveiw so I hope this was helpful!
B00000ILDE|5.0|The second installment in the Aliens saga has been my favorite of the bunch ever since first seeing it. There are multiple reasons for this. For one, being a sequel, there was no need to develop gradually learning about what the situation on the planet is. The plot gets going a lot earlier than in ALIEN. Second, the pace is much faster and intense than in the first. Indeed, this is one of the tensest films ever made. But primarily, ALIENS is the best in the series because the character of Ripley has developed into the best female action role in the history of film. A lot of movies over the years have featured women in action roles, but most of the time, they are not terribly believable. Most of the time, the women look like what they are: actress with model's good looks awkwardly holding a gun. Not Ripley. Although traumatized by her encounter with the alien in the first film, she takes her fear and trauma and channels it into an intense anger and assertiveness. When she sees the indecision and ineptitude of those supposedly in charge of the mission, Ripley is forced to step forward and assert herself. When she does so, she emerges as the greatest female action character ever.<br />Ripley makes this movie. Her sheer courage in doing what she has to do to not only to save herself but the young girl who is the sole survivor on the planet drives her to undertake some amazing feats of courage. Her will drives the film forward, and there are few more extraordinary moments in Sci-fi than when she and the alien queen do battle with Ripley using a mechanized freight handler as a combat weapon.<br />There are so many other excellent things in this film: the great supporting cast, with Lance Hendrickson portraying one of the best androids I can remember seeing in film; the continued superb set design, and the extraordinary action sequences. And has there ever been a greater movie monster than the Alien Queen?<br />The Aliens series is one of the very best, but of those films, this one is the best of the bunch.s, this one is the best of the bunch.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I was Hyped with Chris Cornell&Tom Morello both United here.I enjoy Cornell's Vocie&Mrello's Guitar Playing but something about the material after a while feels Formula driven.Rage was Cool but I dug Soundgarden more so.hopefully they will get it right on the Next album.
0684833395|1.0|Catch-22, by Joseph Heller, stsarts out by introducing the characters. It takes place in World-War II with American soldiers in Italy. Yossarian is the name of the main character who often mentions wanting to be sent homw. Many of the characters are portrayed as crazy. This is illustrated when Yossarian stsates, \\"Then why don't you ground me? I'm crazy. Ask Clevinger\\"(54). By being grounded Yossarian is referring to being sent homw. The man he saks is Doc Daneeka, who wallows in his own self pity. Doc Daneeka answered Yossarian saying, \\"Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\\"(55). The characters aren't caught up in the usuall \\"American Spirit.\\" Many of the men are questioning why they're even there. <br />Much of the humor in this book is based on irony and the idiosyncraises of the characters. Many events that took place portrayed them as children, and the battle field their play ground. Most of the characters, especially Yossarian, spend most of their time trying to get out of flying the number of missions required to be sent home. Everyone tries to get someone else to do their job for them, which I found irritating.<br />Most of the storyline of Catch-22 are the flashbacks provided by the narrator, more than the characters themselves. It's almost as if each flashback is it's own little story, mkaing it hard to follow any kind of rising action.<br />As much as this book is recommended, I would ask readers to stay clear of it. The story lacked a climax, and the characters lacked a certain depth making it hard feel any kind of emotional connection. If you are still interested, I would recommend reading the first few chapters, then seeing if it is something you enjoy.
B000089RVX|5.0|Oh my God!! This CD is absolutley awsome. I cant get over it. I think everyone will find at least one or more songs that they like from this CD. It has amazing and fantastic volcals supported by excelent guitar and drums. The lead singers voice will blow your mind, along with the awsome chords done with the guitars and bass guitars. Greats drums also. I strongly suggest listening to the samples. Than buying the CD!!
B00006L83N|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best prog band out there. They have even surpassed Dream Theater. Yes, you read that right. I was totally blown away. These guys are extremely tight. The production is of the highest quality. I highly reccomend this CD!
0064471837|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this novel, Sabriel. It got off to a slow start and I was just about to get ready to put the book down when it really started to get good and ended up being a really positive experience for me. I thought that it was a positive experience for me because I really enjoyed reading it and it was one of the best books that I ever read. It taught me about someone who, stood up to their fears and made sacrifices to save the world even though she let her father kill himself. She accepted that and knew that she had to do her job, which was to get to the paperwing. Although it did teach me a lot about bravery I think that the real reason it was a positive experience was that it made me want to read more. It was so good that I couldn't wait to get home and read it and even after I finished it I still wanted to get home and just pick up a book which was a weird feeling. So that's why I thought that Sabriel was definitely a positive experience for me and I would recommend it to anyone. I hope that you consider reading Sabriel and I look forward to reading Garth Nix's next book.<br /> In this novel it was amazing how Garth Nix held my interest throughout the book after it got off to a little bit of a slow start. He is a fantastic author and writes very, very, well. He held my interest through the story with all the action he puts in, drama, and he just made me want to keep reading and reading. Especially when Sabriel was getting chased by that mordicant and just got to her father's in time before the mordicant got to her. I also think that Garth Nix was able to hold my interest through the whole story because he made everything really mysterious like when you think you know what's going to happen next but then he pops up with another idea. For example I thought that when Sabriel was crossing the stepping stones to get to the other side of her father's and suddenly she looked back and saw that the mordicant was just watching her. At that point I thought that the mordicant was going to jump across and then she would be doomed but instead she got over safely. So that's how I thought Garth Nix held my interest throughout the story and I look forward to reading his next book, Labriel.<br /> Another thing that I thought was amazing about Garth Nix's writing was the scenes. Even though I couldn't see them it seemed that I really could with all the descriptive detail. Like when Sabriel was just starting to look for her father and she passed the perimeter finding all of these bodies and how he described them being beheaded, what they looked like, and I thought that was amazing. I also liked the parts when the dead were around like in the reservoir when Sabriel went into death to save her father. Then the dead started to close in and finally when Sabriel saved her father he used the bell, which killed everyone around slowing down Kerrigor to get to his body. I really enjoyed that part of the book. I thought that I liked that part because it was full of action, drama, sacrifice, and everything that I really enjoy reading about. That scene was definitely my favorite scene of that book.<br /> After reading this book, I felt that even though it wasn't very educational and the author had a really wild imagination I learned a lot more than I thought I would from this book. I learned that when Sabriel lost her father for the good of the world I learned that you have to get over that and except what life unfolds. I also learned that when you have a person close to you die you have to move on and know that his or her spirit is always with you. This is a book with a lot of dying and death and I was amazed how the author made it seem so real how Sabriel was dealing with it. Sabriel lost a lot of close friends and family and she got through just like a real person should. I felt that even though I didn't learn a lot from this book, I learned one very important thing and that was to move on and know their spirit is always with you. I alsothought that I gained a lot from this book. I read one of the best books I've ever read, I found out about a great author who I should look into if I was looking for a great book, and I found out that even someone with a crazy imagination can make a great book like Garth Nix. I thought that this book was so amazing and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great book. This is a book that someone who loves fantasy would love and I salute Garth Nix for such a great novel. This was definitely a fantastic novel and I hope that you would read this book too.t that I gained a lot from this book. I read one of the best books I've ever read, I found out about a great author who I should look into if I was looking for a great book, and I found out that even someone with a crazy imagination can make a great book like Garth Nix.

B00005JKLZ|3.0|I saw this movie first at the Theaters! I have to say that I liked it, actually I loved it... A half year later it came out on DVD; I bought it the second it came out. I was so excited to see it again... I didn't liked it as much as the first time. It wasn't the same! I knew what would come; after that I watched it again, but my conclusion didn't change... I don't have that with other movies like 'the Omen', I watched that movie almost 6 times, I still love it. So don't buy this DVD, go rent it and never see it again, you'll love it the first time!!
B000002X2B|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best Kantner/Slick projects that I am familiar with.  The music is grand and the lyrics are interesting and poignant.<br />Grace Slick's album art is also a bonus to this album, which I own on vinyl.  It is one of my all time favorite albums.

B000089RVX|5.0|very well put together CD i Love it it really is a sort of Sweet and Sour combonation in the sense of happy and sad the songs that stand out on this CD were the ones from the Daredevil Soundtrack My Immortal is very sad yet energetic and meaningful<BR>and Bring me to life is just an awwsome song great chours lines and riffs and both songs were used in the Elektra scenes one where her father dies (Funaral) and one where she is tranining!<BR>i really like this CD BUY IT!!
0790729725|5.0|ive watched it about 50 times and thats not exaggerating. the acting is great. ray liotta does a great job as henry hill a half italian half irish kid who was raised in the mafia but later becomes a turncoat. the man rober de niro brings his A game as always as jimmy conway really jimmy burke. joe pesci does his best as the crazed tommy devito really tommy desimmone. this movie was great i watch it over and over go watch it love it AND WATCH IT AGAIN!
B000089RVX|4.0|While having an eerie and yet spiritural sound, I think that Evanescence will go far with their taste of music. I saw them live in Chicago and I think that their sound is new and will be well accepted. Rock on!
B00007BH3Y|4.0|First of all I was disappointed that the CD of the score did not include the operatic aria by R Strauss used in the film.  Glass's music was very nice to underline the three stories in The Hours.  I enjoyed it in the movie more than I have on its own but I'm sure there will be times that I'll want to play it at home.<BR>I had thought that Phillip Glass wrote in a less melodic style and I liked his use of piano and cello in this music.  I noticed that Tommasini in the NYTimes hated the score but most of us ordinary listeners loved the music.
0316666343|4.0|The prose is wonderfully originally after being innundated by the &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; style. I was fascinated by the almost omnipresent narrator (from a heaven that I could handle).  The ending was just too unbelievable for me.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I was apprehensive, thinking that Rick Rubin's tenure with Johnny Cash was beginning to go a bit dry--American III lacked the spark that personified the first two volumes in the series.  My tentativeness was for naught.  This album, from start to finish, is a testament to Cash's abilities as a singer, songwriter, and, most fascinatingly enough, an interpreter of others' songs.  &quot;Hurt&quot; and &quot;The First Time . . . &quot; are as close to a revelation as I've heard in the past year.
0876855575|5.0|After reading the first page of this novel, I felt as if I had finally found a writer that was talking about life the way I experienced it as a child.  The way the young boy views the world that surrounds him, the cruelty of his father, his cold mother, his sympathetic grandfather, his few friends (usually considered freaks, like himself), the popular kids taunting him, ... and women, of course ! Bukowski's prose is so devoid of pretence, of gimmickery, it's as if the man was sitting right next to you, talking from the heart.  Nobody has ever written as directly as Bukowski, as truthful or as touching.  His poems and short-stories vary from weird to good and fantastic, but this novel is his absolute masterpiece !
B00008BXJF|5.0|Bravo!  This is probably the tightest album ever produced by King Crimson, perhaps even tighter than Discipline.  This incarnation of the band is truly a tight-knit and working as a team.  The song, Level Five, is probably their best straight-out rockin tune in years, although it borrows a bit from the music off the ConstruKction of Light.  The song Elektrik also has a strong influence from that album. Eyes Wide Open is an electric version of the acoustic tune that appeared on the promo EP Happy With What You Have to Be Happy With.  Although I prefer the acoustic version, both are very pleasant.  It is a mellow tune assessable to the masses.  The song Dangerous Curves harkens back to the King Crimson of 1969, sounding like a variation of their live adaptation of the classical tune Mars by Holst, which eventually appeared as part of The Devils Triangle on their second album In Wake of Poseidon.  There are also influences on this album from Robert Fripps solo works that venture into the world of airy ambient music.  Happy With What You Have to Be Happy With is one of their tightest whimsical tunes ever done, with great lyrics and a tune that will stick in your head. Other tunes include blues influences, jazz influences, and middle eastern influences. <br />In all, I dont think the album breaks new ground, but it is great to see all of the variations of the 35 years of King Crimson all in one place and sounding so crisp.  If youre one of the people who prefer the looser, wilder versions of King Crimson, youll probably want to wait until a live version comes out.
B00005JKZ3|5.0|Almost as good as the first one.  The special effects alone are worth the buy.  Have already watched this several times and will keep on watching it.
0807281956|5.0|Of all the books that I have read, not one has caught my attention as much as this book has.  This highly entertaining, and extremely vivid book kept me up all night until the very end.  This book teaches several lessons to the children it is aimed at.  It is a story of an orphan whose life magically changes.  Harry Potter learns that he is actually a magical wizard with many powers which he is unaware of.  At first his horrible uncle tries to stop Harry from attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft.  With the help of an unwelcomed visitor, Harry is swept off his feet and taken to this magical school.  He then meets up with two of his fellow classmates, who he shares most of his adventures with.  From school bullies, to saving the school from extreme disaster, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone shows that children can make a difference in this world.   This book also teaches children lifelong lessons they could not find in any ordinary childrens book.  This book contains the intellectual backbone which most books lack.  Kudos goes out to Rowling in creating this book.  He has really captured the essence of what a childrens book should be.  I consider myself a very selective reader, and if this book caught my attention as much as it did, I can only imagine what it did for avid readers.  I encourage any person, young or old, to read this book.  It would be time very well spent.
B000000OQF|5.0|So maybe you don't agree with me.  Maybe Appetite for Destruction isn't the best album of all time, but it comes damn close!  Whose standards are these anyway?  Rock N' Roll once took pride in the fact that the music is all about showmanship and performance by nobody else's standards.  This is exactly what Guns N' Roses did here, they didn't care.  Hailing from Sunset Strip sleaze bars, GN'R became the biggest band in the world for an arguable 4 years (1988-1992 approx.), although some will say 6 ('87-'93).  Regardless of the current formation of the band, music is what lasts inevitably.  Appetite For Destruction will continue to remain in rock n' roll history as one of the greatest albums of all time by one of the best bands of all time.  Why?  Because Guns N' Roses held the perfect formula for rock stardom.  They were loud, rude, aggresive, ... sensitive and had superior musical talent.  Surpassing ladie's men Motley Crue, speed demons Slayer, and one-time metal monsters Metallica, Guns N' Roses perfected a winning musical combination.  Although the style would broaden with successing releases (Use Your Illusions), Guns N' Rsses had a plan with Appetite and stuck to it...<br />Opening with rock classic \\"Welcome To The Jungle,\\" the album is kicked off with dueling riffery by Slash and Izzy, followed by thumping drumming into the song.  Next came \\"It's So Easy,\\" a bass driven number that runs rough.  Axl's voice is considerably lower for this song and is highlighted since it follows the high-pitched Jungle.  The solo is kicked nicely, seemingly intertwined and Axl snarls at the bridge.  Nightrain followed suit as another hard-hitting jam.  The chorus is repetative and burrowing, with always-amazing crisp guitars.  The infamous \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" came next.  Known for Axl's constant ranting, the song is great in all accounts.  The masterful drug ode \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" is next on the list.  One of the catchiest songs around, Axl once again sports a lower voice.  The crowd-pleasing \\"Paradise City\\" followed, beginning with an almost folky intro, blended with harmonica, the song quickly kicked into gear and rocked HARD, ending with a hard hitting jam, the perfect concert encore.  \\"My Michelle,\\" about a crack addicted low-life, another powerful track, starts out slow but builds into one of the hardest rocking songs on the album.  \\"Think About You\\" introduces the listener to the softer side of Guns N' Roses, and is lead into the ever popular \\"Sweet Child O' Mine.\\"  Their breakthrough hit, Child is entered by an amazingly precise Slash and lead through by one of the most reknowned hooks in rock history.  \\"You're Crazy\\" is next, fast and hard-hitting, (the acoustic version of this song is available on GN'R Lies).  The one track I could do without is \\"Anything Goes.\\"  The album closer is \\"Rocket Queen,\\" my favorite Guns N' Roses song.  Starting with a drum to bass intro, the song kicks right into gear and stands out among the rest.  From a fully angry state-of-mind, Axl relaxes into an affectionate tone for the latter half of the song and closes on a great note.<br />For these reasons and however you feel after YOU have your first listen to this album is what it was made for.  Rock N' Roll FOREVER!...
B000089RVX|5.0|Don't judge this album by &quot;Bring Me to Life.&quot;  The rest of the album is much better.  Amy Lee's vocals are phenomenal, and they actually work well against roaring 7-string n-metal guitars.  Top notch production, songwriting, and arrangements push this one over the edge.  Amazing debut.  I can't make a list of best songs because this album is consistently good from start to finish; however the clichd n-metal vocal nuances of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; hurt an otherwise decent song.
0312305060|5.0|I loved this book.  At first it was very hard for me to get into; but once I dove in, it was head first.  I think my favorite part was the very end, which seemed to bring the whole book into more of a perspective.  I guess I should say, I never read Mrs. Dalloway or saw this movie, as of yet.  I read it with no pre-conceived notions.  It was well worth the read.
B00003CXXM|1.0|5, 10, 15 minutes in I'm thinking this looks really promising. That comes to a train-wreck of an end when Damon eyes a young lady. One cliche after another and their on the road together. The film looks good and is well excecuted by director Doug Liman. The story however is slow and predictable just a short way in to it. The extras are good - including commentary, an alternate ending, and deleted scenes. But the relationship is dumb and it takes the movie down for me. For a good Matt Damon film about relationships however strange they maybe check out 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' co-starring Jude Law.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|Flash in the pan.  In the United States anyway.  This duo may be popular in Russia, but I don't see how these girls will ever be more than their one hit &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; here in the U.S.  Their music is over the top bubble gum pop.  They have a couple of songs that have a catchy beat to them which make them passable, but the majority of the album doesn't even have that going for it.  Their sound tends to remind me of music from an anime film.  They have two things going for them... 1) They're very attractive girls and in this day and age appearance matters as much if not more than the music itself (see Britney for proof)... and 2) Their songs are already synth pop so it's easy for Dj's to remix them into electronica dance songs.<br />In the end they have only two songs even worth listening to... &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; and &quot;Clowns&quot; because of their catchy beats.  I would suggest buying these on singles instead of the whole album.
0786915749|5.0|This was the first fantasy book I'd ever read, and it has cursed me. This book was incredibly deep and still did it's job of setting up the rest of the trilogy and really, the rest of the series. I say it cursed me because now I expect all fantasy books to be this good, which many aren't. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman are by far the best Dragonlance writers, adding little details to add great depth to there books. Anyone wanting to get into fantasy or Dragonlance needs to get this book.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence burst onto the scene thanks to their hit song &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; from the Daredevil movie.  Bands that become popular because of a song in a movie generally don't last too long and it would be easy to say that Evanescence is just a flash in the pan based on that alone, but that would be an unfair assessment.<br />Evanescence has a sound that is not popular in the mainstream and most likely will not play on the radio long which is too bad because the talent is there.  Their music tends to be a bit moody, provocative, and has some dark undertones, which makes this a perfect cd for the &quot;goth&quot; crowd.  If you like Lacuna Coil you will love this band.  That said, I would still recommend this album to anyone and everyone.  The sound itself can't be beat.  You just have to love a hard rock beat with a beautiful melodic voice.<br />The music also has quite a bit to say if you actually pay attention to the lyrics.  Their songs speak of pain, betrayal, and understanding.  A couple of the more stirring tracks are &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;My Last Breath&quot;.  If you are a big fan of &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; I recommend listening to &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot;. <br />If you are like me then you look for an album that has more than just a couple of good songs.  This album is for you.  There are eleven songs on this album and not one of them is a disappointment.
B00005JLWN|1.0|(...)P>I was one of the ten people in America who caught EQUILIBRIUM in the theatre and dear lord, I laughed until I cried.  I hadn't seen such an earnestly bad movie since BATTLEFIELD EARTH.<br />Just because a science fiction movie adopts a lofty premise (what would the world be like if we couldn't feel.. sniff?) doesn't mean it's a good or intelligent movie.  The \\"world without feeling\\" premise is so flimsy, it's hysterical.  They live in a world without emotion (to prevent war), but the clerics and government officials all display anger, aggression, ambition, prejudice, etc.<br />Wimmer ignores any interesting aspect of exploring characters who feel no emotion and instead occupies himself with creating a low-rent version of THE MATRIX.  The visuals and the look of the movie are all uniformly pathetic.  Apparently, Dimension had left-over sets from IMPOSTER and wanted to make another forgettable sci-fi flick on the cheap.<br />There are so many hysterically bad moments in the film, there are almost too many to list, but here's a few: Christian Bale abandons his whole belief system for the love of a puppy; future people think throwing criminals into a giant furnace is a prudent form of capital punishment; in the future, we all have lots of futuristic gadgets, but we'll drive repainted Ford Tauruses; the government decides that the best way to enforce use of the \\"no feeling pill\\" is to create a group of CLERICS (?) who do kung-fu with guns--that's right, KUNG-FU WITH GUNS--yep, that's good; and apparently, the government only needs 2 or 3 clerics to police all of society.<br />Don't let anyone fool you into thinking that this is a \\"deep\\" or \\"serious\\" work of science fiction.  It's cheap genre trash that hides behind Philosophy for Dummies and an art house cast.<br />BUT I do recommend that you see EQUILIBRIUM.  It's hilariously bad and makes a great companion piece for a bad movie night with BATTLEFIELD EARTH, DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, or SHOWGIRLS.
B000089RVX|5.0|The music by Evanescence was first well known thanks to the Daredevil soundtrack.  I heard &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; on the radio and had to download it.  I downloaded most of the CD at least 2 weeks before it was even in the stores.  The songs on the CD made me want to buy the professional quality even more.  The lyrics are amazing and easy to relate to, and Amy Lee's voice is almost heavenly in an eerie sense.  Songs like &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot; still give me chills.  I highly recommend this CD!  It's a keeper.  =)
B000059XVS|5.0|This is the first and last time Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif would really shine on film.  (They are both among my favorite actors)....This film is beautifully shot.  It is an exquisite film and the actors, scenery and music are spectacular.  There was some chemistry between O'Toole and Sharif that was never again created by each in any other film...i love this film and could literally watch it everyday.  When it first came out at the theaters i saw it 14 times...it is as breathtaking today as it was then.
0684833395|1.0|The story of Catch-22 is a story unlike most war stories. With new characterization in every chapter, a different type of story is created that is unlike any other.  If I were to rate this story though, I would give it a \\"1\\" for being the worst book I have ever read.  The story of Catch-22 lacks major elements needed in a story to make that story exciting and understandable.<BR>  The story is about a bombardier named Yossarian who is serving in World War II at a station in Pianosa,Italy.The character of Yossarian is uncaring and selfish, and all he cares about is being able to go home to America when he completes all his missions.Another thing is that all the conversations in the story tried to make all the characters seem funny, but actually I think it made the book more boring.All the other characters in the story also are very much like Yossarian in the same respect.<BR>  I thought this was an unengaging book with all its unimportant conversations and description of characters with no plot.Also, the unintelligent and nasty characters added to the pain.I could barely even read the book because it bored me to death.This book should not be a classic #1 bestseller, but the worst and most pointless book of all time.
0345409671|5.0|Anne Rice has dazzled me for a good year now.  I am a new addition to the Anne Rice world you could say.  My friend's mother love these books and told me to go read one because I reminded her of Louis.  So I read it, missed the comparison but got immediately hooked on the story.  I'd have to say the books up until Memnoch are suberb.  <br />Interview With The Vampire, classic, there's nothing better.  Rice's vivid descriptions of color and scenery are excellent.  She brings you into a whole no world and makes you believe that these things, these vampires, existed and are in all the corners of the world.  If you don't believe it you know you at least pretend you could soar the skies and travel and have all these fantasmic powers.  Rice may not creature literary classics,  but what really makes a literary classic?  Insanity and racism.  Go ahead and look at classic literature sections of your library.  All that it takes to be a classic is an author who was ballsy enough for their time to come out and speak about racism or someone to get so detailed in the mind of an insane person.  There's no unique style of writing (Hemmingway is the exception to that).  So, in now being a classic,  Anne Rice is still a genius in her own sense.  <br />Bad points about the Vampire Chronicles in General.  <br />-Someone is near death and becomes a vampire<BR>-Someone comes and has someone tell you the story of their life hence starting a whole book.<BR>-The above two repeated enough to bore you.<br />Those reasons are why I have to say that the first 6 books in the series are excellent.<BR>Interview, Lestat, Queen of the Damned, Body Their, Memnoch, and Armand are good.  It goes downhill with Armand though.  Armand is the last real good story that brings you to a not so familiar place and somehow brings it to its dark eerie life.  Pandora is Rome, so familiar, so boring, plus the book is printed in such an odd way as to take up a lot of space.  Rice needn't have tried to fool us, the book was too short, useless.<br />On to Memnoch, above all my favorite book in the series.  I am an open minded Christian.  I have no church because all churches hold boundaries that make it impossible for me to admit myself to such hypocrisy.  Rice dazzles the lucid minds with her descriptions of creation.  Chrous' of Angels, God, God Incarnate, the story of Christ, the coming of the Devil.  All of these things are so interestingly described.  It's something that you can't help but feel raging emotion over, either positively or negatively.  I have forced a few of my Russian Orthodox friends to read it and they are deliberating the first hundred pages still so that I can't get much out of them as to their emotions on it.  Still, the story is suspenseful and opens slow like most Rice stories.  Then imburses you in this beautiful yet terrifying depiction of creation and religions in general.  As the open minded one I think now that all religions have the general idea, yes it has changed a life.  It seems all rather childish to totally believe everything Rice says but it still creates a beautiful world for you.  Heaven and Hell are depicted in such realism that you love it.  You fear hell, you adore heaven.  You wish to bypass the terrible void that awaits you post-mordum.  Ahh, I loved it so much and I hope you all shall as well.  If you are new to Rice and haven't read this far yet, you will soon be surprised.  If you are just an open minded human being and like religions please do yourself a favor and check this book out at the least.  Buy it and read it, pure beauty.<BR>Adios
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is what the music industry has been needing.  An awesome talented band with real meaning in their music.  Amy Lee's voice along side Ben Moody's guitar playing are by far way ahead of their time.  They are only 21-22 years old, yet sound as if they've been putting out albums for years.  Each song has the potential to be a #1 hit.  It's weird to hear people compare them to Linkin Park after hearing Bring Me To Life, but when they hear the rest of the album, their thoughts quickly vanish.  Each song devoures you into a journey that you cannot escape.  The best part of this album is that it is absolutely unflawed.  If this isn't album of the year, then there won't be an album of the year.  Just think that if this talented band can produce an album this amazing, they can only get better with time.  The variety in their sound to appeal to a lot of people and that will show true, just give them a month or so.  People everywhere will have no choice but to stop and listen.  The rock world better get ready, Evanescence will be around for a long time.
B000084T18|5.0|this album is one of my faveroutes extremly good lyrics from start to finish. Track 4,10 and 12 especially. 50 cent is an extremly clever artist in this album and im sure it will impress u 2.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Sure they may not have \\"The\\" in their band title, but Interpol shares the basis of their music with bands like The Strokes and The White Stripes.  What band is it that Interpol \\"borrowed\\" from you say?  Well only one of the greatest bands of all time in Joy Division.  <br />But while The Strokes for example take all the fun out of Television and The Velvet Underground by making their sound radio friendly (hard to believe they could bastardize TVU as bad as they did), Interpol only strengthens their musics by bringing in other band's influences.  <br />Sure they are a tad pretentious, but honestly I'd rather have pretention in music rather than the dull, fake angst of today's modern rock.
B000001ESF|4.0|I first heard Rush when I was about twelve years old, I bought \\"Chronicles\\" with some of my birthday money. I had to say at the time I didn't really care for their music. I am now fourteen, and I guess my music taste has changed drastically since then, bacause I now enjot their music a lot more. And this album \\"2112\\" introduced me to their unique songwriting skills. When I first heard the title track, I was absolutely blown away by the incredible musicianship and how they wrote the song in movements instead of the usual way. The other songs are gems also, including one of my favorites, \\"A Passage to Bangkok.\\" \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" \\"Something for Nothing,\\" and others are definitely must have music. 4/5
078401213X|4.0|Ah, forget that the idea that the stock market couldn't possibly be predicted by pattern unless you knew what every single solitary buyer and seller was doing at that very moment that you decided to measure. Then it'd just change again a second later as new traders enter the system. That's just what this movie purports Euclid the computer can do though, and its brilliant, self medicating schizoid programmer Max stumbles on the pattern which incidentally happens to be the numeric representation for the building blocks of all matter. This quest brings him to the attention of sinister inside traders and Hasidic Kabbalists who know the pattern to be the true name of God. Max desperately tries to keep his secrets to himself, but if the traders and the Kabbalists don't get him, the sheer power of the knowledge sure does, and decides it is best not to know at all. The bleachy, grainy black and white does much to accentuate the torment Max is enduring to find and keep his secret and his sanity. Very Eraserhead-like. Great movie concepts-a bit mishandled, but Kabalists, chaos theory, and drug abuse in one film? Neophyte cyberpunks should love this stuff.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is amazing its comparable to lacuna coil, but its much smoother and flows so well. Her voice is so awesome as well definately worth the money for the shrink wrapped version hint hint ;) support fine music like this and buy it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard Evanescence on their debut CD &quot;Origin&quot; put out a couple years ago. It was an amazing breath of fresh air during a stale time in the music industry. &quot;Fallen&quot; repeats this success and becomes (in my opinion) the most powerful album I've heard in years. Each track is better than the last, starting strong with &quot;Going Under&quot; and ending with a bang on &quot;Whisper&quot;. Amy Lee's beautiful -almost spiritual- voice will stay haunting you hours (if not days) after hearing it. It goes way above and beyond merely &quot;good&quot; music; it connects with you at an emotional level, leaving you hungry to experience it again. Deep, complicated lyrics blended with driving rock are balanced with a softer side, giving a unique sound that simply must be heard.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Others may have said it more eloquently here, but this album is a breath of fresh air! It is neither retro-classic, nor arena-rock, nor corporate schlock rock, nor nu-metal. Instead it's a slickly produced, and inspired, mix of rock and metal ingredients which defies classification. It seems to be an acquired taste, judging by the love-it or hate-it reviews. But for my money, this has been the best album released in a long time. Play it LOUD!
B000089RVX|5.0|I've listen to this CD from begin to end several times now and I can honestly say that this band could possibly be taking a Grammy home for 2003. They are like a cross between Linkin Park and Tori Amos. The Lyrics are haunting on some tracks, uplifting on others and still deeper on other tracks. They definately have an edge to their music. What they bring is a new approach to rock, no teen age angst here,they bring a more positive outlook on life, these tracks are coming from their heart and soul. I hope they get the exposer they deserve.
B00008BXJF|4.0|   Robert Fripp's pushing 56 _ four years younger than McCartney and two years Ozzy's senior. That also makes him 38 years older than Avril Lavigne. Old enough to be her father, heavy enough to give her ears cramps.<BR>   Why would a chap like Fripp (who reminds me of my sophomore guidance counselor) make music to hurt young rockers? To King Crimson, they're nothing but chordal collateral damage.<BR>   Fripp still plays guitar sitting down, like he wants to tell us a bedtime story. But on Power to Believe his solos roar, gurgle and spew like a crocodile shredding Steve Irwin. `Level Five' sounds like Fripp demonstrating how to use guitar strings to remove flesh and fingerprints. On `Facts of Life,' he creates a wall of space-mandolin noise by channeling Bill Monroe, who's channeling Hendrix.<BR>   `Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With' finds Adrian Belew delivering a How-To-Play-Heavy 101 lecture (something about singing about nothing through a fuzz box) before spanking his students with a Strat solo that would be illegal in 20 states.<BR>   How's the rest of the band? They frighten Yes (have for years). And Korn (lack the khops). Buckethead's still kicking himself for joining GNR.<BR>   Sure, there's pretty stuff, too, ie `Eyes Wide Open.' But any 56-year-old can play that. <BR>   And this isn't your father's math rock.
0783239955|5.0|What a gem! Every so often, a movie comes along that can trascend both language and culture, and &quot;The Dinner Game&quot; (Le Diner de Cons) is such a film. Everything about it stands out. The writing is superb, keeping the film at such a comedic pace that you barely have enough time to catch your breath in between laughs. The actors, especially Villerte and Lhermitte are as equally good, both completely embodying the innocent oaf and conceited social man. If you've never seen the film, or even have a slight interest in it, I would whole-heartedly recommend a viewing of it, you will not be disappointed.
055357342X|5.0|Martin is my current favorite author. His series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is becoming my favorite fantasy series, though there are many out there that I enjoy. I must say, however, this volume of the series is so intense, and Martin is so willing to shock the reader with surprise deaths, that I could barely stand certain chapters of the book. I don't mean that in a negative way, either. I was thoroughly impressed with his willingness to take sudden, unexpected and horrifying turns in the story. He's also an excellent writer of prose, meaning his sentences sound nice and flow well, unlike many popular fantasy authors of the day. Good stuff!
B000089RVX|5.0|Yes ... I think Haunting is a good word for this album.  Those of you who were - much like myself - enthralled by Amy Lee's vocals as we first heard them in DareDevil and are thinking about purchasing this album .. SHOULD DO SO.  You won't be disappointed.<BR>I won't commit the great injustice of comparing an uprising group to any others already in existence.  I'm well aware of how difficult it is to carve out a niche in the music industry for young artists.  But I must say that Evanescence's sound is in fact quite unique.  Not for many years has a group's debut album sent shivers up and down my spine as Fallen has done.<BR>As I mentioned earlier, if you're thinking you might as well not buy the album because &quot;I already have the 2 best songs on the DD soundtrack&quot; then you had better think again ...
0783225970|5.0|This is trully the best movie I have seen , thats includes the godfathers part I&II. Alfredo Pacino accent was so real,he sounds more cuban than I do. This movie was alittle too lng but it works... Pacino plays the accent well, sounds just like dominicans in New york, but he is right on with the curse words because not many immigrants speak english and its much easier to learn the slang that proper english. This movie paints a realistic picture of how a small time crook gets to the top and how the american dream can become so corrupt.The ending is a little far fetched but its a great way to go out. The dvd showed horible, for a movie this good it could have gotten at least a better dvd. I hope they make the dvd again so i can buy it. Best ...movie I ever saw ma'ng lol.
B000089RVX|5.0|This Album raises the bar for any type of music. It is the most harmonious product I have ever seen come from the weaving of rock with classical styles. The lead singer, Amy Lee, Has one of the most amazing voices I have ever heard in my life. The album begins with the song \\"Going Under\\" which is only a taste of what is to come. The song \\"Bring Me To Life\\" is already well known, and was featured on the movie \\"Daredevil\\" <BR>   Very rarely do I ever find a CD that I like every song on it, but this is the one I have been waiting for. <BR>   The lyrics have such complexity and depth, that it almost seems misplaced in a rock band, and would almost better suit a book of poetry, but once again, Evanescence makes it work. Also, some songs include several religious undertones, such as Tourniquet. <BR>  I have to say, in no light way, that this is the best CD I have ever heard. I strongly recommend this to anyone who appreciates both rock and classical music.
0316921173|1.0|Rarely do I put a book down, no matter how bad it may be. This one I found myself thinking not about what I was reading, but rather how much more of it I had to read. When I got to page 230 (still over 750 pages to go), I couldn't take anymore. Flashy vocabulary and overly technical drug references are amusing for awhile, but when I found myself dreading picking up the book again, I knew it was time to stop. Easily one of the five worst books I've ever read.
0553801511|5.0|This next series of Robin Hobb is excellent! I thoroughly enjoyed the first trilogy (Apprentice Assasin) and was glad to find she had resumed the storyline.  Robin Hobb is a very gifted story-teller, unveils each character in such a way that you feel like you know them, and the plot keeps you reading page after page.  Unlike the Robert Jordan series (which I lost interest in after Book 6 or 7, I anxiously wait for the next book which may be another year or so.  These books are a must-read for any fantasy lover.  I do hope that Fitz bonds with another as it added such depth and dimension to his character.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Any band that is touted in the press as the second coming of rock and roll is inevitably going to end up suffering a backlash.  Don't listen to the extremists at either end.  The Strokes are neither great nor terrible.  Rather, they're simply a good band with pretty decent songs.  If you like stripped down, unpretentious rock and roll, you should like them.  Sure, they may be rich, uptown pretty boys with fashion industry connections, but who cares?  It seems to me that what matters is what comes out of my speakers when I play the CD.  It's no exaggeration to say that Julian Casablancas's vocals are nearly identical to Lou Reed in his Velvet Underground years, but they aren't VU clones.  The Strokes are generally a bit more tuneful if nowhere near as original and inspired as the Velvets were.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones may be a new talent, but at this point, she can't stack up against the jazz vocalists of the past...or the present, for that matter!  While Come Away with Me is a beautiful, elegant album, Jones doesn't have the maturity of someone like Diana Krall.  Heck, I think Beth Gibbons of Portishead fame is a better vocalist than this young lady!  She's no Ella, Billie, Sarah Vaughan, or Etta James.  She doesn't have the character, bellow, sensuality or bravada of these women.  She is a quiet, pretty, unthreatening vocalist...<br />Still, if you're looking for some mellow-out music to accompany that quiet dinner by the fire, this is right up your bowling alley.  I gave the CD several listens and then passed it on to my dad.
B00005S8FC|3.0|With the ever shrinking musical boundaries and endless crossover music, this disc is pretty good but needs something. it is as though they didn't know whether they wanted to produce old school tango or nu tango. It is electronically suspended Buenos Aires music for the new millenium by way of France. Highly relaxing yet invigorating, this tango chill out music reveals itself as soothing Latin soul. The use of the bandoneon/accordian gives the laid back grooves direction that point south while the lazy electronica give a dreamy texture for an innovative blend of styles. The haunting invocation on &quot;Queremos Paz&quot; is a song fitting our troubled times. On &quot;Epoca&quot; the feminine vocal stylings offers something  that salvages a repetitous beat just in time. &quot;Chunga's Revenge' has a dark edge to it but lacks fire. This is a good disc but could use some polish. Some tracks are just ok, really nothing  by comparison to Astor Piazolla. The use of dub does not constitute innovation yet there are some nice touches that make for an interesting disc.&quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; is a nice version of the music from the film but nothing more. &quot;Del Ruso&quot; starts out like some kind of electronica flamenco dance that settles into a fiery groove, puntuated by piano and violin for one of the best tracks on the disc. &quot;Vuelvo al Sur &quot; has a hypnotic effect that will test you to see if you have been chillin too much. All in all this a good CD and a good concept that needs to be further explored. Recommended for tango heads that want to chill.
0694507962|5.0|Anne Frank is about a girl who wrote a diary about her  life. The main charecters are Anne and her family. The main problems are that they're Jewish and the Germans were prejudice against Jewish people at that time. The Germans were sending them to concentration camps. My favorate character was Anne because she is a really brave girl who writes a diary about her life and her terrible tragedy.<br />I could relate to Anne Frank because I come from another country where I was born and I also was having security problems there.  I think I feel the same things she felt because sometimes I feel fear to be in Colombia, my native country.  That's what she also felt.<br />I liked the book a lot, and I didn't have a favorite part of the book, because I liked the whole book...<br />I would recommend this book to people because I think it's really interesting and it's a true story.  If I had to be someone in the book, I would be Anne because I would like to be recognized as a great writer in history.
B000008HZB|5.0|Jeff Lynne, the man behind Electric Light Orchestra and Traveling Wilburys stepped up and made a solo album. And a GOOD one.<br />This is easy, catchy rock, pretty much ELO without the synths and effects. This is more of an tribute to the good old days where rock where alive, and not the horribel grungewaste it is today. <BR>Only one medicore song on the album, \\"Save me Now\\", while the rest is great! The best songs are the superb \\"Lift me Up\\", \\"Nobody Home\\", \\"What would it take\\", \\"September Song\\", \\"Stormy Weather\\", \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"Blown Away\\".<br />WOW. Might as well call the whole record superb. George Harrison is on some of the songs to back him up, no wonder since they have worked close. The record sounds pure and real, it sounds like Lynne had a great time while recording this. The period after ELO`s fading was over, he had a new start, and he wanted to make some music again. <br />My only complaints about this album, is that it is TOO SHORT! And I am not only talking about a little short, it is way too short. About 40 minutes is not enough, of course thats how much he put on the album, but you just cant get enough of the album, the 40 minutes just zooms past you and leaves you for another round. Best thing is, the record gets better and better, just like an old bottle of Wine. <br />Ahh how do you put this little masterpiece on paper...<br />One thing though. The album can be very hard to find. You can almost forget finding it in a music store any longer, best choice would be Ebay or here on Amazon. <br />Second thing. Dont listen to this album expecting ELO. It is far from ELO. But after some time, I am not sure anymore who I like most...ELO or Armchair Theater.<br />Yes it is that good.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I can't think why I didn't write a review on \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" before, but I remembered that I had that movie so I decided to write on it today.<br />The story is about a boy named Harry Potter(obviously) and his parents who are actually a famous wizard and witch who were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort. But he does not know that, for his mean-spirited aunt and uncle had falsely told him that his parents had 'died in a car-crash'. Of course, there's the fat cousin, too.<br />One day, he discovers all about his parents, his real history, and also about the wonderful school for wizards and witches at Hogwarts when Hagrid, the keeper of keys and something(I forgot) of Hogwarts, meets him on Harry's 11th birthday. Of course, Harry leaves his aunt, uncle, and cousin and goes to Hogwarts with Hagrid.<br />The story goes on about a mysterious stone that makes you live eternally and a three-headed dog that's, obviously, VERY dangerous. It's all very interesting!<br />I think some kids might(MIGHT!) get scared some parts, like the part where the bad guy(not saying who!) shows his two-faced head. Or the part where Harry's opening a book and the face comes roaring out. THAT was surprising and scary in a way. But, it's just my opinion because I got kind of shocked those parts. :)<br />The Quidditch Match was really cool, a little bit silly, but still very cool! I also loved the part where all the foooood comes out(mmmmm!) All in all, Harry Potter was a bit scary and surprising, but it was still very fun and exciting to watch!
0790729652|4.0|I have always thought Batman were the best superhero. No mumbojumbo powers, no silly slogans or sickening peace and love.<br />The 60`s series was totally horrible, it pictured a Batman that was downright embarrasing. There was no style, there was no darkness, only a stupid, dumb fat Batman.<br />Then came Batman the Movie.<br />Tim Burton saved Batman from the  60`s, took him into a world of nightmares, violence and deaths, changed him from a fat bum with slapstick jokes til a man on the edge with enough vengance to take down the whole Gotham City. Yup, no fun and games anymore.<br />The story in short words.<br />Jack Napier is ordered to rob a safe in a chemical plant, but is set up by his boss, and to complicate everything, Batman arrives and everything ends with Napier taking a dip into the acid pool...turning into who we know<br />as....The Joker. He clicks and starts a spree of crime in Gotham City, and its up to Batman to stop him.<br />Simple but effective, the story is pretty good, while it takes a few liberties with origin of the characters, it does not hinder the movie, but the major key in Bruce Wayne`s story is...well I can understand Tim Burton`s decision, and it was a bit surprising, but also a bit TOO obvious. You`ll see..;)<br />On to the DVD. The movie it self scores skyhigh. But I was very disappointed with the DVD. There is NOTHING on it except for the film. Of course the film is the most important, but hello, we are talking one of the best superhero movies ever. No sweet deleted scenes, no making of, no hidden endings, interviews or anything.<br />However, if you can look past that, and think the movie is the only thing that you want(which should be enough!), this is an absolute winner. The Cover is simple, but yet it wields so much symbolic power that one cannot help but being impressed by it.<br />I will give the movie 5 stars, but for the simple and poor DVD it gets down to a 4. Dont let it hinder you, this is absolutely one gem you WANT to have in your collection. Highly recommend the soundtrack too(the Score, not the one of Prince)your collection. Highly recommend the soundtrack too(the Score, not the one of Prince)
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is one of those movies I always saw in the video store and never thought of renting, but a friend loaned me a copy, raving about it, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  This is one FUNNY movie!  With just about as much quotable dialogue and memorable scenes as a movie like &quot;Young Frankenstein,&quot; it is absolutely hilarious -- a must see.  It's one of those films you can watch again and again, either alone or while sharing some tea with friends (and a few Finnish Dwarfs and Moiri Tribesmen).  Great silly fun entertainment, and an insightful look into what it must be like to be &quot;really, really, really, ridiculously good-looking.&quot;
B00005AQE8|5.0|this album has no flaws. it's the bible of the rap industry. I think that Makaveli:7 day theory is the only other album that is slighty better than All Eyes On Me. before this album, 2pac dominated the rap game, but this album put him in a whole new league. U can't step to Pac's deep lyrics and poetic flows covering the album. The rap game won't be the same without Pac, and i have never gotten sick of this album in the 4 years that i've had it. It's just one of those albums that just knocks u off ur feet. If u like rap or even if u don't, pick this one up. U can't be dissapointed. Period.
B000001GQQ|5.0|This CD is an all-around excellent buy. Where shall I start?<BR>  This recording of the Prokofiev 3rd is one of my all-time favorites ( and I have heard a lot).  Argerich knows where to stretch, where to speed up, just how to pull you along in the most deliciously tantalizing way.  She keeps the piece on edge, you can practically see the adrenaline rushing through the orchestra and conductor.  How does she strike each note with such purpose, yet sound like she is constantly reinventing, waiting to see what new idea she can spring onto the orchestra?<BR>  <BR>  The Ravel concerto is very good.  As a pianist who is learning this piece myself, I think she does an excellent job, though I would have liked to hear some more accenting on those Gershwin-esque riffs. She does capture the hustle-bustle sound of the city, however. The second movement of this piece is where she really shines, letting us glide along with her, looking at a peaceful city skyline. The third movement is pure Argerich.<BR>  <BR>  The Gaspard...wonderful!  She throws off some of the most difficult music passages in piano literature like they were mere trinkets.  But her ease does not imply shallowness...she allows her deep sonority to explore every edge of Ravel's glorious, frightening, sad, and sometimes wrenching music.<BR>  All in all, this is a must have for any pianist, Prokofiev or Ravel fan, or Argerich fan.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The best rap album there is period. The next album that might be able to step to it is All Eyes On Me, another 2pac classic. I've never heard such deep lyrics on an album. No one flows quite like Pac. He changed the whole rap game, and every rapper today wants to be Pac. I recommend this album to anyone, even if u don't like rap, u'll like this album. It's untouchable. You cannot dislike this album.
B000089RVX|5.0|It has been a long time coming for a band in mainstream culture to have the talent and the meaning taht Evanescence has.  I have seen the band live and even chatted with them on their message boards(Exodus Evanescence).  Fallen is a wonderful CD with a great mix of styles.  The diversity is seen in the slow melodic tones of \\"My Immortal\\" to the quick beats in \\"My Last Breathe\\".  This CD is a must for any album collection!!
B000089RVX|5.0|A new sound has come to the music world in the form of a rock band from Little Rock, AR. They are called Evanescence. Led by the angelic and haunting voice of 21-year-old founder Amy Lee and backed by co-founder Ben Moody (lead guitar), John LeCompt (guitar) and Rocky Gray (drums), Evanescence puts a new twist on the term 'rock band.'<br />Their music is dark, dramatic, epic rock that explores the depths of love and despair. Their influences include Bjork, Danny Elfman and Tori Amos. The music produces an amazing connection between haunting beauty and primal heaviness.<br />Their first major label release, &quot;Fallen,&quot; hits stores March 4. The album is amazing. With songs like &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; (from the movie &quot;Daredevil&quot;), the anthem &quot;Tourniquet&quot; and the eerie &quot;Haunted,&quot; this album takes you on an emotional roller-coaster ride and leaves you begging for more.<br />The combination of Lee's vocals, the harmonies, violins, guitars and drums create an amazing world of sound. All of the songs are great, but the one that stands out is &quot;My Immortal,&quot; a sad but beautiful song about losing someone and trying to overcome it.<br />Here is a sample of the lyrics from &quot;My Immortal:&quot;<br />When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears<BR>When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears<BR>And I've held your hand through all of these years<BR>But you still have all of me<BR>You used to captivate me<BR>By your resonating light<BR>But now I'm bound by the life you left behind<BR>Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams<BR>Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me<br />Lee's voice shows much emotion and the background voices are a beautiful mix of love and tragedy. The background music consists of a piano (played by Lee), violins and a guitar.<br />The album is a must-have for anyone who loves sultry, orchestrated rock music. Evanescence is currently on tour and will appear on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on March 6.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD has my kind of rhythm, energy, and depth I enjoy.  It may seem short with 11, but I like all of the songs -even though I may have heard Bring Me to Life a bit too much- especially \\"Going Under\\".  Amy has one of the sexiest voices I've heard in music.  I'd rather have 11 great songs out of 11 than 6 out of 18 anyday.

B00008BXJF|5.0|First up, stop thinking of King Crimson as a &quot;progressive rock&quot; band.  They are not stuck in the early '70's, or (for other imaginations) the early '80's.  KC is now in this century and has something to say.  &quot;The Power To Believe&quot; is practically a concept album, a--dare I say it?--post-9/11 contemplation of the world and &quot;hope,&quot; constructed from Belew's lyrics and a coherent yet high-contrast flow of emotions and textures.<br />Second, King Crimson has found its modern voice.  The ProjeKcts were a series of experiments; &quot;The ConstruKction of Light&quot; was the trial results.  Now KC has combined its own heritage with its recent forays (excuse me, Mr. Mastelotto, your drum'n'bass is showing) to create a legitimately NEW incarnation of the Mighty Crim.  It's a beautiful and powerful thing.<br />So forget about categories, and abandon your preconceptions.  Both Crim-heads and non will find this a rewarding and meaningful album.  (Now I just await the live show!)
B00007H1Y2|5.0|This might be the record of the year. Subtle, bewildering, mysterious. On a par with Cooder's best work, this record seems both timeless and unclassifiable. The guitar interplay is first-rate, the supporting instrumentation stellar, and all the soloists go for the throat. <br />If you've ever liked Ry before, you must get this.
B00005QZWI|2.0|As much as I loved the music while watching the movie, the soundtrack is disappointing.  It's very repetitive and after a while, it gets annoying listening to the same themes over and over.
0316666343|5.0|The book was so good. It has all the elements for a good novel and more. My only complaint was the descriptions were sometimes a little too long. Read it!
0316666343|2.0|I have to say I was VERY disappointed in this book.  I think it had excellent potential but I found that none of the characters ever really developed into people that I felt drawn to or even interested in.  Also, I am soooo completely disappointed as to how the main issue in the book is resolved. I don't want to give anything away but I felt it was a total cop-out and if it had happened sooner in the book, I simply would have stopped reading.  Since it was a few pages from the end I finished.<br />This book certainly wasn't a waste of my time but I can't say I would recommend it to anyone.
0780620003|4.0|Al Simmons is killed by his boss and goes to hell.  He comes back to Earth to take revenge on Wynn and to see Wanda again.  With him is the hardly recognizable John Leugiazamo (I know I misspelled that) as a clown from hell.  Leugiazamo has the best lines in the movie in my view.  Al is soon called &quot;Spawn&quot; by the clown.
B00008HCCF|4.0|This young lady is blessed with raw talent and I can't wait to see her evolve (mature) into a refined and polished performer. The sound, video and production of the dvd is first rate and Norah performs in a laid back, confident style. She is very comfortable with her audience and they connect. The only thing missing in her performance is the depth and soul that comes only with some life experiences that she is far too young to have yet acquired. I'm perfectly willing to let her enjoy her youth, but the best is yet to come.
0316666343|1.0|The good news: this book has a clear, swift style, an affecting closing vignette, and a solid opening chapter.  But after that first chapter, you hit the first one: our fourteen year old narrator describes someone's hair as &quot;shiny like the promises in magazines.&quot;  These overwrought, cloying metaphors start popping up every few pages until soon, the whole book is overwrought and cloying.  In 328 pages, Ms. Sebold attempts to capture ten years in the lives of at least ten people, one of them a narrator looking down from &quot;heaven.&quot;  Of course, this task is impossible if one wishes to do it with any complexity or subtlety, so Ms. Sebold instead relies heavily upon predictable New Age gobbledygook.  Fans of contemporary, realistic literary fiction (Russo, McDermott, Morrison, Cunningham), take note: this is not for us.  It is a readable, shallow, &quot;heartening&quot; mainstream book.  Don't believe the hype.
B00005AQF7|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love this CD for the most part, but when they remastered the CD they left my absolute favorite track off. Most of you who've bought the CD probably notice that it ends at track 18 with a track called \\"Pump Pump.\\" However, I dubbed the tape off of the original CD when it first came out (my older brother has a copy) and there are two differences. 1.) \\"Tha Next Episode\\" is listed as a track on the cover, and I'm guessing the track got cut from Snoop's album at the last minute, then Dre put in on The Chronic 2000 when he got the chance. 2.)there are 19 tracks on the original master. Track 19, entitled \\"Gz Up Hoes Down\\" was my favorite track, and I was utterly distraught to find it was cut from the remastered release, which is the only one you can find in stores now. I try not to download music off the internet, but now I think I will so I can get this track. To my knowledge, it's not on any other CD currently available. Big disappointment.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This movie is very true to life....It is Kevin Smith's greatest work.  The movie rocks! Everyone should have it as part of their collection!
B000084T18|4.0|This Album is pretty good. In da Club and Wanksta are both hot songs, that have been played for everyone to hear. I think that Many Men is the hottest song on the album. There are also a lot of other good songs on there.
B0000042MY|5.0|Awesome! That is what this CD is.  I've been listening to this CD since it came out and this is 2003.  I never tire of it.  I've had people ask me what it is when they hear it on my car stereo.  Once, years ago, when I was shopping for new stereo speakers, I took the CD in to the stereo store and played &quot;The Kiss&quot;.  A woman and her husband approached me while it was playing and wanted to know about the music.  They said it was wonderful. You will not regret purchasing this CD.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|Ive been a film score lover for ages, and Im still amazed with every new release from those classical composers such as John Williams, Elmer Bernstein, Thomas Newman and Philip Glass. The Director Stephen Dladry couldnt have done a better choice than this - a composer that really know how to compose about how time pass us by, or better, The Hours. He has done marvellous compositions on his previous scores about this theme on such films as &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;, &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot; and &quot;Naqoiqatsi&quot;. <BR>But this time he outdid himself in original, touching, breathtaking and heartbreaking compositions, every single note is ispiring and reachs the very bottom of your soul bringing feeling sometimes similar of the main characters themselves. The highlight is obviously the piano, which fits perfectly in each theme and flows in a light yet deep way. <BR>The best tracks are defenetly &quot;Morning Passages&quot; and &quot;The Hours&quot; which are worth the value of this purchase alone. <BR>Go ahead and check it out to see Philip Glass in his own particular way of bringing emotion of the movie to every single space in your heart and soul.
078322608X|5.0|Monty Python alumnus Terry Gilliam helmed this surprise masterpiece which features some of the finest performances in the careers of Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, and Brad Pitt.  James Cole (Willis) is &quot;volunteered&quot; to travel back in time to trace the origins of a virus that will wipe out most of the humanity on the planet, but as he is slingshotted back and forth through time he begins to question his sanity and his perceptions of reality.  Along the way he is incarcerated in a mental asylum under the care of a psychiatrist who is strangely drawn to him (Stowe), and he encounters a deranged inmate (an Oscar nominated Pitt) on his journey to uncover the truth.  Willis is superb in his role, words can't describe it alone.  Pitt however, is more than worth noting, and his nomination for Best Supporting Actor was more than well deserved (his characterization of Jeffrey bears a striking similarity, albeit a few cans short of a six pack, to another role of Pitt's in Fight Club as Tyler Durden).  Gilliam's direction is as fantastic as it ever was.  Even though he had a relatively modest budget for a major studio, his uncanny vision makes the film work.  In the hands of another director, 12 Monkeys would have been a failure, in Gilliam's hands we get a dark yet witty apocalyptic film with riveting performances and an unforgettable climax that must be seen to be believed.  Christopher Plummer also stars as Pitt's scientist father, and look for David Morse in a pivotal role.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I see this as Alanis' meditation album, the one where she discovered God and even got over herself a bit... Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is one of her very best albums, the one that cemented me as a big fan! You see it starts out in this little movie theater and goes into a confessional and even deals with suicide (her suicide).  There is one happy little track, the track where the title is taken from &quot;So Pure&quot; that is free and probably one of her best songs.<BR>Alanis is a free spirit with a wonderful lyricaly sence and a great voice (I think so anyway). This is one of the most underated albums in the history of the world, you should pick this one up!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|this girls are so very good and their vids even better!!<BR>I can't get enough of the video and play it every day on my computer. I hope they will come to the netherlands to and I will be the first to buy a ticket!!<BR>Hope to hear from them much, much more!!
0783240287|5.0|Two college friends (Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber)got together to write a light musical for a school project and years later it becomes an international hit with productions being mounted everywhere from small elementary schools to lavish Broadway extravaganzas. Who'd a thunk it? But this DVD is able to give the viewer both the flavor of seeing that &quot;Next Door Neighbor&quot; in the local production as well as all the glitz that broadway has to offer. The staging is superb, beginning in a small English scholl auditorium, we are rapidly transported to Broadway and back again (With enough stops in between to give any travel agent a dizzy spell). The acting and singing are superb, with the most unlikely of &quot;Teachers&quot; finding their way into the Biblical story of Joseph. The staight-laced piano/music teacher is transformed into a bomshell of a seductress (Joan Collins). The Headmaster becomes the head of the house of Isael, Jacob (Richard Attenborough), And that former Teen Idol , and now Game-Show host, Donny Osmond, is wonderful in the Title role of Joseph. And you'll never guess what character shows up to to portray the Pharoh (Pharoh, isn't another name for &quot;The King&quot;) The story is artfully narrated by the singing and acting Talents of that star of the London stage, Maria Friedman. Entertaining for all ages, do not miss the opportunity to see the transformation of this moving Biblical story into a thouroughly Entertaining piece of theater that has a message fo everyone.
B00005JLF5|4.0|It's hard to belive it's been ten years since the first season of DS9 ,and how much in the following seasons that the characters have changed & evolved.   Before The Dominion,The Defiant,Strategic Operations Officer Worf,and Vic Fontaine,we have the humble beginnings of the station formerly known as Terok Nor.Sisko was more of an administrator than the passionate individual he is to become,Kira Nerys is unsettlingly fiesty,Julian Bashir rates high on the arrogent meter,and Jadzia Dax comes off as somewhat aloof.The shakedown season still plays better than the latter seasons of any of the following Trek Series(Voyager,Enterprise).The standout episodes include Past Prologue,Captive Pursuit,Progress,In The Hands Of The Prophets,and Duet,which in my opinion is the best ever DS9 episode.    Even after a decade and nearly four years since the final episode,DS9 still manages to be the best Trek ever,and here's where it all started.
B00005N915|4.0|I watched the film a few days ago and it seems to me that some reviewers cannot separate reality from fiction. If Paul B. does not like the characters played by the actors in the film, fair enough. But we have to give credit to the actors for their performance as  \\"scum of the earth\\" because they do it very well. I admit that I did like the Character of Robert de Niro, good old Robert, always has the knack for picking peculiar characters and I found his part of the cool, creepy Lucifer hilarious. <br />Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke's) is hired by a New York Lawyer, Louis Cypher to track down a singer, Johnny Favourite who disappeared several years ago without paying his debt back to Cypher. Angel's search for Johny takes him all the way to New Orleans where he is suddenly caught up in a series of gruesome ritualistic murders.  As the film progresses Rourke's grubby Character becomes more and more dislikeable (we know now who Bruce Willis modeled himself on) with his self-obsessed attitude and obvious lust towards anything with a pair of ti.s and pretty face regardless of age or motherhood. You soon start to wonder how true is Harry's apparent innocence especially as he starts to become tormented by those violent \\"voodo-charged\\" visions and flashbacks that take him closer and closer to his \\"true identity\\" and that of those in Favourite's entourage.<br />The film is atmospherically amazing with its haunting imagery of evil, sex, darkness, violence, horror that gives you an exotic picture of Parker's vision of Hell. The use of blood and violence is abundant but not abused which keeps the feeling of mystery throughout the film. <br />At the end of the film you will kind of think that Harry deserves everything he gets and understand why he is such an \\"as..ole\\". I couldn't help but finding it funny, almost ridiculous but it's a classic ending and it fits perfectly with the story even if it still leaves you with a few unanswered questions.<br />It is definitely a cult film rather than a blockbuster, one of those films that you have to watch again to spot the details you missed. I can see how an American audience would not appreciate and why it would shock some viewers but for fans of Alan Parker, this would be another one to own from his diverse collection.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles 1 is a great album. Lucky for me it was released the day after my birthday! November 14, 2000. It was December 2000 when my grandma gave me a copy of the CD. I like all four of the Beatles, but my favorite is George Harrison. He had te best songs. I just can't believe that &quot;Something&quot; is the only song on the disc. Ah, what the heck! There's one thing I'm confused about: On the &quot;Day Tripper&quot;/&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; single, I wonder what one was on the A-side and what was on the B-side. Ah, never mind. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, YOU ROCK! And the line from the Beatles song &quot;The End&quot; from the Abbey Road album: The love you take is equal to the love you make!
0553573403|1.0|Robert Jordan writes some harsh stuff - but he has some light in his world.  There is no nobility in this fictional world.  This is not \\"realism\\".  This book seeks to bring forth only the vile, base, and viscious - added is the VERY explicit sex scenes.  I ordered book 1 and 2 on a whim (a mistake I'll not make again).  I read some of book 2 as it came in first until I couldn't take any more (about 1/3).  It was even worse!  I skimmed book one and found the same when it finally came in.  There's better fiction out there that won't stoop to \\"base vulgarity\\" and all that is course and vile to paint the moods.
B00003CXUM|5.0|In the mood for love is easily vintage Wong Kar Wai - Slow scenes of reflection, simple characters leading simple lives, excellent cinematography, slow but deliberate pacing and a dark moody atmosphere. Because of this, a lot of people call this an &quot;art&quot; film. And for every people who say this is an excellent HK noir film, there are people who will insist that this is a boring, slow and shallow movie.<br />The story is simple. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and his wife move into their apartment on the same day that Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband move into the apartment next door. Initally, their relationship consists of passing pleasantries and mundane mahjong games with the neighbors. Soon, circumstances like their spouses' absence, and the suspicion that their spouses have a thing going on results in a friendship between the two. In the process, The two falls in love.<br />But this definitely isn't a love story. Remember, this is a Wong Kar Wai film. It's never a love story but rather a story about love. That love grows and eventually fades. That no one ever really does anything extraordinary or heroic for most of their lives. If you're looking for a good narrative story, rich character development, you will not find it here.<br />What you'll find are dark atmospheres/settings and conflicting emotions. Take note of the excellent physical details. The way Maggie cheung runs her hands thru her hair, the way smoke curls up from Tony Leung's cigarette, dark walls and alleyways on their way back home or from the noodle vendor.<br />This is a Wong Kar Wai movie not to be missed. It excels in its simplicity. Definitely not for the impatient. Here, the actors and the situations tell the story. Not much dialogue, not much action but the result is excellent in its quiet way.
0380729407|5.0|This is a great read. Any fan of Ray Bradbury must read this book. I loved it from start to finish.
B00007E8V4|4.0|This album is not as good as Toxicity, but it comes damn close! Songs on Steal This Album! such as Innevision and Streamline defy SOAD and even metal. But others, such as F**k the System aren't as good simply because they are too frantic and the lyrics can be disappointing. But when this album shines, it really shines! During the album's beautiful moments, it's easy to lose touch with reality for a while! The best songs are terrific, but great songs on this album are few and far between. On Toxicity, almost every song was perfect. No other metal album will ever be as good as it was! The best parts of the album are the more quiet moments such as in Innervision, and Serj's hauntingly beautiful(yes, I said beautiful) voice! When System of a Down gets together, they are a work of art in the rock world. This album clarifies that! Although it wasn't the best album with the best songs from SOAD, any metal or System of a Down fan will find it worthwile to Steal This Album today! Highlights are: Mr. Jack, Innervision, and Streamline. True System of a Down!
B00003CY6M|5.0|Another great John Cusack movie. Serendipity is a chick flick, but even guys will appreciate this, because we've all been in this guys shoes before. When New Yorker Jonathan meets Brit beauty Sara. They share a few perfect hours together before parting ways, leaving future encounters to her quirky obsession with fate. They're about to marry their respective fiances, and urgently hoping for destiny to bring them back together. Under the casual direction of Peter Chelsom this starry-eyed romance offers no surprises, but it has a comforting familiarity, made warmer by the easy chemistry of the leads, with obligatory best-friend support by Molly Shannon and long-time Cusack pal Jeremy Piven.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril said she wanted to do this her way . . . she did. Avril said she wanted to reach the younger and the older music audience; bridge the gap . . . she did. Avril said she wanted to write, sing and play from the heart . . . she did. She played and sang her heart out on this album. &quot;Let Go&quot; is a great, fresh breath of new music. Avril rocks on tunes like &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot;, where the guitar work is tight and hard. The fast paced track &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; is a cool, punky sort of tune. Yet, she still manages to drop in catchy pop tracks like &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Mobile&quot; and really strikes a nerve with the thoughtful and emotional &quot;I'm With You&quot;. She has a great voice and isn't afraid to cover a lot of different ground with her vocals. The lyrics touch on a myriad of emotions and situations that span generations. I grew up on classic rock, and all I can say is this girl rocks! She is talented and has a great band behind her. There isn't a bad track on the CD. If you haven't given this CD a listen, you are definitely missing something! In Avril's own words (from the liner notes) &quot;Rock On and Peace Out&quot;!!
B00008IAMD|5.0|Carrying on the bard tradition, Cash covers classics (including his own) on this collection of songs about death, memories, religion, and love.  This album, which covers artists ranging from Hank Williams to Trent Reznor, also features Johnny's wife, June Carter, singing back-up on Bridge Over Troubled Waters.  From Danny Boy to the Beatles, Roberta Flack to the title track -- an original for this album -- this record is a testament to Cash's musical spirit - even as he approaches his 80's.  The man in black goes stark for this album using sparse accompaniment that allows his own torn and worn voice to carry this album.
B00005U11Z|5.0|probably alot of you know that there are some that say journey is not journey without steve perry.  i am not one of them!  the new steve, augeri, does an amazing job on lead vocals.  but i was even more impressed with steve smith's replacement!  deen castronovo is not only a master of the skins, this guy SINGS while he's all over the drum set---ditto on amazing.  a great DVD and worth your cash.
B00005OWEG|2.0|I hate the new footage. It ruined the flow of the movie and didn't add anything at all to the overall experience. I returned this movie and I won't be buying it until the original is remastered properly. Thanks for nothin.
B000063UR2|4.0|Having spent years hearing about Ridley Scott's now-legendary director's cut of &quot;Legend,&quot; I was eager to take a look at it. I never was a fan of the US cut of the film. It felt flat, the score was simply &quot;okay,&quot; and the editing was very distracting and even sloppy. Now having bought the 2-DVD Ultimate Edition set, I'm happy to say that Scott's director's cut will make any non-fan give the film a second chance. This is the film that Scott set out to make and it's joy to finally see &quot;Legend&quot; in it's original vision. Everything in this film is improved by Scott's cut. It's also refreshing to finally hear Jerry Goldsmith's original score. It may not be his greatest achievement as a film composer. But it comes pretty damn close! The DVD set itself is something to compliment. It's filled with extras. Disc 1 includes the director's cut with an anamorphic widescreen transfer and director Ridley Scott's commentary track. GREAT listen! Disc 2 features the fabled US cut along with an original documentary featuring new interviews from most of the cast/crew (minus star Tom Cruise and original composer Jerry Goldsmith), 2 long-lost deleted scenes, storyboards, photo galleries, trailers, tv spots, etc. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD set for the director's cut and all of the special features. God bless DVD!<BR>Film Rating:<BR>Director's Cut - B+<BR>US Cut - D<BR>DVD Rating: A
0451207521|5.0|Despite the fact that I was seriously ill I simply had to stay up to the wee hours to finish this brilliant book. This is the third Ken Follett book I have read and it has simply got to be the best book I have ever read in my life.<BR>The first two chapters look like most any WWII espionage novel but the plot quickly begins to thicken and then boil over with some simply marvellous and colorful characters who are a group of female [Kelly's Heroes-esque] misfits which brings together some quite comical moments blended in with the more sombre aspects of war-torn Europe.<BR>The group is led by Felicity \\"Flick\\" Clairet who plays a deadly game of Cat and Mouse with the Nazi torturer Major Dieter Frank in German-occupied France. The group's objective is to blow-up a telephone exchange in a French town in anticipation of the allied landings for D-Day.<BR>This book will definitely keep you reading. It is a little predicatable in places but then I struggle to find any title I couldn't tar with that same brush.<BR>This IS certainly an entertaining read and I personally can't wait for a Jackdaws movie? How about it Ken?
B0000508U6|5.0|No need to say anymore really.  Just listen and enjoy
B0000011N5|5.0|...and a shining example of how good music from the 1960s 'hippie' movement could be. Following on the heels of his hits 'Sunshine superman' and 'Mellow yellow', the two-record set 'A gift from a flower to a garden' gave Donovan the chance to spread out - the first album of the set (entitled 'Wear your love like heaven' in its individual release) presents Mr. Leitch with a full band, including some of his regular collaborators (Candy John Carr and Harold 'the very debonair' McNair) along with some fine UK studio musicians, including Jack Bruce of Cream, who plays bass on 'Someone singing'. The songs on this part of the album are all extremely hummable pop ditties with jazz and folk overtones (keyboardist Mike Carr does some beautiful work on vibraphone), and the lyrics give us a glimpse of Donovan at his 'hippie-dippie' (and that's NOT a derogatory term, trust me) best. He sings of love and the beauty of nature - and some of the songs sound like he's addressing them to children in his gentle, characteristic way. One tune - 'Under the greenwood tree' - is taken from Shakespeare; he ends the tune fading out with '...do the Willie the Shake...' 'Wear your love like heaven' is the only real hit from this double set, and it's a great, memorable song.<br />The second half of 'Gift' was also available separately, under the title 'For little ones' - which would seem to indicate an album of songs for children. While several of them would easily fit into that category - and the arrangements on this half, all acoustic, would make it more listenable for younger ears - the subject matter of some of the selections is a bit dark. I suppose I can admit here that MANY fairy tales are VERY dark, when viewed closely - so this is a minor point, and certainly not a complaint. Harold McNair is present on this half as well - his flute is perfectly integrated with Donovan's guitar lines, the mark of two musicians who know and respect each other deeply - along with string bass and percussion, all tastefully added. The arrangements are all pretty sparse, but beautifully so, with Donovan's acoustic guitar, occasional harmonica, and delicately picked banjo gently in the fore - and of course, there's Don's voice, an instantly recognizable instrument in itself, marvelously suited to his songs.<br />BGO Records has done a nice job with the re-mastering - they originally issued this in mono, unaware that it had ever been released anywhere in the world in stereo (it was only available in mono in the UK in its original release), then recalled their release, found a good stereo master, and re-issued it. The recording overall is very clear - the sound on Donovan's guitar is especially nice on the acoustic album, and the blending of the musicians on the more electric half is done very nicely indeed.<br />My only gripe is that the artwork that originally accompanied the acoustic half is represented here only in reduced images. The original set included an 8 X 10 page for each song on the second half, in different colours, on some very nice stock - not practical in a cd release, I know, but something in between the two presentations would have been nice. Ah well - another small complaint.<br />It's a grand thing that this recording is available again, and my thanks go to BGO for that. There's an American release of this set, available through Sony - and while the artwork mentioned above is reproduced more nicely there, the lyrics to the 'Wear your love like heaven' half are included as a single-page reproduction of the album art, and are so small that they're practically illegible. The deciding factor was that BGO had the integrity to withdraw their original release and reissue it in stereo -- it's a wonderful thing to see a company in the music business that cares enough to do that.  It's too rare a thing.  I had the opportunity to make a choice, and I chose the BGO edition.<br />Listening to this album, after all of these years, makes me think there's hope for usyet...us yet...
B00005JLZL|2.0|This movie looked bad from the theatrical previews, but I saw it anyway because a friend of mine wanted to check it out.  Unfortunately, I was not pleasantly surprised.<br />The main problem with The Life of David Gale is that the \\"surprise\\" ending was painfully obvious after about 45 minutes, so much so that I whispered to my friend that, since I knew what was going to happen anyway, I was tempted to leave and she could tell me later that I was right.  I eneded up staying, and much to my chagrin, not only was I right, but they tried to split the surprise ending into two separate twists rather than consolidating them and saving me some time.  <br />The purpose of a suspense film is to be suspenseful.  That's why most suspense films don't lend themselves to repeat viewings unless they're exceptionally well made.  However, if a suspense film fails to deliver a surprise when you watch it the first time, then it can only be described as a collosal failure.<br />On an unrelated and admittedly minor note: why does the film behave as if Austin and Hunstville are close to each other???  Texas is a big state, folks.  You can't just mosey on over to another Texas town or city like you're in Connecticut or something.  I know this is not very important, but it is really annoying if you know anything about Texas geography.<br />The reason I gave the film 2 stars rather than one are as follows:<br />1. I am an alumnus of the University of Texas, so all of the shots of UT and the city of Austin warmed the cockles of my heart.  That, however, is a rather esoteric reason to see a film.<br />2. The performances of Kate Winslett and Kevin Spacey were both solid.  Although Kate may have done a film or two previously that was set in a contemporary time, I had not seen them.  Her accent was excellent, her portrayal convincing, and, straight up, she looked awesome.  Kevin does a professional job, as it to be expected.  Tangentially, Rhona Mitra, who plays the grad student Berlin, is goingto be a star.  You heard it here first.<br />In sum, I'd skip this one.  If you do decide to check it out, I'd like to pass on a caveat to parents who choose to take their children to R-rated films, as did mine.  There are a couple of scenes of violence and sexuality that are rather more graphic than you might expect.  Do take this into consideration when making the decision to take any child under the age of 15.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|I think this album takes leaps beyond Tidal. The production on it is simply amazing. Very inventive, very fun. The lyrics are very witty (if you can get over the fact that sometimes Fiona sounds like a middle school girl with her choice of words) and interesting. &quot;On The Bound&quot; comes pounding in for an excellent opener. I have been reading alot of Aimee Mann comparisons on here, and I just don't see it. I'm a big Aimee Mann fan and they seem like they are on completely different planets. Sure they use the same producer, but Fiona's sounds is alot darker and moodier than Aimee's. While they do share one trait of cynicism, that's where it ends! Some other favorites are &quot;Paper Bag&quot;, &quot;Get Gone&quot;, and &quot;I Know&quot;. The only problem I see with this album and had when I first purchased it is that on the surface all the songs sound the same. After a couple of listens that goes away and you can see how individual each of the songs are. Fiona's locals get more of a chance on this record to shine through and show their grittiness. It's a love or hate thing. Some of the other reviewers of this album wish that it had stayed glossed over like in &quot;Tidal&quot;. I will admit that the album title is terribly pretentious and awful, but that has nothing to do with the music folks. All the music comes from the heart and they are all equally engaging. I suggest you pick it up, or if you are still unsure download a couple of songs and if you like them, then pick it up.
B00003CXAA|5.0|There have been reviewers writing full analytical essays about this DVD set...  Let me break it down.<br />Part I - excellent (Marlon Brando in the funeral home, best scene in the movie, he is truly a legend)<br />Part II - even better (Fredo and Micheal in cuba, talk about drama)<br />Part III - good, but does not live up to the first two, but still nominated for Best Picture, so it can't be as bad as people claim.<br />Its the Godfather, enough said... GO GET IT!
B00005V9HH|5.0|This movie without a doubt is one of the best (after-Hitchcock) movies ever made. It's about crime and punishment and the underestimation of facts and faces. Pure suspence, tention and mystery to the end. It's better not to reveal to much and for those who haven't seen it yet... What are you waiting for!!!
B000002BFL|5.0|This is one of his absolute best albums! Why it didn't move any copies when it was released is beyond me. I've been enjoying this album for a while now, and I really appreciate the excellent artistry behind it, as well as how he connected the album to THE GRAPES OF WRATH throughout the situations that occur in the lyrics of many of the tracks.<br />Who hasn't bought this album? Probably you. Buy it! What are you waiting for? There are so many people who call themselves fans of his and don't own his. They aren't fans in my book; if they owned this they'd be twice the fan. Buy this, listen, and be transported.
B000002UUX|4.0|This is perceived by many not only as Megadeth's finest hour, but as a great moment in Metal history. the hellish, Iron maidenesque guitars and Dave Mustaine's obnoxiously bad vocals is guaranteed to make you vomit. <BR>                                'Five magics' is brilliant with it's haunting guitar riff. 'Holy wars' is arguably megadeth finest moment and it isn't selling out. I would rate this album up there as an all time metal classic up there with iron Maiden's 'No. of the beast', metallica's 'master of puppets', yep the 3rd greatest metal album ever.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|...in other words, like nothing you've heard before. Comparable to his previous collaborations with Ali Farka Toure, Gabby Pahinui and VM Bhatt -- but only in the sense that it crosses national boundaries to synthesize a unique new sound. A pure moood piece, more like &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; than &quot;Bop Till You Drop,&quot; but absolutely divine in its own way. (Also reminiscent of classic trans-national rhythmic-instrumental explorations by Mickey Hart, especially &quot;Diga&quot; and &quot;Dfos&quot;.)
B000085RTZ|5.0|Do I have to say more about one of the GREATEST band right now in the melodic-power metal scene? Kamelot went from a acceptable power metal band to a astonishing great band. What I liked about this album is that is, in a way, more complex than their other cd's. Good music, catchy songs and good writing make this cd a good buying choice for those who like melodic-power metal. If you liked The fourth legacy and Karma, you shoul buy this cd!!
B000001EAQ|5.0|I first heard the song Discotheque and woundered who did that song and win I found out it was U2 I was pleasently surprised by it!!!  I mean I had never heard them sound like that before and I think it was great that they decided to experiment with techno, but I am glad they didn't keep doing it because I don't think it is their strong, that is still rock!!  Not to say I don't like this album because I do and only U2 could have mixed techno with rock and make it sound good!!  So if your a fan of U2 than I would get this one it will great addition to your music collection!!!!!!!!!
B00007LL7O|5.0|The definition of melodic power metal is in this cd. Almost all the music here resembles a little bit of the Infinite cd. In the other hand, I think that with &quot;Eagleheart&quot; they wanted to go a little bit in the comercial way. The rest of the songs are awesome too. If you liked Infinite, yo uwill like this cd. It is very melodic and of course, it came from the kings of melodic power metal.
B000089RVX|5.0|Like many others I too first heard them on the Daredevil soundtrack which also a good choice to own!!!  Anyway I saw this one in the store today and I remembered the two songs on that soundtrack and how good they were so I decided to buy it and it was only [$$] where I got it!!  I think this is one of if not the best new rock to come around in ages they really have an outstanding sound with their music that does draw into their world!!  I absolutely love the use of strings in the songs on the album and Amy Lee's vocals those two things make this album standout from other rock albums that are similar, but nowhere near as good as this group is!!!  If I were you I would pick this album whenever you can, you will not make any mistake of buying this one!!  I guarantee it!![.]
B000063JDE|5.0|What can words say about this movie? It's already been said...this is my favorite Lynch flick, running head to head with 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me'<BR>What I can say about this brilliant DVD version, is that the colors are vibrant, gorgeous and vivid...I've seen this on the big screen, and many times on the small...but I never saw it in such vivid color....the Lynchian themes of light, and shadow, never looked so good...I've read that David originally wrote the Frank Booth scenes with Frank sniffing helium gas...and to anyone who's seen Dennis Hopper's scenes, can you just imagine those, with a Helium voice...?  How scary, and more darkly comic, would that be?! <BR>The 'extra' interviews, with Isabella and Kyle, are wonderful..<BR>get this one, at all costs, if you are a Lynch fan...you won't be disappointed...
0060512806|5.0|This book keeps getting better and better. When I first read it I wasn't able to pick up on a lot of the themes but as I reread the book I saw things I had missed before and the book was no longer a 1168 page behemoth, but a page-turning novel. The book really kept me going and if you are at all interested in the exciting world of cryptography (which I obviously am) then this book is a must read. Any technoliterate individual needs this book on his or her shelf.
B00006CXXU|2.0|It's clear Christina Aguilera is trying to do something a bit more daring than the previous teenybopper stuff, at least as much as her company will let her. Much has been made of the provocative nature of her videos and lyrics in songs such as &quot;Drrty,&quot; but this album is not especially dirty to listen to. The real problem is that amidst the many digital edits and attempts to link things together is a paucity of melody, or when one does show up it sounds schmaltzy and dull, like another ballad from 1985. The digital sound is eventually annoying (the bass guitar sounds like it came out of a machine, as of course the drums actually did) and the many gimmicky cuts and splices that are supposed to dazzle us grow tiresome. Christina has a pretty good voice, if not an original or defining style, but her voice does not justify spending the money to buy this long mess of an album.
B000002H33|5.0|Now, let me state out that I have enjoyed virtually all of Metallica's CD's, from 'Kill 'em All' to 'Garage Inc' and have never once lost respect for them, ever.  Master of Puppets, while I enjoyed 'Ride the Lightning' much better, is still a masterpiece.  As soon as you hear the song 'Battery' you will have an idea of what the album is like, and after analyzing the lyrics closely, you should see what type of material they have: kind of dark, very heavy, lyrically strong and musically outstanding. <BR>     Although many people will not agree with me on this, you can tell that all the songs go together to form one story, as it faintly did on Ride the Lightning.  To me, it's almost as if Master is about creation, the rising of some unexplainable beast that cannot be tamed.  Is this just me?  Who knows, could be, but either way that's what it sounds like.  The greatest song on this CD is probably 'Welcome home, (Sanitarium)' only because of its soft and mellow sound, and its strong lyrics that is a first person narration about a man that is in an insane asylum.  Who could tackle that subject and make it sound good at the same time?  Only Metallica!  <BR>     Master of Puppet's was great, no doubt about it, and to this day I still enjoy it.
B00005JLH3|5.0|This film was one of the best of 2002/2003 in my opinion. A good sleeper hit. I had no idea the hard work that goes into college band performances. The acting was superb from Orlando Jones especially. A definite must see!
B00006879E|5.0|I LOVE this one. Turn it up loud! It's happy, it's pleading, it rocks and jazzes. The vocals are perfection and seem to dance with the music. Every song is awesome..
B000065U1N|3.0|I went to see this at the cinema and thought it was excellent. I then read the book and bought the DVD and loved it less. In fact each time I watch it, I like it a little less. Maybe because the book was so much better (probably because the book didn't have to be condensed into 2 hours).<br />I found certain battle scenes to be confusing, sometimes with no idea what soldiers I was watching. Plus the movie moves away so far from the truth at times that it becomes more or less fiction.<br />I like Ridley Scott, the movie is well-made and the extras are informative and entertaining but it does lack something.
B000002UJQ|2.0|Well, here it is, the most overated album of the 90s, along with that godawful Mellon Collie thing by the Smashing Pumpkins. I have no doubt the same people who [dote] over this boring overproduced [stuff] also think Billy Corgan is a musical genius. So about OK computer, i'll say that it's not nearly as bad as Kid a. This album though is all about the production. The music wouldn't sound anywhere near as good if it wasn't for all the  sonic tweaking and other studio tricks. Underneath it all the music is cold, boring and lacks identity. It sounds like they're trying to be the Pink Floyd of the 90s. Granted, some of the songs deserve merit, mainly tracks 4, 5 and 6. But the first 3 songs are so boring, i really struggled to get through them to find something worth listening to. I don't know what the concept of Ok Computer is suppose to be, but if it was for Thom Yorke to sing and write songs like a computer then he sure did succeed.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|I've always liked Hugh Grant and he is definitely in fine form here.  I loved the interaction between Hugh Grant's character and the child actor (who was also wonderful).  This movie could have become too sappy, but it struck just the right balance.  I would definitely recommend it.
B000068FXX|5.0|...they kicked out this very cool album featuring a strong crossover orchestral rock/accoustical piano flavored gem.  This album spent most of freshman year on my turntable, and on that of the guy across the hall, and the guy down the hall....<br />It's terrific to hear it again, and even if the CD seems a bit more &quot;juiced&quot; than the old LP...well it isn't too scratchy either!  Yep, Who, Floyd, Zep, Yes fans will appreciate Hodgson and Davies.  And any album with Winston Churchill on it can't be all bad.  &quot;Never surrender!&quot;<br />Love the piano on the mountaintop!
B00006RIO7|5.0|Fresh, sassy, sexy and super! These 3 stars give their all and man it was a lot to see and hear. It's about time to have an original musical come out of tinseltown. I applaud everybody involved!
B000069HZP|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorites.<br />I don't want to give the plot away, but the first time you see it, you'll never guess what's going on ... and when you do, you'll find out you were wrong.<br />It's one of those movies where you keep guessing and then second guessing yourself over and over and over again.<br />If you like some excitement, it's a must see!
6304308388|5.0|THE APARTMENT can be classified as both a comedy and a drama. The story is about C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon), a young bachelor who works for a large insurance company in New York City. He enjoys a meteoric rise to a junior executive position after allowing several of his bosses to use his apartment for their clandestine love affairs with female employees of the company. The only trouble is that Baxter falls in love with one of the girls (Shirley MacLaine) who is spending time in his apartment with his boss (Fred MacMurray).<br />Lemmon and MacLaine make a thoroughly loveable duo - two characters who capture your heart early in the film. Fred MacMurray plays the part of a hypocritical rascal, somewhat reminiscent of his role in THE CAINE MUTINY.<br />THE APARTMENT won Academy Awards in 1960 for Best Picture, Best Director (Billy Wilder), Best Original Story and Screenplay, Best B &amp; W Art Direction and Best Editing. Nominations were received for Best Actor (Jack Lemmon), Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine), Best Supporting Actor (Jack Krushen), Best B &amp; W Cinematography and Best Sound. The main competition for awards in that same year came from ELMER GANTRY starring Burt Lancaster and BUTTERFIELD 8 with Elizabeth Taylor.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This cd really grew on me, though i DO  have to admit that the repetitive high-pitched singing of the words \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" gets on my nerves a bit, as does the repetitive \\"Malchik Gay\\", of which i have a love/hate relationship with the high pitched tone of the vocals when they sing those two words.  Those two complaints aside, this is a fantastic cd. The song All The Things She Said just blew me away and made me run out and buy the cd. The disc was only 9.99 and so i snapped it up, and have no regrets. I haven't seen the video for that song, and have looked past all the \\"Russian lesbian teens\\" stuff, that to me is just clever marketing. Whether they were packaged by some svengali who came up with an idea for the next marketing ploy or not, this is an interesting and fresh-sounding cd. The music is exciting and these two girls can really sing beautifully! The slow songs are amazing, and the music is beautifully crafted to compliment these two voices, and their Russian accents are cute when they sing in English. They probably sang the songs phonetically for all we know.  I'm glad they chose to put the Russian versions of some of the songs so we can compare the two. Both versions are great. This was one of the better cd purchases i made in 2003. The cd gets better with each listen. One thing i really like about this cd is that even though it's a teen girl vocal act, the producers were smart in not having them follow in the Britney Spears or Christina Agulera mold. Tatu is a cd that adults and teens will enjoy equally.
B00005JL95|4.0|Once again before writing my review I've gone through my now habitual look at the 1-star reviews. The 30 1 star reviews I've read here have left me bewildered at the pathetic P.C state this world is headed towards.<BR>Well, since I don't care one whit about political correctness I will sum up LILO AND STITCH briefly as this: A cute Disney comedy with sci fi elements.<BR>Stitch is a koala-like genetic experiment made by aliens: fireproof, bulletproof, has  the ability to think faster than a supercomputer, can see in the dark and move objects 3000 times his size. The only negative is that Stitch is also a lethal weapon, so Stitch is sent into exile, but escapes to Earth en route to prison. A pair of dim witted prisoners are enlisted as bounty hunters,  who will be given their freedom in exchange for Stitch's capture.<BR>Lilo is a cheeky, but lonely little Hawaiian girl with a passion for Elvis music who lives with her older sister Nani. Nani decides Lilo needs a dog to keep her company. This results in a visit to an animal shelter where Stitch has been impounded upon his arrival on Earth. Lilo adopts him, but their burgeoning friendship may be being abused by Stitch for his own protection. Meanwhile a social worker is trying to take Lilo away from her sister....<BR>Featuring the voice talents of Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers and Ving Rhames, LILO AND STITCH is a great movie with a humorous script for all ages.
B00000I8NC|4.0|Just in case any body was wondering the writing on the front is Hebrew and says TOHOU WAVOHOU which means \\"empty and desolate\\" or in King James english \\"without form and void\\". Its from the creation account in Genesis. I knew a biblical hebrew class would pay off in the end.<BR>But as far as the music goes I really like it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the spoken dialogues in the background on the second track.  Their (the dialogue's)artistic value is great but after hearing them a few times I got tired and wished I could just listen to the music which is wonderful and always keeps my attention the whole way through, which says a lot because sometimes I get anxious with good short songs and skip tracks after a couple minutes.
B000002LRX|5.0|When I was a little guy, I was a Faith No More fan.  I still am, and of their too short catalog, this is easily my favorite of the lot.  While I had nothing against Chuck Mosely, I do think that Mike Patton was much better suited to front the band.  His creativity and just all out weirdness are still, to this day, unmatched by anyone I can think of.  The best part was that he did all of this without coming across as pretentious.  Just check out Mr. Bungle (any of the three albums and you'll get an idea).  True, this one is a little tougher for the average person to digest than &quot;The Real Thing&quot; and to me, that's the beauty of it all.  Once you get a feel for the record, it will stick with you and you may never part ways with it.<br />If you're new to Faith No More and are reading this to decide whether are not to buy it, I'd say get &quot;The Real Thing&quot; first, then get this one.  You'll at least be somewhat prepared.  Then you'll want to go on to &quot;King For a Day, Fool For a Lifetime&quot; then &quot;Album of the Year&quot;...better yet, just get the &quot;Who Cares a Lot?&quot; Greatest hits collection and that should be enough to get you started.   <br />Enough with my rambling.  All I can say is that once you're introduced to the world of Mike Patton, you're in for one hell of a trip.
B00005JLH3|4.0|As formula underdog movies go, they don't get much more charming or fun than DRUMLINE, which surprised me with its well-developed characters and grand band performances when I saw it in the theater.<br />The film works well as a family movie, for there's little sex or violence. The music is great. (The soundtrack is excellent, if you want to pick it up.) And the message extends beyond the whole dare-to-dream \\"Rocky\\" theme. The film addresses the importance of honesty, humility, hard work and education. And it's fun.<br />I saw this because it was filmed in my hometown. I didn't expect to be so entertained by it, though.<br />Orlando Jones, as a dedicated band teacher who stresses education and music over showmanship and glitz, is particularly good. He proves himself to be a compelling character actor.<br />Though DRUMLINE isn't edgy or particularly challenging, there's something to be said for the film's winning quality.
B000060MWU|5.0|This is without a doubt a superlative film. No questions asked (not that they can be anyway). More importantly: a Dolby 5.1 version (with significantly improved picture and sound quality- widescreen 1.85:1) is available from Amazon.de (that's Germany, but the basic interface is identical to Amazon.com, so decoding the icons shouldn't be a problem). No extras, but it's the mans thing, man. Now we want 'Wild at Heart'. A 5.1 mix and remaster have been created (I hear), so why the WAITING??? Pliz, Pliz wiv a chewwy on topp?!?!?
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is phenomenal.  The passion and soul of the lead singer Amy Lee is simply stunning for a girl her age.  There isn't a single track which I don't like which I think is a first for me for an album.  Also, a first is that I don't have a favorite, I like them all.  My only criticisms are that some of the mixing could have been done a little better (the vocals are drowned out in some of the choruses) and that some of the guitar riffs are too simplistic.  However, besides those minor flaws, this CD stands out as one of the best in years and is stunning for a debut.  I usually just download all of my music, but this made me actually buy the CD!
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Commentary on Reaganite plutocracy, double standards and internal and international political deviance boiling in about a cubic ton of corn syprup. A classic and then some. Wonder if a thinly veiled attack on the George Dubya 'regime'will ever come about.
B000089RVX|5.0|I dont know what the reviewer was listening to that gave this effort a (**)rating. This is one of the hottest,original sounding rock/metal bands I've heard in a long time. The chick on vocals has a incredible voice. Do yourself a huge favor...BUY THIS CD &amp; you'll understand why EVANESCENCE is the best new artist of 2003.
B00006V9A0|3.0|As I said in the title, this album is great if you want to get into Nirvana and learn about this awesome band, but it doesn't do justice for those waiting 10 years for new Nirvana material. Don't get me wrong, the new song and remasters are awesome, but this 14 track disc only shows you the &quot;radio friendly&quot; side(except for maybe &quot;Sliver&quot; and &quot;About a Girl&quot;). This is a great collection of Nirvana songs, but there is a lot more material that was left out. Songs I wish were on this disc- the Intesticide standout, &quot;Aneurysm&quot;, Nirvana's first single, &quot;Love Buzz&quot;, the energetic &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;, the acoustic &quot;Polly&quot;, plus &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Molly's Lips&quot;, and &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;. There are a lot more but I can't think of them. Again, this CD is great for new listeners. Peace out.
B000084T18|5.0|All I have to say is that 50 cent is the future and Lloyd Banks will be the next to blow up.  This CD is all-around tight just like all of his underground mixtapes.  ... its a tight ... CD if you listen to him.  If you got shot in the mouth do you think you would sound the same, c'mon.  This is the one of the best cds since The Eminem Show.
0375414053|2.0|Meet Kate Reddy.. or don't.<br />I picked up and put down this book at the bookstore at least five times, debating whether or not I wanted to read it, and pay a so much for it. I kept telling myself that I would be perfectly content picking up the book at the local library in a couple months. I was especially conflicted because I'd read varying reviews for this novel on Amazon-- some were glowing, whereas others weren't all that spectacular. But, I figured, most of those awful reviews were from working mothers themselves. I don't work (unless school studies count), nor am I a mother, so I figured that I would agree with the majority of the reviews and love the book. <br />I really wish I had put it down and walked out without buying it.<br />Kate Reddy is a mother who works twenty-five hours a day, and then some. She knows her children miss her, she knows they don't see her, she's aware that she doesn't know anything that she, as a mother, should know. I think that Allison Pearson was trying to convey sympathy for her obnoxious character, but she failed miserably. How could you possibly feel sympathetic when Kate hides in the bathroom so she won't have to see her eighteen-month old son? When she uses work to escape from her two young children? When her husband, so obviously loving, is snubbed and she's constantly snapping at him? Even when he leaves her, I felt nothing but happiness for Richard for finally getting away from the Monster; after all, how could I possibly feel for Kate when she wanted to have an affair with someone else? <br />Allison Pearson throws in symbolism left and right (maybe I've spent too many years in English class analyzing literature and symbolism). It's as if she wants to prove to the world that she is a Real Writer by tossing in shoddy symbolic work. Another thing that really annoyed me about this book, other than Kate's irritating behavior, is that in several places, the phrase, \\"Kate, I don't know how you do it!\\" pops up. PLEASE. There's nothing magnificent about Kate. She's not a good mother (she even went as far as to smoke [a non-tobacco substance] with her cabdriver!). All she does is work, work, work. So she remembers her children's birthdays, but what common mother doesn't? So she throws them spectacular birthday bashes and tries to get the icing on the bakery-bought cake just the right shade. She's just trying to bribe her children to love her, to try to make up for lost time by being the \\"Perfect Mother\\" for one day. So she spends hours calling a toy company to see if they have a stuffed kangaroo. All to make her son shut up, actually. So she buys them everything they want for Christmas. More bribery instead of real love. It doesn't make her a good mother to do those things, nor does it make her commendable. <br />A commendable mother would be my own. She's a hard working mother with three daughters in their teenage years, and finds time to do the laundry, cook meals, prepare breakfasts, and always, ALWAYS has time for her children no matter what she wants to do instead. If you need to talk, she's there. She's the shoulder to cry on, the rock, the backbone of the family. Tell me, isn't that a better mother?
B00000JGOH|4.0|I honestly did not know what to expect when I first sat down to watch &quot;Shakespeare In Love.&quot;  Perhaps that was for the best, since this film teems with unexpected moments and twists, turning literary history upside down and giving it a clever and bawdy twist.<br />Gywenth Paltrow plays a young noblewoman who is expected to be demurely betrothed, but who wants none of the life ahead of her.  She yearns for the theater, and, in her headstrong, ambitious drive, dresses like a boy to obtain a part in Will Shakespeare's newest drama.  Of course, the two fall in love (hence the title!) and their duplicity leads to plot complications that get more and more outrageous.  Literary jokes abound, but you don't need to know a whit about Shakespeare to enjoy this romp.  This is a romantic comedy cloaked in Elizabethian times, an anachronism that is thoroughly satisfying.<br />Paltrow's Viola is gutsy, intelligent, and torn, a portrayal that deservedly earned her an Oscar.  Joseph Fiennes makes a lovable, bumbling Will Shakespeare.  The two display a chemistry that brings the witty script to life and elevates this film to a level above most romantic comedies.<br />This film should appeal to a wide range of viewers - even those who hated studying Shakespeare in school.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Rage Against the Machine and at first I was very worried that Audioslave would fail to meet my expectations. When I first listened to the CD I was hooked. I skipped right over Cochise and Like A Stone because I already knew that they were amazing songs, and I soon noticed that the rest of the album was also amazing. I would recommend this CD to any and everyone.
B000002JEV|4.0|Very enjoyable, with Travellin' Riverside Blues and The Girl I Love . . . alone making this a worthwhile purchase.  Two things are abundantly clear after listening to this: First, studio engineers' ability to tone down Plant's vocal histrionics  have played a key role in the band's success.  He simply is making too much noise on these sessions!  Second, their recorded output, as great as it is, would have been even better had the focus been MORE on Jimmy Page, especially if it had captured the tone he lays down in these sessions.  Very powerful.  Bonham as always is right on.
B000089RVX|4.0|Euopre- especially Scandanavia- has had the monopoly on Goth Metal for a long time now (Moonspell, La Cunna Coil, Crematory, Tristania/ Sirenia, Tenebre) but now here comes an American unit to give them a good run for the $$$! EVANESCENCE most remind me of Italy's La Cunna Coil with the errie female vocals but Evanescence are more \\"orchestrial\\" and \\"operatic\\" than Coil. Best songs: \\"haunted\\", \\"taking over me\\" and \\"whisper\\"  I understand Portigual's Moonspell are ready to release a new CD. Wouldn't it be great to see these two bands on the same bill.  Play this CD back to back with Sirenia's \\"At Sixes & Sevens\\" or Tristania's \\"Widow's Weeds\\".
B00006678I|4.0|This movie is one of the funniest dramas I have ever seen. Elvis as a doctor in the ghetto is so unbelievable that the comedic value of the movie is astronomical. There are such quotes as \\"He called my sister a dirty stinkin'...no one  calls my sister dirty!\\" and \\"knifing a player in football deserves a 15 yard penalty\\". While it tries to raise serious issues including the role of the church, civil rights, racism, and autism, you come away with nothing but a bad case of side burns. If you want to see Elvis as a hero- do not buy this film. Yet if you find humor in bad social commentary which includes Elvis and Mary Tyler Moore this movie is for you! I loved it for this reason.
B00007JVBI|5.0|Back in high school, they all said she'd amount to nothing.  She was different, aloof, always reading or writing something, but never anything she had been assigned. She ran with a small but select  group of social bottom-feeders, all of whom spent prom nights watching old Audrey Hepburn flicks and ingesting contraband substances.  Her schoolwork was characterized by teachers as solid but unexceptional, willfully outside the lines and from a world of its own. Her worst grades were in art, based solely on her absolute refusal to create the requisite deer and antelope scenes required by the art teacher (who doubled as the shop teacher). In short, high school was something for her to endure, to get through before real life started.<BR> Ten years later, the jocks and cheerleaders of yesteryear are frightened at what's beginning to show. Many have become their parents, mired in babies and bills. She's since moved on, too, and done fine for herself. She put down her paintbrushes once upon a time and started strumming a guitar. She moved around a bit and saw some things. She decided to make rock and roll music, and started a band consisting of herself and no one else and called it Cat Power. This, at least, is how I see her, whose name is Chan Marshall. Parts of the story may be true or none of it at all. What can be said for sure is that she has always forged a musical path that can be described as nothing if not passionately independent. On You Are Free, her first album of new material in four years, she takes this a step further, setting a new standard for herself and her contemporaries.<BR> From the start, You Are Free is a stripped down affair, with songs pared down to the essentials. Marshall's songs have always had a bare feel to them, but these songs make use of every element they're left to work with-and with astounding results. Whether it's just Marshall's all-nighter with gin & tonic voice paired with electric guitar, or the groaned tenor of none other than Eddie Vedder (identified only as E.V. in the liner notes) sitting somewhere below the piano lines, nothing here is superfluous. Marshall oscillates back and forth between personas resembling Joni Mitchell: piano-based, plaintive introspection; and Joan Jett for the intellectual set: breaking out the electric guitars with strut and sass. The remarkable part is that she's so much at home in each.<BR> Maybe the best example of the latter is found in the sort of like the title track, \\"Free.\\" This is a delectable little slice of retro yet modern pop, a teaser that stops and starts with the help of an electronic snare that lasts exactly six beats at a time before retreating back to the 1983 from whence it came. The stripped down production gives the song a skeletal, retro vibe that somehow sounds fresher than anything around, a la the last couple of Spoon records. It also calls to mind some of the best recordings to come out of the late 70's/ early 80's: Talking Heads, Elvis Costello & the Attractions and, oddly, Blondie.<BR> Other highlights include the spooky rendition of Michael Hurley's \\"Werewolf,\\" a foreboding cello spelling out doom on what is soon destined to be a Halloween standard. Also of note are \\"Good Woman,\\" featuring a barely audible, yet effective Vedder along with a muted choir of adolescent girls; and \\"Maybe Not,\\" a chilling piano-based composition that Marshall delivers in such a personal tone that it leaves you feeling as if maybe you weren't meant to be listening.<BR> The notion of \\"freedom\\" pops up consistently on You Are Free, although it's not the same vague notion of \\"freedom\\" that has been unfortunately present in all sorts of misguided musical attempts since Sept. 11. Cat Power's \\"freedom\\" seems, instead, to be about a freedom of transcendence of mind, a freedom to think critically about whatever is presented to us. Perhaps this credits the music with too much importance that was never intended to be there in the first place, but you've got to take these things where you can get them these days. Only a cynic could disbelieve when Marshall sings, \\"we can all be free/ maybe not in words/ maybe not in look/ but in your mind...\\" The big picture has never sounded so good.<br />The power of the feline proves impressive; one of the top releases of 2003.     9.2 out of 10.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|t.A.T.u are absolutely fantastic! Their songs are original, genuine &amp; catchy, &amp; it's obvious that both of these ladies are just bursting with talent. They are, by far, the best international act I've ever come across.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Interesting, isn't it, how some musicians who happen to be dead happen to manage to release far more material in their post-mortem state than they ever did when they were alive.  Every other year, it seems like, we've got some rehash of \\"new\\" and \\"never before available\\" recordings from Hendrix and/or the Doors and/or the Dead (pun fully intended), just to name a few.  As the saying goes though, you can't take it with you, and there are people who are very much alive, comparatively speaking, who have millions of reasons for every one of these \\"new\\" releases.  <BR> It's refreshing, then, to finally have a release like George Harrison's new Brainwashed, a posthumous release that, for once, was full intended by its creator  (not only that, but it actually is all \\"new and never before available material\\").   This is the album on which Harrison was nearing completion at the time of his death last November.  In the past year, the task of completing it has belonged to Harrison's friend and fellow Traveling Wilbury Jeff Lynne, and to the junior Harrison, Dhani, each of whom was already contributing to the project before Harrison died.  In a way, this represented a torch-passing of sorts: it was Jeff Lynne and Harrison himself ( along with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr) who finished off the two incomplete John Lennon songs, \\"Real Love,\\" and \\"Free As a Bird,\\" back in the mid-90's.<BR> Remarkably, Brainwashed represents Harrison's first solo output in fifteen years, since 1987's Cloud Nine.  He did, of course, do work as a member of the Traveling Wilburys as late as 1990, but that's the last we'd heard of him aside from some production work here and there.  That having been said, Brainwashed is an exceptionally accomplished work.  Whatever Harrison had been doing during his mostly low profile final decade, music was certainly a part of it.  Wonderfully present here is Harrison's trademark slide guitar work, prominent in the first single \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud,\\" the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues,\\" and announcing itself from the outset on the opener, \\"Any Road.\\"  It's clear that Harrison hadn't lost a step with his forte, the parts bringing to mind the Beatles' \\"For You Blue.\\"<BR>In addition to playing slide, electric, acoustic and bass guitars on the album, Harrison also shows virtuosity on the ukulele.  A standout example of this is found on the album's only cover, Hoagy Carmichael's \\"The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,\\" which finds Harrison and his ukulele backed by Jools Holland's band.  Ukulele is also found, fittingly, on the original \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii,\\" which, while written by Harrison, is clearly based on the Hank Williams classic, \\"Long Gone Lonesome Blues.\\"  This unexpected, if somewhat peculiar, twist makes for one of the more interesting moments on the album.<BR>Lyrically speaking, Harrison was clearly cognizant of his pending death.  The songs are filled with spiritual elements-not the dogmatic, black and white variety, but the searching, seeking, questioning sort that Harrison had come to embrace in Eastern religions.  The examples are too numerous to mention here, but song titles like `Looking For My Life,\\" and \\"Any Road,\\" point clearly to a man asking the big questions about his life...and death: Who am I? What am I doing here? Where am I going?  Fittingly, the album closes with the title track fading into the sound of Harrison chanting an Indian chant (\\"Shiva Shiva Shankara Mahdeva...\\")<BR>For some reason, perhaps because we'd heard so little from George Harrison in the past several years, Brainwashed feels like a surprising accomplishment.  We really shouldn't be surprised, however, to hear such work from the quiet Beatle.  It was he, after all, who penned gems like \\"Something,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" and \\"Within You Without You,\\" not to mention several other lesser known but solid tunes.  Brainwashed is Harrison's self-examination and meditation on his life and death, as well as, it turns out, his magnum opus.<br />   Worth the wait, Harrison's last statement is his best.  8.0 out of 10
B00008BXJF|5.0|Sure this CD has great production, great songs, great hooks, great playing and great writing. But as you listen to this fantastic CD, consider this: this band has been around for over 30 years! Name a band that has that kind of mileage and still puts out quality material. In short, King Crimson is a great band. They have become legends without having to compromise, or lose any of their current or former members to the grim reaper. Their music stands on it's own without any external marketing manipulation, unlike today's disposable video stars. <br />At the risk of sounding like an overly zealous Dream Theater fan that praises anything the band puts out (you know who you are), this is truly a great CD!
B00006M183|5.0|Hmm... when my review for this album began late in 2002, I never thought the album would gain such a massive amount of praise and hailed by this site as an essential recording from Eddie Vedder & Co. Well, after listening to the CD since i bought it the day of its release, the songs keep getting better and better, more so since radio didnt kill them. With that, here are my opinions on each track:<br />1. Cant Keep: Great starter to the album. Not too fast, but not deathly slow, either. Incredible lyrics also.<br />2. Save you: The second single from the album highlights Vedder's enthusiasm in rocking out and Mike McCready's guitar magic. One of the best rockers the band has ever relased.<br />3. Love Boat Captain: They gotta come up with more songs that have their own logos for it. That aside, the piece is a great musical tribute to the Roskilde tragedy, as well as showcasing the organ sound courtesy of Boom Gaspar. great nod to the Beatles' immortal \\"All you need is love\\" also.<br />4. Cropduster: The first of drummer Matt Cameron's songs on the album is one of the best PJ songs there is lyrically.<br />5. Ghost: Bassist Jeff Ament's song that has a catchy chorus to it. ALways an entertaining piece to listen to, and a rant on today's society.<br />6. I am mine: To me, this is the best single PJ has released since \\"Jeremy\\". Vedder's catchy guitar and awesome lyrics highlights this piece.<br />7. Thumbing my way: Ukulele, arresting folk vocals and introspective lyrics is, as simple as it may sound, a working formula here.<br />8. You are: Matt Cameron's second and best song on the album. Great use of poetry by both Vedder and Cameron in writing the tune. And man, Cameron finally playing guitar as a Pearl Jam member! I have been waiting for that to happen. BTW, the drums in the song is a machine, not Matt's.<br />9. Get Right: The last of the Cameron triad of songs is one of the best rockers PJ have come up with.<br />10. Green Disease: Definitely the best rocker on the album. Not only does it have  great lyrics and incredible guitars, it also is a direct descendant to \\"rearviewmirror\\" (albeit backwards) musically, and also another tribute to the Beatles in their rhythm guitars, reminiscent of \\"you never gave me your money\\"'s last section.<br />11. Help Me: Pretty weird and scary song considering both Jeff Ament and Eddie Vedder sing it in a falsetto voice. Nevertheless, great use of storytelling here.<br />12. Bushleaguer: No, the song has nothing to do with baseball (k, maybe a little). This Bush commentary will surely set a fire to the White house hearth.<br />13. 1/2 Full: of what? cant say it here. PJ's defiance of lavishness and greed continues here in this great bluesy number. Mike McCready shows why he's a guitar god here.<br />14. Arc: If this is meant as a tribute to Vedder's friend the great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, it surely is not a bad one. Weird hearing Eddie doing a tribal prayer call.<br />15. All or none: the best closer in a rock album in quite some time. Jazzy, smoky club feel of the song shows how versatile band is. Love the McCready guitar and Cameron jazz drums work here.<br />SO there you go...my full  re-recap of the \\"Riot\\". Have fun listening, if you havent done so already!. Let the rioting continue!!
B000088E6M|5.0|I have listened to 50 even since How to Rob came out. I was very dissapointed when The Power of the Dollar got shelved. This album makes up for it. I can listen to the whole cd over and over again, and I have. Every song is great. I usually like 5 or 6 songs on a cd, but I like all of these. A must buy. Listen to the song dissing Ja...Rule. Puts him to sleep.
B00006HAZG|5.0|I recently watched a Charles Dicken's Documentary on Television, March 5 which showed bit's and Pieces of movie clips from his books, and would like to say that from what i have seen, David Copperfield is an excellent movie to watch, I will be recommending this movie to everyone i know, and mention that it's something they should watch, it very touching, even though i haven't seen it in full yet, Daniel Radcliffe is a very good actor.
B000089RVX|5.0|Aside from a few songs on this CD (Everybody's Fool and Haunted), this is a fairly solid album.  This CD has the ability to evoke a calm, tranquil atmosphere yet give the listener a sense of melancholy and sadness.  The combination of artifically created orchestrated sounds (i.e. violins) and harsh, scathing guitar really accentuates the beauty of Amy Lee's voice.  So many aspects of this band's music clash that it helps to create a fresh new sound.  My only complaints with this album are that some of the songs are a little too generic and rehashed (like Everybody's Fool and Haunted).  Haunted really isn't a bad song, I like the eerie atmosphere it builds, but the chorus sounds oddly similar to Everybody's Fool.  But this is just my opinion, others may think differently.  Although I do like how the song ends with a chorus of singers in the background and Amy essentially &quot;free styling&quot; the song's original chorus. ;)  I was originally going to give this album 4 stars, but I can't really compare it to anything else I've listened to in the past.  If you like this band, you'd like RA and Trapt as well.  The lead singer of RA has the same mastery over his voice as Amy Lee does.
0783225881|5.0|I was a school librarian for seven years.  I wearied of the concerned parents wanting to unilaterally censor books from the junior high's library because of an opposing political view, cuss word, etc.  My wife knew the drill.  When the censor came calling, she'd have Field of Dreams in the VCR and queued up to the school board scene.  \\"At least I don't burn books, you Nazi cow\\" became a family slogan.<BR>Before being a librarian I was an ESL teacher.

0131103628|5.0|With more than 30 years under its belt, the C programming language still remains one of the most important computer languages to date.  Languages like Perl and Java might have secured permanent niches in certain areas of programming, but one must keep in mind that they their own compilers were written in C languages, and both use structures and styles derived from C.<br />In short, this book is a classic in the field of computer programming, but it is no less relevant today.  Kernigham and Ritchie start the reader from the very beginning with discussions of variables and functions, and keep their discussion of C in very stripped down and simple terms.  Using C libraries can get you very far these days as a programmer, but if you want to know how those functions work, you will enjoy a very nice introduction in this book.  You will make your own functions like strcat, atoi and so on using the most basic C commands.  This approach to programming really helps the new programmer think for themselves.<br />I also like the problems and questions throughout the book.  Kernigham and Ritchie definitely want the reader to be actively learning C and not just be a passive reader.<br />In short, this book is an excellent starting point for someone wanting to learn C, or for someone who is starting out in programming.  Its also a classic that should definitely be on any career programmer's shelf.
0792838068|5.0|1995's Leaving Las Vegas is a dark, fatalistic film that unlike most Hollywood films, does not offer redemption at the end.  Nicholas Cage stars in yet another edgy role as Ben Sanderson.  As the film begins, we find that Ben has lost his reason to live as his career in Hollywood and his family have been taken away from him.  He has vowed to move to Las Vegas and drink himself to death.  One very powerful early scene, finds Ben downing a whole pint of booze in one shot at a bar and sinking into a hallucinogenic state.  The scene is filmed in a hazy blurriness that captures the moment perfectly.  Upon arriving in Vegas, Ben runs across a hooker, Sera, played by Elisabeth Shue.  They connect with one another and soon Sera finds herself becoming attached to Ben.  Ben offers no promises and demands that the one thing she never asks him to do is stop drinking.  Sera grudgingly accepts this condition and they enter into a relationship that is based on a mutual neediness that only desperate people have.  Director Mike Figgis does not allow the characters to change.  Ben remains a drunk throughout the film and he fulfills his destiny and Sera never gives up her profession.  Mr. Cage & Ms. Shue are brilliant in their roles and both garnered much acclaim.  But as great as Ms. Shue is, this is Mr. Cage's film all the way.  He is a commanding presence on screen and gives one the best acting performances in the last twenty years.  For his troubles, he won the 1995 Best Actor Oscar.  Ms. Shue was nominated for Best Actress and Mr. Figgis gained two nominations, one for Best Director and the other for Best Adapted Screenplay.  This film was a surprise and so far an anomaly for Mr. Figgis.  He showed nothing in his prior films to suggest he could pull off a film like Leaving Las Vegas and none of his subsequent films have built upon or matched this film's excellence.
B00003BDXG|5.0|This film gets better with age! It reflects more clearly our society`s obsession with violence and the characters (despite what the other reviwer said) of Mickey and Mallory are truly sympatethic -- we feel for them. They may be killers but they`re not hypocrits. <BR>&quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; doesn't offer viewers violence that look like fun (although some scenes are deliberately moking &quot;violent movies&quot; through its satire) and it does not try to glorify violence. A lot of movies do -- and they make a lot of money. &quot;You don't have to be a very sophisticated person to realize this is not a exploatation film. This is an art film.&quot;
B00003CXD0|3.0|In 1982s Tootsie, Dustin Hoffman plays actor Michael Dorsey, who through his obnoxious perfectionism has managed to alienate every producer in America.  His agent, George Fields (the films director Sydney Pollack), is exasperated and cant even get Michael work in commercials.  Dorsey learns of an opening on a popular daytime soap opera, but it is for a womans part.  He decides to dress up as a woman and auditions as Miss Dorothy Michaels.  He wins the part and in the process, becomes quite popular in the role.  On the set, he meets castmate Julie (a luminous Jessica Lange) for whom he falls in love with.  Of course, Julie has no idea that Dorothy is a man and she confides many things to him.  Complications ensue when Julies widowed father, Les (Charles Durning), falls in love with Dorothy and pursues her.  In the end, Michael reveals himself to Julie and exclaims that being a woman has made him a better man.  The rest of the supporting cast is quite good in the film especially Bill Murray as Michaels roommate Jeff and Teri Garr as a neurotic actress, Sandy.  Tootsie was co-written by M*A*S*H creator Larry Gelbart and directed by Sydney Pollack and was widely acclaimed upon its release.  The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Actor for Mr. Hoffman, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture and two Best Supporting Actresses, Ms. Garr and Ms. Lange, but Ms. Lange took home the films only Oscar.  While Tootsie is well acted and funny, it is very contrived.  The film relies on most of the same old jokes that have appeared in most other movies or TV episodes where cross-dressing is involved, but instead of giving in to the silliness like a film like Some Like It Hot does, it tries too be highbrow humor.  The film deserves recognition because many of the performances as first rate, but the overall film is highly overrated.  It is a very good film, just not a great one despite all the lavish praise it receives.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time! It is the best adaptation of Jane Austen's book, which I also recommend! Though this movie is 5 hours long, it doesnt feel that way! The actors do a wonderful job and really bring the story to life, and after it is over you still want more! I have watched this movie over 20 times and I know it by heart! This movie will make you laugh and maybe shed a tear or two.

0440234743|3.0|It happens that I am Brazilian and when I read American novelists and by chance the story has passages held in Brazil or has references to our uses and costumes I always get annoyed.<br />John Grisham is not an exception.<br />His book \\"The Testament\\", an adventure which divides its scenario between the courtrooms of Virginia and the Pantanal in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in Brazil, gives a completely wrong panorama of Brazil and his people. In some passages Grisham crosses the line of offense.<br />The city of Corumb&aacute;, where was taken most of the hints used by Grisham, was not even included between the 200 biggest Brazilian cities. At that time 213 cities had more than 100.000 inhabitants and Corumb&aacute; counted around 95.000 in its urban area.<br />The first thing an author has to have in mind before issue a concept about the country and its people is that Brazil is a huge country, more than 8 million squares kilometers wide, where lives more than 170 million inhabitants and where the diversity of culture, costumes, habits and facilities are tremendous.<br />Anyone that judges the country based on experience in one single location will fall into plain misled.<br />That is what happened with the character Nate O'Riley of \\"The Testament\\" which issued his opinions about Brazil by his acquaintances in the small city of Corumb&aacute; in the banks of river Paraguai.<br />Starting in page 89 (Island Books - Dell Publishing 2000) Nate ask to his boss \\"So they have phones in Brazil\\" In this episode there is a chance, by the comment of his fellow character Josh, that Grisham wants to point out the ignorance of the entire American people about Brazil using the ignorance of his character Nate as sample. The same applies for the estrange thinking of Nate when he boards the plane to Corumb&aacute; at page 98. Not considering this idea the thinking is offensive.<br />It is amazing that a writer which also happens to be a law man makes, on page 102, such simplifying explanation about the Brazilian practicing law system. It is not true that courtrooms were not a integral part of practicing law in Brazil. The difference in relation of the American style litigation is that only homicides crimes held a jury. In civil and others types of offenses the courtroom actors are limited to the judge, lawyers, parties and testimonies and no popular jury is involved. So trials are not rare, they just don't apply for crimes others than homicide. Like commons Americans Grisham is only aware of the American style, the rest of the world is simple the rest of the world.<br />Brazilian knows the problems of their public hospitals and are working to improve the system but in inconceivable that the wealthy character Nate have to be conducted (pg.333) to a nasty public hospital in a small town instead of private one just to say a lot of imprecations to be generalize to all hospitals in Brazil forgetting that, besides the problems, Brazil has modern hospital facilities, some even publics, and a advanced research medicine with top awards in genetics, cardiology, plastic surgeon, and AIDS therapy. An American doctor, cogitated, by the author, to be transported from 3.000 miles away would not treat better a patient with Dengue than an experiment Brazilian specialist in tropical diseases.<br />The page 335 statement of \\"a tide of the finest American-made chemicals\\" given to Nate is a falsehood. No Brazilian hospitals uses American-made chemicals as a routine.<br />At page 376 we found the worst concept about Brazil made by Mr. Grisham. Is a complete misunderstanding of our culture.<br />We inherit from our Portuguese's, colonizers, what we call in Portuguese \\"estamento pol&iacute;tico.\\" In this context is the bureaucracy which included what is usually known as \\"despachantes\\"<br />Since the 70's all the successives governments worked to exclude or at least reduce in our society the bureaucracy monster. The results in those 30 years have been enormous. TBrazilian practicing law system. It is not true that courtrooms were not a integral part of practicing law in Brazil. The difference in relation of the American style litigation is that only homicides crimes held a jury. In civil and others types of offenses the courtroom actors are limited to the judge, lawyers, parties and testimonies and no popular jury is involved. So trials are not rare, they just don't apply for crimes others than homicide. Like commons Americans Grisham is only aware of the American style, the rest of the world is simple the rest of the world.<br />Brazilian knows the problems of their public hospitals and are working to improve the system but in inconceivable that the wealthy character Nate have to be conducted (pg.333) to a nasty public hospital in a small town instead of private one just to say a lot of imprecations to be generalize to all hospitals in Brazil forgetting that, besides the problems, Brazil has modern hospital facilities, some even publics, and a advanced research medicine with top awards in genetics, cardiology, plastic surgeon, and AIDS therapy. An American doctor, cogitated, by the author, to be transported from 3.000 miles away would not treat better a patient with Dengue than an experiment Brazilian specialist in tropical diseases.<br />The page 335 statement of \\"a tide of the finest American-made chemicals\\" given to Nate is a falsehood. No Brazilian hospitals uses American-made chemicals as a routine. <br />At page 376 we found the worst concept about Brazil made by Mr. Grisham. Is a complete misunderstanding of our culture.<BR>We inherit from our Portuguese's, colonizers, what we call in Portuguese \\"estamento político.\\" In this context is the bureaucracy which included what is usually known as \\"despachantes\\" <br />Since the 70's all the successives governments worked to exclude or at least reduce in our society the bureaucracy monster. The results in those 30 years have been enormous. Today, although reminiscent in interior land and small towns, Brazilians can get important documents trough the Internet automatically. This includes annual IRS declaration since 1996. So, \\"despachantes\\" are not anymore a much used figure in big cities except by old class citizens, still aggregated to the past. I don't want to say that the Brazilian bureaucracy is already a wonder but is improving each year.<BR>Besides that, the text of Mr. Grisham is full of mistakes. \\"Despachantes\\" were never used for voting. The voting system in Brazil designed and built by Brazilians firms is the most modern in the world where every 100 millions assigned electors in the 2002 election voted in a computerized system trough a electronic ballot and the final results where officially published 24 hours later. Compare this performance with the last American presidential election. Observers all over the world came to the country to study our voting system.<br />Is it believable that a country with such a technology capacity, with a aeronautical industry competing and exporting for many countries which includes United States and Canada could be depicted as a bunch of Indians aside their huts?<br />The affirmative at top of page 377 stating that a American passport was issued for Nate for US$ 2.000 trough the services of a \\"despachante\\" is outrageous. First because no American passport can be issued by a Brazilian Government Agency. If some \\"despachante\\" was used, was an American \\"despachante\\" for the American Consulate services. Second, because a Brazilian passport can be issued without \\"long lines\\" for less than US$ 20.<br />Is not forbidden to an author to write the realities about a country but a bestseller author must have compromise with the absolute truth and not create wrong general impressions.<br />Concluding this comment, I still recommend the book as a good novel with a smart plot showing aspect of courtrooms, legal conferences, judges chambers and exotic wild places of Brazil but I do not recommend it forBrazilian readers. Most of them will get annoyed like me with Grisham's misleads
B0000000LI|1.0|Lets start by saying I paid only $1.00 for this cd, at a thrift store.  I've always been intrigued by this artist, a sort of instrumental version of Tommy Bolton.  I imagine people who like Mr. Bolton, also enjoy listening to Yanni.  Intrigued to the point where I can only imagine an artist who receives an avalanche of 5 star ratings must be phenomenal. Lets see, Beethoven's Ninth deserves 5 stars, any Beatles album, some Stones, (not what is currently showing on HBO,) Mozart, Bach, Chopin, Etc... I would be more impressed if those who gave this noise the maximum number of stars would also list 5 other recordings of equal quality;  I could then withhold my negative review and rightfully say, yes, this is incredible.  Alas, this has to be one of the most bombastic thing I have ever heard.  If anyone wants to buy my cd for what I paid, before I throw it in the garbage is welcome.  I also think that the plastic it came in is more valuable.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Bob Fosse was quite the perfectionist and even did the autobiographical film of his flaw (and cause of his demise), \\"All That Jazz.\\"  He is also best known for his \\"Cabaret.\\"  He died back in the '80s and it was a big loss to the film and stage worlds. However, his work lives on in the marvelous choreography and other creative work he did in the performing arts.  This film has his look and his stamp all over it even though it was done by other filmmakers using his source material.  I saw the stage show back in the '70s and this film is even better but, of course, cinema has advanced since then so the filmmakers had that going for them.  This film also benefits from some exceptional talent.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is a wonderful actress with a very wide range.  She now adds singing and dancing to her repertoire and does a bang-up job.  We knew she could act ever since her arrival with \\"Jerry McGuire.\\"  Richard Gere is the best he's been in a long, long time and he does two show stopping numbers, one nested within the other, both revolving around his conducting the defense trial for murderess Roxie Hart (Zellweger).  He does a marvelous tap-dance in salute to legal defense too which should be played at ABA conventions.  Zeta-Jones does a grand singing and dancing job. I don't think she has quite Zellweger's range of ability but she is very good.  One of the best numbers in the film is done by Roxie's husband, Amos, (John C. Reilley).  It is \\"Cellophane\\" and he is transformed while singing it.  He's been hiding that talent behind his everyman roles in movie after movie.  Queen Latifah also does a great number plus plays the woman prison warden.  I will be buying this on DVD as soon as it comes out.  It is that good.  The plot line concerns female murderesses and tabloid fame in 1920s Chicago. It would be wonderful to put \\"Cabaret,\\" \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Chicago\\" into one boxed DVD set. For younger people who never experienced the delights of Fosse's work, prepare to be knocked out by performing arts genius!out by performing arts genius!
B000089RVX|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I heard \\"Bring me to Life\\" on my local radio station. The first thing I remember was hearing this absolutely gorgeous female voice, not something you hear that much on rock stations. Then I was caught by surprise as the band kicked in, the orchestra kicked in, and lead singer Amy Lee showed us that unlike most female rock singers she had not only an amazing voice but also a powerful range. The DJs response &quot;wow.&quot; No kidding.<br />I was unsure what to expect from this band after only hearing their two tracks from the Daredevil Soundtrack: the dramatic and hard \\"Bring me to life,\\" and the honest and gentle \\"My Immortal.\\" I was shocked with the CD. This is a rock band. Even though Evanescence is very new, I already foresee them lasting for a long time. This CD kicks off with the powerful pure-rock, \\"Going Under\\" then continues with their first single, \\"Bring me to Life,\\" that I'm sure everyone has heard now. They add one more great rock song, \\"Everybody's Fool\\" before they have a complete change of pace with \\"My Immortal,\\" a beautiful slow ballad that many would see more fitting to a singer such as Tori Amos. Unlike other rock bands when Evanescence writes ballads, they really write ballads. They don't depend on guitars; they bring in a piano and strings. It sounds strange I know but somehow it still works out. The next song, \\"Haunted,\\" is obviously about being stalked. The powerful lyrics will send shivers down your spine the first time you hear it. Next we have \\"Tourniquet\\" where Evanescence confirms the rumors that they have Christian roots. The lyrics are astounding. I absolutely love Amy's little jazzy effect she puts on the word &quot;screaming,&quot; which adds to the meaning of the lyrics.<br />Next we have \\"Imaginary,\\" my favorite song on the CD. It seems to blend in with \\"Tourniquet\\" almost, seeing as the last track ended with a nice string piece and the first piece begins with it. This song is probably my favorite because of its poetic lyrics and great beat. Next is \\"Taking Over Me,\\" a love song that starts out slow and then speeds up to a moderate pace. \\"Hello,\\" the other ballad on this CD, defiantly shows off Amy's powerful voice and range. \\"My Last Breath\\" and \\"Whisper\\" go back to the dramatic rock side and finish up this strong debut CD.<br />There are so many things I like about this CD. One is with all of the new pop-punk that seems to be all over the radio stations, it's nice to hear something a bit darker, a bit more emotional. The lyrics, written by the entire band including lead Singer Amy Lee and lead guitarist Ben Moody, are also very powerful, almost poetic at times. Evanescence reminds me a bit of an earlier Garbage, although I could picture some of the guitar rifts in, strangely enough, a Linkin Park Song. Evanescence knows how to use strings effectively along with guitars and drums. This is a very solid CD. You can tell that they put a lot of work into it. I would highly recommend it. Amy Lee said that the purpose of Evanescence was to show the world that there was some hope in this world. This CD proves her right. It also shows that there is some hope that the young rock music world has not simply dwindled down to one type of music. I can't wait to see what this band does next.
B00008BXJF|4.0|After the sterile mathematics of &quot;Construktion of Light&quot;, this is a welcome return to the King Crimson I like best - first found on the groundbreaking alt-metal masterpiece &quot;Red&quot;. At the same time, flourishes of their 80's work can be heard, too, so what we really have, to my ears anyway, is an album similar to &quot;Thrak&quot; - more melodic than &quot;C of L&quot;, but still metallic, edgy and offbeat. (Fans of bands like Tool need look no further than The King to hear that band's influences!)
B000084T18|5.0|I dont know what kinda music all these reviewers are listening to, this cd is awesome, in da club has to be false advertising or something, i think everybodys just getting dissappointed because they are lookin for a more poppy sound from 50, thats not what he's about, if you like eminem, dre, xzibit, and the aftermath sound, then you're gonna like this cd, its awesome, great lyrics great beats, it might not be living up to the hype its getting cuz everything gets overhyped these days but its damn close, definately get this cd if your on the fence, you'd be impressed
B000089RVX|5.0|I don't know what I can possibly say about the Evanescence CD that can adequately convey how truly amazing it is. I don't know if there's anything that can be said. It's just unreal. It's serenely soothing, while at the same time not being whiny or &quot;emo&quot;. The lyrical content is absolutely breathtaking. Not all the songs are like the recently released &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, but that's not necessarily a bad thing - at all. The songs contrast enough that they're each wonderfully written in their own distinct way, however they retain a similarity that assures that if you like one, you're almost guaranteed to like the rest. If you're sick of hearing &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, and are apprehensive about listening to the rest of the CD, don't be! Whether you're worried that all the songs will be too much like BMTL, or worried that they'll be too different, or if you do want to get a copy of the CD and just haven't had the opportunity yet, all I have to say is: Get off your computers and go get this CD now! Or at least download a few of the other songs from it. Regardless, do yourselves a favor and pick up a copy of Fallen. You won't be disappointed.
0736041850|4.0|I am a female who loves the gym, and more specifically, lifting weights, focusing on good form.  I saw this book and had to buy it after reading a few reviews.  I haven't been disappointed yet, until I saw the 'Women's Strength Training Anatomy' book that is available.  But after reading those reviews, I was happy with my choice for this book instead.  I have a couple of male workout partners who are just as into lifting weights and form as I am, and after they saw my book, they too had to have a copy of it.  You can't go wrong!  Pick up your copy today!
B000063WDH|2.0|i heard this cd while hanging out in some cd stores in boulder colorado.  over their system it sounded great....kind of a stripped down j.s.blues explosion.  i then had several long days of driving to get into it.  the more i listened, the less i liked it.  now, several months later it never makes it out of my stack of 1500 cds.  in fact, i am thinking of moving it to the ever rotating pile of cds to trade.  i guarantee that most of you will never listen to this cd more than a year from now....there just isn't enough there to hold one's attention.  white guys doing stripped down blues is nothing new or radical or interesting.  listen to the originals (hooker, guy, waters, harpo, wells, rev.gary davis, hopkins, wolf....)....they are much more interesting.  If white blues is what you crave, search out peter green (hot foot powder) or go for the funkier js blues explosion (completely unlike the other artists i mention above).
B000069AUI|5.0|One thing that always strikes me in these reviews is that they are often overloaded by fans of the specific artist.  Well, in all honesty, I am not a Coldplay fan.  In fact, all I knew of them before a recent barage awards was the song &quot;Yellow&quot; that I did not like.<br />However, living in an area where radio is repetive and dull, a ray of sunshine has come through in the song &quot;Clocks&quot;.  This song is just awesome and has sparked my interest in this album.  That and the song &quot;Politik&quot; played at the Grammy's.<br />Now, I have owned this album a weak and find it is great through and through.  I particularly like the piano arrangements and the vocals.  In a weird way this album reminds me of a mellow and more melodic version of recent Radiohead albums.  As a Radiohead fan, I actually find this album better than the recent Radiohead offerings.  Of particular greatness are the songs &quot;The Scientist&quot; which maybe the best song , &quot;Clocks&quot; which has an awesome piano backing that is very full, and  &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; which is another great lyrical piece.  The rest of the album is just as strong.<br />I think Coldplay have done a great job of being creative, something that lacks these days, and they sound unique.  Even my feelings of them being similar to Radiohead is only a vague similarity.  I hope this band keeps it up.
B000002BFZ|5.0|This is one of those rare albums in a record collection, so unique and so rare, that it is great simply because of its vision and message.  With that said, I find this to be somewhat of an ironic album -- I consider it to be both PJ's best and worst.  From a repeat and rock perspective, this album is right at the bottom along with biurnal, which is not to say it is bad because PJs valley is analogous to another artist's peak.  However, from an album completeness perspective, this album might be the greatest album ever recorded (DSOM included), and I do not exaggerate.  I, like so many other amazon.com reviewers, am constantly baffled by both fan's and critic's lack of attention to this sheer work of art.  From start to finish, this album is literally a rock opera that teaches us the most valuable lesson about life -- to live it.  Thank you for that Pearl Jam.  Give this album a listen sometime if you do not understand.  I refuse to give more away.  I liken it to one of those blurry pictures -- hard to see at first, but once you see it, that is all you can see.  Enjoy!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Hee hee hee, I feel guilty for liking this album. I am WAY too old for this kind of music, really! That is why I didn't DARE buy it in a store, (haha!) but ordered it from www.Amazon.com instead. However, I think the album is fun to listen to. It isn't exactly what I would call quality music, but there's a certain charm to it. The whole controversy over whether the two girls really are lesbian lovers or not doesn't interest me. I believe it is most likely just a marketing stunt.
0800125789|5.0|I can honestly say that I love this movie. At the time when I first watched this movie I wasn't old enough to rent R movies and I was a huge Arnold fan so I rented this movie. The movie presents a great story that has action and is funny at the same time. The movie showed what many kids like me wished they could do, go into the movies with their heroes. I watched it many times since then, so much so the movie doesn't seem as good as it did. The movie just offers so much to like I can't see why anybody wouldn't like it.<br />Reviewers wrongfully made fun of this movie and probably caused it to tank. I was so mad when I found out that there was no chance for a sequel. I awaited a sequel to this movie almost as much as a sequel to T2.
B00000AD94|4.0|Spock's Beard's debut, &quot;The Light&quot;, is somewhat hard to digest upon the first listen.  For one thing, the production is pretty bad, so if you're expecting the sound quality of &quot;V&quot;, well, you won't get it.  I would not recommend starting you're SB collection here.  You might find it too wierd.  Get &quot;V&quot; first.  However, if you're already a fan of the band, you need this, cuz' it rocks.<br />The songwriting is, for the most part, quite good.  Some parts seem like they don't fit, and some transitions in songs are not very smooth.  However, this is not a big problem, and this is a pretty damn good album.  The title track is a 15 minute epic, with many different sections.  It features several crazy instrumental bits and quirky lyrics.  A good song.  &quot;Go the Way You Go&quot; is a hard rock song with elements of pop.  &quot;The Water&quot; is the 23 minute epic, and the centerpiece of the album.  Well, their are some mixed opinions, but this is my favorite song on the album.  The story of a man's downfall, told very realisticly by Morse.  Some moments reminiscent of Yes and Pink Floyd.  The end is truly touching.<br />Overall, this is a good album for Beard fans.  Unfortunately, the great Dave Meros and Nick D'Virgilio do not stand out as much, possibly because of the production.  Neal and Alan are really great on this record.  I think every other SB album deserves 5 stars, but this one is just a bit below the rest.  I'd strongly recommend this to already fans of the Beard.  If you're not already a fan of the Beard, well, it's never too late.  Check out &quot;V'.
B000056K04|4.0|When I first heard this CD, I thought it was great.  I had only become a DMB fan upon hearing Before These Crowded Streets, and while I knew of other DMB albums, this was my second studio exposure to the group. The songs were catchy and sounded great.<br />However, after having this album for a couple of years now and filling out my DMB collection, I don't find this album particularly wonderful.  The musicianship that shows up on other DMB albums is missing here.  Fortunately, it shows up in concert, but even lyrically these songs are not too fantastic.  Take the lead track &quot;I Did It&quot; for instance.  Nothing too compelling there.  Of course the album is much stronger than that, but a lead track does say a lot.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is a good album.  The song &quot;Everyday&quot; is fantastic as is &quot;Mother Father&quot; which features Santana.  Even &quot;When the World Ends&quot; and &quot;The Space Between&quot; are great songs.  They just don't sound very DMB.  Try the recent live album &quot;at Folsom Field&quot; to hear what this album should of been.
B000002GFC|2.0|I love Cream, I love most of the songs on this CD -HOWEVER, this CD is poorly remastered (actually it downright ...!). It is unlistenable on heaphones( I'm talking the expensive kind).
B00005YW4H|5.0|I'll admit that I never heard of Norah Jones until the Grammy Award Show. The only reason I purchased the album was because she won the 8 awards, so I figured I was missing out. I was. For fans of this genre, it's the perfect album.  She's got a great, soft voice and I love the instrumentation. It's a very relaxing album.  Two of my favorites include, obviously, &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and &quot;Turn Me On.&quot; Now, this style of music isn't for everyone, but it certainly fit my eclectic taste.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of brothers is an extremely detailed look at the experience of war.  Its ten one hour episodes start with the men of Easy Company, 101st Airborne, during the rigors of basic training and the process of becoming soldiers.  From the series' onset the men's youth, exuberance, but also naivety about what is to come, are the subject of a deep introspective look at war and all its tragedies.  The bond that these individuals develop episode by episode is well chronicled, as well as the major operations that Easy Company participated in during the liberation of Europe: D-Day, Market Garden, Bastone, the capturing of Hitler's Eagles Nest, to V-E Day.  The great depth of the characters and their experiences are like no other war movie ever captured on film (granted, the ten hour series length allows for this).  If you liked Saving Private Ryan you'll love Band of Brothers.  I can't sing its praises enough for those of you who want to understand maybe just a small portion of these men's experiences and the horrors of war.  My only caution: the series is graphic in nature due its content.  This is not done for audience effect, merely to correctly document the realities of the condition.  For those viewers that do not care for this level of realism you may want to think twice about experiencing this series, because it truly is an experience.  Otherwise, devote ten hours of your life to Band of Brothers and you will not be disappointed.
B00006LLJ4|5.0|I always love a good Stephen Spielberg movie, and this is another great addition.  The suspense throughout the movie, the plot is wonderfully done... the twists in happenings keeps you on your toes and wondering.  Tom Cruise also does a fantastic job at acting as normal... he is the dark and mysterious character we all know and love...  I would urge anyone to purchase this as I have watched it many times and will continue to watch it many more times.  Another film that I feel that isn't so racy that the whole family couldn't almost enjoy it (maybe if you had children in the teens at least)
B00005YXZH|5.0|I'm sorry, I just can't see how anyone can backlash over such a beautiful piece of art as this.  Nothing about this demands or begs for flash-in-the-pan success, critical acclaim, or fawning over at its beauty and wonder.  What happened with being dropped by Reprise had nothing to do with some \\"conspiracy\\" to gain a stronger consumer interest (It didn't do all that well compared to other major pop releases anyway).  There's nothing forced or fake to be found on this record.  When something hits, over and over again, such resounding chords, there must be something special and unique.  <br />When the instrumetal breakdown 4 minutes into \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" comes cascading down, as if the song was just given birth to and became fully fleshed out, and it just sends tingles down my spine.  When the quiet hisses and static blur the gentle vocals and strumming on \\"Radio Cure\\" and I just become eveloped in another universe.  When \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" seems to stop mid-song and leaves nothing but feedback like a howling desert wind at night, and I realize that I've found something truly wonderful.  When I've listened to the album some 100 times or so and I realize that it's quickly becoming part of the soundtrack to my life.<br />Things are borrowed on this album, oh yes, but isnt everything in popular music?  And the way Tweedy & Co. twist and distort traditional song structures, or even lay down something so deceptively simple that it sounds completely new (\\"Kamera,\\" \\"War on War,\\" \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\") belies their true mastery of the artform.  Whatever country, rock, electronic, classical, or pop influenced this record, it becomes so swallowed and assimilated that it's impossible to tell it's anything but the band's own baby.  <br />The most compelling part of this music is how many moods are conveyed at once.  Even on the gloriously upbeat pop of \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You\\" and \\"Pot Kettle Black\\" (the best song REM should've done but never did), thereare the dark undercurrents that remind you just how bleak the themes are.  And even on the album's darkest track, the aforementioned \\"Radio Cure,\\" there seems to be the slight glimmer of home as the song reaches its climax and Tweedy cries in that gentle unearthly wail \\"Distance has no way of making love understandable.\\"  There are just so many surprises and hidden beauties to this record that they cannot all be mentioned, for fear that this review would take days to write.  Whoever dismisses this as the mere jockeying of record labels for more of our cash doesn't deserve to delve deep into this record and find these treasures underneath.  Whomever thinks it's too simple or sad or dark or poppy really needs to take another look, for their own sake.  Never has such a disjointed record sounded so whole.
0375414053|5.0|I read this book afer a recommendation and I have to admit, I laughed out loud many times !  Kate Reddy has it all, a husband, 2 children, a full-time job and just not enough hours in her day !  Sound familiar ??  Well, sit back and laugh, cry and relate to this busy, over stressed woman going through her daily routine !  I loved her \\"to-do lists\\" at the end of each chapter. Well written, this British woman makes you understand the constant pulls on her time, dealing with a male-dominated workforce and the local \\"Muffia\\" (those fulltime stay at home moms who can simultaneously make homemade pies while handmaking clothes.....you know the type !) A must read for all us working mothers.....if anything to show us we aren't alone !  You'll soon be saying \\"I don't know how she does it !\\"
B000069HK2|5.0|I am completely amazed! This cd totally caught me off guard when I bought it when it came out.  I had only heard Box Full of Sharp Objects and I knew that I had to have this cd. I was not disappointed at all, because every song on this cd is full of so much passion and talent that you can't help but fall in love with Bert's vocals and the band's musicianship. Every single song on this cd is just bleeding with passion and heart, which is quite evident in the lyrics to all of the songs. The Used is everything music should be about in my eyes, because they rock out, they feel everything they say, and they all have a true love for music. This cd is truly amazing and every song is perfect! It's my favorite cd of all time and I am a huge music enthusiast. My favorite tracks are \\"Blue and Yellow\\", \\"Greener With the Scenery\\", \\"Box Full of Sharp Objects\\", \\"Poetic Tragedy\\", and \\"Noise and Kisses\\".  I highley recommend this cd if you like Glassjaw, Finch, Starting Line, AFI, Taking Back Sunday, Thrice, or Thursday.  The Used is by far the best band of 2002 and I believe they are the best ever!  Buy this cd, turn it up as loud as you can, and hold on, because you are about to be blown away by The Used! Man, Bert has an amazing voice!
B00003W8NM|4.0|This was a great movie.  I removed 1 star because it was a little hard to follow the first time around... You really have to watch it a couple times to totally understand the whole plot.  When I realized what was really going on I couldn't believe it and I had to watch the movie over again from my new perspective which made things all the more funny!  Some of the material was a bit graphic but very realistic and kept me believing that the fights were real and that what was happening could really happen and may actually be happening as well.  I loved Brad Pitts role in this movie and think that his character was chosen very nicely.  I also loved the character that Meatloaf played.  This is a great movie to watch again with different people around because the different commments that are made during the movie will change how you see it... and it will seem different each time.  It is very much worth buying.
B000002C25|3.0|I hate to give them 3 stars for this, considering how I TECHINICALLY hate this band, Liam's singing, their ripping on the Beatles, Thom Yorke, Coldplay, etc. etc. etc., but nevertheless I still find this album a fun listen.  When I first bought it in 1998 I was actually listening to it probably about once a day, enraptured in the lengthy, almost cozy song structures that they created (although I always disliked \\"All Around the World\\"-can you say 5 minutes too long?).  Liam's bratty whine was almost effecting, and it made generally good background formless rock to listen to.  Eventually I almost felt ashamed owning the record, and despite the fact that I secretly liked it, I did end up selling it (for what, 2 bucks?).  Truth be told, though, they always have, and probably will always be in some fashion, good at this sort of manufactured, mindless pop.  The lyrical fragments in each song are sometimes repeated 2 or 3 times, with the lines a bit rearranged each time, and what lyrics there are are pretty uninspired (\\"Don't go away/Say that you'll stay/Forever and a day\\").  The riffs are circular and generally uninspired.  But it's so crunchy, loud, rocking (even on the slower songs like \\"Magic Pie\\" and \\"Don't Go Away\\"), and sincere (especially when they aren't trying to make a point like on the leadoff \\"D'You Know What I Mean\\") that it's hard to resist even for someone like me who (I think) has standards.  As a result, I gave in and bought it again on cheap, just to remind me what this record had to offer in the way of mindless fun.  Doesn't hold a candle to Blur by any means (you mean they were competing with each other???), but it's at least better than Kula Shaker (ugh, now THERE'S something to hate) and it's always there if you just want to empty your mind and rock out in a head-noddingly-approved manner.  Don't worry, I won't tell anybody :)
B00005YW4H|5.0|said Arif Mardin, Turkish born producer of this album, when she received the \\"Best Album of The Year\\" award and the person who discovered Norah Jones. He is right, she is incredible. Arif Mardin who also won the \\"Producer of the year, Non-Classical honors\\" award gave one fine singer to the music industry. A must have album.
0684857820|5.0|Alice Sebold has a gift for not tiptoeing politely around raw, painful issues.  Her opening account of the actual rape is stunning in it's brutality and while you want to avert your eyes, you don't.  I love her honest creativity.  She does what few writers can.
B000051ZST|5.0|Road Trip was such a funny movie!  It kept me on the edge of my seat laughing.  Tom Green does a nice job in this movie as the &quot;story teller&quot; part, and he isn't so bad that you get tired of listening to him and/or watching him.  He is just the right amount of funny.  :o)  The whole trip that the guys go on is a riot a minute and the things that happen to them aren't so unbelievable that it doesn't remain funny, it is almost realistic as if you could see that happening if you were in their shoes!  But would you want to be in their shoes?  :o)  I say I would love to be in their shoes because they built a stronger friendship amongst each other and gained new experiences along the way as well as giving us all something to laugh about.  It was a funny movie and very much worth buying.
B000002LOE|3.0|First off, the songs you need to get this album for:<br />Low<br />Half a World Away<br />Country Feedback<br />Me in Honey<br />These are some of REM's best songs EVER.  \\"Low\\" is a down-tempo, very dark song centered on Stipe's circling, introspective lyrics about divorce, death of a relationship, tension, what have you.  The airy instrumentation is evocative and helps propel this to the level of REM classics.  \\"Half a World Away\\"<br /> is a charming sitar-flecked song with a dreamy pace and effective vocal stylings from Stipe and spot-on harmonies from Mills.  \\"Country Feedback,\\" as plenty of you almost surely know, is REM'S dark classic on this record, a sort of one-off studio-wise that has Stipe envisioning desolation and loss of hope in his lyrics.  \\"Crazy what you should've had/ I need this, I need this\\" he repeats passionately as the song breaks down into drop-D tuning guitar ruminations from Buck.  Worth the price of admission alone.  \\"Me in Honey,\\" however, is a quittesential REM album closer, all upbeat and dark undercurrents, with Kate Pierson of B52's leading her powerful voice to the track.  A passionate paean to one-sided relationships.<br />That said, this is their most inconsistent and radio-friendly release.  For you Mike Mills lovers, he sings on two tracks and does a decent job on both.  \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" is a bit bouncy and cheery for my tastes, although very melodic and sweet, and \\"Texarkana\\" is fairly bleak and directionless but still a good listen.<br />The rest (I don't count \\"Losing My Religion\\" due to it being so overplayed) is essentially filler.  \\"Radio Song\\" is silly and superfluous, and doesn't mean a tenth as much as Stipe's passionate vocal would make it out to be.  \\"Endgame\\" is an instrumental, not as good as their others on Automatic for the People, New Adventures in Hi-Fi and their B-sides.  \\"Belong\\" is pretty much useless, with Stipe doing spoken word over a typical REM backing track.  Kind of reeks of laziness on the band's part.  No fear however, with the 12 other masterpieces they released.  Despite \\"Religion,\\" this is probably the last purchase any would-be REM fan should make.  \\"Murmur,\\" \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi,\\" or \\"Automatic for the People\\" first.
B000006O7C|5.0|'Sketches' is a fantastic piece of music.  The quality and sheer artistic genius of Jeff Buckley's work comes out in full force on the first disc, which alone is well worth the price of the set.  It's hard to imagine what changes Jeff may have made, because the tracks are so captivating they seem perfect already.  <br />'The Sky is a Landfill' is a smooth-yet-rockin' opener that like many tracks on this disc reaches heights Chris Martin and Coldplay can only dream of achieving.  Throughout this collection one can see not only how influential Jeff has been, but the diversity of his own influences -- from the Prince-influenced (and Grammy nominated) 'Everybody Here Wants You' to the equally soulful gospel tune 'Satisfied Mind,' the legacies of Jeff and many who came before him shine through.<br />The second disc gives a glimpse at what might have been; songs in the making.  This disc is fascinating because it gives us a look into Jeff's songwriting and the process of experimentation he underwent to achieve his unique sound.  This is more than Jeff playing around on a four-track (although he does play around a little); it is a glimpse of a true artist doing what he did best -- create.<br />If you loved 'Grace' and/or have any sort of appreciation for Jeff's music, this set is a MUST HAVE.  Pick it up.
0316666343|5.0|This book is a wonderful read.  It is haunting and at times, downright scary.  But above all, it is beautifully written and stays with the reader long after they have finished it.
B00005JLF5|5.0|When Deep Space Nine first made its debut on television, I was a young Next Generation fan, firmly entranced in the theory that science fiction adventure could only come from a moving source.  Therefore, after giving DS9 a cursory glance its first two seasons, I moved on, only to realize nine years later, how wrong I was.<br />Deep Space Nine is perhaps the most overlooked drama in television history.  I believe I can say that objectively, given the fact my strong loyalty to a starship-based drama series blurred my vision of it for so long.  The excitement, drama, character development, and social issues during the most stationary of Star Trek series' has quietly become its best all-around legacy.<br />By being \\"limited\\" to a space station on the edge of an entrance to a new portion of the galaxy, DS9 enables fans to once again feel the thrill of the \\"final frontier,\\" in a fresh, new format. The action comes to the station, instead of the ship finding the action. A bold and logical step in the evolution of the Star Trek universe.  The show's platform enables the story and character development to flow smoothly from one show to the next, a feature lacking in prior Star Trek series.<br />In addition to a richer, more intimate storyline and detailed character development, political and social issues are examined unlike ever before, giving the series a continuity and reality superior to any sci-fi series to come before or after it.  This DVD box set, and all those upcoming have great sound options, along with crystal clear visuals and effects. <br />Even if you aren't a Star Trek fan, but love intense sci-fi dramas, give DS9 a shot. It's a series that deserves much more credit than it's predecessors.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence have really put forth an album that is so great, words cannot even come close to expressing.  From the ballad &quot;My Immortal&quot; to the hauntingly gloomy and wicked &quot;Haunted&quot;, this is guaranteed to be a cd you will wish never ends.  Amy Lee's voice is so angelic and beautiful and powerful all at the same time.  I SEVERELY recommend this album even if you have heard only one or ten of their other songs.  You won't be disappointed.
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento is a really wonderful thriller that captivates and entertains.  It's funny at times, scary at times, and confusing at times but it is definitely one of the most creative and tricky movies I've seen in a long time.  It's one of those movies that you talk about for a long time after you've watched it.
0452282152|3.0|This novel is definitely not a great work of literature, in my opinion, but the story is engaging and it is easy to read. The main problem with the novel is that it does not have any subplots, in addition to Griet's life as a servant, to &quot;jazz it up&quot; a bit. I found that because of this, the short novel became a little boring at times. Still, the characters are lively and the &quot;what if...?&quot; idea is inventive.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan's CD is one of the greatest CD's I've ever purchased. Like other punk bands, they add the troubles of life, but Simple Plan writes about the trouble of being kids. Their song &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; is about falling in love and having your heart broken. &quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot; is about waking up in the morning and everything just getting worse. &quot;You Don't Mean Anything&quot; is about a troubled relationship and one's point of view about the other. &quot;I'm Just A Kid&quot; is about how hard being a kid can be when you don't fit in and are trying to impress someone (featured on the movie The New Guy). &quot;When I'm With You&quot; is about being in love with someone, but they never seem to have time for you. &quot;Meet You There&quot; is about being so in love you would do anything for them and meet them anywhere. &quot;Addicted&quot; is my personal favorite, and it's about having your heart broken but you still love the person so much you can't drive yourself away from them. &quot;My Alien&quot; is about having a girlfriend/friend that is very different from other people and still loving them. &quot;God Must Hate Me&quot; is about how everything seems to be going wrong, and you feel cursed because of it. &quot;I Won't Be There&quot; is about having a problematic relationship and wanting to get out of it without hurting the other's feelings. &quot;One Day&quot; is about the troubles of having your parent's control you and how kids will someday have independence and won't have to listen to parents. &quot;Perfect&quot; is about having problems with your father and wanting to know how he feels that you've finally become what YOU wanted to be. I'm not going to tell you what the bonus tracks are, but they are both really good too.
B000069CWE|4.0|If you haven't read this aleady, Reanimation is a remix album. There's only three new songs on this album (which are remixes as well), and though the pull-out booklet says that Linkin Park wrote everything on here, I have my doubts. So what do I give this album? Four stars. Why, you ask?<br />For starters, it has the most beautiful and emotionally rousing opening that I've heard on any CD. Period. It starts with a sixty-seven second long orchestral piece led by Phoenix at the cello, and then as it slowly fades on a bittersweet note, you hear an electronic trickle pierce the atmosphere. It gets a little deeper, stops, and then drops the track into a fiendishly well mixed techno/hip-hop hell, beginning with Mike Shinoda's soberingly acidic rap and descending into Chester Bennington's well-sung tale of torture. And that's just the first two tracks.<br />It did them well to enlist the help of pretty much every major talent in the nu metal and hip-hop world, including Jay Gordon (who helmed the previously described track, Points of Authority) Chali 2na (Jurassic 5), and Johnathan Davis (Korn).  What didn't help their case any was the level of freedom that they permitted some of the lesser known (or maybe just talented) rappers on this track to mingle with the lyrics. Fortunately, some of the new writing isn't too bad (Frgt/10 and H! Vltg3 come to mind).<br />Besides maybe P5hng Me A*wy, whose electric keyboard ballads bordered on overkill, I didn't hear one track on this album whose mix work I didn't like. There's a lot of sampling, but it's so well woven into the tapestry of sound that you hardly notice. The first two tracks are definitely the highlights of this disc, but everything afterwards is definitely worth your listening time. This one might not have been Linkin Park's baby, but the \\"Reanimation\\" of these classics is so good that it's hard to care.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This 2DVD set will be monstrous.  If you're one of the millions of Led Zeppelin fans worldwide who have always regretted the small amount of available footage of the band that's been made commercially available, then this set is a dream come true.<br />Comprised of material from both before and after the Madison Square Garden shows in New York City at the end of the 1973 American tour captured in the film \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", this collection will include material from the band's home country of the UK in 1970, 1975, and 1979, as well as from Australia in 1972 and Denmark in 1969.  Many other surprises (including extra footage from the MSG 1973 shows, and some U.S. 1972 footage) are also in store!<br />Don't expect note-for-note recitations of the album tracks.  This set will be so much more than that!  These DVDs will showcase the wild improvisational genius that Zeppelin displayed in the era long before click-tracks, pre-recorded backing tracks for live situations, etc.  This DVD set will vividly display the work of four guys who walked up on stage, grabbed their instruments, and let it freaking RIP!<br />You can't expect visual content of a quality to rival that from concerts recorded in the last few years, but the 5.1 audio mix added to large amounts of material on the DVDs will go a long way toward compensating for the age of the footage.  If you don't have a surround sound setup yet, and you're a big Led Zeppelin fan, then this release will probably be enough reason for you to go ahead and take the plunge.<br />Also, don't miss \\"How the West Was Won\\", the 3CD set compiling the two white-hot Led Zeppelin shows from Long Beach and Los Angeles, California on the brilliant 1972 American tour!
B00000099Y|5.0|After the success of Tool's 1993 debut album \\"Undertow\\", the band was already receiving acclaim for the live stint on the third annual Lollapalooza festival and for their disturbing music videos for the songs \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex\\". When it came time to record their sophomore effort \\"Aenima\\", bassist Paul D'Amour left the band and was replaced by Englishman Justin Chancellor. When the band recruited David Botrill, the band wanted to broaden their progressive-metal sound to newer heights that most bands wouldn't have done when it came to make a second album. Whereas most groups try to make a second album that was more accessible or stick to the formula that made their first album great, Tool didn't do any of those things. Instead, they went to darker and more melodic territories to set the \\"Aenima\\" album further apart from their debut album. What Tool did was make on one of the best hard rock albums of the 1990s that broke more rules on how to rock harder with a much darker sensibility. <br />The first track off of \\"Aenima\\" is the metal-power of \\"Stinkfist\\" with its atmospheric-like guitar intro which leads into a powerful rock tune with driving guitars from Adam Jones, melodic bass riffs from Justin Chancellor, hard-hitting drum hooks from Danny Carey, and awesome vocals from Maynard James Keenan who belts out these loud screams during the chorus. \\"Eulogy\\" is a brilliant hard rock tune with an excellent intro of weird bass riffs, atmospheric guitar sounds, soft percussions that lasts for a couple of minutes with Maynard singing in a distorted tone and then at full tilt sings clearly once the guitar and drums come in like a powerful punch into the stomach. \\"H.\\" is a dark, melodic guitar-driven tune highlighted by Adam Jones' expressive guitar work that sounds a little bit like Black Sabbath and King Crimson backed by Carey's gymnastic drum-style. \\"Useful Idiot\\" is a forty-second instrumental that sounds like soft percussion sounds backing soft electrical sparks that serves as an intro to the bass-driven \\"Forty-Six & 2\\" that is highlighted by Chancellor's bass intro along with Carey's diverse drum-style w/ beautiful percussion sounds, Jones powerful guitar charges, and Keenan's powerful vocals. <br />\\"Message To Harry Manback\\" is a weird tune of a man talking to a man called Harry Manback backed by an ambient guitar background from Adam Jones that serves as a weirdness to the band. \\"Hooker With A Penis\\" is a powerful hard-rock song filled by powerful drums from Danny Carey, brutal guitar charges from Adam Jones, and ferocious screams from Maynard James Keenan who can probably scream the hell out of such current divas like Mariah Carey (no relations to Tool's drummer), Christina Aguilera, and Jessica Simpson. That man is wreaked with awesomeness. The next track is a break in the middle of the album titled \\"Intermission\\" which features a weird circus-like organ sound that shows Tool's funny side. Pretty cool intermission. Next is the melodic-power of \\"jimmy\\" dominated by Chancellor's melodic bass-riffs, Carey's brilliant drum-power, Jones' guitar grooves, and Keenan's hypnotic vocals. \\"Die Eier Von Satan\\" (or in translation from German to English, \\"The Eggs/Balls of Satan\\"), is a weird industrial-like tune with distorted bass riffs and percussion sounds, hard-driven guitar hooks, and vocals by Marko Fox singing in German with Gudrun Fox translating in English. <br />\\"Push*t\\" is another weird metal track that lasts for nearly ten minutes with a fuzzy guitar track that sounds at first like buzzing bees with mesmerizing vocals from Keenan, magnificent drumming from Carey and atmospheric bass hooks from Chancellor that shows the excellent musicianship of this band. \\"Cesaro Summability\\" is another weird track of a baby crying with distorted guitars in the background that serves as an intro to the next track \\"Aenema\\". \\"Aenema\\" is the album's big highlight with its melodic bass hooks, guitar grooves, powerful drums, and Keenan's powerful track that starts out as a metal-driven track until the middle of the song where Justin Chancellor's bass riffs dominate the track backing Keenan's mesmerizing vocals with Carey's powerful drumming accompanying him. Then Jones' brings in a powerful slide guitar solo until Carey comes in with this powerful drum track while Chancellor and Jones both come in with their assaults backing Keenan's vocals until the song softens up a bit and then becomes a even powerful song right through the end. Tool at its finest. <br />\\"(-) Ions\\" is a four-minute instrumental track of atmospheric sounds and electrical sparks in the background that serves as an intro the final track of the album called \\"Third Eye\\". The thirteen-minute song \\"Third Eye\\" starts off with a sample of comedian Bill Hicks talking the good things about drugs and saying that all the best rock albums were made on drugs. During Hicks' talks on drugs, Tool comes in with a powerful, blistering song with intense drumming from Carey, guitar grooves from Jones, and Keenan's powerful vocals who screams in the fourth minute of the song. After four minutes, a huge instrumental part comes in from Jones, Chancellor, and Carey comes in for about a few minutes then there's a quiet break during the eighth minute part of the song until things get loud again by Keenan's ferocious vocals who screams like a madman backed by the rest of the band's powerful instrument assaults. <br />\\"Aenima\\" is an excellent masterpiece from Tool. The band not only beat the sophomore slump but also went way beyond it. Tool would have more success to come including a headlining slot at the final Lollapalooza festival in 1997. Things however, wouldn't be so good in the years to come as lawsuits from their manager and record company came at them and forced their fans to wait for a new record in the next five years. \\"Aenima\\" is a true testament to Tool's power as a band and as a musical force.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This cd is so amazing.  In it's songs, it takes the simplest melody and develops it into a complex orchestra of numerous instruments and vocals.  Two thumbs up
0684857219|5.0|This is truely an amazing book.  Anyone interested in weightlifting, from simple basement workout to full gym bodybuilders should buy and read this.  All aspect of the sport are covered in detail, and no stone is left unturned.  I recommend this book to everyone I know that lifts weights and all of my bodybuilder friends.  This book has helped me add 2 inches to my arms and 3 inches to my thighs!  It is truely an amazing book and is avidly referred to as &quot;The Bible of Bodybuilding&quot;
B00005B36H|5.0|I can only begin to imagine the pressure put on Tool's shoulders over the past few years; Aenima accomplished and embodied what few albums can. It was complete, alarmingly deep, meticulous, and more importantly, it's own being. It was created as if in a musical void, absent of influence and resemblence. In fact, I can confidently proclaim that Aenima is among the ten best albums of the 90's. <br />So how do you even begin to top an epic such as Aenima, or even match the scale of Aenima for that matter? While I can't tell you how, I can clue you into something that most Tool fans shouldn't find surprising: Tool have found the way, and have followed the path. That's right, I believe that Lateralus has topped Aenima. <br />Now, I'm not saying this after having heard the album only several times. I have listened through the entire album over a dozen times already, trying to digest every bit of the album and make as much sense of it as I can. In the months to come I will no doubt discover new subtleties, new perspectives, etc... Aenima continues to grow on me to this day, even after having owned the album for 2 years. <br />Lateralus is ferociously true to Tool's sound, musicianship, and style. At times the music drifts in a quiet daze with soft, resonant guitars accompanying Maynard's soothing voice, while at other times the pounding tom-toms and double bass drums tears through the musical landscape, fueled by Maynard's thick, rough wails. As a vocalist, Maynard has grown far beyond his capabilities showcased on Aenima. He now tries for more daring melodies with a thicker, more firm voice. The vocal effects are few on Lateralus, as they should be. Maynard's voice has approached the threshold of perfection, and there is no reason to tamper with perfection. <br />The percussion is also a standout on Lateralus. Quiet bongos, chirps, clicks and more underline each song's progression adding an edge to the music unlike any other. The percussion is far more prevalent on Lateralus than on Aenima; this is only a testament to Tool's meticulous nature and maturity. <br />On a whole, Lateralus is definitely a more angered Tool. &quot;Parabola&quot; and &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot; feature some of Tool's most vicious material since their earlier material. The last few riffs and tempos on &quot;Ticks &amp; Leeches&quot; are about as &quot;metal&quot; as Tool have ever sounded. This is not to say that the entire album is marred by overly ferocious overtones...the soothing, introspective moments remain, and are in great abundance across the album, even in the heavier songs. <br />Above all else, however, Lateralus demonstrates maturity. I'd say that in general maturity is the album's motif; song structures are more intricate, the guitar work is more daring, and the vocals are near perfection. Lateralus is the product of a more wise, venerable Tool. <br />Highlights of the album include &quot;The Grudge,&quot; a strong, high-impact opening track, &quot;Schism&quot;, the album's shining, beautiful single with incredible melodies, and &quot;Reflection&quot;, an 11-minute long voyage through percussion solos and vocal magic by Maynard. <br />What more can I say? This album will undoubtedly take several months to grow on me...ideally I would review the album in several months time, however it's only fitting to write a review now. Honestly, give Lateralus a listen. Give it several listens. When it starts to make sense you'll be dumbfounded and hopelessly addicted. And if any of you were privileged enough to get tickets to any of their shows, I envy you. It will undoubtedly be one of the year's best performances.
B00005A46T|2.0|build up for this album was intense. The members calling this \\"pure heavy metal\\" and even mentioning the phrases \\"grindcore riffs\\" and \\"death metal\\", which got me truly excited. I then heard \\"Left Behind\\" on a teaser before the album was released and thought that it was a mediocre track, more nu-metal than anything, but also thought that this one song isn't what the album would sound like; I still could not wait for 'Iowa''s release. I bought it the day it came out, and immediately in the the C.D. player. What I heard was not bad, but it was not at all what I expected.<br />Metal? In a sense. Brutal? Now that makes me laugh. Slipknot's 'Iowa' is not a \\"death metal\\" record, or even close to anthing of that sort. It is more or less one of the lamest thrash records in recent history.=. Granted, \\"The Heretic Anthem\\" is a solid thrash track that brings the likes of Slayer and Testament to mind. \\"Metabolic\\" is an odd song with a very heavy riff that goes throughout the song and has some gret lyrics and vocal work that shows Corey Taylor at his best. I am partial to \\"Gently\\" because it was my favorite track on 'Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.' and that the band has conformed well to their older stylings. The rest of the album is mediocre pseudo-metal - \\"I Am Hated\\" is one of their worst songs right behind the 'Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.' version of \\"Only One\\" - it is pure rap-metal nonsense (and he hates Fred Durst). The album might have been rated higher if what they were saying about it was true - how it was heavy metal - or if they didn't say that. I got worked up over nothing. If you are considering purchasing this album I warn you, this is not a heavy metal album. ... But if you enjoy this genre of music, by all means pick this record up, just don't call it metal.
B000089RVX|4.0|I was pretty hyped to hear this album after they began playing \\"bring me to life\\" on the radio.  What a great sound! I've heard it described as Linkin Park meets Tori Amos, and I guess that's accurate, but I was a little disappointed to find that Paul McCoy, who does the guest vocals on \\"bring me to life\\", is not featured on any of the other tracks.  Also, the album is short, with only 11 songs total, and it left me wishing for a little more.  However, I thought this cd was delightful!  Amy Lee's vocals are stunning, and definitely are the highlight of the band. Each song has somewhat of a gothic romanticism about it; lots of dreamy, almost nightmarish themes of dying, bleeding, taking my last breath, whispering, salvation, and of course, bringing me to life. The feeling is very consistant throughout the whole cd, although it may even be a little too repititous when you listen to the album from start to finish. The standout tracks are definitely \\"going under\\", \\"bring me to life\\", and especially \\"tourniquet\\", which I thought was a little morbid overkill at first, but has really grown on me the more I hear it.  Even the cd's several piano ballads are nice to listen to!  Overall, Fallen may not be hard enough for rap/metal or techno/industrial types, for whom it seems targeted, but it will surely be a mainstream hit.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is thirsting for something refreshingly new in rock, having such contrasting, yet complimenting elements as heavy guitar rifts and beats, side by side with beautiful vocals and passionate lyrics.
B000089CJI|5.0|I have to start off by saying this album is awesome!  I'm usualy not too into electronic music but one of my friends recommened this to me and I'm glad he did because even though it does have a very electronic feel the vocals (not just the lyrics but BG's voice) and background acoustic stuff(and the accordian!) is great and I dont think the album would have the same effect if it werent electronic this is a CD that you can pop in and let play from beginning to end and love every minute of it (even the clark gable song :). So what I'm saying is that if you can appreciate good music you will like this.
B00000IGGA|5.0|A lot of people, well more than one, don't like this album...

B000006MS3|4.0|When it was first released in 1982, \\"The Dreaming\\" was a radical departure from the sparse pop of Kate Bush's first three albums. The dense music with unusual instrumentation were and remain quite unique and not always easy to appreciate.<br /><br />The record is highly eclectic, ranging from the dense but haunting rocker \\"Get Out Of My House\\", through the danceable \\"There Goes A Tenner\\" to the anthemic, quasi-tribal \\"Sat In Your Lap\\". The lyrics are highly mysterious in a way that would set the prelude for her spiritual masterpiece [[ASIN:B00004R7TP Hounds Of Love]] in 1985.<br /><br />However, compared to the intensely personal \\"Hounds Of Love\\" and accessible but equally mystical [[ASIN:B00000293R The Red Shoes]], some of the lyrics here are quite disturbing, such as the title tune, whose well-intentioned theme about the displacement of Aborigines is let down by poor music, and \\"Houndini\\", about the difficulty of holding up magicians. \\"All The Love\\" is also somewhat morbid, and \\"There Goes A Tenner\\" is an odd, danceabel tale of people trying to destroy money that, given the mystical character of her work, could be seen as an attack on capitalism's desire for wealth.<br /><br />Thematically, indeed, \\"The Dreaming\\" was basically concerned with the problems of evil and the harm it can do, seen to best effect on \\"Pull Out The Pin\\" (about the Vietnam War) and \\"Get Out Of My House\\" where drummer Stuart Elliott gave a fiery pulse to Bush's passionate desire to exorcise a demon from herself.<br /><br />The highlight, however, was the utterly magical and mysterious \\"Night Of The Swallow\\" driven by heavenly and utterly mysterious (in their melody) uillean pipes and stings that blend in in a remarkable way with Bush's voice and Donal Lunny's bozouki.

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is an awesome band and this CD is very good.  All songs are wonderful and though provoking.  I've never heard such an intellectually stimulating rock album before.  The best tracks are My Immortal, Bring Me to Life, and Tournaquet.  However, these are the best among great songs.  This band is definitely something special and shouldn't be missed!

B00005J9M1|5.0|Pet Shop Boys included a lot of contemporary electronic noises in the arrangements for Very, and as a result the album has dated more than any of their others: you could safely listen to it as background music for playing Sonic or Super Mario. That doesn't make it irrelevant, though; Very evokes a particular time and place in popular culture and Pet Shop Boys' own development, and although it can border on frantic it's at least energising. The new remastered release pairs a second disc featuring some of their best b-sides and remixes, including the previously unreleased extended mix of Go West (their own mix, into which they throw everything - including the kitchen sink). A classic album, enhanced by the second disc.
B00000J2SQ|5.0|Is there a better guitarist at placing his solos perfectly into his band's songs than the incomparable Ritchie Blackmore. He does it all over this album.<br />The reviews to this CD are an unfortunate mixed bag. In the context of its 1982 release it was a great album -- it stands alone and on its own merits. An Amazon reader can clearly be misled.<br />If you were in high school in the early 80's -- particularly 1982 you know MTV played \\"Stone Cold\\" nearly every hour. But Death Alley Driver was the better video. Where is the DVD of all those great Rainbow videos anyway??<br />I remember the MTV Saturday night concerts and the Rainbow weekend was a superb show. The one thing which was very true that senior year of high school was that although Van Halen blew through town in November '82 to support Diver Down -- .38 Special was touring to support the Special Forces album -- Def Leppard released the spectacular Pyromania album in Feb./March '83 and toured to support it then -- those bands had nothing on Rainbow. Stone Cold was the video of the year.<br />When Van Halen dumped Diamond Dave in 1985 I thought Joe Lynn Turner would have been a great fit.<br />Joe Lynn Turner and Ritchie Blackmore were a cut above those other frontmen. The one thing which was absolutely true about Rainbow fans was that they were more devoted to their band than fans of other bands were.<br />Though smaller in number -- true fans of this band had a genuine affection for Ritchie Blackmore and Roger Glover despite the sometimes musical chairs lead singers and keyboard players and drummers over the years.<br />Today, Ritchie has gone in a new direction with Blackmore's Night pursuing folk and medieval renaissance music --- but at a concert at the Patchogue Playhouse in November of 2000 -- Ritchie went into the archives to really rock out on some Rainbow and Deep Purple classics -- and the crowd loved it. <br />Listen to this record and you will be rewarded.
B000002HH2|5.0|&quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; was my first introduction to Bjork, namely the video for the song. I absolutely loved the video and the song itself however I didn't get into Bjork until a few years ago with my other favorite Bjork cd &quot;Homogenic&quot;. Of all the cds I own by Bjork (which is most of them), &quot;Post&quot; is definitely my personal favorite Bjork cd. As much as I enjoy &quot;Homogenic&quot; and &quot;Vespertine&quot; a lot, I find her music on &quot;Post&quot; more gratifying to listen to. I also think that &quot;Post&quot; is a bit more diverse than her other albums after &quot;Post&quot;. The hooks and melodies are so uncanny and hard not to like. I absolutely love the big band sound of &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot;. The song itself is one of my all time favorite songs ever. I love how Bjork balances her vocals throughout the song. &quot;Hyperballad&quot; is simply an amazing song. Bjork's vocals really shines throughout the entire song. She really sounds incredible on that song. &quot;The Modern Things&quot; gives the listener a sample of the big band sound to come before &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot;. Another thing I have noticed on &quot;Post&quot; is how much freer Bjork sounds. The production is a lot more loose and not as slick as &quot;Vespertine&quot; IMO. I love &quot;Post&quot;. Definitely one of the best albums to come out of the '90s.
B000089RVX|5.0|I went to go see daredevil and although the movie was terrible 2 of the songs stood out and both are on this cd.  This cd is produced so immaculatly that i find myself not skipping any songs on it.  I like every single song, and i don't think i can think of any other cd that does that for me.  Amy's vocals on the tracks are amazing, she hits every single harmony that you've always thought, &quot;wow that'd be cool if the singer could hit that note&quot; but couldn't.  She hit's that note and then goes higher, and its not a scream, its singing and beautiful.  My only regret with this cd is that it isn't 5 hours long.
B000002TPS|5.0|I have reviewed this before but I am listening to this album right now as I type this so I feel that I should review it again.  Megadeth is my second favorite band of all time(pantera is number ONE) and I like all their albums except for risk(sorry dave but that album is a [dud]) and this album here is my favorite of the...megadeths.  The songs are catchy and you can hum them for days but they never get too repetitive.  The riffs are super crunchy but still retain some excellent melody.  <br />If your a megadeth fan then I'm sure you already know how great this album is.  If your looking to get into megadeth then you should get this album along with Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?  What is not to love about this cd?  It' contains some of their best lyrics, Dave voice is pretty tolerable in most places, it's got heavy riffs and EXCELLENT solos...
B00000JCOV|5.0|This cd kicks... slipknot rules! they are by-far the best band there is and this cd is one of the many reasons. though i dont find this cd as good as iowa,there other cd most people seem to. I would highly recomend this wait and bleed is still one of my favorite songs ever!!![.] though slipknot isnt for everyone I still say you should buy it!  <br />stay (sic)
B00005OAIE|5.0|This by far THE BEST Cd I have. After I heard No Such Thing and Your Body is a Wonderland on the radio, I decided to get this Cd. After getting this Cd and others by John Mayer, I can now say I am a full out John Mayer FANATIC!I definently recommend this Cd to anyone who is thinking about buying it.
B00003CXXM|1.0|I started watching this on a weekend away with 2 other couples.  By the time it was 20 minutes into it, I was the only one who hadn't given up and gone to bed!  It's very slow, and the ending is a letdown......it just sort of, ends.  No real character development, you don't really care what happens to the characters.  There are much better choices out there.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|I didn't really know much about this band until I heard One-Armed Scissor. When I heard it, I was shocked of how unique this band is. You can't really categorize them. <br />There are very few CD's you can listen to more than once over. This one of the few great CD's. The day I bought it, I listened to it four times. I would recommend this CD to anyone who listens to rock music. I guarantee you will love it.
B00006IU73|5.0|Despuès de escuchar algunos de los trabajos de esta banda (Signify, Recordings, Stupid Dream, The sky moves sideways y, especial, COMA DIVINE) llegè a la conclusiòn de que Porcupine Tree, tarde o temprano, depurarìa su estilo para llegar a la gran masa de rockeros esparcidos por el Planeta. De esta forma presentan In Absentia; una grabaciòn realizada con un estilo, a nuestro juicio, muy influenciado por RUSH (gran interpretaciòn de la guitarra acùstica con la elèctrica, el bajo y la baterìa bien marcados con un teclado llenando espacios y creando un magnìfico sònido total..) Sin duda, este es el CD màs comercial de esta banda, pero el hecho de que sea comercial no significa que no se disfrute de principio a fin.....una y otra vez...<br />After listening some of the works of this band (Signify, Recordings, Stupid Dreams, The sky moves sideways and, specially, COMA DIVINE) I realize that sooner or later Porcupine Tree will depurate their music style so can the world could know what this megaband is really capable to do. For this purpose comes In Absentia, newest Porcupine Tree record, in our opinion, highly influeted by RUSH (great combinations of the accustic and the electric guitar, bass and drums integrated by the magestic execution of the keyboards creating a magnificent music...) In our opinion, this the most commercial work of this band but, nevertheless, is very pleasant to listen to it again and again.....again and again....
B00006EXL5|5.0|this album is a wonderful peice of work through. i suggest you pick it up.through there screams, you can here there pain...its beautiful. if you like  bands such as The Used, Finch,  The Beauitul Mistake, and A Static Lullaby.I suggest you pick this up. defintly and if you dont have these then pick them up 2.
B00000F1D3|4.0|THE PRODUCTION QUALITY IS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS CD. A FEW SINGLES DO STAND OUT &quot; THE POWER&quot; MY FAVORITE. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH JUNIOR'S WORK. &quot; STRONG ENUFF&quot; IS A GREAT FLASHBACK TO DISCO. TAKING BACK MY HEART  SHOULDVE BEEN A SINGLE. OVER YOU SHOULDNT BE DISSAPOINTED WITH IT.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Though I have never seen it in English, the japanese version of this movie is fantastic.  It leads you in to a fantasy world beyond belief.  A world of greed, where a single girl over comes all odds in order to save her parents and new friends.
B000001EMW|2.0|This cd is dissapointing. Why? because it´s not a real mix of classical and metal music. The guys just played his cellos like playing electric guitars. Nothing else. It sounds cleanless and noisy. A mix of styles is not only to change the instruments.<br />If you want to listen a real mix of metal and classic music with real good arranges and high musicality buy the S &amp; M (Metallica and Orchestra)
B000089RVX|5.0|While I was interested in what some poeple thought about this cd I was surprised to find one person and being the first person to say anything about this cd was a 2 out of 5 and I am here to say they never heard it as a matter of fact there whole spill of what they said about the band must have been someone else cause this Evanesence is nothing like that. I found myself wanting Amy Lee to hold her and comfort her as I bared her lose of something and the strings of Moody made me want to kick the arsh of those who wronged them. This cd will pull you into it and never let you go only down fall is its only 44 mins long I NEED MORE?!?!?!?!!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Over the years, as an amateur film historian, I have dutifully watched this film several times in its various butchered incarnations (with the sound turned down to stop myself from cringing at the various, woefully inappropriate attempts to score the film).  I knew the film was one of the most important films in cinema history, but for the life of me, I just didn't &quot;get&quot; it.<br />With this new Kino restoration, I finally get it.  Metropolis, as it was meant to be seen, really and truly is an astounding film.  This restoration is incredible, making the movie look for all the world like it was filmed yesterday.  Yes, it still contains its dated pantomime overacting; but, my god, what a beautiful, stunning film!  The incorporation of description cards and photo stills to fill in the missing footage really helps to flesh out the story, so it makes more sense.  Best of all, the addition of the original 1927 score really enhances the film -- Finally, we have a score that matches the movie's action and historical significance!  The score itself is magnificent and memorable, and hopefully will be made available on CD.<br />This DVD is definitely a must-have for anyone interested in science fiction or film history in general.  If you already own one of the older, butchered copies of this film, keep it so you can make comparisons -- It will help you appreciate Kino's restoration even more.

B000002JS6|5.0|It's easy to understand why AC/DC's 1980 sensation Back In Black is so popular once you listen to it.  Sure we've all heard the ever-popular title track, but that one song is only the beginning of probably the best album to come out of the 80's. Every song on the CD was either a huge hit (many of which are still played regularly today) or an AC/DC fan's personal favorite.  Some of their later (and earlier) releases have been a bit inconsistent with the success of Back In Black, which only gives more acclaim to this one.  This album is no doubt your best chance to hear AC/DC at the high point of their musical careers.  Even after the death of former lead singer Bon Scott.  The appearance of the CD may seem too simple--the 10 songs and one-dimensional CD cover art--but there in lies its timeless brilliance.  It's so basic and done seemingly effortlessly that you'll have a hard time finding a low point.<br />\\"Hells Bells\\" is a slow-starter, something that's not characteristic of the rest of the songs.  And once the track picks up and the music overtakes the church bells, we can clearly see where the CD is taking us.  \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" is one of the faster songs, and also one of the best.  Its classic rock sound makes it one of the best AC/DC songs you`ll have the pleasure to hear.  As we come to the tracks \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" and \\"Given The Dog A Bone\\", you will find two of the band's most underrated songs.  \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" has a start similar to that of \\"Shoot To Thrill\\", but it's slightly better.  As soon as you hear the opening of \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\", you will be hooked.  It's a Zeppelin-like ballad that deserves more credit than people give it.  And with the best yet to come, \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\" puts a lasting touch on the first half of the CD.<br />I'd said before that we all know the song \\"Back In Black\\".  And along with the other four final songs, it accounts for the high point of the CD.  \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" was a popular song, and with good reason.  It's a real different feel from the title track; and offers, in all probability, the best lyrics to an AC/DC song ever.  Even if they appear simple.  \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" is probably my personal favorite track on the CD.  It's just a brilliant rock & roll song and could have easily been a monster hit.  \\"Shake A Leg\\" is many people's choice for best song.  And it certainly deserves that sort of appreciation; it's an awesome song.  But \\"Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", I believe, is the best song on the CD.  As Young shouts out with ease: 'rock and roll ain't noise pollution / it makes good, good sense', you will understand the significance of the album's endless simplicity.<br />AC/DC, with Back In Black, has made a straight-forward rock recording that hides behind nothing.  There's no hidden meanings or twisted notions in any of the song lyrics; which is something many new bands have trouble doing.  So if you are looking for the best AC/DC album or for the best classic rock music, you have found it with this release.  It gets no better than this CD; and I have a hard time believing that any new band will ever be able to do what this band has done with Back In Black (Local H's 2002 Here Comes The Zoo comes close).  And finally, remember: 'rock and roll will never die'.Long\\" was a popular song, and with good reason.

B00005JKTF|5.0|This film contains one of the most memorable performances by any actor of any time.  Cate Blanchett puts an absolutely immaculate performance together with strong performances by a supporting cast.  She plays an English woman who goes to France as a spy in hopes of finding her love who was a member of the British RAF.  His plane went down in France and no one is able to tell her if he is dead or alive.  What she finds in France is a completely different world.  <br />As soon as Charlotte arrives in France she faces the tragedy that comes with being a spy.  Instead of retreating in fear, she presses on clinging to the hope of finding her love safe in France.  She ultimately becomes much more involved with her new life and identity in France.  She is involved in attacks on German forces, the hiding of Jewish children, and many other dangerous missions.  In the process she falls in love with another man.<br />This movie is paced very well.  Each scene flows directly into the next.  Cate Blanchett will ensnare you with the tremendous bravery exhibited in the character of Charlotte Gray.  This movie was overlooked at the Academy Awards.  It is one of my all-time favorite films.  Accompanied by a haunting score, Charlotte Gray will be a movie you will never forget.
B000089RVX|5.0|Like I said, I review music for my newspaper and I listen to a new release every week, and I'm almost always disappointed. I was completely blown away from the opening note to the end of this CD though! I have to say, from the very first note of Amy Lee's vocals, she had me hooked.  I don't mean I just kinda thought it was good, I mean hooked as in fanatically hooked.  As a guitar player, I'm still disappointed to hear the same generic \\"nu-metal\\" guitar tone that every single rock band seems to have nowadays, but Amy's voice makes up for it completely.  I would buy anything that had her vocals on it whether I liked the style of music or not.  I am very rarely impressed by anyone in the music industry these days, but this band definitely made an impression on my jaded, cynical ears.
B00005NTJM|1.0|1) Remastering: Zero stars:<br />a) The bass and treble have both been boosted to give us the illusion of greater frequency range. It's only an illusion: Most of music occurs between the bass and treble, and when you attempt this crude trick you get a thin, pinched, nasal sonority. <br />b) The individual instruments are more separate from each other, but individually the sounds of these intruments are not any clearer. This sort of separation makes the instruments blend together less well, and insignificant bits (drum cymbals, for example) stick out obtrusively.<br />2) &quot;Bonus tracks&quot;: Zero stars:<br />a) Long time Jethro Tull fans will enjoy listening to &quot;One for John Gee&quot; once or twice out of sheer curiosity and nostalgia, but it isn't worth buying the entire record to do that. &quot;One for John Gee&quot; is a very slight jazzy instrumental performed by musicians who are--or were, at least--not particularly adept at jazz. Ian Anderson and Mick Abrahams play again licks they've already played elsewhere on the record, and Glen Cornick attempts (and pretty much fails) a bass solo.<br />b) &quot;Love Story&quot; has been continuously available on &quot;Living in the Past&quot; since 1972. It was not recorded at the &quot;This Was&quot; sessions, and was never intended for &quot;This Was&quot;.<br />c) Mick Abrahams had already left Jethro Tull when &quot;A Christmas Song&quot; was recorded. &quot;A Christmas Song&quot; has even less to do with &quot;This Was&quot; than &quot;Love Story&quot; does. It also has been continuously available on &quot;Living in the Past&quot; since 1972.<br />3) Packaging: Two stars:<br />a) The original liner notes are reproduced microscopically. <br />b) The new liner notes are brief and less stylish than the original liner notes but still fairly interesting. They are large enough to read--and they are also ungrammatical. (Mr. Anderson appears to think &quot;hopefully&quot; means &quot;I hope&quot;. It does not. &quot;Hopefully&quot; is an adverb. If your flute playing is &quot;hopefully improving&quot; then it is full of hope as it improves--an unlikely prospect.) <br />c) There are no new photographs.<br />Next time leave well enough alone, thank you very much. Live in the past if you like; don't rewrite it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence's debut album, Fallen, completely lives up to expectations that were raised with their single &quot;Bring Me to Life.&quot;  The first song on the album, &quot;Going Under&quot; starts the listening experience off with a nice kick.  There are also some lovely, moody, songs filled with emotion.  This band has a techno style, slightly similar to Linkin' Park which mixes beautifully with the lyrics, and vocal stile of the band.  All in all, this CD is well worth the cost, and should help Evanescence make quite a name for themselves.
B000002MJ0|5.0|the cover looks like pink lined-cloud people french kissing. the music is less distorted than loveless, but more of a raw earthly surrealism possessing Sonic Youth-style treasures. the second and third tracks will make you cry. the rest are just dam good, sounds alot different than loveless but equally mesmerizing equally awesome. great great band, too bad they went defunct before i could see them live. the only band still around from the so-called shoegazer era is Sonic Youth, but they are different as well (see them live, buy their albums). shoegazer is just a name. god is just a word. Slowdive, Ride, Lush, Curve...yes they're all good too. pink mountains. lava dripping from hallucinogenic raindrops. mbv=good. listen and hear the wisdom, maybe a substance?

0743455967|5.0|You can say what you want about Stephen King...  But the man knows how to tell stories that people like to read.  He certainly didn't have to write this book, but he did.  I personally think novice writers could learn a thing or two from Mr. King...<br />ON WRITING is part autobiography, part writing guide.  In the autobiography section (which is mostly about writing), I really enjoyed learning how King started writing as the result of several childhood illnesses.  Early on, he wrote for his friends, his school paper, and his mom.  After his mom read one of his early stories, King says \\"She said it was good enough to be in a book.  Nothing anyone has said to me since has made me feel any happier.\\"  In and out of the principal's office for his writing in The Village Vomit, working and writing in a laundromat, the sale of his first story...it's all here and it's all entertaining.  (It's worth the price of the book just to read King's reaction to the sale of his first novel 'Carrie.') <br />\\"Toolbox\\" is a short section consisting of several of King's thoughts on grammar, punctuation, vocabulary, and the author's burning hatred of adverbs.  <br />\\"On Writing,\\" the third and final part of the book is devoted to the craft of writing.  Rather than summarize what's there, I thought I'd try to give you a taste of the book by including several of King's quotes on various writing issues:<br />The book-reading public:  \\"Book buyers aren't attracted, by and large, by the literary merits of a novel; (they) want a good story to take with them on the airplane.\\"<br />Plotting:  \\"I believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren't compatible...There is a huge difference between story and plot.  Story is honorable and trustworthy; plot is shifty, and best kept under house arrest.\\"<br />Description:  \\"Description begins with visualization of what it is you want the reader to experience.  It ends with your translating what you see in your mind into words on the page.\\"<br />Dialogue:  \\"Dialogue is a skill best learned by people who enjoy talking and listening to others - particularly listening, picking up the accents, rhythms, dialect, and slang of various groups.\\"<br />Research:  \\"I simply made up all the stuff I didn't know.\\"  (!)<br />Classes/workshops:  \\"You learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot, and the most valuable lessons are the ones you teach yourself.\\"<br />Getting published:  \\"The most important thing you can do for yourself is read the market.\\"<br />\\"If I have to tell you, I lose.  If...I can show you...I win.\\"<br />I read this book three years ago for pleasure when I was not writing.  I enjoyed it, but it didn't really mean much to me at the time.  Since becoming a writer, the book is one I knew I had to own.  I admit it, I read a lot of King when I was younger and I still pick up one of his books or stories from time to time.  Do I think he's a great writer?  I don't think that's the question.  I think the question is, \\"What can Stephen King teach me about how to become a better writer?\\"  The answer, at least for me, is practical, no-nonsense information from a regular guy (a very rich regular guy, mind you) to another regular guy.  I'll take that any day.  <br />297 pages
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the first album that I have purchased in the past year, with the exception of Darren Hayes' debut CD and Tonic's latest album, that I can say is worth every penny.<br />The singer's voice is haunting and seductive, powerful and full of emotion.<br />The lyrics are excellent, and the music is perfectly orchestrated.<br />Piano, strings, guitars, and choirs backup the music beautifully.<br />This is one CD that will stay in my player for a looooooong time, and a band I can't wait to see in concert!
B000088E6D|5.0|After having had suffered through Rod Stewart's [version] of the Great American Songbook, it's refreshing to hear someone of Michael Buble's caliber treat it with the love and respect that it deserves. This young man is nothing short of phenomenal. Blessed with a velvety voice that is reminiscent of the great crooners like Mel Torme, and girded with an enthusiasm for the music that comes shining through whenever one sees him perform, Michael does justice to these songs that few other pretenders to Sinatra's throne, can. Not since I first discovered Anthony Warlow of Australia, have I been so smitten with a new crooner. This guy is definitely the new 'standard bearer' of his genre (pun intended!). His \\"Summer Wind\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"Sway\\", and \\"Come Fly With Me\\" will get you to your feet, and his renditions of \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" and \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\\" will get you positively swooning. The latter two songs are absolutely exquisitely produced, and Michael's vocals are as smooth as silk -- his voice can melt lead!<br />As his producer David Foster had said of his other wonderful protege, Josh Groban, this guy \\"has got the goods\\". Catch this star on his rise! Frank has left the building, and Mr. Buble has claimed it as his own!
B000089RVX|5.0|One of the greatest CD's I have heard in a long time.  Amy Lee has very strong and very powerful vocals.  I definitely recommend this to anyone no matter what their taste in music is!
6305922756|5.0|It amazes me that to this day, nearly 20 years later, there are still some people who thought this was real. That Spinal Tap actually existed. It's hilarious. This film is truly one of a kind. It perfectly lampoons the life, success, and downfall of a rock group. The film is shot as a documentary, or as this kind of film is, a 'mockumentary'. It's being done by director Marty DiBergi(Rob Reiner, who also directed and co-wrote the film), who is best known for commercials. He chronicles the life of legendary british band, Spinal Tap. The members of this band include David St. Hubbins(the always great Michael McKean), who is the vocalist of the group. Nigel Tufnel(the brilliant Christopher Guest), is the lead guitarist. Big mustached Derek Smalls(the great Harry Shearer), is the bass player. They started out in the mid 1960's as a mellower hippy/pop type band with songs like \\"Listen(To What The Flower People Say)\\". The documentary chronicles that to where they are today. They turned into a long haired, heavy metal group with songs like \\"Big Bottom\\", \\"Sex Farm\\", and others. The entire film shows their struggles to maintain their career as it appears to be falling down the tubes. Producers won't release their album, concerts are cancelled, no one comes to autograph signings. The inner turmoil within the band is showcased as well. They suffered from we could call, 'the Yoko syndrome', where St. Hubbins' girlfriend, Janine Pettibone(June Chadwick), comes into the picture and causes friction within the group. Throughout the film and interviews, there are concert clips showing the band in glorious action. The film was written by our three stars, and they must have spent time in this world because many musicians have stated the authenticity of it all. Not only did they write it and get it down pat, but these three guys also wrote every song and really performed them. They might not of been a real group, but they could of been. Keep your eyes peeled open for appearances by Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, and Fran Drescher at a party. Fred Willard and Ed Begley Jr., who have become Chris Guest regulars in his future films, appear here as well. Willard, as he will in the future films, steals every single frame he is in. Ed Begley, Jr. plays the band's original guitarist who died in an awful gardening accident. This continues as a running gag(that always works)thru the rest of the film concerning their drummers. The movie is funny. It's not the kind of comedy that a lot of people will get. Read the one star reviews below for that. It's a type of comedy that is very dry, but also very funny. If you are not in on it, you will not get it or respect it for what it is and is trying to do. Same goes for Guest's future films(Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show). The DVD comes with a great load of cool extras. The three guys, in character, give audio commentary. It's priceless. There is a new interview with Rob Reiner. There is a slew of other special features here. Over an hour of never before seen footage; Theatrical trailers; 6 TV commercials; an appearance on \\"The Joe Franklin Show\\"; 4 music videos for \\"Listen(To What The Flower People Say)\\", \\"Hell Hole\\", \\"Big Bottom\\", and one I can't remember the name of. It's a hysterical film that hits on every mark. Definitley the funniest movie about music ever made, and the all time best 'mockumentary'. And once again, just to make sure, this was not a real band. Go ahead and see this. It's one of a kind.
B00005T30L|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever. It's truthful, and has a true-to-life plot, and wonderful acting. But why is everyone saying it 5u&gt;&lt;0r5? I loved it. Also, check out the comics that it was based on.<br />One final thing: I read a review for this were the reviewee said this: &quot;UM...HELLO! Nobody lives like this!...&quot;(or something to that extent). That is not true. I do.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a great album. All the songs are great. Going Under is a great song that starts of the album. Bring Me to Life is probably one of the best songs on the album. I personal favorite is Tourniquet. There are 2 slow songs and 9 fast paced rock songs with great beats. Overall this is a very good album, you should go out and buy it.
B000088E6D|5.0|I heard Michael Buble perform on the Today Show and immediately ordered three copies of his CD for myself, my parents, and my inlaws.  Buble has an amazingly smooth and fluid voice that simply melts into the wonderful arrangements of David Foster.  &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; and &quot;Sway&quot; are simply brilliant.  For the fellow who rated this CD one star you are an imbecile.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I absolutely love Creed! They are the best band out there right now! I recommend them to anybody who enjoys this type of music. It is hard for me to find a song by them that I do not like. I love them all!
B000056H24|1.0|Do not pick up your New Testament & follow along with this movie, the characterizations & plot move in & out of biblical history that I stop watching the movie 3 times without ever finishing the movie. Then again; we all know how the movie \\"Should\\" end. Maybe better written: How can you make a movie called \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" while changing the plot of the greatest story ever told?
B00005YXZH|2.0|I have a suggestion:  Wipe everything you know about Wilco out of your mind, sit down, pop in Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and just listen.  Forget about the drama with their record labels, forget about Jay Bennett leaving the band, forget about Wilco's unknown status (broken up?/together?)......just listen.  If you hear what I heard, you'll hear a highly mediocre album that, at best, has a couple of good songs on it.<br />I really like Wilco.  I almost certainly will continue to like them.  However, I think that those who are calling &quot;YHF&quot; things like &quot;The Best of 2002&quot; and &quot;Pure Genius&quot; are WAY off base - focussing more on the drama than the music.  My vote??  I consider &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; one of the most disappointing albums of 2002.  If you don't believe me, try the following.  After you're done listening to &quot;YHF&quot;, pop in &quot;AM&quot;, &quot;Being There&quot;, or &quot;Summerteeth&quot; and see what your ears and heart tell you.  Don't believe the hype -- &quot;YHF&quot; is not that great.
6302484391|5.0|Three beautiful, but almost broke, models have come up with the perfect plan to solve all their financial woes. And all they have to do is marry a millionaire. That should be simple, right? They've put all their cash together and rented a fab apartment, they are welcomed at all the right places, and they are dressed to kill. And there are takers...naturally. But what happens when the girls meet the men of their dreams...and they are not rich? Or are they? You'll have to watch it to find out whether love or money will win in the end. Buy this movie and YOU'LL be the winner either way. It is romantic and too funny.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I got this CD only a few days ago, and I have listened to it over and over and over.... I totally love it!! Even if I've only had it a couple of days, it's one of my favourite CD's! Okies, it could have been a double CD with more of my favourite tracks, but I love all the songs on this CD, and it was an awesome gift from a friend of mine.<BR>Phil Collins haven't really been a favourite of mine until recently. Being a teenager I've listened to other genders of music, and Phil Collins isn't exactly the kind of music played at parties.. The more I've listened to his music, the more I love it. This CD is great when you haven't got all the others, and I love the fact that it does have my favourites on it.<br />This is the kinda CD I'd rush out to get a new copy of, if I'd for some reason lose, or break. And it's being played on my sterio right now. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good CD with great tunes on.
B00008IHN1|5.0|This movie wasn't bad. I figured that they would do a terrible job of portraying a college marching band, but they did a good job.  The movie showed the flashier side of being in the band.  They didn't show much of the painstaking practices that a marching band goes through.  but, then again, who would want to sit around and let them practice?  The drumline sounded excellent(I should know, i'm on a drumline) and did some pretty good visuals and choreography.  Overall I would reccomend this movie to anyone, wheather they are/were in a band or not.

0671015206|5.0|Gosh, how often I should have had this book whenever I made a big purchase (like my car, for instance). That's my first thought ....<br />Seriously, you never read about these kind of millionaires. Maybe it's because millionaires like these don't make tremendosuly interesting reading. Donald Trump is so much more exciting. BUT ... most people don't need to be Donald Trump. You don't need to make the society pages to have a satisfying financial life. You don't need to be Trump and have fancy things in order to love your children, live in a good home, drive decent and reliable transportation and enjoy your short time here on earth. This book teaches you, over and over again, what is worth having, and what isn't.
0792164903|3.0|This film has good costume, setting, cast and cinematography, but I am a bit bamboozled why so many people gave it five stars. This film is Tim Burton full-on rich filmic style and action, but perhaps too much so. It is too long, dizzying, and puerile. It's a fun film to watch on a rainy eve, but a landmark production? Well, perhaps some of these other reviewers have lost their heads.
B0000797IO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Jennifer Aniston really stepped outside the box and gave a wonderful performance. I think that women might enjoy this movie more than men. So... if you're feeling kind of down in your relationship, grab a glass of wine and watch The Good Girl, you might relate to it.
B0000634EV|5.0|By this time now we've all one way or another come across Phil Anselmo whether it be being introduced through metal from Pantera, being welcomed by his thrash/hardcore band Superjoint Ritual at this year's Ozzfest, or by Phil's best work to date in my opinion with Down. With their second album, Down sharpens that New Orleans jam metal sound that made them so great to begin with.<br /><br />Whenever I hear this album, I just always get that mental image in my mind of decadence and ugliness which couldn't be any better. The band truly captures the sound that they were going for. The album made in less than a month, features Phil's most focused record to date and a truly honest one. The lyrics are dark and really let you into his madness that is his world.<br /><br />The band as I mentioned earlier showcases a very Sabbath bluegrass kind of feel to it. Yet, they put their own twist on each song to keep the album real fresh and keeping you guessing. \\"Something On My Side\\" sounds like something from Nola, while \\"Learn From My Mistakes\\" is a heartfelt bluesy song that is really the epic piece of the album. The other highlight is \\"Beautifully Depressed\\" that gathers inspiration from Hendrix's Manic Depression which is ironic.<br /><br />While I don't mind Superjoint Ritual, I think it showcases all the bad qualities of Phil. I wish that there would be just one more Down record and perhaps then I could rest in peace.
B000053V7Q|5.0|Superb effort went into this project.  The \\"Special Edition\\" is in every possible way, a major improvement over the original release.    Digitally restored, the picture is crystal clear and brilliant.  The film has also been re-edited from its original format, which contained interviews with talking heads, Elivs fans and impersonators, and entirely too little of Elvis.  Now, \\"Elvis: That's The Way It Is\\" contains lots of extra (in fact, nothing but) footage of Elvis rehearsing, performing, and interacting with folks, including many previously deleted scenes and performances that greatly enhance the impact of the film.  Why they cut this stuff out the first time is beyond me.    The movie still serves as a documentary, but basically presents the events of Elvis rehearsing, pre-show jitters, and then the performance (filmed over 6 shows), intended to give viewers the experience of watching the \\"ultimate Elvis concert.\\"    Did I mention the sound?  They actually took the trouble to find the original 16 track reels and have completely digitally remastered it.  The sound is fantastic!  This is one of those DVDs you could simply put in and LISTEN TOO.    Elvis is at the top of his game - he's in fantastic shape and his vocals and the band sound great.  What a performer!  What a show! What a Legend.    This DVD does real justice to the King and presents and preserves his musical legacy.
B000089RVX|4.0|They bring a new kind of sound,thanks to their singer,but they shouldnt compare them with bands like:Linkin Park,Saliva,or Trapt;cause they´re not as hard sounding as them.There more like 3 Doors Down band, but in any case a good sounding band never the less.<br />P.S:NOT LINKIN PARK
B00005JLF5|5.0|This entire collection is awesome and it's only the first season. This is the greatest sci-fi series ever and I still miss it to this day.  It is pure joy to see these episodes again; episodes that I haven't seen in years but have never forgotten. It was definitely time DS9 received the dvd treatment.  This collection is worth every penny.  <br />My only complaint is with the packaging.  Would it kill Paramount to spring for keepcase packaging?  The DS9 collections are certainly cooler looking than the Next Gen collections but neither are very sturdy.  Keepcase is the way to go for any dvd.  I don't understand why the region 2 discs get the better packaging and not region 1.  <br />And can anyone tell me how well this season has sold in comparison to the Next Gen first season.  I am hoping this series outsells all the other Treks just to prove that DS9 was THE best of them all.  Maybe then people will realize just what they missed. <br />GO NINERS!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Let's start off by saying this is not your normal rock cd.  Don't buy this expecting it to be like Avril or Michelle Branch or any pop girl rock.  \\"Fallen\\" assembles a bunch of different styles into one cd.  To sum it up, it is dark, epical hard rock.  After hearing their first single a week ago, I decided to give them a shot.  I was happy that I did.<br />1)Going Under- Good way to start out the cd.  I love the implementing of a solo.  Sets the pace for the rest of the album(8.5/10)<BR>2)Bring Me to Life- I love this song. Plain and simple, this is a huge hit.  Lead singer Amy Lee's voice shines, and having the singer of 12 Stones guest on this track helps it out.(10/10)<BR>3)Everybody's Fool-Sounds a little like the first track, as it goes along with the hard rock element.  Pretty solid song as well, nothing real outstanding about it.(8/10)<BR>4)My Immortal-Off the Daredevil soundtrack, wil suprise some people as it is a haunting piano ballad.  Very enjoyable in the change of style from the previous hard rock songs.(8.5/10)<BR>5)Haunted-If I were choosing, this would be the next single.  Another haunting song but more rockish/metal.  Great solo in the middle, and another strong vocal performance.(9.5/10)<BR>6)Tourniquet-Not as hard as the other songs.  Straight up rock, with a decent chorus.  Not much else to say about this one(7.5/10)<BR>7)Imaginary-Great lyrics to this pure rock song.  This could be a sleeper hit off the album, as the song flows very well, and the emotion in the chorus can be felt.(8.5/10)<BR>8)Taking Over Me-Rock with the addition of the piano.  Very good chorus, and by this time you'll realize that Amy's voice is simply great.(8/10)<BR>9)Hello-The second piano ballad on this album.  Very dark once again, as I sensed the theme of this album was deep and gloomy.  Not that bad though.(7.5/10)<BR>10)My Last Breath-Slower verses, some more piano in this.  Then breaks off into a harder yet melodic chorus.  Pretty enjoyable song.(8/10)<BR>11)Whisper-Very weird song.  Extremely dark rock song, but I like how they end with this.(8.5/10)<br />There isn't one song on this cd that I thought was bad.  This isnt mainstream rock if thats what your looking for.  it is something very different, and I can see it as a love/hate thing with listeners.  It has some standout tracks and different speeds going along with a dark mood.  Overall, if you want somethnig unique, definetly check out this album
0792846303|4.0|Classic horror movie director John Carpenter directs this scary and suspenseful film about the sleepy coast town of Antonio Bay.  Its the town's centennial celebration, but mysterious occurances are happening.  A large fog bank has appeared off the coast and is making its way inland.  Legend has it that the fog contains the spirits of a group of lepers that were killed by townspeople one hundred years ago.  Now, they have come back to take out their revenge on Antonio Bay.<br />Carpenter has chosen an excellent cast for this movie.  Adrienne Barbeau stars as Stevie Wayne, a single mom who owns KAB radio station located in a lighthouse overlooking the ocean.  She is able to see the fog rolling in off of the water.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins star as Elizabeth Solley and Nick Castle.  Elizabeth is hitchhiking along the road and is picked up by Nick.   Nick's friends have went out on the bay in their boat and are overdue in returning, so Nick and Elizabeth begin searching for them.  A bond develops between Nick and Elizabeth as the movie goes on.  Janet Leigh plays Kathy Williams, a local socialite who is in charge of planning the centennial celebration for the town.  Finally, Hal Holbrook stars as Father Malone, a local priest who has uncovered the story of the leper colony.<br />This is a classic \\"scary\\" movie.  Carpenter has cut down quite a bit on the blood and guts in favor of more psychological terror.  The movie definitely grips the viewer and draws them in.  It will definitely give you a good scare along the way.  If you've never seen a John Carpenter horror movie, then I highly recommend this film.  Its full of good old-fashioned terror without a lot of gore.

0966638328|4.0|I have several books on color harmony, but most of them were written in process color formulas, which was not so helpful for those of us who are doing 2- and 3-color work. <br />I have even needed to do some projects with 6 spot colors in which using a build of colors was not the best way to go (at least not if you want vibrant color!)<br />Anyway, that this book is Pantone made it way more valuable than the other books I have. I don't even look at them anymore. <br />There is still use for good books on color theory, but this is more of a quick reference for getting colors which &quot;play nice&quot; on the page and it has been a good timesaver for me.
0553260111|2.0|The idea and the plot of this book (along with other Lundlum books I've read) was exellent, that's why I gave two stars instead of one.  Lundlum, I think, is not that great of a writer but like I said he has good ideas.
0451156447|5.0|Truman Capote has a great imagination. Every story I have read by him has held my interest. I am anxious to read his other novels. Although this novel is a short read, it held my attention very well. Breakfast At Tiffanys is a novel filled with a love interest, a little suspense, and scandalous affairs; its a little racy for the time this story takes place.<br />  Lulamae Barnes wanted to re-invent herself. She picks a new name, Holly Golightly. I feel she has picked this new name to reflect the persona she wants to project; someone who was always on the go-someone not too easily tied down. She is a little gullible, a little naïve, and also outspoken. Holly Golightly is someone you love intensely for the short while she is in your life and someone you long for long after she has exited. I also feel that everyone could relate to her at some point in her life (all the way from the pain in her childhood, when she felt like she never belonged anywhere or to anyone, to the time she lost her brother, Fred).<br />  Holly was a young woman who had quite a few gentleman callers. She seems to fall for the older men in her life. Holly suffers from this father complex.<br />  My favorite character is the narrator of the story. He is an older gentleman as well. He is in his sixties and a writer. As they developed their friendship, he also developed a fascination with Holly. He reminds her of Fred, so she asks if she can call him Fred, and he graciously accepts. As the two interact as friends, Fred quietly falls in love with her.<br />  I was most disappointed that Holly never quite knew of his love for her. I think that if she had known then maybe she could have had a better life with him.<br />  I rated this novel with five stars because I could not put this story down until I had finished it. I am not an avid reader so that is saying a lot for this story. If I cant wait to finish a book, then I feel the author had captured my heart for the length of time it took me to put it down. It is almost like getting a kiss from a long lost lover.

B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence: Fallen<br />Absolutely outstanding. A true masterpiece. I can not say enough good things about this CD. I have been a hard rock fan for a long time and it's only once in a great while a CD totally blows me away.<br />Now the review:<BR>The first song that caught my ear was Bring Me to Life which was featured on the Daredevil soundtrack. I would describe it as Tori Amos singing for Linkin Park. This may sound like a strange combination, but does it ever work. Though it is outstanding, people might be shocked that this is the only rap/rock song on the CD. The rapper (Paul McCoy from label mates 12 Stones) is not even in the band. This might sound like a negative but it adds to the diversity of the album.<br />The extreme opposite of BMTL is the song My Immortal. It is a haunting piano ballad with a touch of stings that makes my hair stand on end when I hear it. Vocalist Amy Lee is a truly gifted singer. She has the ability to rip it like Ann Wilson from Heart and keep it angelic like Jewel all in the same breath. This could be a #1 single if released.<br />The majority the CD is a combination of some heavy guitar work from and co-founder Ben Moody, tight rhythm from John LeCompt and Rocky Gray; balanced with Amy's piano and powerful voice. Many of the songs start with a programmed NIN feel, then kick into incredible hooks and choruses. There is not one throwaway song of the eleven tracks. The songs Tourniquet, Imaginary and Taking Over Me are some great examples of this. I guarantee we will be hearing many of these songs on the radio for years to come.<br />This is a CD for the ages and just might change the face of music. Soon we will be hearing bands being described as \\"like Evanescence but with........\\"<br />Buy this CD!

B0000024K1|5.0|this album is where rap grew and the hip-hop nation took its first steps into the world-wide phenmenon it is today, punk-rock like noize james brown grooves and black nationalism and you have the only band i thought that mattered through 1988- 1991. like the clash they had a manifesto and nearly succeeded. the songs wow \\"she watch channel zero\\", \\"don't believe the hype\\" and my fav \\"black steel in the hour of chaos\\" it's the perfect album for rage, serious thought and booty shaking one of rock-n-roll and black music's greatest moments. too bad gangsta rap and bling bling is killing this music once vibrant spirit, when this type of music was mainstream and rappers could flow with a verse...
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard this band while watching DareDevil. And I loved the sound. I had to have this music. Once I bought the Soundtrack, I played &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; over and over.<BR>   Then the Album came out. Not one track on this album is bad. There is no feeling better than rolling down the windows in your car and rocking out to hard crunching guitars and Amy Lee's voice.<BR>Check out &quot;Tourniquet&quot; along with it's folow-up &quot;Imaginary&quot;. The Haunting &quot;Hello&quot;, and the last song, &quot;Whisper&quot; leaves you wanting more.
B00003BDXG|5.0|Please after reading the reviews on this movies i thought i was not watching the same movie, this movie is an indictment of our glorification of violence in our society and the media that exploits it for fiancial gain. the performances were top notch by these fine actors and actresses and you could see they were over the top its funny, yet sublime its satire people. perhaps you negative reviewers heard of it when you open your comic and read the &quot;Boondocks&quot; or listen to Parilament-Funkadelic's later albums. stone's intent was to parody the violence we see everyday in the various media(music, art, t.v. etc..) later that year o.j. simpson was on trial and the media expliotation mirroed the movie  from the ' media talking heads'  to the side show celebrites like kato kalien  downey's character is like a modern day bill o'reilly ( who was one of those &quot;journalists&quot;) using people for ratings and money for our corprate media and that what this movie represents. we as a society glorify violence of all kinds then we get angry and critcize those who produce it  and then our media trivializes it and celebrates it for our enjoyment.
0440539811|5.0|I've never read a book quite like this, and I doubt I ever will.  The Illuminatus!

B00006DEF9|5.0|What is there about this movie that makes it so uniquely exhilarating, inspiring, even profound? After pitching \\"Broadway Melody,\\" Don Lamont is told by his producer, \\"I can't visualize it. I'll have to see the movie.\\"<br />\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is a film that confronts both technique (stage elocution) and technology (\\"talkies\\") and demonstrates through its story and form that movies are a child of the human imagination. For me, the key scene is Don Lamont's sharing of his imaginative vision with Kathy on the sound stage serving as the set for his \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" number. We as spectators are witness to the entire fabrication, its basic pretense and artifice, yet we're as irresistibly drawn into Don's dream as is Kathy.<br />The triumph of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is that it constructs two levels of imaginative activity. The first is characterized by willful control and a passive surrendering to the mechanical; the second demonstrates the power of the imagination to transform artifice into art, technology into a human voice and vision. It's the \\"imagination\\" that Coleridge distinguishes from \\"fancy,\\" a creative force that puts us in touch with the best parts of human nature. We exit the theater prepared for the outside blast because Kelley's encounter with it on a rainy street has provided not merely an escape but an alternative vision of reality, a realization that our dreams are capable of informing our lives.<br />On this DVD version, the edges are sharper than ever, the colors are richly saturated and even gaudy, the sound is full and enveloping. No film depends more on such excess and artifice to demonstrate its main point: when technology does not replace but is transformed by human imagination, we are able to see beyond our wildest dreams.
1563898586|5.0|This takes a seat right next to Watchmen as my second favorite graphic narrative by Alan Moore. This is the seminal English Major comic book. The writing is flawless, the characterization is superb, and the art by Mr. O'Neill is awesome. Some may find it to be a bit on the unconventional side, but after finishing Dickens's Dombey And Son, complete with original art, the work by O'Neill in this volume is very cool.<br />I'm completely convinced that they will mess this movie up really bad. This book is just too good to translate well. From the previews that I've seen, Tom Sawyer joins the League, and they have some sort of souped-up car. Neither of these are in the book. The League travels around by Nemo's sea-ship or Hot-Air Balloon.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in a turn-of-the-century crime fighting team. The volume comes complete with period ads and lingo (issue #2 may be a little bawdy for women and children). My English Professor is borrowing my copy right now. I'm sure she'll like it, too!<br />Cheers! And to dust off an old Moore-ism, England Prevails!

But the originator of this genre can and does pull it off very nicely with MUSIC FOR FILMS.<br />True it does seem that many of the pieces are just starting to flow into a groove but instead simply end.  Most notable for me is M386, which features an excellent bass riff, that sounds similar to Lalo Schiffrin's Dirty Harry soundtrack.  <br />SLOW WATER is also a favorite of mine that I wish would have been lengthened because of its light phased airyness, it does sound like slow moving liquid.<br />Somehow this minor inconveinence can be easily overlooked simply because most of the pieces contain similar instrumentation, and overall atmosphere.  Once you have listened to the running order of the pieces you become more familar with how and when the tempos and instrumentation changes.  <br />MUSIC FOR FILMS is a nice compliment to MUSIC FOR AIRPORTS and serves as a more ambient pop music length, if there is such a thing.  This is a great alternative when you have become tired of the lengthy repetition of the latter but still want to hear the same sort of music.<br />The book entitled THIS AMBIENT CENTURY, which chronicles ambient music from turn of the century Classical all the way up to the present has a good couple paragraphs about this album, which involves a Pennsylvannia steel mill and LSD.  If nothing else it gives a great perspective on this album that is mostly passed over by Ambient fans.  <br />Besides this magical description it contains a large ammount of other Eno related things.  Brian Eno also writes the forward so check this out at your local library as well.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is a must-buy!  Amy Lee adds great eerie style to riveting lyrics.  It's easy to relate to what this band sings!  The songs from Daredevil are not by far the best!  Check out all songs to get a great listening experience.  &quot;Whisper&quot; is one of the best!
B000002H2H|5.0|Obviously, this album is bound to be overshadowed with Master of Puppets widely being considered the greatest metal album of all time. I don't think people should forget this one! I'm astounded that the Black Album is on the essentials list and not this album instead. <BR>Fight Fire With Fire - love the intro, the song is average (good solo though)<BR>Ride the Lightning - such a cool intro.. good concept for a song (innocent man about to get the electric chair)<BR>For Whom the Bell Tolls - its your opinion.. but i think this is a very overrated Metallica song.. but still good.<BR>Fade to Black - best song on the album... phenomenal song. I love metallica's power ballads.<BR>Trapped under ice - good song, not amazing though<BR>Escape - same as above <BR>Creeping Death - GREAT song.. underrated<BR>Call of Ktulu - such a good instrumental!! rock on!<br />Master of Puppets IS better.. but don't forget this album!
B000005DQR|5.0|Hands of Midas, the touch of gold, tears flow from the beauty of this album. I enjoy living when I listen to Endtroducing. I feel grateful for being human, I feel greatful for not being deaf, I feel honored that Shadow walks on the same planet as I do.  This album has changed so many lives.  It is what makes people want to become djs, musicians, poets...it is the art of the perfection of music! If it wasn't for Shadow and Endtroducing, I wouldn't be aLive, I would simply be...
B000089RVX|4.0|I picked up this cd because of the two tracks on the Daredevil soundtrack that really made the cd worth getting. So when I got it I expected some good music and from top to bottom it doesn't dissapoint. With dark music and vocals Evanescence turns away from some of the other music that you would put in this kindda catagory. Bring me to life is still the best of all thier songs with my Immortal kindda taking a break from the harder rock that is on the other 10 tracks. Tracks like Haunted and whisper are darker and set more of what the band is about. I have been looking for darker music to listen to and Evanescence is a step in the right dirrection and that is what make this cd so enjoyable for me.
B00005JLXC|1.0|I really tried to be open minded about this one.  Upon hearing that Ben \\"Media Baby Of The Year\\" Affleck was to star in the title role and Colin \\"Flavor Of The Week\\" Ferril as a main bad guy, I was sure I would never see this.  But then I remembered how pleasantly surprised I was with Toby McGuire's role as Spiderman - another actor who I previously never thought much of.  So I gave Daredevil a shot.  Unfortunately once you get past the pretty cool looking intro of the film, it's all downhill.  I was upset because they really could have done something good with this...  The acting was so bad it's beyond words, the plot... was there one?, and the characters were anything but convincing.  Bullseye has to be the single most inane villain ever to hit the big screen.  And the cheese factor was literally unbearable.  The puns were so over the top that it was almost sickening ...  Much like the Battlefield Earth film (with John Travolta) or Resident Evil, this movie is SO bad that you almost have to see it just to experience.  It's almost like going on a ride that you know will make you sick.
B000024JEX|3.0|To call Keith Jarrett overrated is simply to announce the obvious: While Jarrett has recorded prolifically and maintained a following of large and cult-like proportions for over 25 years, hundreds of equally brilliant and superior pianists have been marginalized by recording companies and the public alike. All of which raises the question: What is the secret of his singular success? (Is there another night club jazz recording in existence where the audience' applause becomes a uniform \\"we want Keith\\" group chant?)<br />When, in the early 80's, Jarrett recoiled at the description of his music as \\"new age\\" and committed himself to programming \\"standards,\\" he did little to change his approach to improvisation or communicating with a large listener base. Take either \\"Autumn Leaves\\" or \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" (disc 3) as a touchstone to his approach. Each performance is approximately 20 minutes long, with 3 separate \\"movements\\": 1. Keith introduces the song with an accessible melodic fragment or \\"folksy\\" motif that is not so much developed as portentously repeated; 2. Bass and drums join piano for statement of the melody and improvisation on the chords of the song; 3. An extended Coda is initiated with Keith \\"riffing\\" on a single chord while bass and drums drop the 4/4 \\"walking bass\\" time and go into a \\"danceable,\\" latin-feel beat.<br />While sections 1 and 3 are going to strike many experienced listeners as containing unlistenable self- indulgence if not pure \\"jive,\\" the second section always gives Keith a chance to demonstrate his credentials as an improviser in the jazz tradition. Even though his left hand never comes close to matching the tone quality or creativity of the right, his single-note melodic lines are characterized by melodic cohesiveness, sophisticated phrasing, sure-fingered precision and, above all, a rich, sonorous tone. Even without the constant \\"assist\\" provided by Keith's splintering of the piano's voice and the player's, his melodic lines stand up to musical inspection.<br />But this hardly explains his popular success. There's talent, musicianship, pianism--but nothing approaching a Bill Evans performance (going from \\"Live at the Village Vanguard\\" to \\"Live at the Blue Note\\" is a regressive, painfully reductive experience for this listener). There's also unparallelled \\"attitude,\\" \\"ego,\\" \\"self-belief,\\" and a canny sense of self-promotion. Keith's own published statements to the effect that no piano as presently manufactured is worthy of him has created more true believers than doubters. And it is these believers who follow Jarrett's every move, because like few other performers (Monk and Glen Gould are the other notable examples who come to mind, though neither took \\"performance art\\" to this level) he allows the listener--any listener--a sense of being \\"in on\\" the creative process itself. The man has taken what is for many a foreign language and allowed them to see how its meanings are made. Not bad as a start, but now comes the time to explore the later developments and cultural accomplishments of that language.nd up to musical inspection.<br />But this hardly explains his popular success.

B0000256VK|5.0|I've had a few of Roxy Music's albums, this one is my favorite, I have on occasion revolted against top 40 music which comes and goes.  The musical artistry stands the test of time.  My favorite cuts are: the title cut &quot;Avalon&quot;, &quot;More than This&quot;, &quot;To Turn You On&quot;,&quot;True to Life&quot;, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, the instrumental pieces &quot;India&quot; and &quot;Tara&quot; also go down easy, great music for a quiet dinner with a beautiful, candle light and Corvoisier.  They were pioneers of neo classical glam sound, which preceeded great bands such as: Breathe, Ultravox and Spandau Ballet, who had their moments in the spotlight, but Roxy Music remains an original.
B0000844I8|5.0|Being a huge fan of Science Fiction, I have to say this film is one of the best out there. I don't understand why so many people think it's second rate. Personally, I think the last few Star Wars theatre releases are terrible, containing some of the worst acting and unimaginative plots I've seen in some time, so perhaps there's a different audience praising those and leaving Stargate in the dust.<br />The acting in this film is fantastic, the plot is complex and compelling, the special effects are quite adequate for the story, and the musical score is nothing short of tremendous. But essentially, this film is not entirely about far out adventure and action, although the characters are obviously brought through significant experiences. The film is about the puzzle of language and understanding, communication being the predominant message here. And with the solving of messages on many levels, the humanity of this film is perhaps it's greatest value.

B00000HYXB|5.0|I LOVE Nightfall in Middle-earth! So far, it's the only Blind Guardian CD I have but I LOVE it! My absolute favorite is Curse of Feanor-- it's a great outlet (for me at least) to sing it if you're angry... Nightfall is a GREAT song, someone mentioned the chorus... It's amazing. Then there's Noldor, which is great too and Blood Tears which is one of those despairing songs, but the drumming shows that there's some inner wall of strength... something that keeps the character (Maedhros) going... This would be great if you're reading Silmarillion, just so long as you're not reading a calm part. I HIGHLY reccommend this CD to Tolkien fans and Blind Guardian fans alike. Now I can't wait to get my next BG CD!

0553579908|3.0|Martin does a fair job of interweaving a complex plot, but I wasn't totally drawn into his world. There are too many characters and not enough character development. I also felt the book was too long--there are long stretches where very little is going on.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Hey, I'm not a trekkie.  Let's get that on the table right away.  But I have seen the movies and some of the series, so I had high expectations for this film.  My biggest problem was that, in the end, I just didn't care about the villain.  This film had the opportunity to be a great one, but it didn't take enough chances.  For instance, if they had chosen to kill off one of the original series' scared cows, like Sulu or Uhura, suddenly I've got a vested interest in nailing Shinzon.  But in the end, a Villain set on destroying the earth is a bit old hat for 2003, and for that matter, given the ease with which one can slip in and out of time travel in the series, what does it really matter? :)  <br />But seriously, I like the TNG crew, Patrick Stewart is a fine actor and I care about the rest as characters.  What this series needs is a director/writer combination that aren't afraid to take risks.  Re-invent the series a bit and come up with a quality journey that audiences will enjoy.  I want to like these movies, I really do, but First Contact is where it ended for me.  <br />High marks on the special effects, and the sound was terrific.  Other than that, I just couldn't get excited.  We deserve better, and the cast deserves better scripts.  I fear that this may be the last of Star Trek for a while, given the poor box office performance and the television series lull.
B00005JLF5|3.0|I have bought many box sets and the Deep Space Nine has the worst packaging that I have ever seen. Series one is enclosed,or should I say sitting between,two thin plastic sidings which fold over it,this is after I had to shake it to remove it from it's thin plastic case.<BR>This thin weak casing will not last too long. I have cancelled the rest of my DS9 region 1 orders and will go for region 2 which is encased in a strong and proper plastic case.<BR>Paramount USA do not seem to have much regard for their customers as the Star Trek:The Next Generation box sets were also inferior to the overseas cases. But the Next Generation cardboard cases were heaven compared to the thin and hopeless DS9 plastic cases. It's overseas Deep Space Nine box sets for this fan.<BR>The series? Great series,lousy packaging.
1573226521|1.0|This book basically chronicles the adventures of a 21 year old British \\"traveler\\" (our protagonist) and his discovery of a hidden unspoiled island commune somewhere in Southeast Asia. Basically the guy is in Thailand staying in a youth hostel when the creepy Scottish guy next door (aka Mr. Duck) leaves a map to \\"The Beach\\" taped to his door before he promptly kills himself (by wrist slashing-which means we can look forward to annoying blood and suicide metaphors throughout the rest of the book- too bad he didn't just jump off something tall). But Mr. Duck ain't dead yet folks, he comes back in the form of about 127 annoying dream sequences in which he advises our hero while dripping blood from the wrists everywhere and making a general nuisance of himself. But I'm jumping ahead of myself. Said protagonist sets off to find this mystical place, accompanied by an annoying French couple. They find it, are accepted into the community, but find there are sinister undertones to this supposed Utopia (what a shocker). I'm about 2 chapters away from finishing this thing and it's yet to kick into high gear. Author Garland prefers to write everything from the first person perspective, so not only do we get to hear every insipid conversation the character takes part in, we get to see into his thoughts as well, and believe me folks there ain't a hell of a lot to see in there. Mostly we get to hear his internal mental struggle on if he should light another cigarette, will he be able to get more cigarettes, and should he try and make it with the French chick while her boyfriends not around. We also get his mental commentary on which members of the commune he likes or dislikes on that particular day. Unfortunately it is hard to agree or disagree with him since there is little or no character development focused on anyone other than the protagonist (who is basically an annoying self centered twit). I can't say this book completely sucks since I did manage to get through it ( I guessI was waiting for something interesting to happen). Call it the literary equivalent of a Tab Cola. If you want to read a book that you will completely forget about within a week, pickup \\"The Beach\\" by Alex Garland. Otherwise try reading something by an experienced author instead of a first timer.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Peter Jackson's epic film version of JRR Tolkien's classic fantasy trilogy continues.  The fellowship has split into three parts and we follow each as it makes its way toward the events of \\"The Return of the King.\\"  Frodo and Sam make their way toward Mordor in the company of Gollum, an incredible CGI creation.  Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli stand with the men of Rohan against the onslaught of Saruman's army of Uruk-hai, culminating in the most spectacular battle in film history.  Merry and Pippin find themselves in the company of the tree-like ents and are present at the defeat of Saruman.  <br />There is much to admire here.  The special effects are magnificent and the talented cast continues to deliver fine performances.  The storyline, however, is not nearly as coherent or unified as \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"  The political situation and relations among the royal family of Rohan were rushed and confusing, Gandalf's return from apparent death was not satisfactorily explained, and the battle of Gondor was overwhelmed by the spectacle of Helm's Deep, making it seem incomplete and inconclusive.<br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed this film quite a bit and count myself very pleasantly surprised at the fine job that Jackson and company are doing bringing this classic story to the screen.  No doubt an extended DVD of Towers is on its way.  I expect it to eliminate my complaints about the theatrical version, just as the \\"Fellowship\\" DVD did so much to deepen the characters and story of that film.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle<BR>By: Kurt Vonnegut<BR>Reviewed By: J. Gagnier<BR>Period 1<br /> Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is a very good book. It is about a man who is trying to write a book about the day the atom bomb fell, and the people that constructed it.  He soon found out that the chief designer of the atom bomb was a strange man named Felix Hoenikker.  He mails Two of Dr. Hoenikker's children, Angela and Newt Hoenikker.  Later on he finds out about a chemical called ice-nine, then the trouble starts.<BR> I really liked the way the writer worded the book.  He wrote about how the world came to an end and the events preceding it. I enjoyed the way that he presented his personal opinion on how man makes things to complicated.  He wrote about an imaginary religion called Bokonon that is nothing but \\"sweet lies\\" according to the founder of Bokonon himself.<BR> My favorite part of the book was when Angela was talking about ice-nine. I like the idea of ice that has a melting point of 114.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  Unfortunately if such a substance were made the end of the world would be it's effect on humans and nature alike.
B000089RVX|4.0|Just to sum things up, evanescence has combined a hard rock sound with a beautiful voice.  I am one that enjoys a good hard rock song but could care less for the screaming that sounds like my friends throwing up at a party.  The harmonies and chords converge together like non-fat butter and the result is a kick &quot;a&quot; cd.
B000002TQV|5.0|What do you look for in a work of art? Something that evokes the limitless possibilities of the human heart. Something that moves you. Forces you to look at things entirely differently. Encourages you to seek meaning in the mundane and embrace the beauty that exists in every beat of our human hearts. Immerse your soul in love. Listen to this album and wonder at the marvel of sound, rhythm, melody, mood and magic.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Harmonically Rich. Midroad instrumentally, although there are some great musicians on the album such as Brian Blade, and Bill Frisell.  No Gimmmicks. No ads for Pepsi, or your other massive sponsor of choice.  Just Music.  The MUSIC, (not the videos, the interviews, the scandalous clothing that so many female pop singers wear because their musical integrity is as shallow as me spitting into my hand),  keeps me interested for quite awhile which is more than I can say about 90% of popular music.<br />So in short..a good album.
6301562178|4.0|In my opinion this is one of the best movies of all time. The only thing that I don't like is Doug Roberts girlfiend, wife or whatever she is. She gets annoying after a while and she doesn't have any signifigant part in the movie. Overall this is a great movie! I love the suspense!
B00006IU73|5.0|I heard about this CD indirectly from one of the guitarists from my favorite band, Peter Lindgren of Opeth, and was interested by what he had to say about Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree.  &quot;How bad could it possibly be?&quot;  I asked myself.  May i be burned at the stake for ever doubting such musical mastery.  &quot;In Absentia&quot; is absolutely incredible.  For some reason though, PT fans are apparently displeased when PT is compared to Pink Floyd.  Guys, get over it!  Yes, in many ways they're distinctly different but the musical ingenuity had me thinking of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; the entire time i listened to it!  I simply lack the articulation and brainpower to really describe how good this CD is, so just do yourself the favor of buying it, and by buying it, you do me the favor of knowing there's at least one more person in the world who has witnessed such brilliance.
B000002H72|5.0|Anybody that has a shred of good taste should admit that this is the album of the eighties along with a few other excellent records.  As I have seen someone say before critics may say that this is their most accessible album, but only one song is really that accessible, that being Gouge Away.  This album is practically flawless although La La Love You and Silver are just slightly a let down, for The Pixies mind you.  If only all new wave sounded like Debaser, then I would be a fan of all the eighties.  Yeah most of The Pixies revolve around death and mutilation, but that doesn't matter because they can write many a good pop song.  I don't think a pop fan without a shred of integrity could not like Wave Of Mutilation or Here Comes Your Man.  This album also hits you with some harder, Nirvanaish tracks that prove the influence.  These would be Tame, Debaser, and Gouge Away.  And of course there are many odd songs on here (i.e Crackity Jones, Mr. Grieves).  This album also has the impeccably classic Monkey Gone To Heaven.  What more could you want in an album, I can't think of anything.
B00005UK1F|5.0|Most fans of rock are hesitant to accept most death and growl vox that go along with a lot of the good metal bands around these days.  Luckily for them, Green Carnation is one of the few (Lacuna Coil, Katatonia, soon \\"Damnation\\" by Opeth, others) that these people can tolerate.  In \\"Light of Day, Day of Darkness\\"'s case, not only could said rock fans tolerate it, but they'll be totally blown away by it.  The composer, writer and arranger for this metal epic, who calls himself \\"Tchort,\\" must've destroyed himself in the process of composing this masterwork, because there is just so much variety in this 1-track wonder.  That's right:  1 track, 60:08.  Opera, jazz, and symphony frequently become evident throughout the CD.  The only thing that i don't like about this cd is the saxophone/female singer interlude at about 30 minutes through the CD.  The saxophone section is really cool and relaxing, almost euphoric, but the woman doesn't sing any actual words, she just does an \\"open-throated progressive chant\\" if you will, it kinda raises your eyebrow; then all-of-a-sudden she starts WAILING like she's giving birth, honestly, this part made me cringe and now every time i listen to the CD i skip a little bit ahead just to get past that one awful part.  Other than this slight but avoidable blemish in the song, the rest is absolute musical brilliance.  I say \\"musical\\" and not just \\"metal\\" because there are so many instruments and style of music in this song/album.  The ballad-style guitar solo at about 40 minutes into the CD is in my top-3 list of guitar solo's, it's absolutely STUNNING.  Tchort dedicated this masterpiece to his son, which, if i were the son, i would feel pretty damn special to have such a beautiful song written for and dedicated to me.  Buy it.  Now.
0553582445|1.0|I was shocked by how poorly Fitz's story has played out.  The characters irritate more than interest and the plots are severely lacking.  For some real fantasy, read George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire or Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen.  This book is drivel.  Plain and simple.
B00000AFFI|4.0|The bad news: there's some weaker songwriting here, like the silly \\"The Wind\\" and a few cold biscuits from the \\"To Bring You My Love\\" era (the unbearably ugly \\"Joy\\"). <br />But several of PJ's most revelatory songs appear here too. \\"The Sky Lit Up\\" and \\"No Girl So Sweet\\" explore her overdrive gear; \\"Angelene\\" and \\"Electric Light\\" are lovely slow burners; the diamond here is \\"A Perfect Day Elise,\\" which filters the stuttering guitar of \\"Four-Track Demos\\" through a delicious electronic dance-floor haze. Irreplaceable music at its best, and a crucial transition to the mature work on \\"Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea.\\"
0553801511|5.0|This book is wonderful, however, do not read any George R.R. Martin books before this.  They are so good that all fantasy will seem like complete trash, including Robin Hobb's books.  If you've already started A Song of Ice and Fire, steer clear of this nonsense.  Whiskeyjack has got twice the play of a rogue Fitz smack.
B000009VOL|5.0|I didn't love this album when I first heard it.  I thought it was &quot;nice&quot;... &quot;beautiful&quot; even... but that was all.  That was in the summer of 2001.  Today I would rather sever my right arm off at the shoulder than be deprived of this great work.  Chan + the dirty three + Australia = perhaps my favorite album of all time.  I know there are a lot of five star reviews out there, and I've added one more to the pile, but you may take comfort in knowing that this is the only review I'll bother to do because Moon Pix has come to mean so much to me.

Think \\"The Brain that Wouldn't Die\\" transplanted into one of the Terminator skeletal frames robots and you get the picture.<br />I'll let you figure out which of the two male actors is 1/2 of the romantic couple and which one is the \\"mind\\" behind the malevolent machine.<br />It gets two stars because Douglas and Fawcett compliment each other.
B00006879E|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best albums that I've ever heard. The closest comparison (why do we have to compare?) I can think of is Stevie Wonder. &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is the perfect mix of Soul, Funk and Rock, with a Pop sensibility - just like Stevie Wonder's work from the 1970s. The Grammy voters should definitely take notice of Maroon 5.
B00005JLZL|3.0|I would like to start this review by stating that I can not say much about events that take place in this movie without giving out the ending. Since doing so will spoil the whole film for you I will try to avoid them as much as possible.<br />David Gale  lifelong fighter against death penalty, is convicted of rape and murder of Constance Hallaway and is sentenced to be executed. 4 days before his execution he agrees to give a 3-day interview to Bitsey Bloom. Although convinced of his guilt at first, during the interview she starts to doubt it and sets out to prove his innocence. The story throughout the film is told through Bitseys eyes, as she listens to David Gale. <br />The movie is about capital punishment, as Im sure everyone knows it. And even though Alan Parker and all the actors claim that the film does not take sides, it does in a very subtle way (not to imply that watching this movie will change your opinion about it). Film basically gives both point of views: why some people support it and why some dont. Story is very well told and ending was well done. Even though by day 3 of the interview I knew what it was (ending that is), good part about it was the way it was presented. <br />One thing that puzzles me is the point behind this movie. It is one big argument against the death penalty given in a most argumentative way. What were the filmmakers trying to achieve? Regardless, the movie is worth watching, if nothing else for the ending.
0393317552|3.0|Jared Diamond presents an interesting argument in explaining the world's iniquities...but after a few days you forget it.<BR>Not a &quot;paradigm shifting&quot; book.
B00005JLXC|2.0|OK. I'm not a comic reader, so I do not know much of a story behind these characters. Thus I do not have much to say about this movie from that perspective. However I can tell a bad film from a good one. And this one was pretty bad. <br />First of all, nothing in this movie lasts long enough for anyone to enjoy it. Longest part of the movie is a fight between DD and Bullseye and it lasts about 1-½ minutes. I don't know what the rush was, but every scene of this movie was over before I had a chance to get into it. <br />Second, these days with all the technology available one would think that visual effects would have been better. It was not all-together bad, but difference between computer-generated character and a real person is just too obvious and fight scenes are pretty .... <br />Third, filmmakers seem to concentrate on DD's inability (or ability) to see little too much. For the most part we all see everything the way DD does. And although visually it was pretty cool, there was no reason why we had to watch half the movie as if we were blind. <br />....<br />All and all, I do not recommend rushing to theaters to see it. There are much more superior movies based on comics we can watch, Spider-man, X-man, Batman.
6304994540|5.0|First time in the theater, I wasn't sold. In fact, I sat there wondering if I'd been robbed of 2 hours. But someone came 'round with the DVD and it hasn't left my collection since. I swear I watch this movie every few weeks, and never get tired of it. In fact, my friends and I get more annoying with each viewing, quoting &quot;the dude&quot; and Walter at random, anywhere, anytime. It grows on you, and you start to realize every element is there - well developed characters (maybe not ones you would necessariy want as friends!), a familiar story that has excellent treatment, and fun dream sequences that are well executed. Guest stars are fun to spot, too!<br />Have a white russian, and kick back. In the parlance of our times: &quot;this unchecked aggression will not stand!&quot;. (Timely words today...)
B00007L4MJ|3.0|Perhaps I'm picking nits here, but I find it regrettable that this print wasn't transfered to DVD before it was exhibited in theaters.  The DVD reveals a number of black lines, from emulsion scratches on the source print, which occur now and then, throughout, but are particularly frequent and distracting for about the last reel.  I also see dirt in the projection gate for a short time.  Couldn't Kino justify striking a fresh print for this DVD edition, from their digitized negative?  Nonetheless, I concur with the consensus that the restoration, aside from the warts on this print, looks and sounds beautiful.
B000002J03|4.0|This is one of my favorite LZ records, mostly because of the outstanding bass guitar work by John Paul Jones, but also because of the memorable sungs, increasing presence of Robert Plant and classic riffs by Jimmy Page. John Bonham plays some mean drums, too.<br />I wavered between 4 and 5 stars, but had to knock a star off for lyrical rip-offs during the Lemon Song and the vocal black-face portrayal in Bring it on Home. Still, I highly recommend this album, especially for novice rock musicians and fans just becoming acquainted with the Led Zeppelin catalog. There's a lot of good stuff here.<br />\\"Whole Lotta Love\\" kicks things off with one of rock's all-time classic guitar riffs. Plant's vocals are much more self-assured here, and we can sense the beginnings of his 'golden god' image, plus there's that orgasm sequence in the middle, with all those crazy guitar effects. One of Page's better electric solos here, crystal clear like you're sitting right next to the amp. Great dynamics, especially by Bonham, who had superb timing and could really coax feeling from his drums.<br />\\"What is and What Should Never Be\\" has a nice mellow groove, snaky bassline, and soft/loud dynamics that rise above the lyrical content. Nice guitar/bass interplay during the solo, and great energy at the end.<br />\\"The Lemon Song\\" features some not so subtle innuendo and imagery copped from Robert Johnson. \\"Squeeze my lemon...\\" While this is mostly standard white blues with edgy guitar, Jones balances with tissue paper touch on the bass and a fine extended solo. The tempo changes give this one a lot of energy.<br />\\"Thank You\\" is probably one of the least misogynistic tunes in the LZ catalog, a pledge of undying love even \\"if the sun refused to shine.\\" Plant sings with emotion. There has always been something about the transitions and harmonies of this song that were awkward and didn't quite work for me.<br />\\"Heartbreaker\\" is another classic riff and rock/blues progression, with cool bass licks backing the vocal lines. This song has a quirky solo that starts with some cool licks, then dissolves into a stuttering, sloppy pick frenzy, before gathering speed again with a second solo part, then back into the verse. If I had to rate Page as a guitar player, I would say his acoustic and electric rhythm playing were exceptional, but his electric solos were hit and miss.<br />There's hardly a missed beat before going right into \\"Living Loving Maid\\" with a driving rhythm, with more outstanding bass and drum interplay, another memorable Page lick and interesting rhythm/tempo changes.<br />\\"Ramble On\\" is on of my favorites, with a beautiful bassline, excellently strummed acoustic guitar and gently tapped percussion. One of Plant's better vocal performances, wonderfully modulated. Check out that bass work during the choruses. The lyrics begin to introduce us to Page and Plant's interest in fantastic mythology, mentioning Gollum from Lord of the Rings, and a love story involving a ranger-type character.<br />\\"Moby Dick\\" is an instrumental with a basic rock/blues progression, built to showcase a drum solo by John Bonham.<br />\\"Bring it on Home\\" begins with a Delta-style blues feel, some cool harmonica, and Plant singing in an affected American South dialect that sounds ridiculous. Still, I like the way this song builds from blues into a hard rock piece. Nice guitar overdub interplay, and Plant redeems himself with his vocals on the rock part.<br />Add this one to your rock library. It's a classic.ks backing the vocal lines.

B00005JLKB|5.0|I normally watch television in spurts. I sit down when I have time, turn it on, and watch whatever is on. I have Never found a show that got me so addicted that I would actually HAVE to plan my week AROUND watching the new episodes. That is until Smallville!<br />After having watched almost the entire Season 1 (but having missed a few episodes), I am dieing for the DVD release of Smallville. The series is amazing, showing the early life of Clark Kent and his adolescent adventures as he makes his way to becoming superman. I especially love the romance (or lack of romance :) between him and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). I think she is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. <br />If you haven't watched smallville, you definately need to! I can sit here babbling on about how great it is for hours, but if you REALLY want to fully enjoy smallville, wait for this DVD release so you can start from the beginning! Everything makes a whole lot more sense that way.<br />The funny thing is I didn't know that it was filmed in my home city Vancouver until after getting addicted to it. That just made me want to watch it even more!
B00004U2G4|5.0|At first glance, the diversity of stuff on this album (rockers like the opener and the instrumantal \\"Beck's Bolero,\\" blues covers like \\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"I Ain't Superstitious,\\" and versions of \\"Old Man River\\" and \\"Greensleeves\\") makes it seem like Jeff Beck and his band went into the studio, randomly recorded a bunch of songs, and picked 10 of them to fill an album. (Actually, that is probably what they did.) But the material is excellent in general, so when listening to it, the album feels not like a 40-minute random batch of 10 songs but an epic covering a wide range of genres, in spite of its few weaknesses here and there. It almost seems odd that by the album's close, you've heard only two-sides worth of material and not four.    Considering the all-star lineup of Beck's group and the influence this album had, it seems fairly odd that it is (at leat as I see it) fairly obscure when compared with the work that Beck's fellow Yardbirds alums were doing around the same time and in the following few years.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I personally think Catherine Zeta-Jones steals the show in this sound track.  She really puts on a great perform through song.  I think she does a great job in the movie (sorry, but I had to reference it) and it definitely is heard through the songs on the CD as well.  You can hear her character during each performance she sings.  Quenn Latifah also brings out her best.  I wish she was involved in more songs however.  For me, Richard Gere is so so in his performance.  But overall, I really enjoy this CD.
B00006RIO7|4.0|I went to see the movie Chicago on a Friday night and loved the music so much that I bought this soundtrack the next day. This CD includes some songs that are not in the movie... by far the most dissimilar one to all the rest is the &quot;Cell Block Tango Remix&quot; by Queen Latifah. That's the only one that I really don't like, but other than that, I recommend this CD very highly!
B000084T18|4.0|... Even though this is not the best hiphop debut CD ever made it's still a very well produced CD. <br />... I'm not a real fan of gangsta (that's why only 4 out of 5) but 50 cents effort is defiantly good at bringing it to the next generation. <br />In my opinion Pac was good for his time, biggi though, I would have preferred not to have ever heard if I could of. But you have to remember that there music became huge in the early nineties, now hiphop is evolving you can't expect the same old tunes from 10 years ago coming out, that's what makes this CD so good as it is trying to evolve the gangsta genre.<br />What I suggest to any hiphop/rap lover is to listen to the CD yourself and make your own opinion wether to buy it or not. <br />Don't forget everyone has there own taste.<br />P.S for some real, true Hiphop listen to some Hieroglyphics stuff (Souls Of Mischief, Deltron 3030, Del). Peace
B00005JL7Q|3.0|I love Hugh Grant, and was extremely disappointed with this movie.  I didn't find it nearly as good as it was said to be.
B000075BFK|4.0|The album is off the chain! Excelleng lyrics from Pac as usual. Some tracks are a bit suspect though. You get the feeling that there were a lot of &quot;cut and join&quot; operations to create these songs. This own it's own lowers the integrity of the album. Hence one less star! As for Suge Knight... well enough said!
B0000797IO|3.0|This story was really weird.  I found it boring and depressing.  I was expecting much better.
B0000019PA|5.0|Well, I'm not quite sure why I haven't written a review of this cd yet, actually I might of, I'm quite forgetful.  Anyways, this is one of my favorite albums - usually it's my favorite, but lately 'The Charm of the Highway Strip' has been doing very well.  It is impossable for me to tell you how good this album is.  If you don't have it yet then download the title track from Kaaza.  By the time the song is over you will already be on your way to buy it.  <br />For those of you who have it already and don't have \\"Avery Island\\", don't make the same mistake I did.  I waited three years to get it, and have only been able to enjoy it for the last few months.  It's an excellent album, not as good as this one but still very good.  So wait no longer, get all the NMH cds you can.<br />P.S. Elephant6.com has a live solo show and a full NMH show free to download, the solo show is the best but they're bolth worth downloading. Go, do it now.
0316286443|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I would recommend it to all people interested in the Make-up industry.  Kevyn Aucoin was extremely talented.  It was rewarding to see celebrities having different looks while comparing what they usually look like with it.  He also explains how to get that &quot;look&quot;
B000051S44|5.0|Until I bought my own copy of LeMans, I was forced to try and catch it on the obscure channels at 2:00 am. Now, I can watch it at my leisure and turn the volume wayyyyyy up - thereby scaring my cats and irritating my wife - and just close my eyes and soak up the sounds of those glorious Porsche and Ferrari engines at full chat. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Outstanding!
0151008116|5.0|This book certainly won't make you believe in God, as the author claims, if you don't already. But if you already do believe in God, it will invite you to question what belief is. Is it full acceptance of all the stories of your faith, or is it just a comfortable suspension of disbelief? What do you do with the parts that are too hard to believe? This isn't the kind of book that one forgets as soon as the last chapter is read.
0151008116|4.0|Young Indian boy lives in a zoo, learns about religion, gets thrust into a wild adventure. Chock full of symbolism - that works enough but sometimes heavy-handed. Either way, a fun read, an interesting ending, and plenty of practical stranded at sea tips. Not recommended for reading on a cruise.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble's honey and silky voice is wonderfully introduced to me via the standards and classics I have always loved to hear and swing to. Buble's effortless singing of these wonderful ditties delighted me tremendously as I listened to his CD. Bubbly, naughty, capturing, sad, sexy... all these adjectives come to my mind as Buble sizzles through 'Fever', romantices 'The Way You Look Tonight' or simply swings it in a song, Come Fly With Me. <br />It's been a long time since I've fallen in love with a male jazzy voice. And he is certainly the one I am going to look out for these days.
B00006690G|5.0|I am a huge fan of Eminem, and I love this CD! It only has a few songs on it that I don't absolutly love. Hailie's Song is beautiful (if rap can be beautiful), and it's awesome that Em included his daughter in My Dad's Gone Crazy. Sing For The Moment is great, and so is Cleanin' Out My Closet. Without Me gets old, but it's still good. In short, every song on this CD has the potential to be a hit single (if it isn't already!). On the down side, if you don't like cussing, graphic messages, or hard-core truth, I wouldn't recommend this CD.
B00000273M|5.0|The Bangles are definitely a classic 80's group. They exploded in 1986 and were huge all the way up until their break-up in 1989. Inthat short time period they managed a handful of great pop singles that are still well known and recognized today thanks a lot to Susanna Hoffs distinguishable vocals and the girls' awesome harmonies. &quot;Manic Monday&quot; was the song that made them music superstars going to #2 in the US and becoming a pop classic. The hits kept coming with their huge #1 &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot; and the #2 hit &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; *both included here of course.* They also had a top 5 hit with &quot;In My Room&quot; and had another massive #1 with my personal favorite, the beautiful ballad &quot;Eternal Flame.&quot; &quot;To Be With You,&quot; &quot;Walking Down Your Street,&quot; and &quot;I'll Set You Free&quot; were also moderate hits all making the top 40. It's a shame that they broke up at the heighth of their popularity. I'm sure they could've been huge even into the 90's.<br />This &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is an awesome collection of what made The Bangles so great. Sure, &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot; may have 80's cheese written all over it, but it's so enjoyable, who really cares. Buy it and enjoy. Other 80's girl groups you might wanna check out are &quot;The Go Go's&quot; and &quot;Expose.&quot;
B000089RVX|5.0|I knew these guys (and gal) would be great. Once I heard the two songs from DareDevil I knew the group would be good and boy was I right. Every song is listenable w/out any skipping. I can't really put them in a group, its kind of like t.A.T.u w/out the techno and Korn only better than that. I can't remember the singer's name but all I have to say is she has a beautiful voice. I just wish there were more hard rock groups out there that have great female lead vocalists. Check this CD out no matter what the price!
0684800713|1.0|I read this book for an English class, expecting it to be the masterpiece it's cracked up to be. I was unpleasantly surprised. This book is not only TERRIBLY written, it is boring beyond words. Hemingway's writing style could easily be surpassed by a seven year old. Descriptions like &quot;she was really pretty&quot; just don't cut it in the world of top writers.
B000069AUI|5.0|I have to say, I've never been won over by Coldplay enough to buy an album of theirs. Until now.<br />After the acclaimed debut Parachutes, they had a bit of a challenge on their hands. Change of direction, or more of the same? This is pretty much the latter, but they haven't done the same record under a different title or anything. It just picks up from where Parachutes left off. But it does sound accomplished - in fact, it sounds rather like a proper seasoned rock band, like U2 for example.<br />Coldplay has really outshone itself artistically. Their rule is Keep Things Simple. Like its predecessor Blood is quite a subdued, sedate record, but here we are getting signs that they really do want to take on the world. \\"Tell me your politick\\" goes the opening track. \\"Daylight\\" is a nice surprise, a hint of Sixties retro with a tune to die for. \\"Clocks\\" is as U2-like as they get.<br />The thing that really makes this album is not the killer choruses, or the gentle guitar riffs, or the lovely piano. It's not the heartfelt, sincere lyrics, either. Rather it's the sheer emotion and soul of Chris Martin's vocals. His voice is not so much the icing on the cake as the baking powder IN the cake. It is very important to Coldplay's music. His voice sells the album, in my opinion. It is absolutely perfect for the lyrics he writes.<br />All in all, A Rush Of Blood To The Head is a very impressive effort by a \\"super-band\\" in the making. Coldplay deserve the plaudits that have been given to them, and those who haven't heard this album really are missing out.
B00004Y6OA|3.0|On their third release, Van Halen still had it. Although it's not as great as the two first albums, \\"Women and children first\\" surely have its moments. The opener \\"And the cradle will rock\\" stands out as one of the bands better songs, together with \\"Take your whiskey home\\". The approach on this album is over all a bit heavier, shown in tunes like \\"Everybody wants some\\" and \\"Fools\\". In \\"Could this be magic?\\", David Lee Roth is going for the lighter style comparable to parts of \\"Ice cream man\\" and \\"Beautiful girls\\".<br />Some may say that Van Halen developed on this album, but development doesn't necessary have to be a good thing. While \\"Van Halen I\\" and Van Halen II\\" both were superior and had a naturally connection to each other, this one \\"Women and children first\\" have more in common with its following \\"Fair warning\\". I'm sad to say, but after the two first albums, Van Halen were unable of creating another masterpiece.
B00005J6UP|1.0|I ordered this movie because I am looking for movies for my kids that are more mature than the Disney cartoons but still wholesome.  I read the reviews for this movie and it semed like a winner.  Within the first 5 minutes of the movie there was foul language by the KIDS in the movie, reference to drugs, and a small stutue of a naked man with an erection.  I turned it off VERY ANGRY that I had wasted my money on this garbage.  This is supposed to be a kid movie -- there is no way I would let my 7 year old watch it.  Wish there was less than 1 star to rate it.
B0000025RQ|5.0|Besides \\"British steel\\", \\"Screaming for vengeance\\" is the best album from Judas Priest. In a way, it's a bit more melodic but it still rocks big time! Rob Halford is in top shape and the guitar playing by Glenn Tipton and KK Downing is superb. On this album Judas Priest went for a more radio friendly approach. I guess their plan was to conquer America, where the European metal style never gained success. But don't be afraid, it's still heavy metal and it has almost nothing in common with the L.A. metal scene (also known as Hair Metal).
B00004SVID|2.0|If you believe _The Wall_ was a work of genius, then all you need to know about this live recording is that it's slightly better than the original studio release, but not amazingly so.  There are two new tracks, but they only add more lyrics without adding more music.  So if you already own the original studio release on CD, this version is not different enough to be worth buying as well.  <br />However it's a marginally better recording.  Although the guitarwork is much the same as on the studio set, Gilmour's playing gains an edge from live performance.  Also, you can occasionally hear Wright in the mix, which was seldom the case on the studio version.  So if you're a fan of _The Wall_ but don't own a copy, this is the recording to get.  <br />This is also vastly better than Roger Waters' all-star version, where he tried to link his concept to the fall of the Berlin Wall. The best that can be said of that project was that it was irrelevant, both musically and politically.    <br />But if you're a Wall sceptic, like me, then the rest of this review is for you.  Why are so many Floyd fans _Wall_ sceptics?  Three reasons.  <br />The first problem is that _The Wall_is musically very ordinary.  That is, there was a time when Pink Floyd sounded like no-one else on earth: the sounds they got from their relatively primitive technology (by today's standards) still seem unearthly, beautiful, new, strange, sometimes scary.  And the compositions, especially the longer tracks, were as far from verse-chorus-verse-chorus-repeat-chorus rock as it's possible to go: weird, creative, mind-enhancing stuff.  In _The Wall_ Pink Floyd sound like a rock band: a good one, but good in a workmanlike, ordinary way.  To put this in perspective, let's take the band Queen.  I don't mind Queen, but I don't care about them much, either.  I can't imagine Queen being capable of any of Pink Floyd's music up until _Animals_, but I could quite easily imagine them coming up with something a bit like _The Wall_.  (Queen, to give them their due, would have offered less self-pity and more humour; that might not be enough to rescue _The Wall_, but it probably would have helped.)  <br />The second problem is that _The Wall_ is musically very ordinary.  That is, &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; is an okay song/chant lifted into something genuinely interesting by a great bassline; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; are two okay songs that get promoted to good-ness by Gilmour's guitar.  &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Hey You&quot; are kind of okay, but aren't lifted higher than &quot;kind of okay&quot;.  But the rest falls into two categories: endless recitative with Waters' voice whining and mumbling over mediocre playing by The Other Three, and &quot;The Trial&quot;.  <br />As for &quot;The Trial&quot;, I once read that after releasing _The Final Cut_ (which was more like _The Last Straw_, for those of us who used to expect vital music from Pink Floyd), Roger Waters decided to sit down and listen to some Andrew Lloyd-Webber, because he'd just insulted Lloyd-Webber in his lyrics.  Waters was worried that it might turn out that _Cats_, or whatever it was, had even a shred of merit, in which case Waters would have to feel bad about the insult.  So he was relieved to discover that Lloyd-Webber's music was, as he said, &quot;completely and utterly horrible in every way.&quot;  The trouble is, Roger, I can't imagine Queen coming up with something as completely and utterly horrible in every way as &quot;The Trial&quot;; but I can imagine Lloyd-Webber writing something like that.  And &quot;The Trial&quot; is not just a track, it's a category of awfulness: other tracks, like &quot;Vera&quot; and &quot;Bring the Boys Back Home&quot; fit into &quot;The Trial&quot;'s category of Utter Horribleness.  <br />The third problem is that _The Wall_'s concept and lyrics are very ordinary.  The wall itself is a lazy metaphor, too obvious to have any real force.  And a wall is, let's face it, not very interesting visually.  Even the much maligned flying pig seemed more imaginative.  Then there's Waters' self-pity, or that of his character &quot;Pink&quot;.  We're supposed to identify with his whining, but I ... don't.  Pink doesn't really exist as a character, but the little we are told about him seems neither interesting nor likeable.  Perhaps my problem is that I don't really give a toss about the problems of rich rock stars, not since John Lennon worked that same territory to better creative effect.  Nor do I like the sub-Freudian blame-the-mommies stick that Water's mother comes in for.  (I think Julie Burchill once recommended that Mrs Waters give her boy a slap for all the horrid things he says about her on this album.  But me, I think that Violence Never Solves Anything.) <br />So, I had my reservations about _The Wall_.  After I bought and listened to the _Is there Anybody Out There_ version, those reservations still stand.  I'd bought it mainly in the hope that Gilmour would cut loose under live conditions and decorate more of the flat recitative sections with his trademark guitarwork, something I can take a lot of.  Unfortunately that doesn't happen; the solos are marginally more energetic, but there aren't any more of them.  <br />I've been hesitating between two or three stars.  My decision to give it two is probably influenced by my feeling that this is Pink Floyd and so it ought to be better.   Can I recommend buying it?  Am I pleased I bought it?  The answer to both questions is, no, not quite.  _Is There Anyone Out There_ is okay in parts, but its three best tracks (&quot;Another Brick&quot;, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;) can be found, without the bland filler and the Trial-esque abominations that make up the rest of _The Wall_, on The Other Three's live album, _Pulse_.    <br />This is an improved version of some disappointing music, but still a disappointment.    <br />Cheers!<br />Laon
B00000731Y|5.0|After the instrumental intro (\\"Fortuna\\"), Pretty Maids kick off with the fast and hard \\"Back to back\\", and there's no doubt that we're in for heavy metal quality time. Pretty Maids have both the speed (\\"Back to back\\", \\"Night danger\\") and the melody (\\"Queen of dreams\\", \\"A place in the night\\"), the heavy approach (\\"Red, hot and heavy\\") as well as a softer side (\\"Waitin' for the time\\"). Singer Ronnie Atkins is perfectly suited for Pretty Maids and he's capable to variation in his singing style, and guitar player Ken Hammer is without doubt talented. This album is packed with traditional heavy metal with its roots in New Wave Of British Heavy Metal, and in my opinion it's top quality from the beginning to the end. The album cover is indeed not good, but don't be prejudiced.<br />After this excellent album, Pretty Maids followed it up with \\"Future world\\", but that is a pale copy in comparison. Do yourself a favour and get \\"Red, hot and heavy\\" as fast as you can.
B000089RVX|5.0|delightful surprise with this first album. for those who love LINKIN PARK, try EVANESCENCE. this band has a potential # 1 with  &quot; bring me to life  &quot; . very intersting mix of dark gothic, with LINKIN PARK sound, a very like GARBAGE voice, and some MEATLOAF accord spinkled on top of it. Strange but very interesting recippe. This album rocks big time and is definitively worth the 14 bucks investment. the doctor prescribe to listen to it very loud and without moderation. 1 down note, still need to see how they will sound live because this remains the real test.
B000002MUQ|2.0|This album has only two great songs: \\"Seventh seal\\" and \\"Can't stop lovin' you\\", the rest is at best mediocre. I'm not a big fan of Sammy Hagar and his squealing and strained singing style, and I can never come to terms with a Van Halen without David Lee Roth. But believe me, that has nothing to do with my low rating. Most of the songs are just not captivating and they are forgettable. If you prefer Sammy Hagar over David Lee Roth, like I know a lot of people do, you better buy \\"5150\\" instead of \\"Balance\\" since it's the best Hagar/VH album.
B000084T18|5.0|...and no not because his record label has pushed the cd mercilessly or because Dr. Dre and Eminem produced this album. The reason is clear 50 Cent has raw talent, street cred, and great flow. 50 Cent is the real deal when it comes to \\"thugs\\". He's been stabbed, shot up, and locked up. He's run ki's, popped caps, and toted macs. These beats are hot and so is 50's flow. All of the tracks are strong but the absolute best of the best are: Patiently Waiting, Many Men (Wish Death), In Da Club, High All the Time, Blood Hound, and Like My Style. The element that will separate 50 from all the other mc's is that he has the street credibility to back up what he says on his records. Like 50 says about rap \\"...I don't need to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood.\\" This guys the real deal. Highly Recommended.
B000089RVX|5.0|&quot;Evanescence&quot; means fading from sight, but that is something this band will not do. Contrary to popular belief, they have been making music together for many years, releasing independent albums of their sound. Unfortunately, not very many people were able to get their hands (or ears, if you prefer) on these indie EP's. My hope is now that they have been signed to a major label, all of those wonderful songs that were lost will get re-released. Their main first album was &quot;Origin,&quot; which does not differ too much from &quot;Fallen.&quot; If you are familiar with &quot;Origin,&quot; you will see repeated songs: &quot;My Immortal,&quot; &quot;Imaginary&quot; (though a slightly egdier version), and &quot;Whisper&quot; (also slightly a different version). The rest of the songs on &quot;Fallen&quot; hold up the expectations of &quot;Origin,&quot; following in the footsteps of its predecessor. If you loved Evanescence before they got big, you will love them even more now.<br />Individually, the songs each have a life of their own. This is not one of those CD's that you pick up and once you've heard one song, you've basically heard them all. Each song is crafted with its own unique feel and message. Some are heavier, some are softer; some feature the usual guitar/drum combo, some include Amy Lee's wonderful piano playing and orchestral instruments. But don't let the piano and chamber choir fool you--this is an edgy, powerful album. You can't help but be moved by it. It is a dark, gothic collection of pensive, brilliant songs that will not disappoint the real music lover.<br />Amy Lee is always great, and Ben Moody is her perfect complimentary element. Being signed to a major label has not altered their powerful lyrics or heart-stopping music. Evanescence surely has nothing but a bright future in store for them.<br />**Highlights of the Album: Track 1) Going Under, Track 2) Bring Me to Life, Track 4) My Immortal, Track 5) Haunted, Track 7) Imaginary, and Track 11) Whisper. Though, in all honesty, each of the tracks on this album is very likable and pleasing to the ears.ck 11) Whisper. Though, in all honesty, each of the tracks on this album is very likable and pleasing to the ears.
B00005R23X|4.0|The acting and effects in this film were very well done and the story was deeper than the shallowness of horror as it recognized that all have their motives.  It was, despite the critisism of some of the nay sayers, very faithfull to the book in many ways ( the vampire being abroad in day light, the facination for the modern, etc).  The only real point of divergence from the book was the love story added.   Many have complained that the Dracula of the novel was an heartless unfeeling monster not the gentle mis-understood lover in the film.  While this analysis has textual merit, the film was certainly within the relm of legitamate interpretation.  The novel was in the epistolary form, each section being only a letter, diary entery, recording, etc of a specific characters recounting of events.  There was no omniscient narrator, to tell us how dracula viewed things.  The only examination of dracula in the epistolary form was, per-force, that of those who were bent on his destruction and would tend to view him as a monster, and from Mina, who might understandably leave out some detail.  Thus, while this was probably not what the author intended, there is actually plenty of room in the text to contain such an interpretation.  <BR>  Also the complaints about the nudity and so on are misplaced when one considers that, with even a tighter eye on the text and sociolgical background, a huge part of the \\"evil\\" of dracula was the symbolic sexulaity verboten at the time it was published.  The wontonness/nudity of dracula's \\"wives\\" was ther very symbol of evil at the time.  In addition the films focus on the lush sexuality of Lucy and the more restrainted, but perhaps just under the surface sexuality of Mina would mark them as easy tagets for the devil of the time.  Any discomfort we as veiwer feel about the nudity, sexuality, etc, indicates that the film/novel is makeing its point.<BR>   The interseting thing that I have not seen addressed by most reviewers relating to the filmis the nature of faith.  In the film Dracula basically become what he was becuase of the injustice of God againt him.  He fought to protect christiandom from invation, he was rewarded with his love dead and, apparently, damned.  He become what he is becuase he rejects God.  We don't all have the paitence of Job, in this film even after failing at his test of faith, it is implied that he can still be reconciled with God through love and the triumph over fear.  <BR>   While this film looks beyond the book it never contradicts it and it tells a story that has levels of meaning that the text does not contain.  If I have to choose between a fun book or a thoughtfull and fun, meaningful film, I will take the film.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was completely shocked when I heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" (off the Daredevil Soundtrack).  I was becoming bored with same guitar stuff, and Evanescence blew me out the water! Very electric, with a touch of hardcore, and to top it off a female vocalist!!???? That's pretty much unheard of in this line of music.  Her voice is likely to send chills down your spine! Wonderfully haunting songs.   I would recommend it to just about anyone!!!
1572702486|5.0|As an example of how ingeniously a whodunit might be plotted, and how expertly an audio book might be read, this package could hardly be bettered.<br />Agatha Christie wrote \\"Evil Under the Sun\\" in the early 1940s.  It was a time when the second world war had brought widespread misery, pain and austerity.  A welcome antidote, therefore was to devise a little budget-priced escapism, to depict a group of guests at a sea-side holiday resort relaxing and exchanging gossip and tittle-tattle as they overlook a beach and the bathers who are using it.<br />The inane gossip and the lack of suspense in the opening pages might wear your patience, but keep alert!  Many significant clues are scattered here.<br />The subsequent murder and the possible motivation relate mainly to a context of human relationships.  A drug smuggling racket is occasionally suggested.  Hercule Poirot is present, of course, to lead police, readers, and everybody else to the solution of the mystery, even if he needs to ruin a good pair of shoes and risk seasickness during the hunt.<br />Addictive and ingenious as her books can be, Agatha Christie's prose and dialogue are not renowned for literary merit.  All the more remarkable, therefore, is the contribution of David Suchet. Such is the reading of the great British actor that the banal is transformed into the brilliant, the commonplace into the courtly, and the mediocre into the memorable.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I shant talk about the plot or what goes on in this movie, however, I will say that apart from the lord of the rings trilogy, this is the most satisfying film I have seem in the longest time, strong storyline, perfect action and beautiull acting.<br />  I can safelly say that people who dont enjoy this film should seriously re-evaluate why they like films in the first place. I cant wait for this dvd, since my first reaction after seeing this film was the urge to walk right back to the theater and watch it again. A definite must for anyone who enjoys a great movie.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|On DVD, the Platinum Special Edition of Disney's \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is a refreshing and aesthetic experience. The DVD comes loaded with special features- theatrical trailers, three versions of the film, soundtrack, Broadway musical and interactive games. Beauty and the Beast was released in 1991. It was Disney's most enduring classic, and one of the first to use computer generated effects which would pave the way for later films. The romantic, quasi Gothic tale revolves around a haughty prince, transformed into a hideous Beast, who must love a woman and earn her love in return. \\"But who could ever learn to love a beast ?.\\" That would be Belle, the book-smart, beautiful, courageous and vibrant young heroine and one of the few Disney heroines who is not vain, vapid and helpless. Belle's father becomes imprisoned in the Beast's dungeon and Belle offers to take his place. During her stay in the Beast's castle, she becomes acquianted with the enchanted host of objects and furniture- Lumiere, the candelabra who speaks  French like Maurice Chevalier, Cogsworth the uptight British clock, Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury) as the warm, motherly teapot an Chip the rambunctious tea cup. Belle saves the Beast with her love- and he is transformed into a handsome, human prince.<br />The villain in the film is Gaston, a ruggedly handsome, but self-centered and vainglorious hunter. Gaston is determined to make Belle his trophy wife, but his machinations (including locking up her inventor father, Maurice, in an insane asylum). The special effects are computer enhanced- particularily striking is the ballroom scene. Beauty and the Beast is full of memorable and catchy songs by Alan Menken and Tim Rice- \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Be Our Guest\\" \\"Belle\\", \\"Gaston\\" \\"Something There\\" \\"Kill the Beast\\" and the never before heard song \\"Human again\\". There is no wonder why the movie was made into a popular and successful Broadway musical.
B00006LLLN|5.0|A very good CD set. It has two CD's, so it's well worth the money. It has a lot of old favorite bluegrass songs on it such as \\"the boy who wouldn't hoe corn.\\"  Also, it has songs like \\"I am a man of constant sorrow\\" from O Brother.  It also has some of Allison's newest CDs and some of her old faves.<br />Overall, it's well worth the money, and it has good sound quality for a live-recorded CD.
6305744793|5.0|A near-worthy successor, to be more exact. The 1991 remake of the classic 60's series was taken into the hands of director Barry Sonnenfield (Men In Black films). Sonnenfield's use of computer enhanced effects and tongue-in-cheek, slapstick surrealism contributed to the success of this film, which spawned a sequel, \\"Addams Family Values\\" and a made for video film.<br /> The 60's tv show magic is lost in the wake of modern cinema and even the actors, try as they did, could not match the sophisticated humor that John Astin and Carolyn Jones shared- they were the original Gomez and Morticia. But nevertheless, the film is worth watching, if anything for the special effects and performances by Christopher Lloyd as Uncle Fester and Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. Noteworthy is also Lurch and Thing, whose dismembered hand is a computer generated illusion.<br />The plot of the film revolves around Uncle Fester's amnesia. He has returned from the Bermuda Triangle (something which in itself is impossible, says the doubting Christina Ricci's Wednesday) and brought home his mother. His \\"mother\\" is a villainous woman bent on claiming the Addams Family fortune, their estate. When she has managed to influence Fester, the rest of the Addams are forced out of their home and obligated to work for rent in a slum's apartment. Eventually, the villainous woman is defeated and the Addams reclaim their home, and Uncle Fester regains his memory.<br />The film has its comic moments, i.e. when Gomez (Raul Julia) is watching day time talk show Sally Jesse Raphael and asks where voodoo witch doctors have their meetings, when Pugsley and Wednesday engage in a play and duel (with fake, splurting blood) and the Halloween party in which all the Addams are invited- a host of grotesque, zombie creatures appear, including the two-headed sisters. Cousin Itt also makes an appearance. <br />Although Raul Julia and Angelica Houston try to imitate the artistic, witty repartee and passion that John Astin and Carolyn Jones shared, they fail to do so. Raul Julia can pass off for Gomez, especially because he is Latin, but Angelica Houston does not portray a convincing Morticia- cast only because Angelica Houston's has pale, dark, \\"witch\\" like features. A striking element in the film, besides its cinematography, is its music. The soundtrack, elegant, haunting, romantic, Gothic, which sounds like the same music to the scores of \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" or \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\"- orchestral subtle tones, lush romanticism, tango, etc. An enjoyable film, although what would have been preferable was for the producers of the original tv show (which ran from 1964 to 66), would be to have had John Astin, Carolyn Jones and the rest of the black and white tv show's cast- Ted Cassidy (Lurch) Blossom Rock (Grandmama) Lisa Loring (Wednesday), Ken Weatherwax (Pugsley) and Jackie Coogan (Uncle Fester) to star in a color film directly after the show ended (1966) in an attempt to save the show from a brief syndication. Apparently, this was done in the late 70's, but by then the series had ended years before and a lot of the cast members were quite old.
B0000844I8|3.0|Come on Artisan how can you say that this new STARGATE (Ultimate Edition) DVD has a Newly Remastered Picture. The picture quality is loaded with ARTIFACTS. What kind of 35MM Negative did they use for remastering? All the dark indoor sceens show heavly artifacts and the outdoor lighted shots are beautifully crisp? See for yourself! The Sound is unbeatable. The best sounding DVD I own. But there is no way that this picture quality was remastered. Buyers Beware!
B000002JSN|5.0|What more can you say about Zeppelin that hasn't already been said? PG along with LZ3 are my favorite Zeppelin cds. I own this one on album, had a copy on cd but needed a better one. Kashmir is my favorite Zeppelin song. Gotta have this one.
0393039765|5.0|We are God's forsaken middle children.  The scum of this earth.  If you feel like you are nothing, then you are well on your way to understanding Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club.  The unknown, Christ like protagonist leads us through a pain filled world so that we might have a better relative understanding of what really is pain.  The piece opens with our hero struggling to sleep, and asking for some sort of medication that will finally grant him dormancy.  \\"I'm in a lot of pain, here,\\" he says.  \\"You want to see pain,\\" the doctor says, \\"Then go to the testicular cancer group at so and so church on Wednesday nights.\\"  From this point our champion becomes addicted to dying persons' support groups, because he is able to take a new perspective on life.<BR> As readers we are walked through a series of these groups until we are introduced to Marla, another \\"faker\\" in these support groups.  After meeting Marla, our \\"Joe\\" is no longer able to reap the benefits of these support groups because he sees his own deception in her.  And so he leaves, seeking another form of therapy.<BR> At this point we are introduced to Tyler.  Tyler comes to us as a guy who as seen rock bottom.  He knows how bad it can be and so is unphased by everything else.  After our leading man's apartment, his soul, is blow up he seeks refuge with Tyler, and this is where to fun really begins.
0446608955|5.0|I was very excited for \\"A Walk to Remember\\" the movie to come out, but I always love when I read the book and then see the movie so that I can compare them to each other.  I began the book on the day that I purchased it, and never put it down after that until I finished it.  I loved the book because it seemed like a real story that could actually happen to someone.  I loved how the author used specific details for feelings and described the setting so that the reader could feel like they were actually in the story. The characters in the book were mainly high school seniors and they seemed like real people who did activities that young readers could relate to. The ending was very sad and after I finished the book, I anticipated seeing the movie and expected to see something very well done.  When I finally went to see the movie, I was disappointed.  The movie wasn't as descriptive as the book and left out parts or emotions that I enjoyed in the book.  I think that the actors in the movie did a good job to the best of their ability, but some of the scenes were filled with bad acting and cheesiness.  It always turns out that the book is always better than the movie.  I think that is because a book can allow the reader to imagine the characters any way they would like and interpret their emotions to any extent.  In a movie, everything is laid out for the audience and you cannot change any aspect of the film.  This book is definitely one of my favorite books and I feel like I can read the book again and again, and still enjoy every word.
014028009X|4.0|I aw the movie first and loved it and wanted to read the book.  The book was just as funny and original as the movie, although slightly different.  <BR>Some of the scenes were a little different or longer in the book and I liked that.  Other things were explained more in the novel which I was glad.  Reading the trials and tribulations of a singleton thirty-something with boss problems and men problems and a little mix of mom and dad problems was a refreshing read from the usual fare of 'chick lit' I have been running across.<BR>Alot of authors are trying to recreate the magic of Bridget Jones, but they fall short of the witty and most oftentimes hysterical turns of Ms Jones's life.<BR>Bridget is unhappy with her weight, her job, her boss, her lovelife and her bad habits(drinking too much wine and smoking).  Determined to do something about it after New Year's disasterous turkey curry buffet with her mom and dad and their friends, she sets herself up for a year of hysterical twists and turns that lead her into the next Christmas wondering what went wrong.<BR>Written in diary format, we see everything from her point of view and how she thinks and operates.  The secondary characters of Shazzer and Jude, Sharon, Daniel, Mark Darcy and Vile Richard(also in the movie) make many appearances in the book and add humor and many hours of laughter.<BR>Well worth the read!!!
B000059T1E|5.0|I purchased this album on vinyl on whim, and boy was I rocked. I immediately went out and purchased the CD as well.  Originally meant to be a solo album for Steve Winwood, he couldn't resist bringing in his pals from the then defunct Traffic.  What a treat that he did.  From the opening of Glad with its upbeat jazz riffs and groovy piano work, to the desperate vocals in Every Mother's Son, this was three great musicians at their best.  Unlike the two previous Traffic albums they were willing to take extended solos, and experiment with more jazz flavor than before (half of the songs clock in at more than 6 minutes).  Check out Winwood's piano solo in Empty Pages for proof that the equation works.  The album simply rocks for all the right reasons, good songwriting, and even better musicianship.  Highly recommended!
6304362498|5.0|I saw this film when it was first released and was blown away by how great it was, having known the novel since I was a young boy in the 1970s and never completely grasping it until I saw this film, and having grown up a bit by then, it hit home HARD.  <BR>John Hurt makes the perfect Winston Smith, Richard Burton the perfect O'Brien.  Someone earlier in these pages makes mention that some find this film too dark, too depressing.  I think we all should be forced to watch this film at some point in our lives BECAUSE it's so dark and depressing.  First of all, 1984 the novel was George Orwell not predicting THE future but predicting one POSSIBLE future.  If you can't grasp this you might as well not bother with the novel or this film version.  Given 9/11 and recent events in our own United States (indeed \\"EastAsia\\" as well) if you don't get the message of this film, God help you is all I have to say.  You'll find no happy endings here if that's what you're searching for.  1984 is about loss of freedom, loss of the individual, the intellectual, and the total annihilation of human culture, ultimately.  It's about what COULD happen, not what WILL happen for certain.  I can never understand why people<BR>can't get the message in a film like 1984 (or the novel), and realize it's George Orwell warning us of possibilities, NOT<BR>of current or future realities.  Thus, the newly minted Patriot Act in the USA COULD become The Ministry of Truth if we let it become so.  The people who are too dim to understand this book or the film would be the first to succumb to Big Brother.  <BR>It's not just surveillance that's the issue for Orwell, it's <BR>the government destroying all individual thought until only <BR>servile robots remain. If that's the future you want, complain that this film is too dark, depressing and disturbing: at least you still have time, hopefully, for the message here to sink in your dim brain and maybe, just maybe, you WON'T end up like Winston Smith or Julia.People can turn away at this film or book, can turn away from realizing the Holocaust happened, that the Khmer Rouge happened in Cambodia, etc., but if you turn away from these cruel facts you will NEVER get the message, and you are therefore in grave danger of ending up living the reality 1984 portrays.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Is there any way to describe &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; except wow? The ending alone might be the greatest in movie history. I would like for someone to prove me wrong by finding one that was better. Kevin Spacey turns in a career-making performance as the often likable Verbal Gent. He convincingly takes the viewer along a rollercoaster ride of lies and deceit. The cast is amazing including: Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, and Chazz Palminteri. A must own for every DVD collection. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece.
B000089RVX|5.0|Wow... that's really all I have to say. This cd is absolutely... amazing. After hearing the first single, &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, I wanted to pick up their album, but then came to find out that it was not yet released. I bought the Daredevil Soundtrack for their 2 songs, and waited for the release of &quot;Fallen&quot;. I was hooked upon first listen of this cd. The music is dark, gothic rock... but yet, not depressing. It sends chills up and down my spines everytime I listen. Amy's voice is so angelic, yet very powerful at the same time. This cd is outstanding. If you enjoyed the first single from Daredevil, you will surely enjoy this cd. If you take the time out to purchase this... it will be well worth your money.
B0000062S0|4.0|Walking into Clarksdale is the type of cd that you have to listen to a few times to really enjoy it to it's full potential.  Just like Led Zeppelin in it's prime, it has an almost spiritual feel to it, as if the divine are speaking through Page and Plant.  It has the ability to transport you into different planes of thought.<br />The best songs of the cd would have to be 'upon a golden horse' which has an old school led zeppelin feel and 'when the world was young' which is everything that I spoke about in the last paragraph.  Admitingly some of the songs on this album are not all they could be, but this is still a great record by all means!  There is alot of wisdom in their music and I recommend it for all and everyone.
B000084T18|3.0|I dont know what all the hype was about...in da club was catchy, but i see no special lyrical quality in any of these songs, he doesnt say anything i havent heard before. he doesnt hit you like Em (who is vastly superior to everyone in the industry). This is a good album, but nothing we'll be talking about (or listening to) in 6 months. the hype was just that, and i am unimpressed and im glad i heard it before i bought it.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble has a competent voice, an interesting style and a natural flair when it comes to singing pop classics, and his debut album, produced with the help of David Foster and Paul Anka, is a gem.<br />Listening to it, you'd never guess the album wasn't of the Rat Pack period. Buble, whose smooth voice is a delight, is only 25 years old, though.<br />With Rod Stewart and Robbie Williams doing albums that harken back to the era when Dino and the Chairman ruled the airwaves, it's good to see someone who's not just doing these songs as a sort of wink-wink throwback. Buble sings these songs because he prefers singing these songs, not because he had a pop rock career that fizzled.<br />Hopefully, with future albums, he'll stay within this genre and continue doing such fun, catchy work. It's good that someone like Michael Buble recognizes that the best music is the kind that can lead couples to dance.
0894803123|5.0|First off, Dastardly Mash no longer exists. If you like it, you're going to have to make it, and the recipe is in here.<br />Offering another general review of what may be one of the best (if not best, at least the first) books on ice cream you can buy would be a bit pointless, so I'm going to talk a bit about what they did with this book instead. &quot;Secret recipes&quot; are a big deal -- a guy named Todd has put together quite a successful line of cookbooks based on copying famous foods, and everyone from Coca-Cola to Boston Market has their secrets -- a syrup, a marinade, a cookie. But when Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield published this book in 1987, right around the time Ben &amp; Jerry's was just hitting the big time, they were letting the cash cow out of the bag and doing it in print. Hasn't hurt them a bit, and the book is sixteen years old now.<br />Now obviously it's not going to be easy to duplicate the concrete-dense mouthfeel of B&amp;J's ice cream without one of those pricey self-contained ice cream makers from Simac or DeLonghi, but you can still play with their recipes and recreate their flavors (such as the above-mentioned Dastardly Mash) and have a lot of fun doing it. The point is that Ben and Jerry realized that having fun with food is enhanced by learning about it, and nothing is gained by keeping that learning secret. <br />Buy this book. Make some ice cream, and enjoy it. And make sure you pass on the recipe to anyone who asks.
B00004W52U|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I own. Here's a 1-10 scale for all of the songs.<br />1.Knowledge- 9/10- Great punk song. Green Day did a cover of this song that's pretty cool too. No ska though.<br />2.Sound System- 9.5/10- The first ska song on the CD, and it's great. Good lyrics.<br />3.Jaded- 9.5/10- This is a really great song. Great speed, great lyrics, and great ENERGY!<br />4.Take Warning- 10/10- The only reggae song on the album and it's AWESOME<br />5.The Crowd- 10/10- best \\"no ska\\" song on the album.<br />6.Bombshell- 9.5/10- This is a really fast energetic punk songs. It clocks in at an amazing 1:03!!!<br />7.Unity- 9/10- Very catchy. Awesome lyrics, and Jesse sounds like he's rappin' old skool.  This is most people's favorite, but I think it's way overrated.<br />8.Vulnerability- 8.5/10- I think this song is underated. It's fast and catchy.<br />9.Bankshot- 10/10- best instrumental EVER<br />10.One Of These Days- 9/10- this is a great, short cover song<br />11.Gonna Find You- 10/10- Great song, great lyrics, it's what Op Ivy's all about.<br />12.Bad Town- 6.5/10- Only song with horns, and it's good. It's a bit too long for it's own good though. Lint sings.<br />13.Smiling-10/10- very catchy chorus. VERY true lyrics.<br />14.Caution-8.5/10- The sound qualities poor, but I think that actually makes the song better.<br />15.Freeze Up-10/10- Probably the best lyrics on the CD, and it's a great ska song.<br />16.Artificial Life-9/10- Not the greatest ska song on the CD, but it's catchy, and the lyrics are humorous.<br />17.Room Without a Window-10/10- really grows on you. Awesome reggae bridge too.<br />18.Big City-10/10- One of the best choruses on the album.  You can tell that Jesse put a lot of thought in these lyrics.  Great metaphors<br />19.Missionary-8.5/10- It definently grows on you, but the first few listens it's not that great. Begginning sounds like Blitzkrieg Bop by the Ramones.<br />20.Junkie's Runnin' Dry-9.5/10-Etremely awesome chorus. ENERGY!<br />21.Here We Go Again-10/10- The line \\"If that's what they call normal, than I'd rather be insane\\" is yet more proof of how great Jesse is at writing lyrics.<br />22.Hoboken-9.5/10- PURE hardcore punk.<br />23.Yelling in my ear-9.5/10- Great chorus<br />24.Sleep Long-9/10- you can't really understand a word said, but hey, you got the lyrics book, right?  The chorus is really good.<br />25.Healthy Body/Sick Mind-10/10- PURE ska.  I don't hear much punk, but it's awesome.<br />26.Officer-9.5/10- Easy, but great bass line, and awesome lyrics. It swears a lot but it's still meaningful.<br />27.I Got No-9.5/10- The poor sound quality turns some people off, but it's really a great song.<br />So that's it, all 27 songs that you'll never stop listening to. Even the worst songs still make me want to go skankin' across my room.<br />Note:  I update my reviews sometimes because I change my mind a lot.
B00004SGNM|2.0|Alas the SACD reissue is aweful.  Apparently the engineer who worked on this reissue must not have cared for Cyndi's voice because it is mixed way too low in comparison to the instruments.   I consider &quot;Time After Time&quot; to be one of the ten best pop tunes of the 80's.  Listening to the muffled and often difficult to hear vocal track on the SACD version was enough to make me feel like I'd wasted my money and things don't get much better then that on the rest of this disk.<br />Hopefully there will be a SACD release of this album some day that does it justice.  For now, just say no and stick with the standard edition.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Ignore the rants from hateful types here, this is a moving &quot;folk&quot; album in the best sense.  A man and a guitar, filled with history, loss and woe.  It's gutsy for someone of his age and health to embark on this album - some of the songs are more successful than others, but HURT, I HANG MY HEAD and others will rank amongst his best.  Recommended highly for Johnny Cash lovers and country music purists.
B00000JNO2|5.0|This is by far my most favorite Skynyrd album. It is most definitely the most underrated. I also feel that if you are a fan of the band, you should spell the band's name and the members' names correctly. In response to the person who wrote: &quot;The wonderful Allen Collins lead guitar sound on &quot;Gimme back my Bullets&quot; is just A1-pure unadulterated Skynyrd too (how DID he get it?). &quot; He didn't play the lead on the song Gimme Back my Bullets. Gary Rossington did. Anytime you hear that wailing, mournful guitar tone in a Skynyrd song, it's Gary, not Allen. Allen has a clearer, Clapton-esque sound. Try watching &quot;Freebird, the movie&quot; if you don't believe me. I agree that the original CD is lacking clarity in the mix. That's why I am purchasing the re-mastered CD. Oh BTW, there is NO filler on this album. Calling any of the songs on this album &quot;mediocre&quot; borders on blasphemy!
0930289528|5.0|This is one of the greatest graphic novels of all time, just as good as Watchmen and Dark Knight returns. In England in the late 90's that has been altered by war, the country is led by a corrupt leader and an even more corrupt police force. Then one man (or woman) changes it forever. V, a masked man destroys what took years to make, seeking revenge on those who tortured him in a camp. He takes a young girl in under his wing while a troubled police officer tries desperatly to track him down. <br />This book is incredible, after a while as you realize who the true villian is, you start to see V's mask as his real face. Gradually you learn his true origin.This book is very dark though, not for young readers, be at least 12 or 13 when you read it, but read it. It is and excellent book that every comic fan should read
B00004W52U|5.0|i heard this album for the first time when i was 14 and now i'm in my mid-20's and it is still one i listen to all the time.  this is an album that you can never get tired of- believe me, it's been one of my favorites for over 10 years.  like i said, if you don't own this album, there's something wrong with you.
0385486804|4.0|Over the summer after the 7th grade, I started to read a book called Into the Wild.  But I was never really the kind of person that could actually sit down and really read; I always had to be doing something active, so I never finished reading it.  Then this past summer I found the book and decided that since I had nothing better to do, I would give it another try.  I can't remember every little detail, but I do remember that it was really the only book I have ever read that actually made me think.  It's a true story about a guy who was smart, and was heading towards a successful future.  But to him, something was missing.  He didn't have a great relationship with his father; he didn't have a girlfriend, or even many friends.  So he decided he would go \\"into the wild\\", maybe to find something he was looking for.  His journey took him into a forest in Alaska, and after several days he died there.  Later his journal and camera were found, that included a picture of an old abandon buss he had been living in. This book had a profound effect on me, because I really started to understand that you can have everything and still be unhappy, or you can be fortunate and still want more out of life.  Even though his decision to leave his life and the people that loved him may have seemed selfish, I found myself respecting what he was trying to do.  Of course that doesn't mean I would make the same decisions, but it definitely gave me a new perspective.
B000083C49|4.0|Though this is certainly a very good movie, my favorite is Wrath of Khan.  The one sore point here is I think IV has the worst score of any of the films with the original cast.<br />I have no problems with the DVD, and this is really in answer to stinky-but-nice's Feb 15 review.  He is concerned about missing footage, but this must be a misprint in the official advertising and the box details,  I have the DVD and rest assired, all 119+ minutes are there.  So go buy it already/
B00005JLF5|5.0|Star Trek Deep Space Nine is without question the best Trek ever made. There is no question about that. I believe Nemisis would not have tanked had the characters from DS9 been in that film. They were the best Trek Series ever. It brought a dark element to Star Trek that showed for the first time that Space was a hostile frontier, a series that reflects our own contemporary history and society. Its the coolest and it gets better. The first season you get your feet wet but when the second season hits its like a tidal wave that does not subside.
0930289234|4.0|Though it is an excellent story this book didn't really interest me until later issues. Though I do respect it, it is definetly not as good as V for Vendetta.<br />In an altered reality where heros are outlawed, one that has been retired for years is suddenly and mysteriously killed. Now Five of his teamates come out of retirment to track down the killer, while America slowy slips into the brink of war.<br />It's good, and should be read, But nowhere near as good as people say it is.
0792841344|5.0|This was the film that turned me on to the whole horror scene. I own 4 different releases of it....original VHS......new release VHS......DVD....and the limited release Laser Disc....I don't even own a laser disk player anymore. I love it!<br /><br />I was so glad when they finally released this awesome film on DVD. It's loaded with cool features....always a plus. After all these years it still holds up the test of time. I first watched Phantasm when I was a youth (5).....yep, very open minded parents......no sex or nudity for me (had to turn my head), but violent death was a family outing. I'm looking forward to Phan 2 being released on DVD....in Europe 1-4 are already in a DVD box set or should I say sphere. Even though Phan 2 is my least favorite of the 4 I still want it in my collection. Loyalty to a true genius (the production of that film was out of Coscarelli's hands). There is much more to the orginal Phantasm than on this DVD. Originally it was a 3 hour movie, alot was cut (Rumored). There is actually a version that was made for some of the people involved in the making of this film where everything was edited back in. They did a very good job at it from what I hear. Perhaps someday we'll get a taste of that one.<br /><br />Some of the unused footage was used in the making of Phan 4. It really added to the over all atmosphere of that film.<br /><br /> Check out my Oblivion(Phan 4) review to see how I believe it was perfect closure for the Phantasm story. (definately a rewinder)
068484267X|5.0|My book is called Angela's Ashes, it is by Frank McCourt. I found my book very interesting, because it was rough to learn that they were so poor. I really liked the spirit Frankie and his family had for Ireland and their heritage. I agreed with Frankie about how the most miserable childhood is the Irish childhood, and worse yet the Irish Catholic childhood. Sometimes things would get so bad to the point were he thought he couldn't go on. I felt that Ireland is somewhat similar to what America was once, when we were divided into the Confederacy and the Union. It angered me to read about how everyone was critical about people, and where they were from. For example on page 247 Frank said, &quot;She calls me scabby eyes, she says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an alter to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family.&quot; It seemed as if most Irish people were biased where the McCourts lived, they were so particular. In addition, I didn't understand why even just one person would be smart enough to not drink or smoke. And why didn't anyone even limit the number of drinks a person could have? I felt really sorry for all the people of Limerick because not only were they in poverty, but also they were so unhappy from getting drunk too often. <BR> In Angela's Ashes the theme or message that the author was trying to portray was to make the best of your situation and be happy with it. Frank and his brothers were so excited when they got a piece of toffee or went to the Lyric Cinema; it seemed to me like it was the best thing in the world to them. I definitely agree with that. I feel it's so important to make everything special regardless of how horrible the conditions. This book doesn't relate to my life, but I learned so much from it like about how what life is like for people with a completelydifferent childhood than mine. There seemed to always be one more challenge or problem that Frank had to face, which I had never had to deal with. As I read more I became more thankful for the little things that came upon him, and for what I have experienced growing up. <BR> I would recommend this book to people who can handle reading anything sad, and have an interest in other cultures. This book was very well written and realistic. I became involved in it, and couldn't stop reading. This book, Angela's Ashes, is a great true story.
B00004SC3M|5.0|This movie was excellent, definately the best \\"caper\\" film out there in my opinion.  Sean Connery's performance is his usual, non-entusiastic, but for some reason, still captivating.  Catherine Zeta-Jones gives the sexiest performance of her career (thus far).  The story is absolutely amazing, with betrayal, plot twists, and a suprise ending.  Plus, the capers are unbelievably fun to watch.  If you like action, a good plot, mystery, suspense or anything along those lines, why are you still reading this??? BUY IT NOW!
B000002I25|5.0|Really i find it quite impossible to imagine a rock album more fascinating,more magical,more powerful,more inspiring than this one.This is the best rock album ever,this is the real rock,this is the art of music!Needless to say that you have to buy it.As a matter of fact you are obliged to own this masterpiece!!!!!
0783229100|5.0|I would say the only thing 'special edition' about this tape is it comes included with a 'pictured cd with Robert Redford and Paul Newman',the cd/cd-rom is shaped like a 'playing card',not your standard circle rounded disc. Great movie,great sound (THX Sound).
B000002897|5.0|Grunge (the only time you'll see that word for the rest of this review).  This a classic rock album. Absolutely no filler on this album, every song is bursting with energy and emotion. The sound is a nice blend of hard rock and 70's era psychedelica with very soothing (bluesy?)vocals. Recommeded if you like: Mountain, Skynard, Meat Puppets, Stones, early Aerosmith, Deep Purple, Pearl Jam.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm most impressed by the stunning range of Amy's voice  -- at times it is angelic, pure and clear -- yet at others she sounds slightly gravelly and a touch angsty, almost like Shirley Manson (of Garbage).  I can't think of a single other singer whose voice possesses the purity of someone like say, Sarah Maclachlan as well as a more Manson-like rich, textured sound. Incredible versatility.<br />The instrumentals and arrangements are also excellent. <br />The rock/guitar riffs at times are truly invigorating -- the opening/guitar theme to 'Whisper', the guitar interlude towards the end of 'Imaginary'<br />Ethereal pads/effects, angelic background vocals in many songs provide a nice contrast to the metal-rock basis of the band.<br />There are some extraordinary piano moments also, such as in 'My Immortal' and 'Hello'.<br />'Going Under', my personal favorite, is pretty pop, and undeniably catchy...expertly mixed, with breathtaking contrast between the harsh/glorious moments of the song, as well as the fantastic opening which reveals the sexy depth of Amy Lee's voice.<br />'Tourniquet' has some beautiful electro-industrial moments reminiscent of Garbage, as well as hauntingly dark lyrics. I find myself wishing there were a bit more of the electronic touch, as these moments are usually breif, both here and in 'My Last Breath'.<br />There is an obvious spiritual undertone to many of the songs, which some might write off as 'Christian Rock' -- this would be a grave mistake, however. The spiritual message in Evanescence's music is refreshing -- englightening without being preachy. And because the spiritual songs in the album are sung in the first person, a personal psychological and spiritual journery is implied rather than proselytism.<br />All around, fantastic album and superbly talented group.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this DVD - Would be nice if a sequel comes out.  Want to see more.  I would love to see how everybody turned out, especially Mr. Darcey.  Do wish there had been a little more interaction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcey though - it went a little too fast between their love and hate relationship.  It is a great series - still wish there was more time for more acquaintance for everyone.
B00006ADGQ|5.0|John Carpenter's sci-fi 'Dark Star'(1971),comes in hi-fi sound,and is 85 minutes long. Pretty good movie,if you like movies like 'Attack of the killer tomatoes',pretty b-type movie.
B000002HPV|5.0|I was always too cautious of Bjork it seemed to ever give her a real chance.  Well, at first I always disliked electronic music, for no good reason really.  I thought it was always souless compared to guitar based music, and as much as I would get the nagging suspicion that maybe I was missing out on something when I heard things like Bjork, Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, or Chemical Brothers, I would push the nagging suspicion out of my head just as strongly.  Also, I like many others probably thought her too strange and eccentric to even give her a chance.  When I first saw the video for &quot;Human Behaivior,&quot; I was almost literally scared by the bizzare imagery and music of Bjork's.  Later, I remember them premiering a track of this album, I'm not even sure which one, but as I listened to whichever off-kilter song it was, I was thinking &quot;Boy, she must've gone off the deep end.&quot;<br />Yeah, and all the better that she did.  When my sensibilities finally changed (mostly due to Radiohead's OK Computer) and I decided I WAS missing out on something, I picked this CD up on a whim, wanting to make the plunge into Bjork's music head-first.  At that time I was already pretty well-versed in Massive Attack and Aphex Twin, so I thought I knew what to expect.  Wrong.  She surprised me in the best possible ways.  While the staccato beat behind songs like &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;Pluto&quot; were instantly familiar to an Aphex afficiando, her voice gave it more warmth, personality, and heart than those songs could ever have (not that their coldness is a bad thing, like apples and oranges).  Her soaring vocals on tracks like &quot;Joga&quot; and &quot;All Neon Like&quot; were absolutely heavenly.  With my personal favorite &quot;Bachelorette,&quot; however, she knocked over any expectations I had for her music and any electronic music since.  Climatic strings build up over probably the most passionate song about love and respect I've ever heard, and the way the beat practically deconstructs gives the song the push it needed to make it classic.<br />In my opinion, she has one of the best voices and musical talents in the industry, along with Thom Yorke's.  This album just certifies her ability at making compelling, original music.  Like me, you may have the preconception that this is too &quot;out there&quot; or that you may &quot;not get into it&quot; or that it's &quot;too souless.&quot;  But let me put it simply: If you have any interest in the future of music, or any love for the artform, Bjork is the artist to get into.  When we look back on this period in music, she will be one of the few that will be recognized as defining it.
B000002TLX|5.0|I am 19, so i vaguely remember Richard Marx when he was at him prime.  His songs, however, are still played on various radio stations, so I decided to pick this album up.  This is a great album, with some of the best slow jams of our time, in my opinion.  With his great 80's hits &quot;Right here waiting,&quot; &quot;hold on the the nights&quot; and &quot;endless summer nights&quot; and a few from the nineties, namely &quot;now and forever&quot; (my new all time favorite song) this cd is great to listen to when you are with a boy/girl friend (or husband/wife).  Richard Marx has a great voice, and is an excellent songwriter (yes he wrote &quot;this i promise you&quot; and he's writing songs for Nich Lachey's (of 98degrees) solo album)and this cd is highly recommended to anyone who is fan of easy rock or pop music.
B00006690G|5.0|This CD is the best from Eminem yet. I actually like every song on this CD, especially Haley's Song.
B00007GZQI|4.0|Yes, this is a dated piece of psychadelic fluffery.  The question is, though, is it worth the 90 minutes it takes to get through?  I think the answer is yes.  The first time I saw this film (repeatedly) was in college, where it was a film that I believed the University Film Series owned.  They had a tendancy to show this with Yellow Submarine and the Monkee's tres psychadelic film Head, so I associate it with those two films.  It is extremely eposodic, but I do think that's the point.  If you want to watch it now in drips and drabs, it's entirely possible.  As a curio of the psychadelic era, one can do much worse than this film, and the point (and it does have one) is made very clearly.  Some of the sketches have turned up in other, later films--it's something you can find for yourself.<br />A note--one of the other reviews mentioned \\"2 Beatles appearing in the film and one singing.\\"  This is not correct (although Pete Ham of Badfinger does sound remarkably like McCartney).  The songs are mostly by Badfinger, with the exception during the last scene of \\"Something in the Air\\" by Thunderclap Newman (whose guitarist eventually went on to play with Wings).  The shot of Lennon is either from a film clip (like that of Onassis & Jackie) or a stand-in (it goes by VERY quickly)  This is definitely Ringo's film!
B000002HJD|5.0|it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of morrison's poetry for this generation. while many dismiss him as a mere by product of the chaotic and revolutionary time in which he lived, this eloquent album should put aside such cynical doubts and reveal him for what he was:a genius and an artist. it was not drugs that fueled jim morrison, nor alcohol, although he was heavily addicted to both:it was a spiritual quest for something beyond the material. we should judge poetry, particularly spoken word poetry, by the feelings and impressions we receive when listening or reading, not by the individual's lifestyle, biographical details, etc. james douglas morrison was not a myth, but a flesh and blood human being who suffered, hoped and had flaws just like the rest of us. his primary aim in this particular masterpiece seems to have been, (it could be argued that this was what he pushed for his entire life, perhaps a little too hard to the detriment of his emotional and physical well being) to wake us up, to insist that we recognize the wonder inherent in life and terror inherent in that wonder. \\"do you know we exist, have you forgotten the keys to the kingdom, have you been born yet and are you alive?\\" his obscenity (\\"lament\\") is not gratuitous or merely vulgar but is employed for this same purpose. although morrison knew the emotion of nihilism, the feeling usually unique to artists/sensitive/intelligent people, that existence is an incomprehensible mass and ultimately without purpose or meaning, he also knew moments of transcendence (\\"Gently they stir, gently rise\\") and poetic beauty.  He was not a drugged out punk who got his kicks from pissing people off.  He had the same heart as an Oscar Wilde, Nietzsche, or Rimbaud.  He deserves to be buried where is.  Listen and find out for yourself.
0385474547|2.0|This is the second time that I have read Things Fall Apart and I didnt like it any better this time. Although the book incorporates two very important concepts, hubris and the unability to grow and change with society, I still found the book boring and difficult to read. I definately wont be reading this one a third time.
B00004ST9Q|4.0|This DVD chronicles Whitney's career to innocent, pure-voiced ingenue to slick modern superstar with a penchant for being in the tabloids.<br />It opens up with the excellent \\"You Give Good Love\\" and through the songs presented here you can watch Whitney grow up. You can also see her star status rise to new heights as Whitney becomes a movie star with \\"The Bodyguard\\". There are definity shifts in her fame and style, and these can be witnessed here. For example, the first shift is felt upon hearing (and seeing) the first few bars of \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\"... But then the musical risks and independent style she was taking with \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" are superseded by her mega success with \\"The Bodyguard\\", where she shouts full-blown corporate love songs.<br />There's a whole lot of slick urbane songs and videos here, Whitney has not always been musically adventurous, but there are interesting songs here and there, nearly all dealing with affairs of the heart and their ensuing complications. We see that her fame has heavily relied on the power of her clear, steely voice.<br />The best Special Feature is Whitney's first live TV performance of \\"Home\\" on The Merv Griffin Show. It shows a side of Whitney rarely seen- nervous, naive, unaware of her future, yet a genuine revelation to those watching- Merv introduces an young unknown and after the performance knows that he has just introduced a superstar...Her voice is in perfect form here, singing an exceptional song in an exceptional performance.<br />Other great live performances include \\"Didn't We Almost Have it All\\", \\"One Moment in Time\\" at the Grammys and \\"Why Does it Hurt So Bad?\\", the latter a fine performance though Whitney's voice is a bit rough and she sweats profusely. There are other performances included, though they are not career-defining or her best. Missing are many other great live performances e.g. \\"Saving All My Love For You\\" from the Grammys, \\"Greatest Love of All\\" in New York and many others.<br />There is also an interview with Whitney and her then-record company honcho, Clive Davis. Plus an extended photo shoot session featuring Clive. Who knew that this DVD also marked the end of her working relationship with Clive. So basically, these are the Clive Years. It chronicles their achievements and illustrates Clive's influence on her music.
B00008BXJF|5.0|King Crimson enter 2003 with the most amazing album, truly one of their all-time best five.<BR>It combines heavy metallic powerful pieces with beautiful transcendental music, all united by what have been called Belew's \\"musical haikus.\\" <BR>It opens up with the album's theme a cappella and then soars into the most yet powerful and mind-blowing version of Level Five. The drumming is especially amazing on this piece and together with Fripp's soloing and Trey Gunn's superb bass completely charges one up. Lyrical \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" soothes the listener after such a mean masterpiece. This is definitely a Belew's song and it is beautiful. \\"Facts of Life\\" is a heavy metal song by KC that is completely brand-new and absolutely grooves and rocks. Transcendental \\"The power to believe II\\" is one of my absolute favorites. It has evolved from Level 5's \\"Virtuous Circle\\" from \\"Level Five\\" and takes into a completely different wordl. It has Eastern feel to it and is rich wiht different mystical sounds and grooves. The voice in this track is also beautiful and adds to the richness of the song.  \\"Dangerous Curves\\" is even more powerful than on \\"Level Five.\\" \\"Happy\\" is another heavy track soaring wiht power. It is followed wiht \\"Power to Believe III\\" that has evolved (it seems to me) from \\"Deception of the Thrush.\\" The perfect closing piece on the album is \\"The Power to Believe IV: COda\\" re-stating the theme and offering the perfect conclusion to the musical journey undertaken by the listener.<BR>I personally absolutely love this album and cannot wait till hearing the guys live.<BR>The quality of sound is oustanding as well.<BR>In conclusion, this is an amazing album that is an absolute MUST for any Music Fan.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones is a seductive interpreter of these songs. Funky, torchy, some just plain fun, take your pick. Her voice is easy to listen to. It has a way of growing on you after a few listenings. Moody and sensuous, the rhythms and feel of this disk are enchanting. Put it on when you're with someone you like a lot. Have a glass of wine or something from a brandy snifter. There's not another pop recording on the market that can match it in that setting. The instrumentation is sparse, in a good way. Guitar, piano, violin, accordian (!!) sexy, soft and gentle, weave their way in and out of Jones' vocals. The accompaniments don't get in the way. But this is really all Norah's outing. The musicians are true accompanists. I wouldn't call this jazz. It has more of a pop feel to it, but damn it's good.

B00006F83Y|5.0|Fans of Kyuss and Gamma Ray will recognize names on on this album. It is a tribute to what rock/metal should have been. From the primitive (though enjoyable) sounds of early Metallica, to the gritty sounds of early Soundgarden and the raw sound of Nirvana, &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; represents what rock and roll should have been if the revolution in music of the early 90s hadn't lost momentum. We now live in an age where the music industry is confused, kind of like when MC Hammer and Warrant shared hits on the top 10.  QOTSA is independent of this hypocrisy.<br />To top it all off, Dave Grohl (from, ah hem, Foo Fighters and of course Nirvana) is *drumming* on this album, and he manages to convince anyone that all of his hours playing axe for the Foo haven't taken an ounce of skill from his drumming hands.  He is truly superhuman.  <br />Josh Homme combines his bluesy styles from early Kyuss and brings in new metal sounds with wierd rythms and odd tunings to create a gritty guitar sound. Nick Oliveri compliments all musicians in the band with nifty bass lines that are reminiscent of RHCP's Flea. Dave Catching (from Screaming Trees) rounds out the band.  The general effect is some ripping metal combined with lucid moments of intense and beautiful harmony, all of it well blended and symmetric.<br />There are many other albums to sample and enjoy from this truly original and dynamic band.  Check out &quot;Rated R&quot; and their self-titled albums.  Also, for fans who are simultaneously emphatic about Kyuss, Gamma Ray, and QOTSA, look for anything that says &quot;Desert Sessions&quot; on it, because it involves Josh Homme and many others experimenting with nifty sounds.
6303168507|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie! I've read the book about Oskar Schindler and about every part that was in the book was in the movie. Though I must warn you, this is such a disturbing yet wonderful masterpiece. Children are shot dead in the streets, families seperated and everything else you could imagine. This movie is definitely recommende, if your of age though.
0375704027|5.0|Very nice book. It tells, in a very delicate and sensitive way, the story of a Young japanese boy getting out of his teens and going into adulthood. Life is hard, it is very tough to assume responsibilities and to measure one's reach towards other people. Although there is not very uncommon about this boy's life, it is also very unique in the sense that all his emotions and experiences are his own and no one else's. Not very different from ourselves, anywhere in the world. This book is full of common life day to day poetry. Highly recommended.

B00005JLSC|4.0|Six years ago I saw Neuwirth and Reinking on Broadway and was blown away. I didn't want to see this movie because they cast hollywood instead of broadway stars and because I just didn't think it would translate well onto the big screen. I was pleasantly surprised. True, this show isn't for everyone. It's not plot-heavy. If you're into action it's not going to thrill you. But those of us who like Kander and Ebb musicals will actually like this film.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Like most I heard and liked, &quot;Don't know Why&quot; and had to buy this CD.  Every song is great.  She sings like no other - mellow - background music - i cannot wait for her next CD.  She is great not like the half-wit singers we have been listening to of late!  Enjoy this new singer - she will only get better and better.
B00004T37H|5.0|The visual effects were awesome and breathtaking.  This movie wasn't your average run of the mill character undeveloped movie.  The movie has a lot of symbolism and has a deep message that pertains to all.  The action was amazing.  If you are a fan of Japanimation this movie is absolutely right for you.
B00005QDW1|2.0|First of all, I'd like to point out that I am a huge No Doubt fan. They have released four great albums, peaking in 2000 with the tragically underrated Return of Saturn. However, that was the last album No Doubt released.<br />Rock Steady is not a No Doubt album.<br />That being said, Rock Steady offers some fine pop to new listeners.<br />For anyone who loved the No Doubt of old, stay away--<BR>There are only 2 songs that sound remotely like the real band on here. These songs are Don't Let Me Down and Platinum Blonde Life.<BR>Download them.<br />The rest of the album is a hybrid of dancehall, reggae, and electro-pop experiments. The heavier tracks work quite well, such as the edgy and fierce \\"Hella Good\\", the moody \\"Detective\\", and the quirky \\"In My Head\\". Though sounding nothing like No Doubt, these  songs are quite engaging and are worthy of mention.<br />Unfortunately the rest of the album is a mess: No Doubt spent a little too much time in Jamaica. The reggae/dancehall influence is used haphazardly on the bland single \\"Underneath It All\\", the highly irritating \\"Start the Fire\\", and the title track, which happens to be one of the most mundane pieces recorded in the band's history. The band sound entirely out of their element. It would be the equivalent of Nirvana experimenting with salsa. You get the idea.<br /> \\"Hey Baby\\" requires furthur listening, however. At first it is quite annoying, yet listening closely it become evident that the song is a carefully constructed piece containing networks of loops and strange sound effects intertwined. For all their Jamaican experimentation, \\"Hey Baby\\" is the most promising result.<br />Those are the high and low points of the album.<BR>Other tracks include the dippy, Toyland ballad \\"Running\\", the monotonous party song \\"Making Out\\", and the horrible \\"Waiting Room\\", the lovechild of the unfortunate pairing of Gwen and Prince.<br />I'd say this album is decent for an ordinary pop album. As it sounds nothing like a No Doubt album, I am forced to rate this album on the ordinary scale. I give it 2 1/2 stars, but since that option isn't available I will give it just 2. A fair album, but not worth buying. ... Save your money.
B0000029GA|5.0|If you don't have it, buy it, enough said.
B00004U8P9|5.0|this movie is the perfect example of a movie that isnt for isnt for everyone. i am one of those movie followers of movies no one knows of or only freaks and romantics enjoy. Like, Newsies, RHPS, monty python and the holy grail, and Cheats. (all very, very different movies)....<br />Rocky horror is an invader of the mind, it can drive you crazy and no matter how much you hate it, you can still love the movie. its kind of like the first time you learn to (review approprite:) \\"kill a kitten\\". Its a new, wierd, wacky( very wacky...hahaha) expereince. and You will always return to see it again. it invades your mind. the music controls you.<br />a good friend of mine, Jimbo, just went to a midnight showing the other day as brad. anyways,  he has been \\"brutally mauled\\" by this movie, basicly. before becoming mega-obbsessed with this movie, he was a quiet, depressed, un-jacked freshman. afterwords, he is stranger beyond belief. <br />This movie is the biggest cult, and one of the most easily understandable cult-movies. ive already been drawn into this movie, and it has helped pull me out of depression. this movie is one of the best movies ever. and annother thing, you can get drunk off this movie, and be swimming in a pool of your beliefs. you can be who you want to be. you shouldnt have to worry what others think. <br />to summarize this: EXCELLENT MOVIE!! go rent, see or buy this movie RIGHT now.
B000083C49|5.0|The Special Edition is 118 minutes. I've seen this movie a few times, and I believe in the Special Edition has a few prolonged scenes. Spock's computer test, Kirk's travel from the bridge to free Scotty and Gillian after the ship crashed in the water, seeing Scotty and Gillian travel towards the bridge to escape,and a couple of others. A grand total of perhaps 10-30 seconds of added footage.Of course, the Special features disk is incredible. About 3 / to 4 hours long of Star Trek IV behind the scenes info and interviews to fill your Trek thirst until the next Edition comes out.
B00005JKZT|1.0|I can't believe how much this movie was ruined. The book was pretty good, but the movie stunk. There are too many boring parts and the movie is too hard to follow. If you have trouble sleeping, this movie will put you right to bed. Don't waste three and a half hours of your life watching this boring  movie.
B00001IVOF|5.0|The Infamous and Hell on Earth Albums are flawless.  Mobb Deep has never stopped bringin what they got to say raw to the public. I heard every song the had ever made.  Their style is unique; Havoc has kept it real with his beats.  His beats are pure original.  It seems QBC and its rapper's are veterans when it come to producing some ill music.  They dont get the respect they should.  They arent main stream like these other rappers who rap about what people wanna hear.  They speak the truth and most people can't handle it; you feel me?  On the real Queens Bridge keeps bringin it raw.  Just to name a few Nas, CNN, Tragedy Khadafi, 50 cent, Cormega, Nayshawn, Nature and kool g rap among others are on another level.  Listen to these N*ggas and you'll understand what I'm sayin.
B00003CXI1|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME- IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE LORD OF THE RINGS. THERE IS HUMOR, MYSTERY, SUSPENCE, AND A UNIQUE AND ORIGINAL STORYLINE. THIS MOVIE PULLS YOU INTO HARRY'S WONDEROUS WORLD, AND CAPTURES YOUR HEART. GO BUY THIS MOVIE NOW!
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is truly a match made in Heaven; beautiful classic music and incredible animation, and now on DVD...I saw this as a child, only five years old, but I remember it vividly, and how fascinated I was throughout the entire movie. Of course, the dinosaur segment scared me (oddly enough, \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" did not...)at the end of the movie, during the \\"Ave Maria\\" sequence, dazed and infused with the powerul, haunting images and sound, I asked my mother \\"What happened then?\\" And she said \\"The World was born, and then you were born, and everything was all right.\\" I have had more than one occasion to remember those words, with a terrible longing to go back in time. I loved the \\"Dance of the Hours\\", the ballerina hippos, the Centaurs, and Bacchus being set upon by Thor, Zeus, the various gods, and the beauty of Night coming, after the storm, after the sunset, and the Goddess of Hunting, Diana, shooting her arrow into the sky and thousands of stars appearing; and she (Night) was a wonderfully soothing image, and also reminded me of my own bedtime and my mother tucking me in, safe for the night and safe from the storm; would that that were still true today!!!! This is the essential Disney DVD; along with Snow White and Dumbo and Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and 101 Dalmatians...a must for your DVD library.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This movie is awesome- no words can desribe how great it is. The Chamber of Secrets is better than The Lord of the Rings, which is a boring movie. There is comedy, and lots more excitement everywhere you turn. The ending of the movie is a big twist, and is very heart pounding. This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. I will never get tired of the movie! Go and get it now!!
B000002UA0|5.0|Syd Barrett is not a simple man. He is the man who started Pink Floyd. He is a mythical figure who started a cult. Therefore it is inappropriate to dismiss this album as a bad one merely because it doesn't fit in with one's view of what Pink Floyd is (if one happens to think Pink Floyd is 'The Wall' and 'The Dark Side Of The Moon').<br />'The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn' is the first album by Pink Floyd, and the most experimental, psychedelic and innovative. The atmosphere of the album is kind of detached, cosmic, the band is not with you, the music is not about you, nor is it for you, it simply is. This album is like looking in a madman's mind - horrifying and fascinating at the same time, the music has a life of its own, there is something unearthy and eerie about it, and it can go infinitely deeper. 'The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn' embodies a time of change, the very moment that is the present.<br />And I couldn't not give this album 5 stars - not if it has 'Interstellar Overdrive' and 'Bike' in it...
B00005JL95|1.0|This is a very non-Disney movie if you ask me.  Besides having a very odd story line, this movie has encouraged my 3-year-old son to hit/punch/bite (because Lilo does) and use the word \\"stupid.\\"  I had to hide the DVD so he can't watch it anymore.  I definitely don't recommend this movie!
B000005JA8|1.0|I cannot believe that I'm listening to the same album that everyone else is.  This thing was terrible!  Where did all of these 5-star reviews come from?  This must be some kind of joke - I heard about it from an art student, and mayhap this is a dadaist prank, but that doesn't make it good music.
B000084T18|5.0|Ja has beef with everyone, but he will never compare to DMX or 50 Cent. 50's beats are HOT!!! I love this CD and I listen to it almost everyday. It takes a great rap artist to get females to buy your CD, and I had to buy it after I heard \\"In Da Club\\".  He is the best thing out there(...)
B00003CX95|5.0|Just brilliant from the acting to the directing.<BR>Best Film of the century for me. Romatically none of this happend of course but Mel Gibson will be praised by the Scots for the true portrayal of the english.
B00000612P|5.0|One of Rod's (With Small Faces) Early albums. Excellent remaster, a must to get, worth it for the sound. Great Great Great.
B00005OAIE|1.0|I could have been force-fed broken glass.  I could have walked on hot coals for a mile straight.  I could have watched the Fox News Channel for over 2 hours straight.  Any of those experiences would have been better than listening to this drivel.<br />I went to a party the other night and someone had this album playing on the stereo.  I cannot overemphasize how horrible this album is; how in the world this won a Grammy award is beyond me.  When I first heard &quot;No Such Thing&quot; way back during the summer, I thought he sounded like Dave Matthews, only with the serial numbers filed off.<br />&quot;Room For Squares&quot; needs to be retitled to &quot;Dumpster For Squares,&quot; because that's where someone needs to put Mayer.
B000089RVX|5.0|The music's driving beats were inspired. I have been looking forward to this album since buying the Daredevil soundtrack and it has definitely exceeded my expectations. If this group can continue to produce music of this caliber they will be around for a very, very long time.
0790731002|2.0|The third chapter in the &quot;Batman&quot; series is without a doubt, a shame for all the superhero fans. The first thing that you can notice is that &quot;Batman Forever&quot; seems to be made for children. The dark essence of the comic is replaced by the goofy style of the 1960s TV show. And that's a bad thing, because the TV show was a spoof of the comics. On the other hand, the first two movies &quot;Batman (1989)&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns (1992)&quot; really reflected the comic.      Bur Tim Burton was not here anymore, neither was Michael Keaton, and neither is the fun of the two previous movies. In this film, the Gotham City superhero is now Val Kilmer, a stiff and way too serious Val Kilmer, I must say. Also we can find Tommy Lee Jones as &quot;Two-Face&quot;, in perhaps his worst role in his fine career, and Jim Carrey as &quot;the Riddler&quot;. He played his part nicely and stole the show from the two superheroes and the other villain.      But the most interesting novelty in this mediocre film is the gorgeous Nicole Kidman as Batman's new love interest. If you are a fan of Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman or Batman, watch this movie, but probably you will only see this awful movie once.
B00008OOZ9|5.0|For all of you who've been waiting for the \\"new Nirvana\\" and didn't buy into the \\"garage band hype\\", the White Stripes have released the perfect album at the perfect time.  I've liked 'em for a while, but I never put much stock in them, partially because the lo-fi 2 person band seemed too much like a gimmick, and in my blindness, I often couldn't see past that. Well consider this a repentance of sorts. I couldn't think of a better band (or album) to lead the world of rock out of this overproduced melodramatic slump it's been in for so long. Granted, this \\"garage band revival\\" already has and will continue to provide us with loads of flash-in-the-pan style [singers] (see Mooney Suzuki, The Vines, The Music, etc.) but albums like \\"Elephant\\" will make it all worthwhile. Jack and Meg are back, with more vintage gear, organs, vocal harmonies, and *gasp* BASSLINES. But don't worry, they're still as scratchy and raunchy as ever.  I would go into detail about each particular song, but all you need to know is that THEY'RE ALL AMAZING. They've managed to pack all of the catchiness, lyrical brilliance, and energy of their previous 3 albums into one rock masterpiece. Jack White's guitar mastery comes out more than ever, without any ham-fisted 300-note solos. Remember how big guitars used to sound in the 70's? Yeah, well they're bigger now. This will undoubtedly go down as one of the top 10 rock albums of the decade. Get it any way you can, you need it.
B000088E6D|5.0|GREAT MUSIC,GREAT GREAT SOUND A GIFTED SINGER.       GOOD TO LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER. I CAUGHT HIS LIVE TV SINGING PERFORMANCES ON CANADA A.M. AND VICKI GABEREAU - THEY WERE FLAWLESS TOO. WHAT A TREAT TO SEE AND HEAR A YOUNG ARTIST WHO 'HAS THE WHOLE PACKAGE'. AND TO HEAR SOMEONE 'LIVE' SOUND SO INCREDIBLE JUST ADDS TO MY ADMIRATION FOR HIS TALENT     CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE
B00008HCCF|2.0|She's just as boring as ever in this new DVD. Granted, it's somewhat a testament to her talent, as she is able to smoothly lull listeners to sleep live just as well as on CD. But the material is just as flat and the style is just as draining. The most impressive thing about it is the fact that the soundman's mixes didn't have to be altered at all in the transfer to a market-ready product. Now that takes talent.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've never written of a review of a CD before, but that's because few have touched me as this one does.  I do not dislike one song.  How rare is that these days?  The entire album the WHOLE way through is a spectacular, beautiful blend of tender and heavy, and Amy Lees' voice.......AMAZING.<br />This is quite possibly the *BEST* CD I have ever heard.  As you can see by all of the other reviews this is DEFINITELY worth your money...the phrase 'no brainer' comes to mind.
B000089RVX|5.0|After hearing &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; on the Daredevil soundtrack, I knew that I must have this cd. Once I bought it, I managed to listen to it more than 10 times in a row. Each song has a unique feel to it that keeps you interested in every single track. Amy Lee is one of the first female rock singers that actually knows how to sing, not to mention that the lyrics and mixes are amazing and unique. I really enjoy how she encorporates different styles and voices in the background, techniques that add to the already great songs. There are a variety of types of songs, ranging from gothic rock to punk to soft and somber. I would recomment this cd to anyone who is either a fan of rock music like Linkin Park or Blindside, someone who enjoys really interesting mixes, or who just likes hearing a female singer who has real range and actual talent.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has hit the bullseye with \\"Come Away With Me\\" ... she is talented and I hope she continues making music like this for a long, long time.
0790733226|5.0|This is an incredible movie, by far on my top 10 list of my all time favorites.  I purchased this movie on DVD over a year ago, and I can't count how many times I have seen it.  Jodie Foster is majestic in this film.  She plays a very complex character, as per usual for Jodie, but this role suits her very well.  Throughout the enitre film you will be cheering her on, as you quickly realize she is the &quot;outcast&quot; of the scientific world.  The movie made me think of the possibilities, the &quot;what if's&quot; of the universe.<br />The overall message is faith and the power of believing in one's self, science, and the universe.  Because of this movie, I had to stop and think many times, about the power of faith.  The movie made me realize that we as humans are a tiny incriment of the universe.  Are we the only intelligent life in the universe?  Can faith and science coincide with one another?<br />Robert Z. is the perfect director for this.  Jodie was the PERFECT Ellie.  Robert pieced this enitre movie with such grace and precision, and Jodie was so realistic as Ellie.  Ellie challenged the normal views of the world, she grew as a person, she saw somewhat of a &quot;different light.&quot;  I truly loved this movie, and I reccomend it to everyone, even if they're not into sci-fi, that's only a fraction of the movie.  The message will strike you, the performances will amaze you, and you will think.
B000005JA8|1.0|I wish I knew the word for &quot;the opposite of masterpiece&quot; but that's what this is.  I have to say that this is quite possibly the worst album I've ever heard.  Absolutely unintelligible garbage.
B00003CWLF|4.0|A lot of flack was heaped on the release of this film in comparison to Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's musical &quot;The King &amp; I&quot; which is, itself a remake of &quot;Anna &amp; The King of Siam&quot; a 30's film with Rex Harrison and Irene Dunne.  I should like to point out that such comparisons are foolish.  Though all three movies deal with the subject of an English school teacher coming to Siam to educate the King's children, each has dealt with the topic on it own terms and merit.  <BR>In this version Jodie Foster is Anna Leonowens, the head strong British colonialist who sees into the heart of a king and grows perhaps too fond of him for her own stalwart romantic sensibilities.  <BR>FOX STUDIOS has done a beautiful job of capturing all the color, glamor and spectacle of Andy Tennant's beautiful film.  Colors on this DVD are robust, rich and vibrant.  Clarity is remarkable.  Though some pixelization and edge enhancement are present they never really intrude on the overall visual experience.  The 5.1 sound mix is incredibly lively and well balanced with a natural sounding fidelity that is most complimentary to the film.  Extras include a documentary and several featurettes (which are just edited down versions of the documentary - go figure) as well as the film's theatrical trailer and an audio commentary.   FINAL WORD: Highly recommended and well worth the money.
1573229725|5.0|Fingersmith is really a terrific read.  People shouldn't be daunted by the 500 plus pages, they go by almost too fast.  The constant plot twists leave the readers on their toes, not to mention the secrets of each of the characters.  If you're bored with reading verbose Dickensian works about love and work, then try Fingersmith out, it gets down to the grit of being a villain.
6305280762|2.0|By far the best of the seventies disaster epics. Steve McQueen is O'Halleran, the fire fighter who must save guests from an out of control, four alarm blaze terrorizing the world's tallest skyscraper. Paul Newman plays Doug Roberts, the guilt ridden architect who designed the fire trap.  His one comfort; none of the impending doom is the fault of his design, instead, the result of cost cutting and shoddy wiring approved by his boss, James Duncan (William Holden) and his contractor son-in-law (Richard Chamberlain). The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of Hollywood has-beens (O.J. Simpson, Susan Flannery), up and comers (Faye Dunaway, Dabney Colman) and a potpourri of old time studio talent(Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, Robert Vaughn), leading one critic to dub the movie \\"Grand Hotel in flames!\\"<BR>Director/producer Irwin Allen came down hard on the fire codes of the day and infused the film with a moral underbelly that still rings true today. The special effects are astounding.  I deny anyone to tell me that isn't a real 135 story building going up in flames. Okay, the superstructure actually never really existed.  It's the result of seemless editing and the incorporation of six models and various location photography.  The flooding of the promenade deck is equally impressive.  After nearly 25 years this film continues to give the first time viewer white knuckles.<BR>Unfortunately, Fox Studios has chosen to give us a really disappointing print of this four alarm blaze.  While colors are rich and well balanced and black levels and contrast are superb, the inclusion of excessive edge enhancement, shimmering details, aliasing and digital compression artifacts really burn up this transfer.  In short, this is the same transfer Fox used to master its laserdisc.  The DVD is not even anamorphically enhanced for 16X9 televisions.  And guess what?  NO EXTRAS!  What a shame!  Please, Rupert Murdock - a better job and a new transfer and soon.  This current version is burning a whole in my patience!
B000005S5N|5.0|really great cd from the bands more synth beginnings.  Scoundrel Days, Cry Wolf and Soft rains of April are highlghts.
0800141660|4.0|This film is so beautifully realized, in its scope and execution, that I have nothing but praise for both screenwriter/actress - Emma Thompson and director Ang Lee. Based on the novel by Jane Austen, the film follows the exploits of Mary-Anne (Kate Winslet) and Eleanor (Thompson) Dashwood; two angelic sisters determined to find romance amidst the sublime grandeur of the English countryside.  Also stars Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman.<BR>Columbia's transfer is, on the whole, gorgeous.  Colors are well represented and fine detail is rendered accurately. Contrast levels are subtle, as they should be and dark scenes are accurately represented with only a slight loss of fine detail to speak of.  Unfortunately, there are several scenes that exhibit pixelization that breaks apart background information.  There is also the inclusion of some minor edge enhancement that, while not terribly obtrusive, is nevertheless present.  This special edition includes a wonderful featurette and Emma Thompson's witty acceptance speech at the Golden Globes - a real treat.  FINAL WORD: There's no costume drama of the 90's more poignantly captured.  A British legend becomes an American Movie Classic. Get this one!
B0000025DV|4.0|The album is absolutely great, but this CD version (two albums on one CD) is missing a song! &quot;Standin' in the Rain&quot; is gone!<BR>It should be track 10.
B00005JLSC|5.0|I thought this film was AMAZING , perfect cast , perfect songs , perfect everything , a truly cinematic achievment of the musical genre. 10/10 !
B00004Z400|5.0|first off, buy this 'added track' version instead of the normal one. this one's got the song, 'Back to School' on it which is my favorite song on here. 'tis very good and along with tracks such as 'Digital Bath' and 'Change' makes buying this CD very woth it. this one of those discs you can easily liusten to all the way through without getting bored.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This cd wont leave my player I listen to it all the time , Truly great songs by stars who can actually sing , I prefer it over the great broadway cd probably because of the fantasic new upbeat orchestrations.
B000089RVX|4.0|I heard the song Bring Me To Life when I saw Daredevil and had to have it! Surprisingly, that's not even the best song on the album!!! It's awesome! The haunting melodies and dark themes are riveting!! And Amy Lee's voice sends chills down my spine!! I hope that this band will not do like most bands featured on soundtracks and disappear into one hit wonder land. These guys are truly talented. And the sound is very original. I definately recommend it!!
B00006LIRI|4.0|U2 is a world-class band and probably the most consistent of any band of their calibur and popularity(i.e. Metallica, Pearl Jam, Aerosmith, and the like).  With that said, U2 make incredible albums and they tend to flow together as one unit better than most.  In the 90's, their output consisted of three distinct albums that encapsulated a different feeling into each.  There were some standout tracks from each of the albums but for U2, I believe they are best heard within the context of the album and not in a scattered compilation.  Unlike Aerosmith who will produce a standout single but their albums do not sustain that level throughout such as &quot;Jaded&quot; from their last album which was arguably their best track.  A greatest hits package from Aerosmith makes more sense because they are much better at making singles then albums.  <br />U2 made a greatest hits album for some reason buit it's only benefit is the B-Sides disc that contains alternate remixes and contains the highly regarded Salome track.  This disc is very revealing of how U2 completely revamped their sound from one decade to the next.  U2 is best heard in album format becuase their songs flow so well and have a unifying theme.  For the casual fan, Achtung Baby is the far superior album and where the majority of the tracks appear from and they should start there to get what U2 are about.  <br />As far as including tracks from their latest album, Walk On should have been included as that song and Beautiful Day are the standouts from that album by far.  A better complation would have been intorducing a double disc greatest hits package comprising U2's entire catalog but the record companies make more money with each new release.  Nonetheless, it is an interesting collection and my recommendation is to listen to the B-Sides as with the 80-90 collection, it is the most revealing and meaningful to a U2 fan.
B000089RVX|5.0|Had I listened to this album, as it deserved to be listened to, the first time, I would have given it the 5 star rating it truly deserves. I very rarely give any album this rating, however I feel in this case that 5 does not give this work its due. I personally tend to favor, male fronted bands. Being a male, I relate more to their vocals. However, This band has done for music what none of its predecessors could accomplish in me..... leaving me completely and utterly enslaved to a female fronted band. Amy's voice could not be more hypnotic, it leaves me mesmorized and an insatiable desire to listen more and more. As psychologically unhinged as this all may sound to the reader of this I'm sorry. This girl at the age of 20(My age) has the single most amazing voice I have ever heard. The only thing it would be comparable to, would be all the legions of heaven singing with one voice. Some of her notes, honestly feel like the heavens are breaking open and the Sun is shining brightly on your face, even though you woke up on the darkest of days. Paired with incredible instrumentation, and flawless dynamics on the part of Ben Moody(who is truly so good at this)and heartfelt, painful, yet inspirational lyrics......I would like to propel Evanescence to the top of the \\"Most addicting drugs\\" list! My favorite tracks include \\"Going under\\", \\" Everybody's Fool \\", \\"Whisper\\" and \\"Bring me to life\\". If you are at all wondering, What possibly in this world could bring me solace for weeks? Go out...Right now, and buy this CD! What are you waiting for? Your missing out on valuable time to calm the waves crashing in your head, searching for the ways to express how you feel when you are broken in inumerable pieces. Amy you are beautiful, and I wish I could thank you(and the band) for calming the storm that plagues me daily. Again, I apologize for this reviews lengthiness.
0451120426|5.0|The book and the film, while both fantastic, are very different creatures.  Both can stand on their own quite well.  While I prefer the idea of Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golighty, I like Holly herself in the book far better.  She is a very frightened little girl (really, a girl-she is only 19), unsure of herself in a crazy, mixed-up world.  She, of course, doesn't help the situation any.  She is constantly looking for something-anything-to make her comfortable with herself and with her surroundings.<br />The book, unlike the film, has the correct ending.  The first time I saw the film, I had not read the book.  And, yet, I could tell that the ending-as sweet and fairy-tale as it is-could not possibly be the right one.  Holly is searching for something that she will never and can never find.  I often wonder what Capote thought of the film's ending.  Did he like it??  Or did he find it a complete cop out??
B00005ATQF|4.0|Stanley Kubrick has always had a fascination of the military (i.e., Dr. Strangelove, Paths of Glory).  And in this movie he shows us what life is like in the US Marine Corps Boot Camp.  Real life drill instructor turned actor, R. Lee Ermey gives a tour de force performance and turns the first 45 minutes of this movie into a Nuclear Hurricane!!  Once the movie leaves boot camp, I felt it loses steam.  But the direction of Kubrick is enough to leave you focused.  Well Recommended!!
0679405631|5.0|I stumbled upon the novels of Wilkie Collins by complete accident.  I love mystery books (Agatha Christie being my absolute favorite, but I don't think I am highly original there!) and was very excited to read what has been hailed as one of the first mystery / detective novels in English.  <br />I expected the novel to take me about a week to read.  It is a little over 600 pages long and I do work a normal 8-hour day...  I finished it in just over 48 hours.  It is a gripping page-turner.    The action comes in roughly 200 page sections.  When you feel the story ebbing a bit, put the book down (especially if you are at all tired!)-it will stay at a lower point for 20 pages or so.  But it will pick up again and you will be engrossed again very soon and quickly!<br />I don't want to tell anything about the story, since a great part of its charm, in my opinion, is having no idea what is going to happen.<br />If you want a great book to read over a weekend, try this one.  You won't be disappointed.
B0000399WC|5.0|This was a monumental performance by Steve McQueen that should have been up for an Oscar nomination.  Dustin Hoffman also gives a great performance in a supporting role.  The movie by Franklin J. Schaffer gives us an errie sence of what life was like on Devil's Island in French Guyana.  The images will linger with you for a long while.
B000000I3O|5.0|For anyone who isn't familiar with the Misfits, but are interested in checking them out, this is the place to start. Of course, their standard studio albums are just as good, but with this you get a lot of their best material on one CD. The Misfits are known for their very catchy songs, and B-movie inspired lyrics. These are the two factors that make them such a great band. All of their songs are very basic as far as technical playing is concerned, but I would honestly much rather listen to the Misfits than, say Iron Maiden (nothing against Maiden). I definitely consider them to be the most unique punk band in the histry of the genre, mainly due to their lyrical content. While most punk bands are known for their dogmatic political views, the Misfits were always just for fun. I'm not gonna get into a track by track commentary, but I'll just say that I highly recommend picking this one up. It's filled with extremely catchy 2-4 minute songs that for once you won't mind having stuck in your head. And the best part: These tunes are from the Danzig era! No offense to Michale Graves, because I like the new material too, but nothing could ever top the Danzig days. My final advice on this matter: get yourself a copy of this collection, and then pick up The Collection 2,and the rest of their catalogue. I guarantee that you'll instantly become a huge fan.
B000068PQ0|3.0|I wish I liked this album more because a number of people whose opinions I respect care for it...but I just find it dull. Except perhaps for song 4 which I thought was pretty amazing the rest of the cd fell a tad flat. I guess as far as over the top psych goes I would sooner listen to Spiritualized (stress on the over the top), and if I want angsty done propper I run to Galaxie 500 or Joy Division. Although I must admit that this album made me miss my  Wilco and Uncle Tupelo cd's heck I even tossed the Shins in after my tenth or so listen to Yoshimi. Though again I am willing to concede I could just be missing something, but it may be something I am willing to miss...
0805062971|4.0|Review<br />My thoughts on the story fight club are that it will start off very confused.  You will feel like you don't know what's going on.  A chapter will end in one location, and the start of the next chapter will have a totally different place.  This story was based on two men who were starting a club because they were angry about many things in their life.  They decided to let their anger out in these clubs.  The clubs eventually got out of control for even the ones who started fight club.  It goes beyond fight club to out side situations in the real world.  This book was not too interesting at the beginning.  I had my doubts.  But as I read on I realized that it was starting to get very fascinating and I enjoyed it very much.
B000002NAK|5.0|I KNOW ALOT OF YOU HATE MADONNA JUST BECAUSE SHE IS MADONNA.

B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is truly a masterpiece. The songs are just....just AMAZING ! All the songs are favorites of mine. I can honestly say there is NO FILLER on this CD watsoever. Every song is a song that was created to be heard and loved. Some of the highlight for me are 'Going Under' which starts off the CD, and its a great choice to start Fallen with. Amy's voice is perfect. Then I also love Bring Me To Life, which needs absolutely no explanation on to why its so good, just listen to it if u haven't. Next I like My Immortal, which showcases the bands ability to showcase's that they can turn a balled into something [great]. And I also love Imaginary, which is such a powerful song. It starts off with violins then get really hard rock. I love it ! And WHISPER !! Whisper is GENIUS. I love that song as well. And Haunted is exactly wat the title suggests its a haunting song, with an amazing opera like chorus towards the end of the song. There all just AMAZING PIECES OF WORK ! Honestly !!!

B00004Z459|5.0|Since I cannot write it in the Meteora page yet, this is my review of the 4 songs I have heard off of Meteora.<br />Track List:<br />1. Foreword (intro)<BR>2. Don't Stay *Listened to it<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong * The new hit single!<BR>4. Lying From You (available but haven't listened to it)<BR>5. Hit The Floor<BR>6. Easier to Run<BR>7. Faint * Possibly the second single!<BR>8. Figure.09<BR>9. Breaking the Habit(features 10-piece orchestra)<BR>10. From The Inside *Listened to it<BR>11. Nobody's Listening (a straight rap track)<BR>12. Session (DJ Hahn's solo track)<BR>13. Numb<br />Don't Stay: A great track. Glass breaks and then Brad comes in with a sick riff and Chester comes in with a violent verse intertwined by Mike Shinoda's emceeing! Finishes brilliantly! 9.6/10<BR>Somewhere I Belong: The new single, it is the most radio-friendly song I have heard on Meteora. It is a bit softer and catchy than the other 3 tracks. Mike raps slower and it gives a great affect. Talking about 'fitting in'. 9.4/10 <BR>Faint: Such an amazing song. Starting with a wild sample that turns into a heavy riff. Then Mike comes in with fast rapping and Chester has a great chorus about 'I won't be ignored!' Really roudy song, Chester screams himself out at the end! 9.8/10<BR>From The Inside: Heavy guitars but more of a Chester song. Reminds me of the emotions and chorus of Crawling with the melodic brilliance of Runaway (except its much more complex). Mike and Chester again do a great job at intertwining their vocals. 9.6/10<br />OVERVIEW: From what I have heard, Meteora will surpass Hybrid Theory on every level. The songs are more complex, diverse, Chester has a better range, Mike's raps flow better with the rhythm, Rob's drumming is much more complex and original, Phoenix's bass is much more pronounced here, and Brad's guitars are more biting and precise. Overall, Linkin Park has evolved and Meteora will be a sure success.<br />Prerelease Grade: A+
6304211740|1.0|i am a big fan of Jane Eyre. this movie barely followed the book and didn't even seem like the events could and would possible happen. my advise is to not waste your time watching this movie. if you want to see i good Jane Erye movie watch the one with Timothy Dalton. that one is the best by far.
6305428387|5.0|... of this mostly fictional account of the trials and tribulations of the Jamaican Bobsled Team in the winter of 1988.  No matter that it's mostly fictional, it's a wonderful, uplifting story.  With a terrific performance by John Candy as the coach and a great supporting cast as the team this movie tells a story of triumph, redemption and personal achievement.  Billed as a comedy, it has it's chuckles in the first half as the team is formed and begins training in the warm Jamaican climate, but once the boys reach Calgary and are confronted with their obstacles, it becomes very serious.  Faced with seemingly insurmountable odds to not only qualify for the competition, more less have a chance at a medal, this movie outRockys Rocky.  Unless you're made of stone, the heart-warming scene following the crash combined with the stirring music will at least cause a lump in your throat.<br />Whenever I feel down, I throw this movie in the VCR and 1-1/2 hours later I feel much better.  It's great therapy.  Try it.
0590353403|3.0|Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone is a adventurous book about a young boy named Harry Potter who just finds out that he is a wizards. His parents were wizards, but they died by an evil wizard name Voldemort. This wicked wizard killed Harry's parents but when he tried to kill Harry, some how he couldn't. The only thing that Voldemort did to Harry was gave Harry a scar on his forehead. Harry is adopted by his uncle and aunt who treats Harry like dirt. Harry then goes to Hogwarts with Hagrid (a very big man). Learning at Hogwarts was not easy with Malfoy (a bully) pushing Harry around. In the end, Harry goes face-to-face with proffesor Quirrel with voldemart in him. Harry kills Quirrel and Voldemort escaped.<br />What I like about this book was that this book hooks you in in the first couple of pages. This book is an great adventure books with new, exciting adventures. There are many new items and new wizards things never seen in our world. I also like how J.K Rowling describes everything in details. This is a great book.<br />What i dislike about this book is that in the beginning, thew story is a little bit boring. The story is not interesting in the beginning. I think the story could get better if there were a lot more action in the story. Then the story would get more interesting. The story would be a lot more fun for people, like me to read.<br />The part that I like the most in Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the part where Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to Voldemort. Theres so much action in it and there are alot of sacrifices like ron giving his people for Harry to go to Voldemort and Hermione to figure out the riddle and letting Harry go through. I live that part of the story. I think this is a great book.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride The Lightning(1984). Metallica's second album.<br />Once upon a time back in 1983, four lads showed up with a band whose sound combined the speediness of the bands Diamond Head and Motorhead with guitar stylizations from bands like Judas Priest, and invented a whole new style of heavy metal called thrash. Metallica was the flagship band of this genre and Kill 'Em All was the first real thrash album. While their debut album influenced countless bands for many years to come, it wasn't until their sophomore effort that we would be able to see what Metallica was truly capable of.<br />Here we have Ride The Lightning. Continuing where KEA left off, RTL pushes thrash metal to new heights of fast, heavy guitar riffs and lyrical sophistication. Most every song on here is about different types of death (the title track is about death by the electric chair, Fade To Black is about suicide, etc.). James Hetfield sings a whole lot better this time around, with his screeching vocals more controlled now and let out with real passion and angst. Kirk Hammett's guitar solos shread with perfection, especially in Fight Fire With Fire and the title track. They pass as not only some of the best guitar solos the band has ever done, but also some of the best in existence. Cliff Burton's bass thumps faster and louder than ever, and Lars shows off some snappy drumming skills, namely in the songs Trapped Under Ice and the title track. The songs themselves vary a bit, with much more versitality than KEM. Fight Fire With Fire, RTL, Trapped Under Ice, and Creeping death are very fast thrash numbers. Fade To Black is one of Metallica's most famous songs. It's very powerful, being the album's sole slow track. For Whom The Bell Tolls and Escape are more mid-paced, the former being one of the albums best rockers. The latter one, although probably the weakest track on the album, is still a very solid song. There is also a noteworthy instrumental, The Call Of Ktulu, which varies from slow to fastand shows off the band's style in an epic tone.<br />Overall, I highly recommend anyone who likes quality metal to purchase RTL as soon as possible. This album gets 5 stars hands down. Excellent songwriting, playing, and originality make this one of the five greatest thrash metal albums of all time. It is definitely one of my favorite metal albums, along with RTL's follow-ups, Master Of Puppets and ...And Justice For All. Very brutal, yet masterfully brilliant by any standards.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|<BR>Most people have seen it on TV by now, but of Tom Hanks' screen comedies, this is probably the only one I've seen.  I saw it in the theater, and the scene with the bathtub accident caused me to laugh so hard that I couldn't breathe, and thought, \\"this is how they'll find me, dead, eyes and mouth wide open.\\"  There are plenty of small asides that crack me up, such as the realtor's success in dieting, his entering \\"a 1 K\\", and the final scene, a completely unexpected denouement.  Use of Florida's John Ringling mansion as a setting was a master stroke.<BR><BR>I don't yet have this on DVD, but plan to get it sooner or later.  It's quite reasonable, and much cheaper than some of the detritus that has wound up on disk.  I've seen it in the theater at least once, and many times on VHS.<BR><BR>The late Alexander Godunov was nearly flawless, mostly because what would ordinarily have seemed like poor delivery came off more like booze talkin', a characteristic that was completely in accord.  Yakov Smirnoff is best in small doses, and his few appearances were spot on.  Maureen Stapleton was a crack up.  Joe Mantegna acted the part of the stars' guardian angel.<BR><BR>So, without further exaltation of what could have been just another screen comedy of the 1980s, I give a wholehearted recommendation.  Buy it, enjoy it.<BR><BR>
B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets(1986). Metallica's third album and last with bassist Cliff Burton.<br />By the time Metallica released Ride The Lightning(1984), it was clear that the band had a promising career ahead of them, as they amassed a great underground following, and didn't give a care about money or fame on MTV (at least in the 80s anyway). Two years enabled the band to build on RTL's success and release a follow-up that was not only worthy of RTL, but also improved upon that album as well.<br />Master Of Puppets: eight tracks of pure thrash perfection, and perhaps Metallica's finest hour. Hetfield, Hammett, Ulrich, and Burton are all playing in top form here. Hetfield's vocals especially are perfected on this album, delivering growling, angry, and melodic (on this album's slower tracks) vocals alike. Lyrically, MOP is mostly about the abuse of different types of power, oppression, war, and/or drugs and its effects on people. Battery kicks off the album extremely well, starting off as a spanish-acoustic guitar piece and then EXPLODING into a balls-to-the-wall speed thrash number. The title track and Disposable Heroes are equally impressive and full of lightning fast riffs. The Thing That Should Not Be and Welcome Home(Sanitarium) are two of MOP's slower, yet very haunting tracks, in the same vein as RTL's Fade To Black. Leper Messiah and Damage, Inc. are more outstanding thrash tracks, not as noteworthy as the previous ones mentioned, but by all means they still belong here. Like RTL, there is also a lengthy instrumental called Orion, where the band shows off its playing power.<br />If you don't already own this masterpiece of metal, then don't hesitate to grab it! MOP is undeniably a 5 star album. Unfortunately, shortly after the tour for MOP, Cliff Burton (God rest his soul) was killed in a bus accident, which only leads fans to wonder \\"What if...\\" It was sad having the world become 1 bass-playing perfectionist less. The band did persevere with the next album ...And Justice For All, though lyrically and instrumentally it was more complex than MOP, it was also plagued with shoddy production. Forget all the new popular [stuff] this band has been playing on MTV and the radio. MOP remains to this date as the strongest and best produced Metallica album of all time. 17 years later, this album hasn't aged a bit. Have you?
0790731894|3.0|executive decision was a very fine movie.i saw it in the theater three times. so i remember every thing and every scene. especialy the one's with halle barry. oh what a woman but!!!!.<BR>wait a minute isn't the director supposed to say cut when the movies being filmed not when it's already been shown in theaters all around america. this is the most chopped up film i've ever seen! it's a shame. there are about five key scenes cut out of this movie shortening it's lenth by about 12 to 16 minutes.they are very important ones.like when they setup the infrared lighting system. that's cut. or when they have to move the leader of the team \\"joe morton' after his back is injured and they have to carry him on a strecher through the plane to get to the device they cut the part out where they actually move him. all of the sudden he's at the device.there are too many cut's in this film to justify a purchase but if they do come out with a full lenth version of this film i will for sure be inline to get my dvd.
6303347657|4.0|Jim Carrey in one of his best parts. If you like him, try this movie, it's worth it.
B00005JKJA|2.0|This movie is inscrutable. Watts' performance is its high point. See \\"The Ring\\" for a more tolerable dose of this fine and pretty actress. The sexual encounter in the bed midway through was so predictable and obvious that I could not wait for it to be over. That goes for the whole picture as well. To make matters worse-- when I went to use the chapter search function to review a few of the more bizarre sequences-- I was surprised to find this disc has NO CHAPTER SEARCH. I recommend \\"Dune\\" instead. While allowing director Lynch to have his usual type of fun being weird, it is more entertaining than this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|This review goes out to the previous review &quot;A music fan from Taste-ville&quot; who I don't think could be more wrong!.. I heard Evanescence tonight for the first time, performing the song &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, and I was totally taken by the voice of Amy Lee... I have never heard such a haunting yet beautiful voice before.. Intricatley woven into a tapestry of rhythmic guitar riffs and interesting samples... I am a musician myself... and not many songs catch my ear.. but this one did! As a fan of Linkin Park, I can say to &quot;A Music Fan&quot; that this is definitely not a copy of their music.. though u can hear the influences.. it is merely that... Amy Lee's voice takes this band into new territory! After taking a cursory listen to the album, I plan on buying it this week, I can say that most of the songs revolve around the Amy's voice, and are not centered around the boring monochromatic riffs that &quot;A Music Fan&quot; has mentioned.. Each song features hypnotic vocal melodies, harmonies and understated accompaniments that take you in turns u don't expect.. Regarding the review of \\"A Music Fan\\", don't listen to him.. if one doesn't have something positive to say, they should restrain themselves a little.. Good musicianship does not come easy.. listen to this music, it speaks for itself! This album is definitely worth the buy to anyone who appreciates something a little different... the songs truly bring you into another place.. and as far as I am concerned, that is the mark of good music! =)
B0000047CW|5.0|This is an astonishingly beautiful, rhythmic, melodic, upbeat, and tender record. Truly, it is a perfect album. In my opinion, many bossa records are ruined with washy and often .... string arrangements that add needless clutter to the music. That isn't the case here. No sir. This music is made from an upright bass, percussion, Charlie on classical guitar, and Stan on sax.  The arrangements are so solid and intricate - and both Byrd and Getz play masterfully. (Stan is always brilliant and smoothe and silk - and on this record he does what he does very well.) However, this was my first introduction to Charlie Byrd. The man has soul - and isn't afraid to bend some notes and play without a net. Charlie plays like a man posessed. If you like bossa at all - you need to buy this record. It is \\"the one\\".
6304981635|5.0|This is probably one of the best chop-socky movies out there. Pauline Kael obseved that it's a fun example of &quot;the entertainment of shlock art.&quot; True, there's a little bit of philosophical stuff in it (most of which was cut during the original release, but reinserted for this DVD), but it doesn't take up much running time, so we can focus on the dazzling action and the enjoyable performances of Bruce Lee, John &quot;Mitchell&quot; Saxon, and Jim Kelly.<BR>This DVD is aces all around. The picture (2.35:1 widescreen), while a little dark at times, is phenomenally sharp and a whole lot clearer than any previous video or TV version I've even seen. The incredible sound is almost perfect. And for an early (1998) DVD release, this is loaded with extras. On side one (the side with the movie), there is an introduction by Linda Lee Cadwell, explaining Bruce Lee and the several minutes cut from the original release. There is a fitfully informative commentary by producer Paul Heller and writer Michael Allin. Rounding out side one are a pretty large array on production notes and a useless &quot;Film Recommendations&quot; page.<BR>On side two, there is an amusing 1973 documentary &quot;Location: Hong Kong with Enter the Dragon&quot;. There is a very enlightening &quot;Bruce Lee: In His Own Words&quot; documentary, which is mostly made up of interviews with Lee, an interview with Linda Lee (some of which was used in the intro) and &quot;Backyard Workout&quot; Bruce Lee home movie. Rounding out the features are the traditional theatrical trailers and TV spots.
0790729628|5.0|BLADE RUNNER is one of the truly great Sci-fi films ever made.  Seeing it again over twenty years after it first appeared, it seems as fresh and as vital as ever.  Despite having been made before the predominance of CGI special effects, it feels convincing in a way that today's Sci-fi films frequently do not.<br />There are several reasons this film works so magnificently.  First, there is the extraordinary set design, among the greatest in cinema history.  For me personally, the set design on this film is as exciting and as visionary as that for Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS.  It is one of the few films ever made in which the set design is as important as any other element in the film.  Second, there is the great central theme of what it means to be human.  In the novel that was the basis for this film, Philip K. Dick's great DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?, there is great doubt that the main character is human.  This is muted in the film, but the question of whether Harrison Ford is also a replicant is very much in doubt (Dick in interviews just before his death claimed that he was a replicant).  Third, the cast is truly great.  Harrison Ford is tremendous as Deckard in one of the best roles of his career.  He evokes the perfect balance of world weariness, existential self-doubt, dedication to his job, and love for someone who may or may not be as human as he is (or is not).  Sean Young, who suffered a premature end to her career through self-implosion a few years later, is remarkably compelling as the near perfect replicant who isn't aware that she is. Edward James Olmos plays a small but crucial role as Gaff, the cop who occupies his time with origami (which leads to one of the great moments in the film).  And a host of other actors and actresses perfectly round out the cast.  But the actor who nearly steals the entire picture is Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the charismatic leader of the replicants.<br />This was one of the first, if not the first, film to come out in a Director's Cut.  Not all films benefit from such handling, but this one does.  The endings, depending upon which version one sees, are quite different.  Few films demand a DVD format as much as this, with the degree of visual detail it requires, as well as the widescreen.e out in a Director's Cut.

B00000K0E5|4.0|Frankly my dear, this is the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond movie to date. It's also one of the best Bond films I've ever seen. It's full of all the things that we see Bond movies for: gadgets, stunts, action, Joe Don Baker, and (if you don't mind me saying this) women. And despite his less than stellar track record for Bond films, Pierce Brosnan is easily the best James Bond since Sean Connery. <BR>This DVD is absolutely stellar. The 2.35:1 widescreen picture is flawless (as it should be) and beats the heck out of whatever dreary, pan and scan copy is circulating on TV these days. There, as usual for a Bond film, a bucketload of extras. There's an audio commentary (didn't listen), a not so good \\"Goldeneye Video Journal,\\" a really good TV special \\"The World of 007,\\" a music video, some trailers and TV spots, and a booklet.<BR>This is available in a recent 007 box set, which also includes \\"Dr. No,\\" \\"Spy Who Loved Me,\\" \\"License to Kill,\\" \\"Tomorrow Never Dies,\\" and \\"The Man With the Golden Gun.\\"
B00007G207|5.0|Like many fans of this film, I was thrilled to hear about this version, but after seeing it, I was left with mixed feelings. Some of the additions, while visually gorgeous, don't really add to the story; and some scenes, particularly the reunion of Toto and Elena, actually change the tone of the ending of the film.  If you're a fan of this film, or filmmaking in general, this is a must have.  Fortunately, both versions are included on the DVD, so no matter which version you prefer, you have the pleasure of watching your favorite. <br /> I was disappointed at the total lack of supplemental material - I would have been very interested to know why the director chose to release this version - even if it was in a subtitled interview. In particular, I would have liked to know if this darker, sadder ending was what the director originally intended for the film.  Personally, I think that the original film is better, and would have been better served left as is, with the additional scenes included as deleted scenes in a supplemental section of the DVD.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Morning view can be seen as what Adore was to the smashing pumpkins, not the best songs of their career but certainly the most beautiful. Unlike the Smashing pumpkins, however, Incubus manages to mantain its edge on songs like &quot;Blood On the Ground&quot; and &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; while adding their radio made hits like &quot;Wish you Were Here&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot;. Other Tracks of note include the Motown sounding &quot;Are You In&quot;, the Haunting Acoustic &quot;Mexico&quot;, and &quot;Just A Phase&quot; a song that could almost be a tribute to the band Temple of the Dog. But the gem of this album is defintley the final track &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;. Here Incubus experiment with Middle eastern strings and heavy production and come out with a song that sounds different from anything they've done previously in their careers. Fans of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Fungus Amoungus will still be heavily disappointed(at this point they need to accept that the band they knew is long gone) But there should be enough here for People who came to know Incubus through Make Yourself and those just starting out.
B00005JLO2|1.0|Technically this is a very good movie, but it lacks any coherent and attractive story telling.  If you listen to the audio commentary it's pretty obvious why; the director appears to be preoccupied with bashing the brits.  Don't get me wrong.  This is not a movie with a political msg.  It's a movie with no msg at all.
0440237688|5.0|FROM A UNIVERSITY STUDENT:<br />I originally had to read this book for a children's literature class that I am taking.  As I got through the book I realized that this \\"children's\\" book had made me reevaluate how we look at what we would consider to be a \\"perfect\\" society.  Many people criticize the societies that we live in now and would even suggest that the norms and values practiced in this book would be ideal.  The Giver makes us realize that though there are consequences to having choices in a society- choice is freedom from imprisonment of conformity
B00005MP58|5.0|&quot;That a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.&quot;  So commences what is very likely the purest and most marvelous work of fiction in the English speaking world - And thus, as would be well fitting, ventures to introduce Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet, our undaunted heroine, in this brilliant A&amp;E production of the same.<br />Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is undoubtedly the most beloved work of literature contained in the whole of my vast library.  I should therefore find myself hard pressed to ever discover a movie adaptation even approaching the magic of that flawless story. Yet - low and behold - in this wonderful movie I'm sure I've actually found something coming close...quite close indeed!<br />Miss Ehle and Colin Firth are simply lovely as Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy.  The pair have a wonderful chemistry, and this is definitely the best work that either have performed in the whole of their careers.  Truly, they seem to have been born to play these roles!  Supporting them is a cast amazingly well chosen for this so daintily woven tale of romance and self-discovery evolving within the intricacies of civilized manners and politics of the gentry in Regency England.<br />Alison Steadman and Benjamin Whitrow are perfect as the famously mismatched pair, Mr. And Mrs. Bennet, the parents of five daughters - Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia.  Mr. Bennet is a country gentleman with a modest estate, which is unfortunately to be entailed away upon a distant cousin, Mr. Collins, in default of heirs male.  His wife therefore spends much of her time preoccupied with trying to get her daughters married and obsessing over the state of her nerves.  Mr. Bennet, on the other hand, spends much of his time in his study reading and sipping brandy.<br />When a neighboring estate is let to Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, Mrs. Bennet is simply beside herself with the rapturous anticipation of his being introduced to her daughters and, in good turn, marrying one of them.  Mr. Bingley arrives with his two sisters and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who it is soon discovered has a fortune and estate of over twice Mr. Bingley's worth.  Mr. Darcy, however, is aloof and somewhat haughty - characteristics that quickly make him unpopular.  Bingley, on the other hand, is friendly and outgoing, and is almost immediately taken by the charms of Jane, the eldest Miss Bennet.  Jane and Mr. Bingley quickly fall in love.  Yet with the differences in status and fortune, as well as the rather frequent improprieties exhibited by Jane's mother and three youngest sisters, the couple's road to happiness is to be a rocky one at best.<br />At the heart of this movie is Elizabeth, whose graceful charm, sharp wit, and intelligence catch the eyes of Mr. Darcy, who gradually comes to feel a passion for her against his own will.  Elizabeth, who is for quite some time oblivious to this, is meanwhile aware of the attentions of two other suitors:  Mr. Collins, the heir to her father's estate, and Mr. Wickham, a soldier in a regiment stationed nearby.  Mr. Collins is a fawning, silly man, quite ill favored for such a pretty, clever heroine, and Mr. Wickham, though attractive and good-natured, doesn't quite make the sparks fly for Lizzy.<br />The sparks do fly, however, in every single scene of interaction between Darcy and Elizabeth.  His &quot;pride&quot; and her &quot;prejudice&quot; go down the dance in perfect eloquence.  Every phrase, every look or expression, every manner of movement between them speaks volumes.<br />I only have a couple criticisms to this movie, and they are minor, indeed:  first, I would like to have seen Lizzy exhibit a little more softness of feeling and understanding toward her mother and younger sisters, especially her mother, whose first priority is to see her children well settled and secure in life - a valid concern which, to all appearances, her husband does not seem to share.  In the novel, Lizzy understood this, and though those precious little offerings were very subtle, they were always there beneath the admonitions and sighs of frustration.  Ehle's Lizzy appears most of the time to rather disdain their existence.  Yet I see this as a flaw with the script and not with the actress.  Another little problem I had with this film was how Mr. Wickham was presented.  In the novel, he was more physically attractive than Mr. Darcy, and his personality was very open and warm.  From the moment Adrian Lukis' Wickham first appears, one can see he's just a little bit shady.  I don't think he hid his true nature well enough to attract someone as sharp as our Elizabeth Bennet.  My final criticism applies to the dvd version only:  for some reason, the soft, warm coloring is gone.  Everyone looks quite pallid and washed up.  Though it's inconvenient to change tapes six different times, I still very much prefer my vhs to the dvd.<br />Finally, all I can say is that this A&amp;E presentation is not only the very best film adaptation of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ever made, it is the finest movie I own!Lizzy understood this, and though those precious little offerings were very subtle, they were always there beneath the admonitions and sighs of frustration.

0451167716|3.0|THE GODFATHER is THE seminal &quot;mobster&quot; novel. Mario Puzo's story spawned the most phenomenally successful movie series in history, and arguably two of the greatest films ever made. The story is an engrossing read, chronicling the rise and fall of America's most powerful (fictional?) crime family.<br />Michael Corleone's famous movie tag line, &quot;I'll make him an offer he can't refuse&quot; is nearly absent, but the equally chilling and more definitive Vito Corleone line, &quot;I'll reason with him&quot; is present in abundance. These two bits of dialogue underscore the ultimate difference between father and son, but Puzo is a raconteur, not a psychologist, and barely scratches the surface of his characters' motivations. Leave that to Francis Ford Coppola.<br />It's often said that &quot;the book is better than the movie.&quot; In this case, not. THE GODFATHER is a potboiler that's fun to read on vacation, and it belongs comfortably on the nightstand, but it is neither great literature nor even particularly well-written. The story and the characters transcend the telling, which is why the book translated so magnificently to film.<br />Coppola was inspired when he took the book's raw material and created a new universe with it, and Puzo essentially made a career out of THE GODFATHER. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT it isn't, but THE GODFATHER is definitely worth a read or five.
B000089RVX|1.0|Basically what we have with Evanescence is a very watered down, nu metal infested version of The Gathering's newer albums.  I cannot see why this pseudoemotional garbage is getting such a big fanbase, when a godly band like The Gathering regularly churns out just amazing albums that go unnoticed.<br />Please go buy an album from The Gathering or Lacuna Coil instead of this garbage.
B00003CX9E|2.0|It is so funny to think that this film is the greatest. What a joke!  When movielovers can speak out their minds, the result is &quot;the truth about it.&quot; I'm not surprised why this film got so many negative comments. I hate this film since the first time I saw it on Video tape 10 years ago. It is so pointless and boring. The character is not what we care for. You can't make a good film with a poor script. Citizen Kane is a good example of how a film fails to entertain people by its storytelling. No doubt it's not the best. It is not even a good film. I give 2 stars due to the effort that they tried hard to make it good. Sorry, &quot;it doesn't work.&quot;
B00005JLWN|5.0|Ok i saw no advertisements for this movie and i only caught it by mere chance the day before it left the theatre.  I must say i was truly impressed with the stunning action sequences and the original plot.  Christian Bale also goes through stunning personality metamrophases: from a souless bastich thats hard to deal with, to a feeling human being that is equally hard to deal with.  I must highly recommend this movie to any fan of martial arts or sci fi. Hell, buy this movie even if you hate the 2 genres, i guarantee you will love it.
0375414053|2.0|As a working mom and mother of one, and another on the way, I was so looking forward to what promised to be a well-written, sardonic, biting look at the challenges of the modern-day working mom. I loved the first half, thought Kate Reddy was going to evolve into the working-mom's hero!  Her writing was, in an over-the-top sort of way, dead-on to what many of us go through on a daily basis. But I kept waiting for the ending when she would march into her boss' office and demand that her job would have to be more flexible in order to accommodate her family life -- and instead we got total capitulation! I was crushed. As a securities analyst, in a pretty fast-paced and high profile job, I do believe we have to push our value to our companies and make them bend to accommodate. It's not easy, but many moms do have to work (or want to, or both!) and this book sends the same old \\"bad working mommy\\" message. I thought it would support the working mom, give us a laugh and tell us we're not alone in our challenges -- but instead what i heard in the end was the same old crap that you can't 'have it all'.  That we should give up that working nonsense and get back in the kitchen where we belong! Or that if we are going to work, then work from home in a female-oriented line of work, etc. A total bummer for working women who were looking for a story and a heroine that they could relate to...
B00006BTCA|5.0|Rock and Roll. Growing up in Memphis, I have seen my fair share of garage rock bands. In fact, alot of times that seems to be all there is musically here. Naturally I was a bit reluctant when a friend told me how great this band was, since my  opinion on rock music at that time was very low. Honestly I had grown bored and not interested. How happy I was when I heard Interpol! It brought back fond memories of black nail polish and youth, spooky rock without the over goth cheese that has been coming out since Valor took over Christian Death. A nice change also from the electronic soaked \\"post\\" rock music, in which I had found my only hope for rock and roll. Thanks to Interpol, I have been playing my guitar again.
0784011796|5.0|I agree with just about everybody here -- the movie's amazing. A correction on the pills, however. The pills Max is popping like raisins throughout the film are actually Midrin. In real life, they're red & white, and help keep migraineur people like me from going out in search of a nice, sharp guillotine. The pneumatic hypodermic is probably some version of egotamine (he mentions dihydroergotamine mesylate in that long list of therapies). These days, an inhaler has replaced the injections (or suppositories), which is nice, but that injection dohickey does look so much more stylish. <br />So, it's not quite accurate to talk about \\"drug abuse\\" in this movie, although I will grant that at the levels Max is using all those vasoconstrictors, he's lucky his toes haven't fallen off.<br />(And, yes, I have started playing Go since watching the movie about 20 times. And reading up on Mandelbrot sets. Wish Aronofsky would do a movie about tax return preparation...)
0451204530|4.0|Code to Zero is an unusual book. The main part of the plot takes place over a period of a couple of days in 1958, though there are flashbacks to earlier periods, some of them the better part of two decades. The author jumps between the plot and the flashbacks rather seamlessly.<br />In the main story, the protagonist wakes up in a men's room in a train station, dressed as a bum. He's not certain what or who he is, but he thinks he has skills and that his clothing isn't a good representation of his status. He soon gets his bearings and begins to regain his footing, stealing clothes and a car, then working on figuring out who he is. Eventually this develops into a mystery: once he knows who he is, he must find out why he lost his memory, and more importantly what he was supposed to forget.<br />I did have a few problems with the story. Though I won't give away any of the twists of the plot, I will tell you that I thought it a bit much for the main character to be all of the things he is in the story. And I will say I found the solution to the story to be a bit obvious and predictable. Those things being said, the writing is good, and the action flows along quickly and seamlessly, so you don't notice you're reading that much.<br />This is a good book, and I enjoyed it.
B00005QIPH|4.0|This CD is one of the best to come out in the past few years and completely deserves all the recognition it has received thus far. People may complain that the sound is too recycled but, while their inspirations are quite obvious, it's hard to complain when you look at the state of popular music. This is a good band that makes good music and it's nice to know it's not just people in the underground who &quot;get it.&quot; <BR>This is melodic punk you can dance to, with songs that get stuck in your head and refuse to leave. The lead singer has an awesome voice and the two guitarists, the bassist and the drummer are all talented musicians. There songwriting is some of the best I've heard in awhile, with lyrics that hint at emotion instead of smacking the listener with them. <BR>From the slower-paced opener &quot;Is This It&quot; to the frantic and final &quot;Take It Or Leave It,&quot; the entire collection is strong and leaves you wanting more at its conclusion. Great live act, strong supporters of other bands, nice guys [I've had the fortune of meeting a few of them], I highly recommend you check out the Strokes if you've yet to do so.
B0000542D2|5.0|I can't bring myself to give this any less than 5 stars.  The movie is a timeless classic that hasn't lost anything in the nearly 40 years since its release.  I don't think I have much to add to what's already been said time and time again.<br />But this was not what I expected when I heard there was to be a deluxe DVD special edition.  I have read that since Miramax was handling this release, not the Beatles' company Apple, they simply were not given access to all the material that could have been included.  I've also read that there exists no outtakes or deleted scenes (except for the &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; sequence).  Whatever the reasons, the second disc of interviews is frankly kind of boring.  I would have far preferred more extensive interviews with George Martin, Richard Lester, and the screenwriter (his name escapes me at the moment) rather than people who were hardly involved at all.  The primary creative personel interviews are great to have, but could have been more in-depth.  Maybe an &quot;highlights&quot; reel could have been edited together featuring brief comments from all the bit players, and less-involved tech crew.<br />The half-hour featurette on Disc One is pretty well done, and compliments the film nicely.  But there was another Making Of DVD release, now out of print, that was far better and twice as long (worth tracking down).<br />The MOST aggravating aspect:  the DVD-ROM features.  I want to read the first draft of the screenplay, but I don't have a DVD-ROM drive.  I want access to all the other interesting looking features that are DVD-ROM only.  I've seen far better supplemented discs that didn't need to relegate a bunch of cool stuff to DVD-ROM.  C'mon!  All of the second disc's regular features are talking-head interviews!  <br />But when all is said and done, this is the only in-print edition of the dvd and well worth owning for the movie itself.
B000000WFF|5.0|When someone mentions a certain year or decade, I instantly think about the artistic creations that were influencing me at the time. For example, when I think back to the years of 1996-1998, the Spice Girls instantly spring to mind. Before this pop phenomenon, I had no interest in music what so ever. Then I heard \\"Wannabe\\" one day on the radio and was hooked. The Spice Girls were brilliant, every young kid in the world was in love with them and they made me happier than I had ever been. At 10 years old, I didn't understand that they were obviously ruled by the record company and seen as total pop-puppets by anyone who wasn't a screaming teenage idoliser. Looking back, I think of how innocent the whole thing was; I had no idea of their money-making and manufactured image. All I cared about was the music...and Geri, but that's a different story. This band rocked the world - more so than Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Madonna, Mariah Carey and even Michael Jackson ever did. They were simply the biggest pop phenomenon since the Beatles, at least in the UK. Their run of nine UK No.1 singles in the space of just over four years and album sales exceeding 50 million with just two albums proved their popularity.<br /><br />The girls swept the board at the 1997 Brit Awards in which the band performed the classic Who Do You Think You Are. Geri Halliwell appeared in a Union Jack mini-dress and blew the minds of millions of teenage boys the world over. From then on, I was totally in love with the woman - yes, a guilty truth...but I wasn't the only one. The dress is simply iconic the world over and fetched more than £40,000 at auction a few years later - more than double than what Madonna's 1990 Blonde Ambition Tour conical bra fetched! The endorsement factor of the Spice Girls was also a big franchise; deals with Sony PlayStation, Walkers crisps, Pepsi, Impulse deoderant body spray, Polaroid cameras, Mercedes cars and much more netted each girl millions. A lot of this occured in 1997, but the girls also released their much-awaited second album, Spiceworld, in November of this year. Obviously, the album went to No.1 all over the world and sold almost 20 million copies - a significant drop for the almost-30 million sales of their debut album, Spice...but still a staggering amount compared to most other acts around.<br /><br />Spiceworld opens with the fabulous song \\"Spice Up Your Life.\\" The first single to be taken from this second album, the song rocketed straight to No.1 in the UK in October 1997. Even more spectacular, the song dislodged the biggest selling single in history off the No.1 spot; Elton John's Candle In The Wind. You know they're doing something right when they can achieve a feat that grand. The song itself has a fantastic cultural beat to it with a swirly jungle-boogie beat as a backdrop. The video is also brilliant and looks very expensive. They rule the world in the video, with Spice all over the place. This was a reflection on their real lives and the power and control they had over the world. \\"Stop\\" was the third song to be released as a single from Spiceworld and shockingly peaked at No.2 in March 1998 in the UK - their only single not to go straight to No.1 in the UK. The song has a very retro, 1960's feel to it which works wonderfully with the mood of the song. \\"Too Much\\" is one of the best Spice Girls ballads to date. This absolutely superb song was released in December 1997 and became the Spice Girls' sixth consecutive UK No.1. The vocals of Geri Halliwell and Melanie C are particulary outstanding on this smash hit. \\"Saturday Night Divas\\" is another brilliant song about the girls getting down on the town on, surprisingly, a Saturday night.<br /><br />\\"Never Give Up On The Good Times\\" is the best non-released song on Spiceworld and simply swings with funk and glamour. The addictive dance beat that starts off the song is soon replaced with a classy string arrangement and the foxy vocals of Geri Halliwell. The chorus is incredibly catchy and the percussion interlude halfway through is another highlight. Move Over is the shortest song on Spiceworld at only 2:46. The song was originally called \\"Generation Next\\" and featured in the girls' Pepsi TV advertisement. The blend of hardcore rock and funky dance beats work very well and make for another highlight from Spiceworld. \\"Do It\\" and \\"Denying\\" are another two superb songs. The former has a very dancey and happy feel to it, while the latter is more laid-back and relaxing with a striking R'n'B style - much better than anything on Forever. \\"Viva Forever\\" is just absolutely stunning - definitely one of the best ballads I've ever heard. Released in July 1998 after Geri Halliwell's legendary departure from the Spice Girls, it stormed to No.1 in the UK shifting almost 300,000 copies in its first week of release and became their seventh UK No.1 single. \\"The Lady Is A Vamp\\" is a good song to close this great album, but not quite as good as If U Can't Dance; the closing song from the Spice Girls' debut album, Spice.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Along with Spice, I consider Spiceworld to be amongst the greatest pop albums you can ever buy - and definitely the best by an all-female grop in history. All this recent news of the Spice Gils getting back for a last album and world tour would be absolutely fantastic, but I just can't see it happening. I'd love for it to happen, but the way Mel C's successful solo career is going, I don't think there's any chance.

B00005K3OT|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It's definetly best described as cute. I did not realize it was not actually in French though! I would recommend it.
B000053VAZ|5.0|I was torn between 4 and 5 stars. For this genre, it is an easy 5 star rating, but it is not my favorite genre, so I would give a 4 star rating for the general public. Since the former is more significant, it deserves 5 stars.<br />Johnny Depp plays Sam and does another excellent job. This is more in line with &quot;Chocolate&quot; than &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; (I liked the former but detest the latter). He is quiet, but entertaining. He is not shown as obsessed with Buster Keaton, but he does bang-up jobs of mimicking him. The scenes in the park are great.<br />Aidan Quinn is very good as Benny. He holds the role of protective older brother to Joon. Some of his later actions are predictable, but Quinn never falls out of line with his characters.<br />Mary Stuart Masterson does a good job as Joon (Juniper &quot;Joon&quot; Pearl). Only a couple times does she slip out of character. When she is in-character, she is excellent.<br />The plot is simple. Some people claim that it is unrealistic. For the majority of people, yes it is. However, truth is stranger than fiction and this is a feel-good movie that reminds us of positive things and looking forward to another day.<br />The lenghth of the movie is good. Only for a couple minutes during the start did I question if it would go too long (the opening train sequence is visually entertaining, but could have been cut short).<br />The sound is a big factor for me. This movie comes through with a big thumbs-up. The music is clean and upbeat, like a blend of Gershwin and Supertramp. The editing is excellent (except for one case with the car stopping, but the rest is so much better than normal that it probably shouldn't be mentioned). The sound really put this movie in the 5-star league.
060622047X|4.0|I loved these books when I was a teenager and into all things goth.  Now I'm grown up I thought I'd revisit Mr. Gainman's Sandman series.  I'm soooo pleased I did, I'd forgotten how good these are.  I had to wait a while for Preludes &amp; Nocturnes but it was worth it.  Now I intend to try and collect the entire series.<br />Gainman mixes folk lore, myth and a good story well.  These are definately the comic series for grown ups.  If you've never felt the urge to buy an 'adult' comic before give the Sandman and his brothers &amp; sisters a try.
B00005ARDC|5.0|This cd rocks. I listen to every song without skipping one. Some of the best tracks are love burns,sure as the sun, and spread your love. All of the song are meloncholy, but they make you want to pick up a guitar or drum set and jam out. I suggest you buy this cd; you won't regret it.
B0000640VO|5.0|Any movie with a suicidal goldfish has my attention.  Seriously though, this movie is great from start to finish.  Thankfully this movie was not dubbed for American audiences.  Just buy it.
B000066JES|5.0|I just started to listen to MANOWAR and i cant get enough of them now. I started to listen when me and my friend started to workout to the LOUDRE THAN HELL cd.  Now i bouhgt this cd and i love it.  Even though some say that opera isnt good for MANOWAR, i think it is! NESSUNA DORMA (NOBODY SLEEPS) is a great song and MANOWAR pulled it off very nicely!

A very well written thriller recommended for those who like this kind of literature.
B000069AUI|2.0|This CD is nothing compared to Parachutes, which was actually good. In Parachutes, you had strong, meaningful themes and lyrics, and emotional music that seemingly went straight to your heart. With \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", it seems like all they did was unsuccessfully try to re-produce Parachutes' quality, and ended up with a bunch of dull, flat, meaningless songs that really don't do anything for you. They certainly didn't for me, anyway.<br />I'm sort of wondering where that old Coldplay sound went. I think the fame is getting to their heads, and that they're listening to the fans - and not themselves - far too much. There is only one good song on this entire CD, and that would be the title track. This is only because it sounds the most like the \\"old\\" Coldplay. The rest of the album I was honestly bored with.<br />To the band: did you really want to have mass appeal with this CD so much that you were willing to sacrifice your meaningful lyrics and soulful, original sound? Well, congratulations on making something the new fans would like: another ... pop-influenced album with no emotion in it whatsoever. We didn't need this from you.<br />We can only hope whatever else they release in the future isn't quite as bad as this...
B000069HK2|5.0|This has to be the best cd that came out in 02. I bought the cd back in august, and i haven't stopped listening to it yet. It has a great blend of slower songs, and songs that will make ya jump and go crazy too. Berts voice is one of the best by far. He can scream with the best of them, but can also sing so amazingly. Every song on here is a hit and you can listen all the way through. Each song is unique and none really sound alike. They all have their own good qualities. My favorites are Poetic Tragedy, Greener with the Scenery, Noise and Kisses,The Taste of Ink, and Peices Mended, oh and even though its not on the cd, another great song by them is Just A Little. Ive seen them live twice so far, and they are so good in concert, if youre lucky enough to have them come to your town make sure you dont miss them. Theres not much else to say but these guys are one of the best bands around, go pick up the cd.
B000002KCF|5.0|To even think that this is Michael Frank's First Album amazes me to this day!!!<br />It's like Tracy Chapman's debut album x100...<br />All the songs and arrangements are superb.  The musicians who \\"jammed\\" on this session, especially Joe Sample, are just on the money.<br />A truly excellent CD to collect.  I hope an SACD will be released soon...
B00006L7XQ|5.0|When I purchases this CD, I had no idea how truly astonishing it was. The first track:The Man comes Around is awe inspiring. The upbeat tempo is addicting.  The lyrics are thoughtful and inspirational.  This song captures Mr. Cash's vocal talant and his god given talent for song writing.  The 2nd track is \\"Hurt\\" written by Trent Rezner.  It's a song about loss, drug addiction, Mr. Cash sings this song like he lived it. Which of course he did. The 3rd track is Give my love to Rose. It's a classic Cash story song.   The 4th track is Mr. Cash's rendition of Bridge over Troubled water written by Simon & Garfunkle, Fiona Apple joins the legend in this recording. My personal favorite is In my Life written by McCartney & Lennon.  Mr. Cash also has Desperado written by Glenn Fry/Don Henley, Which Don Henley is also singing on this track.  I purchases this CD in December 2002, It has not come out of my CD player since.  This CD is the best CD I have purchased in the last 10 yrs, well worth the money. Mr Cash has done it again, with this CD he proves why he is in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Country Music Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
B000088E6D|4.0|Bought this CD hoping it was by the same singer I had just caught for a few seconds over the end credits of Access Hollywood last week.  While not the first young performer to explore the classic pop repetoire of his or her parents' or even grandparents' generation, e.g., Harry Connick and John Pizzarelli, Mr. Buble's is the first voice I've heard in quite a long time that's equal to the material.  The Sinatra covers such as &quot;For Once In My Life&quot; and &quot;Summer Wind&quot; are fun to listen to, but Mr. Buble puts his own original stamp on standards such as &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; (exquisite!) and &quot;That's All&quot; that can stand against anyone's versions.  Great CD!

0064407667|2.0|I tried to get into the spirit of this book--yes, bad stuff happens, that's the deal, but it may be fun to read.  Well, for me, it wasn't much fun.  The kids' parents are killed off, they're then put in the guardianship of some beaureaucrat who doesn't care about their welfare, they get placed with a horrible distant relative who is mistreating them and plotting against them--in no very interesting way.  I guess I just don't get it.  It was just a series of ugly events about characters that are only marginally interesting in a setting even less marginally interesting.  I'm giving the two stars because I like the book cover image and the title and author's name (all those made the books seem very promising), and the kids tried to be somewhat resourceful, but that was it.
B00006RINF|5.0|OWN THIS CD!! Sell whatever you have to but do it soon. Lacuna Coil is by far one of the best musical bands on any scene. Their music is breathtaking, the vocals are astonishing, the songs are dark, broody, ominous and infectious. Put this CD in your player put it on Random Repeat Shuffle and enjoy for hours on end.<br />Honestly if this band were to get a shot at radio play they would blast the pre fab bands right of the air waves. Unfortunatly their US tour was denied due to VISA problems. But they will tour here and if you like them and live near a show then support them.<br />This music may be Goth to some metal to others but what it is plain and simple is FANTASTIC!! One listen and you will own their CD's.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Overall, this is one of the few cds I can put on Shuffle in my cd player.  Both versions of each &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot; (aka &quot;Te aviso, Te anuncio&quot;) and &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; (&quot;Suerte&quot;) could get redundant, but they are both excellent tracks and placed at opposite ends of the cd.  The only track I actively skip is &quot;Que Me Quedes Tu.&quot;  Some are almost Beach-Boys influenced, and others are more guitar-driven.  Overall, a very good cd!
B000062Y98|5.0|Anyon telling you this is not a masterpiece is deaf. Everysong is powerful and full of passion. Out of all the Bling Guardian Cd's I own (all of them) this is by far my favorite. The changes in songs is fantastic. And as another reviewer has said it does not let up. Well thought out and expertly composed. If you like pure metal then you could do no wrong with this Cd.
6300215741|5.0|This movie has humor, tension, beautiful scenery, and very sharp dialogue between Grant and Kelly. The costume ball and scenes at the end of the movie are just wonderful. Grant and Kelly definately have sparks flying between them, and the give-and-take between them is both funny and very sexy (for that time).
B000083C49|4.0|Definately the goofiest Trek film, but also one of the best.  The classic Enterprise crew travels back in time in their &quot;borrowed&quot; Klingon spacecraft to capture a pair of humpback whales, which are needed to respond to a mysterious alien probe that is threatening Earth in the 23rd century.  The cast has a very relaxed and polished interaction, honed over many years, and the plot is more successful than most at giving each cast member a chance to shine.  It's occasionally a little too cute, but very entertaining overall.
B000002UAO|3.0|I love The Beatles and have been one of their biggest fans from the very beginning.  &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; has always been my favorite Beatles album.  So when this CD came out I told myself I had to have it.  Then I looked at the song list and was very disappointed.  Please understand, this is a great CD and is well worth owning.  If you don't have the original vinyl LP then you definately need to buy this CD.  What I find disappointing about the CD is that they have eliminated two of the songs that were on the album: &quot;I've Just Seen A Face&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love&quot;.  I really liked both of those songs, especially &quot;It's Only Love&quot;.  WHY?  I don't understand it!  There are only 14 songs on the CD, they could have easily added two more songs.  Why on earth would they eliminate &quot;It's Only Love&quot; instead of &quot;What Goes On&quot;?  I love the music on this CD, but I am disappointed.
B000002GYI|5.0|Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk...how do you do it? <br />How is it possible that Kraftwerk, who rely so much on technology, made an album in 1981 that sounds as fresh now as it did then?<br />22 years ago, a year before my birth, I can only assume that these synthetic sounds were fresh and modern...thing is, it STILL sounds fresh; it's enjoyable partially BECAUSE of how sythectic it sounds...there are children's toys today that sound just like this! This just adds to it's freshness because nobody sounds like this, then or now.<br />You can't help but feel good when listening to this album, and when it's over you just want to play another Kraftwerk disc. Or, like me, you'll play &quot;Numbers&quot; over and over and over again...<br />By the way, this is an amazingly subtle production; you'll hear some other detail you didn't notice before every time you play this. <br />Look, there's nothing I can say about this group that hasn't already been said. It's funky, it's fun, it's brilliant/innovative/influential as any group could possibly dream to be. Just buy it, you definitely won't be sorry.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was a fan of Evanescence before Fallen, ... I own the Independent release (Origin).So As soon as they dropped there Debue I had to take a look into that (Ok I bought it the day it came out.) And I simiply fell in love with Evanescence again. I mean Origin was a great Cd even better then the Hybrid Theory EP.If you own origin then you know how good they are. And if you don't then you are about to get a taste. From Opening tack to the last track Fallen is a great Cd. My favorite Tracks on here are Going Under, Bring Me To Life, My Immortal ,Tourniquet & Haunted. ..the rest of the songs are just as good. Amy Lee has a great voice and will be going places with Evanescence. So if you don't own origin, ...get this album trust me this album has brought music back to life.(Pun intended)
B00005JLEU|5.0|Disney for the past years, has botched the releases of Miyazaki movies. Princess Mononoke is a prime example of a botched Disney Release. But what most anti-dub anime purists don't realize is that, even though disney practically ignores this owned publishing right, when it comes to dubs they are excellent. The entire thing is very well casted an on par with the original japanese voice overs. Each voice fits the characer acurately. The Dubs story is also very well and acurately translated, my compliments to disney writers. Another smart move for disney was to keep the original Japanese track with which has created the movies original buzz. My only hope is that the purists would for once actually ...listen to the dub. As for the Subtitles they are a direct translation, and actually stray from the dub version a bit to acurately portray all the chinese mythology which didnt completely transition in the english version. <BR>The movie itself is worthy of an Academy Award. it tells the story of a young girl on a quest for in a words knowledge. She meets many allies as well as enemies along the way. The whole thing wraps this somewhat simple story into a more complex arc with the addition of classic oriental mythology. It uses a very well-done orchestral track by Joe Hisaishi, as well as the classic animation of Ghibli Studios to top of this excellent story. This is definately a must-have for any family, anime-fan, or people in search of the perfect movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|George W. Bush needs to watch this to appreciate the horrors of war before he is so willing to send Americans all over the globe in hostile environments.  What a great historical account.  The interviews with the veterans are really the most significant documentation of the entire collection.  Better than \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", which up until this collection came out, was the most graphically realistic documentation of the true horrors of war (yes, I'm a vet myself).  The boredom, followed by absolute terror, is well documented in this collection.  If you don't buy any \\"Hollywood\\" war garbage films, this is not one of those.  Truly an outstanding, historical collected, with  the accuracy of the film verify by the interviews with the veterans.  This collection will blow you away.

B00005OAIE|3.0|I'm a new to John Mayer, but i do now consider myself a fan. this album is worth buying in my eyes. it gives you a very good sense of what john mayer is all about. his music is unique and beautiful in both lyrics and music. i would recommend this album in a heart beat as well as his live album. john mayer rocks and i will def. be getting his future albums. Props to john!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This musical captivation is beyond words! It's such a refreshing change from the pop music today. This CD offers a glimpse into the past simplicity of music, a greatness without trying to be.  I was immediately lost in it's tranquility, and found myself playing it in each free moment I had (a full-time mother of two, there doesn't seem to be many of them). I am a big music fan (and critic) and found myself recommending this CD to everyone that I know! Enjoyable does not describe this CD, and I very much look forward to Norah's next!
B00004ZB9D|4.0|This Cd is truly jammed packed with some of his greatest works. Contrary to what many say Lenny is a great artist with great talent.  Sometimes simplicity is best. not saying that lenny is simple but sometimes it better, look at it as not over doing things. bringing great music for many to enjoy. the numbers show it all. this album has great lenny classics as well as the ever famous 'again' which anyone in there right mind would enjoy. mr. kravitz is one of the best artist out there today, keeping it real and doing music from the heart. don't hate on the man, congradulate him on all he's accomplished.
0790740443|4.0|As much as I like the storyline, what makes this film is the fine job Kurt Russell does with only a half-dozen or so lines.  It is the lines on his face that convey what is going on inside this charactor whose only feelings are &quot;fear and discipline&quot;.  This is a terrific story of awakening humanity in an individual deprived from birth of such things, and some of the best scenes are between Russell and Connie Nelson's character as he tries to fit into the frightening world of normal life.  I knocked off a couple of stars for &quot;borrowed&quot; plot lines from similar-themed films, and gave one back for Russell's fine performance.
B000084T18|4.0|This is a great debut album.

B00006F83Y|5.0|Ah, a day in the life of FM rock radio -- as FM rock radio should be...<br /><br />Queens of the Stone Age are a blessing of modern rock and roll, a group who doesn't succumb and conform to all the bland trends found so prominently in today's music. The first DJ on the album's car radio announces another day of boring FM rock, when suddenly, from nowhere, Queens of the Stone Age blast into a screaming rage that is more Mariyln Manson than [[ASIN:B0000CAXID Foo Fighters]]. The Foo Fighters' sound is promptly more evident on the next hit song, \\"No One Knows.\\" And so this diverse album plays out: As the radio dial turns and various DJ's speak up, so springs forth an eclectic choice of music from one band -- all on one unique CD.<br /><br />Queens of the Stone Age possess an extremely tight-knit sound that mixes melody with thrash at free will. The guitars often come in spurts, and  meanwhile, guest drummer Dave Grohl clicks away on drums with abandon and precision. The cryptic guitars and eerie vibe to songs like \\"Song for the Deaf,\\" \\"Hangin' Tree,\\" \\"First it Giveth,\\" \\"Song for the Dead\\" and \\"The Sky is Fallin'\\" all hearken back to a heavy metal age when bands like [[ASIN:B000002KB8 Black Sabbath]] and Iron Maiden ruled, not that these guys sound like those bands by a longshot; it's just that Queens of the Stone Age has an aura to its sound reminiscent to where bands like Maiden and Sabbath came from.<br /><br />Power pop rock also makes a huge appearance on \\"Songs for the Deaf,\\" a la bands such as the Foo Fighters and Pixies: \\"Go With the Flow,\\" \\"Gonna Leave You\\" and \\"Do it Again\\" are all potential modern rock hits on the radio. Simply put, this is the type of band kids in high school get excited about. At times speed metal, at times heavy pop, at times dark metal, Queens of the Stone Age can't be pinned down to any one sound.  The last great tune, \\"Mosquito Song,\\" is even driven by a Spanish guitar sound that turns operatic, a perfect closing tune for a perfect album -- during one day of perfect FM radio. Similarly, \\"Another Love Song\\" has a Spanish flair to it, once more displaying the broad range of this band's musical tastes, and its willingness to expand on those tastes.<br /><br />The interspersed DJs on \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" are as diverse as the music, representing a time when rock on FM radio was also more varied. The first DJ pleads, \\"I need a SAGA, gimmee a SAGA.\\"  Well, this album is definitely the saga he seeks.  It's a blistering synergy of music that is original, fresh, fun and untouchable.f perfect FM radio.

B000002OCP|1.0|Forget that Muddy Waters is on this album, forget blues purism, listen to it as an example of late '60's psychedelia...and still the album's bad.  It might have some value if you're working up a collection of extremely dated, '60's period pieces that are good for a giggle.  \\"Are You Experienced\\" this ain't, though the guitar intro on \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" is a feeble attempt to cop the intro to \\"Foxey Lady\\".  The fuzzed-up guitar never stops, playing one cliched lick after another before, after, and during almost every line that Muddy sings, and it's astounding to learn that all this freakout stuff was played by Pete Cosey, who later went on to play with Miles Davis on the stellar albums \\"Pangaea\\" and \\"Agarta\\".  I guess if you're into bands like Chocolate Watchband, 13th Floor Elevator, and other similar bands that haven't aged well but are raw slices of hippie naivete, this album would be okay, but aside from the historic interest this album just doesn't get the job done.  So much for High Concept albums.

B000063WDH|5.0|In the mood for some 'hard blues', I bought this CD along with Govt Mule's Deep End Vol 1. <br />To sum up what my ears told me, The Black Keys demonstrate everything that can go right when loud guitars collide with blues and R&amp;B forms, and Gov't Mule shows how everything can go just as wrong. I played the Mule CD twice and will be selling it on, while the Black Keys I can hardly keep at my house 'cause everyone that hears it wants to burn a copy. <br />If these cats can keep this sound going, I'll have one happy set of ears. I almost wish I hadn't heard this CD as I'm now seriously addicted to The Black Keys - seriously I had a hard time getting to sleep one night worrying whether they would be recording more, and if so whether they could possibly live up to this one, which simply hits the note at all levels. Great selection of tones, seriously rude-antique guitar tones, vocals out of lungs filled with Mississippi mud, and a very cool backbeat throughout. The soul rendering of She Said, She Said is a simple masterwork. <br />OK guys, go out and record some more. Quick.
B00006879E|5.0|I've been so bored with my music lately it's depressing- then I came across a music video someone made for &quot;Through With You.&quot; The video was good, but the song was GREAT! I downloaded seven songs by Maroon5, and I love it. I can't wait til I can get to the CD store to buy the CD! The songs are smooth, and very fresh. Adam Levine's voice makes me melt.
B000002BBY|5.0|this album is perhaps one of the most solid rock albums of the 90's. It immensly added to the brit pop scene at the time and reinstated rock music as a whole. &quot;wonderwall&quot; is in my mind an amazing song. Not only is it my favorite song on this album but one of my favorites from the 90's. If you've heard this song you'll know what I mean. So, do yourself a favor and buy this album, even if you dont like every song on this album (which is usually not the case) because this is an album that you will definitly want in your collection, trust me.

B0000029DD|5.0|Back in 1994, the son of cult singer/songwriter Tim Buckley managed to create some of the most unique music we've ever heard during a time that saw angry grunge rock, and the start of a gangsta' rap revolution.  <br />Buckley has created nothing short of the most innovative work of art of the 1990's.  Let me ask you a question--who does he sound like?  If your answer is no one then you're right.  And that's very hard to do today.<br />So grab this album, and experience brilliance hard at work.  &quot;Grace&quot; is just a glimpse at the man who, had he not passed away in 1997, could very well have changed music.<br />Oh, one more thing--for best results:  PLAY LOUD!
B000075BFK|3.0|I like 2PAc alot, but I definitely have to say that this is one of the worst albums I've heard from him. There are not many good songs. More than half the songs are bad. They don't have any feeling in them. I have to give props to DeathRow and 2Pac's brother and sister, though. They computerized 2Pac's voice to make it sound like if it were actually him singing. The singles \\"Thugz Mansion\\" and \\"Still Ballin\\" have good beats. So does \\"Street Fame\\" and \\"When We Ride On Our Enemies\\". Other than that, the CD is bad. They should've made it better, like \\"ALL Eyez on Me\\" or \\"Me Against The World\\". I hope they keep making 2Pac albums and hopefully, they'll make them better.
0316666343|1.0|Halfway through I realized the only reason I was continuing to read was to discover what happens to Mr. Harvey, the murderer. So I flipped over to the ending, scanned it and put the book away.<br />The prose was lovely if a little tiring at times, and too many scenes were unbelieveable and even disturbing. A girl in heaven watching her mother's adultery? A camp counselor assigning the theme \\"how to commit a perfect murder\\" as a project (in theory, mind you) for junior high kids? A mother, already having had one child murdered, leaves her small boy in a mall play area to meet with her lover?<br />I had treated myself to a stack of books for my birthday -- wish I had my money back for this one.
B000084T18|5.0|This is the best album I've EVER heard in my life! The 2 hit singles \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"Wanksta\\" are real good. \\"In Da Club\\" is number 1 on the rap and hip hop charts and on the top 200 also. Those aren't the only good songs, though. The R&B type song, \\"21 Questions\\" is pretty much a slow jam to relax you and your brain. \\"What Up Gangsta\\" has a bad ... beat, just like \\"Many Men\\" and \\"If I Can't\\". All the songs in this album are good, but I can't name them all. I think 50 Cent will be a big icon in hip hop in the future.
1573301183|5.0|I absolutely adore this dvd!  I can't say enough wonderful things about it.  Its great to see Layne smile and laugh when he actually messes up during &quot;Sludge Factory.&quot;  The atmosphere MTV set up for this installment of the &quot;Unplugged&quot; series is amazing, and definitely supplements Layne's beautiful voice.  Layne and Jerry have never sounded better together.  I watch this dvd at least once a week, and oftentimes fight my urge to cry.  Rest in peace, dear Layne.  You are gone, but definitely not forgotten!
6305127638|4.0|What fan can ever forget the introduction of the Borg into the Star Trek universe?  When Picard was captured and assimilated by the Borg, I was beside myself with wonder, giddiness, and disbelief.  The ultimate Star Trek: TNG movie really had to feature mankind's most dangerous enemy in a battle for Earth.  Not only does First Contact give us this, it actually gives us a battle for earth's past as well as its future.  I don't really know how to judge a director's performance, but Jonathan Frakes certainly knows as much about these beloved characters as anyone and he unquestionably succeeds in giving rabid Star Trek: TNG fans the kinds of thrills, nostalgia, and excitement they crave.  I must admit, though, that while this is an excellent movie for newcomers as well as long-time fans, there are a few little things about it that bother me.<br />Who am I to question things in the Star Trek universe?  No one, yet I still believe this movie fell short of its potential.  For one thing, and this is something that afflicts almost all reunion movies of any kind, there is an overindulgence of enlightening comedic episodes and clich&eacute;s among a cast we already know so well: we see Deanna Troi get drunk, the first words out of Worf's mouth are \\"Perhaps today is a good day to die\\" when his ship is crippled, we watch Data's sometimes magnified efforts to become human, we hear a holograph in the sick bay tell Dr. Crusher that \\"I'm a doctor, not a doorstop,\\" etc.  Every so often, two characters look at each other knowingly as they enjoy some type of private joke that many but not all TNG fans will really \\"get.\\"  I don't really mind all this, but sometimes it just seems a little much.  It can be funny, but there's just a little too much of it.  I was also chagrined by the omniscience of Picard when a Borg pod of some sort left the ship headed for Earth; hearing that the pod was producing some kind of unusual effects in front of it, Picard almost immediately knows that the Borg are traveling back in time in order to change the future.<br />The only substantive thing that bothers me about this movie is the portrayal of the Borg.  I actually think the Borg were given a wrong turn back during the TV series when one of them was cut off from the collective and began to recognize himself as an individual.  As far as this movie goes, I think it was a great mistake to invent a \\"queen\\" who somehow gave birth to the Borg and claims that \\"she\\" (not \\"we\\") is Borg.  An individual consciousness lying atop the command structure of a hive mentality greatly weakens the threat of the Borg and humanizes them in a small way that bothers me (humanization implies vulnerability).  Maybe this is why the Borg fail pretty miserably with Plan A of their time travel strategy.<br />Although I may have harped on them a little bit, these really are rather trifling criticisms that do not make this movie any less enjoyable than it is; I just think it could have been better.  It's always nice to see the cast of the show get together again for a new adventure, especially when it involves the Borg.  There is a nice dichotomy midway through the film; ironically, we hear the determined Captain Picard basically echoing the words of the Borg queen on the subjects of evolution and progress in life.  This thinnest of threads tying the Borg and Federation together seems to lie buried in much of the remaining story, giving it a deeper meaning of some significance.  A more obvious message concerns the reality vs. the legend of heroes.  Warp drive inventor Dr. Cromwell, long-time hero and demi-god to future generations, is basically just a greedy, regular, frequently intoxicated guy.  This helps make First Contact a very good, but not great, motion picture.aveling back in time in order to change the future.  <br />The only substantive thing that bothers me about this movie is the portrayal of the Borg.

B00005UW9T|4.0|Honestly, I though this was a fantastic move. I love the song, \\"Once Upon A December,\\" and the cast for the voices were great. Based on the Russian Revolution of 1917, Anastasia Romanov doesn't get executed, only to be stranded at a train station trying to go to Paris with her grandmother, Dowager Empress Marie. When she grows into her teens, the only thing that she has of her past is her necklace saying, \\"Together in Paris.\\" Now, all she wants to do is find out who she is. Even though this movie is great, if you are looking for the truth of the imperial Romanov family, this movie twists everything into a work of fiction.<br />First, it seems the Revolution lasts only one day, and forget about Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Plus, Rasputin isn't shown as a holy man, only an evil sorceror, who gave up his soul which in this movie starts the crumble of the rule of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Also, in this movie, Anastasia lives a happily ever after life. Well, in the real story of the Romanovs, that stuff doesn't happen. So, if you are looking for a fairtale of the imperial family of Russia, this is your movie. If you are looking for the real truth, read a good book on it or some of those movies based on the real imperial family and their true fate.

The plot and narrative style are too similar to \\"Gone for Good.\\"  The characters aren't very interesting, and for the first time Coben's writing seemed mechanical and his hero humorless.<br />Because the characters were not especially well-drawn, I sometimes struggled to keep up with who's who. (Example: I had to go back and review when the Las Vegas gambling addict-doctor reappeared.)<br />Because I didn't care about the characters, the plot twists were boring, even though I didn't anticipate most of them.<br />I'm also getting tired of \\"the perfect killer,\\" a staple in all of Coben's work.  The Win character in the Bolitar series is fun, and the killer from Korea (forgot his name) in \\"Tell No One\\" was okay, mostly because he was clearly just a plot device.  But here Coben apparently wants us to find \\"the Ghost\\" interesting and even sympathetic.  As far as I'm concerned, he didn't pull it off.
B00004W52U|5.0|This is an awesome cd!!!!! I love The songs. you gotta hear it.
B000089RVX|5.0|After hearing so many wonderful things about them, I bought the Evanescence CD two days ago. I absolutely love it, and it's in heavy roatation in my CD player :0). Every single song on the album is different -- not like some CDs out there where every song is the same. The lead singer's vocals are fabulous. It's refreshing to hear a band with a good female lead singer. <br />While each song is great, my favorites are &quot;Tourniquet,&quot; &quot;My Immortal,&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Fool.&quot;<br />Buy this album and support this great band.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I don't usually buy soundtracks, but this one I had to have since the movie was so great.  &quot;The Hours&quot; soundtrack reminds me of various scenes in the movie, but this music is strong enough to stand on its own.  I think that even people who haven't seen the movie will find this music as deceptively simple -- and therefore, powerful -- as I did.  The fourteen tracks, or sections, clearly form a unified musical experience without all sounding alike.  Especially memorable are the strings that pulse and throb, reflecting the emotional turmoil in the characters.  In general, I find this music to be evocative, introspective, haunting, and very, very accessible.  I heard and liked some of the music as I watched the movie, but I appreciate being able to focus on the music alone through the CD -- without the actors and the situations &quot;taking over&quot; the music and dividing my attention.  The best selections are &quot;Morning Passages,&quot; which plays as the camera cuts back and forth among the three women as they prepare for their day, &quot;For Your Own Benefit,&quot; and &quot;Escape!&quot;  I was not familiar with much of Glass' music before this -- I had heard one symphony of his, I think the   Symphony #5 -- but this soundtrack immediately attracted and enveloped me while seeing the movie, and still does.  This soundtrack is modern music, as current as it gets, and it's terrific.
038572179X|2.0|Atonement is full of lovely phrases, but lacks the ability to carry you through the story.  So many words, so little tiime.<BR>After struggling through the first one third of the book I finally just gave up and put it down.  This novel is not for the reader who wants to be entertained, caught up in a good story, or likes an emotional presence in their reading.  Thinking I had been too harsh in my analysis, I picked it up again a few weeks later.  Same result.  No heart.
B000002W9Q|5.0|I really like the music from the movie Dirty Dancing. I like this one song that I don't know though. It plays when Baby's sister Lisa is walking to Robbys house at night and finds out he's with somebody else in his room(harsh). Does anybody know which song I'm talking about? I don't remember the lyrics and I don't know the artist. Can someone play back their Dirty Dancing tape and help me out? :)

B000089RV6|5.0|Released in 1980, \\"Back In Black\\" featured new lead singer Brian Johnson who replaced former singer Bonn Scott who died months earlier. With the death of Scott, there were sceptics that thought this was the end of the hard rocking Aussy band. But to their surprise \\"Back In Black\\" was a huge success with absolutely no filler tracks. The album produced a number of hits with the title \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". In my opinion some of the best songs on the album were not hits such as \\"Shoot To Thrill\\", \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" and \\"Shake A Leg\\". With the addition of Johnson to the line up the band seemed to be stronger than ever, and Angus Young's guitar licks are absolutely amazing. Just listen to the lead guitar in \\"Shake A Leg\\" and I'm sure you'd agree. Numerous soundtracks have included AC/DC songs from this album, notably the Steven King film \\"Maximum Overdrive\\" which featured \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". This newley remastered edition of \\"Back In Black\\" now on the Epic Label surpasses the older 1994 remastered version in that the volume is pumped up higher, there's definately more bottom end and mid-range. I actually listened to both versions of the disc and this new one blows the other away. The digipack that stores the new remastered version is attractive and there's an excellent booklet inclosed with color photos, etc. of the band. If you want to hear hard rock the way it was meant to be then pick this superb cd up and enjoy.
0060537639|1.0|Much has been written about this author's thesis that the Chinese charted much of the world in the early 15th century.  In my view, the evidence is circumstantial and highly suspect, and the book is very lightly footnoted.  More importantly, though, this book reads as if it was written by, well, a submarine captain.  Interesting ideas are occasionally brought up, only to be forgotten in the next paragraph.  Many arguments are disjointed, leaving the reader to scratch his head when trying to understand how the author arrived at certain conclusions.  In one chapter, the author digresses into a story about an African safari that ended when an enraged hippo threw a boat over the author's head!  Gavin Menzies may indeed have discovered some compelling evidence for China's exploration of the world in 1421-1423, but he should have hired a real writer to help him make that evidence convincing.

B00003CXXM|3.0|The story is unbelievably poorly written (I mean the movie, not the book).  This movie gives you many laughable unreal stupid scenes as a spy movie and endless questions of why.  But do we care?  Nice European locations like Paris, Prague, etc.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|An amazing album by Johnny Cash. Who else could have grandprents and their grandkids gathered around the stereo listening to and enjoying the same artist?<br />That's what Cash has done here. He's covered NIN's &quot;Hurt&quot; masterfully; he's covered the Depeche Mode &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; anthem artfully...the record is awesome. Cash is awesome. What more can I say?!
B000084T18|4.0|There are very few weak songs on this disc.  Will probably go down as one of rap's greatest CD's.  \\"In Da Club\\"  rocks, as well as \\"Patiently Waiting w/ special guest Eminem\\",  and \\"Many Men\\" is another great track.  Dr Dre's hands are all over this record, and you can hear it in the mix.  Dre is the new God Of Rap.  50 Cent is the newest thing if you love Gangster Rap like I do.  Get your nine out, and crank it up!
B000002L9M|5.0|Depeche Mode's 1986 album \\"Black Celebration\\" is considered by many to be their most loved album of their entire musical catalog and it definitely deserves all of the positive reviews that it gets. This album, alongside \\"Music For The Masses\\" is easily their masterpiece to this very day. I must say that the album cover definitely depicts the overall mood of the atmosphere. The building showcases the industrial sound, the nighttime sky depicts it's dark, bleak, and mysterious atmosphere, and the flowers showcase its beauty woven into its seemingly sinister and bleak mood. I would even go far as to say that it's better than Violator and Some Great Reward.<br />BLACK CELEBRATION: The dark and nihilistic ride begins with the opening title track, which I must say, is the best opening song of any of Depeche Mode's albums. It starts with a somewhat scary voice effects backed by an ominous droning minor note key, then robotic voice effects come in and then a ticking keyboard effect comes in before becoming a dark, intense, and ominous industrial number that I think is one of the ancestors of the industrial dance revolution that began to take shape a few years after this CD was released. The beats eventually stop and the song goes full circle returning into the ominous minor note key and transitioning into the next song.<br />FLY ON THE WINDSCREEN: This is a reworking of the closing track on the \\"Catching Up With Depeche Mode\\" compilation. I personally love the 1986 version on this album better. It starts with the droning minor note of the previous track melting into a new melody and becoming a dark, often scary New Wave industrial song with a futuristic feel to it and dark and sinister lyrics to back up the songs ominous tone. Eventually the song gets more and more intense, more desperate with the \\"kiss me...NOOWWW!\\" lyrical line before quietly backing down but the beat continuing and the droning keyboard and guitar sounds continuing and then a barely audible laser sound effect ties \\"Fly\\" into the next track.<br />QUESTION OF LUST: The ending of the previous song perfectly fits the beginning of this amazing song. This song is a major note but still as dark and foreboding as the previous two songs. This is a haunting, dark, industrial, and mid-tempo song with a sense of urgency and desperation. Martin Gore's voice is incredible on this track.<br />SOMETIMES: OK, this almost feels like a table scrap version of \\"Somebody\\" from their previous album. This song is a nearly two minute track that is very much like \\"Somebody\\". The production may not be top-rate but the odd hazy quality though gives this song a strange and mysterious appeal.<br />IT DOESN'T MATTER II: This is not a revamped version of the song of the same name on their previous album but a totally different song altogether. It's a very odd, and somewhat medieval sounding song with very weird voice effects, strange atmosphere, and a somewhat religious tone merely from my perspective with the strange choir voice effects. A weird but wonderful song.<br />QUESTION OF TIME: This song gets my nod as one of the most intense and urgent songs that Depeche Mode have ever written up to this point in their career. A lot of us have already heard it and are familiar with it. This is a very intense song about the increasing angst of increasing sexual tension and the ominous melody and pounding beats definitely portray that. The mechanical drill sound effects at the beginning give a feel of the intense tension that the song expresses.<br />STRIPPED: This is one of the most sinister songs that Depeche Mode has ever written. It starts with an acoustic guitar intro, then a mechanical pulsating sound comes in and the song becomes a very dark, intense song. David Gahan's vocals are incredible on this track. The lyrics are dark and disturbing and fit well with the somewhat terrifying melody too. Definitely one of my favorites.<br />HERE IS THE HOUSE: This is my favorite song off this CD and one of their most overlooked songs. It starts with a ticking watch sound effects and a defined rhythm builds upon that ticking watch effect and the song becomes a marvelous, dark, and danceable industrial number, with some great acoustic guitars too. I have no idea why few like this song much. This song is difficult to explain how it really is but it's an astounding song. The song breaks down with the ticking watch effect continuing after the song itself ends before coming to a complete stop.<br />WORLD FULL OF NOTHING: This is a strange and eerie Depeche Mode ballad and one of the strangest songs that Depeche Mode has ever written. It's another song that's hard to explain how it sounds but it's a gorgeous song.<br />DRESSED IN BLACK: This is a very mysterious sounding song that I think could fit well on \\"Violator\\". It's a very odd, and twisted song with a bit of sex appeal to it. Hey, I've always thought women looked great dressed in black. ;;)<br />NEW DRESS: This is a very intense, edgy and frightening song about the possibility of the Apocalypse coming with tales being told of wars, murder, disasters, etc. The song is a dark, ominous, electronic-techno song with a very dark, urban decay kind of mood.<br />BUT NOT TONIGHT: This song wraps up the darkness of BC on a relatively upbeat note. This might be the brightest song on the album but still isn't daytime in mood. It's just has the least sense of bleakness out of all of the songs but still is a dark and relatively spooky number.<br />I can definitely say that Depeche Mode reached near-perfection with this masterpiece which I can easily say is their best album. For me, it's the mysterious, angry, dark, and bleak tone of the record that makes it my favorite album of theirs. Buy it!ne of their most overlooked songs.

B000002UUX|5.0|Megadeth has yet again amazed me with \\"Rust In Peace\\". Every song packs a punch except for one, and it isn't really a song. To anyone who likes Metal, I recommend this, especially if you are a fan of 80s metal.<br />1. Holy Wars...The Punishment Due: Great song all the way, and a great opening part. The lyrics are good and the pace is nice, but the slow part of the song (the middle) may take a bit of getting used to, and it is still great. Dave really shows off his guitar soloing with the solo leading to the fast part at the end of the song.<BR>Rating: A<br />2. Hangar 18: At first I disliked this song, but it has recently been growing on me.  The main riff throughout the lyrics is just so amazing, it is unbelieveable.  Dave's voice really shines in this song.  And the solos are just amazing!<BR>Rating: A<br />3. Take No Prisoners: Nice opening, but the highlight is by far the middle where it all gets faster and more energetic, and the lyrics get more energetic.<BR>Rating: B+<br />4. Five Magics: The first 5 seconds of the song rock, then the next minute doesn't, just a bit draggy. The rest of the song, however, is brilliant. Nice lyrics (give me alchemy, give me wizardry...), and the mini-solos are good, but the actual solo is even better!  Great riffs as well.<BR>Rating: A-<br />5. Poison Was the Cure: The first bass part is good, and then the rest of the song is just simply awesome. The speed is good, Dave Mustaines non-high pitched voice really shines here, and the best part of the song is by far the solo. Though short, it is absolutely insane!<BR>Rating: A<br />6. Lucretia: Not the best song, but a cool opener and a nice little beat going in the song. Good solo, too.<BR>Rating: B/B+<br />7. Tornado of Souls: BEST song on the album, the first half of the song is a bit slow, but from \\"the land of oppurtunity, the golden chance for me...\\" on is just simply awesome. The solo is very good, and has a great opener to it as well, and then after that the song is very \\"endish\\" and symbolizes the end of something, which is the song.<BR>Rating: A+<br />8. Dawn Patrol: Not exactly a song...<BR>Rating: none<br />9. Rust in Peace...Polaris: Polaris, now that is a cool word! The riff during \\"tremble you weaklings...\\" is perfect, couldn't be much better, and the chorus is great, too. The Polaris part of the song lacks something, but still is good.<BR>Rating: B+<br />Definitely an album to get...
6305171769|5.0|Halloween: H20 is actually a very good installment of the Halloween series.  I liked how they rescued Jamie Lee Curtis from her next-to miserable performance in the first Halloween and made her tough, and sensible, rather than just a spineless whimpering coward of a teenager.  Now, instead of running from Michael Myers with his knife an inch from the back of her neck, she's hunting Michael down with a fire axe!  Is this the same Laurie from the first movie?!  (By the way, I DID see Halloween II, but she wasn't as cowardly as in the first).<br />I really get goosebumps during the scene when Laurie looks through the small circular window and sees Michael Myers (her homicidal brother) for the first time in 20 years. (Ever wonder why it's called H20?  H is for Halloween.  '20' is for the number 20, which means 20 years have passed since the 1978 Halloween massacre in which Laurie Strode (Curtis) and Tommy Doyle (who is not in this) were the only survivors.<br />After seeing the end of this, I realized that it was pointless to do Halloween: Resurrection if Mike got his head sliced off.  But, finally, we figure out that Michael knocked a paramedic unconscious and put his costume and mask on the paramedic.  Mike also crushed the medics larynx so he could not speak.  Even though it was the real Michael Myers that did the murders, it wasn't him that got his head chopped off, it was the paramedic.<br />Therefore, I urge you to see Halloween: H20 and immediately go to Halloween: Resurrection.  Both of them are real good, and I also recommend the original Halloween, Halloweens 2, 4, and The Curse of Michael Myers.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I came across Norah Jones' \\"Come Away With Me\\" at Border's.  It was on sale, and I thought to myself: \\"Oh, poor thing! Already on sale!\\"  But I picked it up on the strength of the album cover (she's pretty), plus I have always loved \\"Cold,Cold Heart\\"(it was one of the featured songs).  A few months later, I almost died as I watched her pick up 5 Grammies!  She is the absolutely best.  What impressed me was that she did not have to show her navel;  it would have ticked me off and I would have avoided the album completely!  America, have class!  Add \\"Come Away With Me\\" to your library!
0451169514|4.0|It was one of the best Stephan King books I've read!  The plot was so great and some of the parts are downright horrifying!<BR>Unlike other SK books the memories and flashbacks are relavent to the story, they are not just page fillers.  <BR>Don't be intimidated by It's bulk, some 1100 pages, it goes very quickly!!  When I first picked It up I thought it would take me ages to fininsh  considering Desperation was on 750 pages and it took me about 10 weeks to finish.  However, It went so quickly and the plot was so fast that I finished It in 6 weeks!  The plot is hardly ever slow and short chapters make reading quick and good.<BR>The reason I gave It 4 stars instead of 5, was because I felt the ending was kind of a let down.  I found the end to be too deep for the rest of the story.  I couldn't really understand the thing with the turtle but overall it was okay.<BR>I highly suggest It to any SK fan, It is one of his best!<br />Also Recommended: The Shining, Salem's Lot, Misery
B00000JY1X|3.0|It strikes me as I listen to &quot;69 Love Songs&quot; that the &quot;idea&quot; for doing an album of 69 songs must have come to Stephen Merritt long before the 69 songs did. Not that there aren't some standout tracks (&quot;Absolutely Cuckoo&quot;, &quot;When My Boy Walks Down The Street&quot;) but they are too few and far between on this massive and unforgivably self-indulgent 3CD set. Still, it's about the best album I've ever heard that had about 40+ mediocre songs on it.

B00005JKZT|5.0|For me, without a doubt, The Two Towers has been one of the finest movies ever crafted.  From the acting, to the peril, to the excellent battle scenes, this movie is almost perfect, offering an excellent bridge one of the greatest trilogies ever.  Being the middle movie in a trilogy is tough, since there is no real beginning and end for the movie.  Still, the Two Towers truly adds a level of emotion and energy that really makes a great feeling coming out of the movie; the feeling where you can't wait to go back in.<br />It's pretty understandable that die-hard fans of the books will not like this movie as much as casual moviegoers will.  There are many changes to the storyline within the Two Towers from book to screen. But carrying a bias against a movie because it's based on a book is probably one of the worst things you can do.  Most of the complaints over this movie isn't it's enjoyability or it's themes; it's because Aragorn didn't do this or Gandalf didn't do that.  To totally transfer The Lord of the Rings 100% loyally to a movie would be pretty risky, if not stupid.  Just look at the 1978 animated version.  But, anyway, some story needs to be sacrificed for emotional purposes.  While some decisions can be questioned (such as why Faramir wasn't used as a contrast to Boromir), others have certain belief to them.  Okay, so in this version elves help out humans at Helm's Deep.  Just because the book never said it doesn't mean the battle sucks or it's boring.  Did you really come here to see a movie, or just read the book all over again?  I felt the changes for the most part were nice, keeping the movie fresh.  If you think about it, while certain events have been modified and changed, the core of the story is still fully intact.  The Two Towers doesn't stray as far off the path as some seem to think.  As for the missing battles (Gandalf and Saruman, etc.), they're already hinting that these will be in Return of the King.  Boromir's death was moved to Fellowship,so it's not unheard of to shift these battles to Return of the King either.  If these are important to the story, they will be there.<br />Back to the movie, it's truly awesome for those who don't mind the event changes.  The Two Towers truly creates a growing sense of peril, and hits some very tense moments, truly showing viewers the danger that Middle Earth and others are in.  The battle scenes are massive and beautiful, and thank god that Peter Jackson doesn't cut away from the action every half second like some directors do.  These fight scenes never get repetitive or boring, and truly a sight to see.  The acting is also top notch, as well as just about everything else.  The Two Towers is also much faster than Fellowship, allowing for more action and movement.  <br />If you're looking for a great movie, than The Two Towers is it.  One of the finest adventure movies ever created if I may say so, it really has some cinematic power to it.  But if you're looking for The Two Towers 100% true to the story; you're better off just reading the books.
B000089RVX|5.0|Amy Lee's vocals are amazing....angelic is the best way to describe them.

0066214122|3.0|Prey overall was a good read.  I definitely didn't regret spending the time.  It's just that I was so taken by his work in &quot;Timeline&quot; that I may have hyped myself silly waiting for his next novel.<br />But hype notwithstanding, Prey is average compared to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, the aforementioned &quot;Timeline&quot; and &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (still my favorite)  <br />I felt that Crichton makes you go on a limb one two many times throughout the book.  Plus there is a certain awkwardness about the characters that kept me from submitting to them completely.  The result for me was a break in the suspension of disbelief which was an annoyance  because he almost always does a great job at keeping your head in the game.  <br />Nonetheless, Crichton doesn't scrimp on the research here.  (as with any of his previous works)  He is still the master of the fusion thriller and can get your blood pumping even if you're reading a tuna casserole recipe.  His knack for blending fact with fiction continues to be flawless.<br />The message of the book is unmistakable and much like the one in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; :   Man is intelligent enough to   cross the frontiers of science but is a virtual fool to ask it if it should.
B000088NTE|4.0|Lisa Stansfield has a great voice and certainly has had her share of one-off hits.  Her career seems to have dulled here in the US, but this disc is a great reminder of what she did really well and what we missed when the US market stopped pushing her so publicly.  This includes everything from her early collaberation with Coldcut to her more recent singles and includes a great remix disc of some of her better club-type anthems.  Worth a purchase.
B00007BH5C|5.0|As he did with the sound track for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Howard Shore has created a masterpiece in this sound track.  Even without relating the music to the movie, it is extremely beautiful and rich.  The music almost appears to have a texture of its own which draws the listener in, causing him/her to fall in love with some mystical world.<br />Shore has created a variety of different sounds from the classic, triumphant Lord of the Rings theme, to the majestic theme of Rohan, to the dark pits of Smeagol, Saruman, and Sauron.  This affords for a great variety of sound throughout the entire soundtrack, so it is very difficult for one to become bored listening to this music.<br />After seeing the movie, however, the listener gains an exponentially greater appreciation for what Shore did when composing the music.  Not only does each group have its own them, but each theme perfectly fits each group.  The Rohan theme, for example, is not only majestic but seems very Celtic and even \\"earthy\\" which exemplifies the people of Rohan.  Even the themes of evil are crafted in such a way that they express the differences between the evil figures (e.g. the themes of Sauron and Saruman).  Sauron's theme is extremely dark and overpowering, almost sounding as though it is filled with fury.  However, Saruman's theme reflects more his cold, calculating, mechanical nature.  So, indeed,  you can truly \\"feel\\" the differences between the themes and, hence, the different figures in the movie because of Shore's mastery of musical composition.<br />So indeed, Howard Shore has created an excellent score for use with The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  I highly recommend it to all!

B00004Z400|3.0|Quite honestly, the songs on Adrenaline and Around the Fur are much more interesting than the ones here. Sure, there are classics like \\"Digital Bath,\\" \\"Knife Prty,\\" \\"Korea,\\" \\"Change,\\" and \\"Pink Maggot,\\" just to name a few, but this sort of thing isn't really what the Deftones are best at doing. Most of the songs are really predictable... there's no more of the agressive/melodic changes that made Adrenaline so great. I would reccomend this CD to new fans only; it's a good start, but not really up to the 'Tones' best potential.
B000022TSW|5.0|There isn't much anyone can say about this movie that hasn't been said before. This movie was offensive, crude, and downright vile. I loved it, it is a masterpiece, one of a kind, with a good story behind it (like all Trey Parker films)
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo, the fourth movie of the Disney Canon, is one of the Disney classics that everyone should watch and own.<br />The story is timeless.  A baby elephant with unusually large ears is born in a circus.  Everyone thinks his ears are funny, except the baby, Jumbo Jr, who is cruelly nicknamed \\"Dumbo\\", his mother, and a mouse.  The mouse tries to make him popular, with very unfortunate results.  The mouse and the baby elephant crawl away from that disaster and into another one - they get slightly intoxicated!  But whatever Jumbo Jr dreamt turns into his triumph - it is thru his dream that he finds out he can use his ears to fly!  He returns to the circus determined to use his newfound ability to show everyone that he can be a valuable member of the elephant herd.  And, of course, he succeeds.<br />This movie takes you back to the days when circuses really did travel mostly by rail from town to town and created huge sensations when they arrived.  The tenderness between Dumbo and his mother are priceless.  The scenes of Mrs. Jumbo rioting in the circus when her baby seems threatened are fairly true to life.  The unlikely friendship between Timothy and Dumbo teaches us to work together no matter who or what we are.  One of the more interesting facts about this movie is that the main character, Dumbo, never speaks.  He gets all of his emotions across with a look or a gesture.  That makes his character stronger.<br />This tale teaches courage in the face of failure, loyalty in the face of adversity, and a triumph of a handicap over the troubles of life.  In just 64 minutes, the shortest Disney feature length animated movie, the Disney animators give us a story that will stand up to any that has been made then or since.<br />The animation is simplistic, but fun.  This movie had to be made on a shoestring budget due to the upcoming war.  And the fact that the Disney studios had yet to get out of the red, despite the critical success of Snow White and Pinocchio made it even harder to get this movie to the theaters.  Fantasia did not make money for the studio by itself until the 1969 re-release!<br />The colors are very vibrant and eye-catching.  It looks a lot more like a cartoon, but with the famous Disney eye for detail.  The \\"Pink Elephant\\" sequence will have you wondering what the Disney animators were thinking of - it is probably the most memorable animated sequence of all time, and also serves as a great anti-alcohol message.  Watch this sequence carefully - it switches from almost surrealistic to realistic to three dimensional to almost psychedelic and back again in just a few minutes.<br />The 60th anniversary DVD contains some cool extras - including concept art that has never been released before, the origin and history of Dumbo, a couple sing along songs, an animated short or two, and other goodies.  It also includes a sneak peek at the upcoming \\"Dumbo II\\".<br />This movie should be on everyone's DVD shelf, even if you don't have children of your own.  Great for grandkids and the whole family.rder to get this movie to the theaters.

B00006LLNU|2.0|I tried to get down to this, hoping the hype was deserved.  But all of these nameless tracks do nothing for me.  It also doesn't help that the album's lyrics consist of 4 syllables repeated.  If you are going to make up the language, at least make it sound good.  I guess if I want epic wordless &quot;rock&quot;, I'll have to stick to GY!BE.  Buy one of their albums to hear how its done, without gibberish and all this pretentious blank packaging.
B0000640SA|3.0|Don't get me wrong. This is a good movie. If we were judging he movie on creativity I would definitely give it 5 stars. But on the whole the movie is not as exciting as everyone says it is. I personally feel that the people who have seen this movie and call it a classic, got too carried away by the story (movie moving backwards). This movie is ranked at #10 at imdb.com! That is definitely overrated to me. Great movies like Fight Club and Ed Wood aren't even close to that! Well the movie has got decent cinematography and a very good performance by Guy Pearce by yet it falls short (by miles) of a classic.
B00005U2LM|5.0|I have been a Wu fan before the release of 36 chambers.And I can say for all the bandwagon commercial wonnabee hip hop heads dissing the Wu. Needs to keep quite! Iron flag is a classic , and tru hip hoppers have been waiting for the Wu to drop a gem like this.Rza once again shows that he is the illest beat maker on earth,and all nine clan members show that they still have the sharpest swords in the game.I will rate this album a close second to Wutang forever.For all the haters out there dissing underground hip hop.Stick to watching TRL and 106&amp;park!
B000075BFK|5.0|If you like any form of rap, you definatly should buy this cd. Every single song on this record is badass-I found myself putting the CD on shuffle and just letting it play, not skipping to no.7 or no.3. Especially good songs off the top of my head are Changed man, Fair Xchange remix, never B Peace, F*** Em all, Catchin Feelings, Thug Mansion, Who do u believe in, They dont give a F*** about us, better dayz, oh and Late nite is really good. Also 2pac is be coming back this year, according to the 7 theory, so look out for that. ESPECIALLY if he releses his next album 6/30/03. If you want more information about the 7 theory head to some other pac website. ...
B000002H2H|5.0|This is the follow up to Metallicas fist album Kill Em All.It is a bit more polished than the first one. I think that this could be their best album but all the 80s Metallica is great. Every song on this album is great. The first track Fight Fire With Fire is a great song and the title track Ride the Lghtning is a 6 minute masterpeice.Kirks solo is a fine one and satisfyingly long. Fade to black is a bit slower and not as much thrash as the other songs it has another great solo and somewhat errieness about the song that makes you love it even more.The next song trapped under ice is a great song that brings out thrash at its finest in Metallica.Escape is a timeless song that is sure to be a favorite and Creeping Death is sheer perfection. THe CAll oF ktulu is an excellent finish to a great album. This 8plus minute instrumental is amazing, how can they write those! in conclusion buy this cd if you are a true Metallica fan you already have it.
B00005JLXC|5.0|\\"Daredevil\\" brings to the big screen Marvel's Red-Suited Horned protector of New York's Hell's Kitchen.  Action and FX enthusiasts will be pleased with this flick and fans of the comic books, despite a few discrepancies from the comics, should also be pleased with Hollywood's rendering of their hero.<br />THE STORY:<br />As a child Matt Murdock is blinded in an accident.  After losing his sight his other four remaining senses become razor sharp and he acquires a type of \\"radar sense\\" that helps him \\"see\\" his surroundings.  (All of which are awesomely depicted in the film!!)  After  his father's murder Matt grows up with a strong sense of getting justice on the evildoers in the world.  He grows up as the dichotomy of justice, working as a lawyer by day as attorney Matt Murdock, and by night as the costumed Man Without Fear, the vigilante Daredevil, who seeks to obtain justice from those who sometimes slips through the legal system's cracks.<br />THE FILM:<br />Many will naturally compare this film to Horn-Head's (more popular) colleague Spider-Man.  Matched against Spider-Man, action and comic fans will be equally pleased with Daredevil.  The story in this movie is infinitely darker than with Spider-Man (Daredevil is actually better compared to his DC rival Batman) but the action and effects are (arguably) perhaps superior to the Spider-Man film.  <br />THE COOL THINGS: <br />The depictions of Daredevil's \\"Radar Sense\\" are just way cool and the action scenes with Elektra and Bullseye are among the best anywhere.<br />The filmography of the movie was also awesome.  One of the coolest scenes was actually the opening credits which featured the New York skyline morphing into Braille which then morphed to the cast and crew names.  Nice touch!!!<br />As a fan of the comic I was very pleased with the portrayals of the characters.  The scriptwriters did a nice job of capturing the dichotomy of the Matt Murdock character and the pure sinisterness of the Kingpin and Bullseye characters as well as the troubled soul of the Elektra character.  Hats off to the cast and crew for putting together a fine movie.<br />NITPICKING:<br />The big obvious flaw to the movie was the casting of the Kingpin character.  Any Marvel fan can quickly tell you that the Kingpin was a huge White guy and not a huge Black guy.  In the end though, this detail becomes minor as Michael Clarke Duncan did a SUPERB job with the role.<br />BEST SCENES:<br />1. Matt's duel with Elektra<br />2. ANYTHING with Bullseye (his scenes stole the show,  hilarious as well as action packed)<br />3. Matt and Elektra in the rain (something about superheroes, women and rain huh?)<br />4. Anything with the \\"Radar Sense\\"<br />THE VERDICT:<br />The Jury says you should definitely check out this flick whether you're an action fan, comic fan or just a movie fan in general.<br />Highly Recommended
B000002UTH|5.0|First of all, this is a GREAT album! I first bought it when it first came out on vinyl! Twarnt no CDs to be had back then! I love this album!<BR>Second, the dumming was done by Cliff Martinez, not Jack Irons as some of you have been raving about. That's the Cliff Martinez that's now a movie composer and has done \\"Sex, Lies, and Video tape\\", \\"Traffic\\", and \\"Solaris\\" and many others. He's also done a Pee Wee's Playhouse sound sound track. Awesome drummer, awesome composer.<BR>Back to Freaky ... it was my intro to the Chili Peppers and I've been a fan ever since. I recommend it to anyone that really calls themselves a RHCP fan!
B000000993|5.0|Some people say this is Tools best I would say that its between this and the masterpeice known as AENMIA.Undertow has more of a hardcore feel to it than Aenmia. The first song Intolerence is a great song and so is the next one Prison Sex. Sober the third song is addictive and has a powerful message. The next song Bottom features guest vocals by none other than Henry Rollins.The rest of the songs are just as good as the ones I mentioned but im too lazy to talk about them although Swamp Song and Disgustipated are defnitly worth mentioning. If your thinking about geting into Tool but not sure what album to start out with I recomend Undertow and once you get sucked into the wonderful world of Tool go buy Aenmia.
B00005O5JV|2.0|The real women who legally blond is based on was from Maryland and sued the university when they wouldn't let her hang a confederate flag up outside the window of her dormitory. its sad that someone who is obnoxious as that is making money off the selling of her &quot;story&quot;
B00007H1Y2|5.0|This CD is a breath of fresh air. Ry Cooder and Manuel Galbn. Great mix. Who doesn't like &quot;Patricia&quot;? And &quot;Secret Love&quot;, with that hypnotic feel. Or how about &quot;Los Twangueros&quot; with it's complex rythums? This kind of CD is altogether too uncommon. Really sweet stuff.
B00006AG5N|5.0|For anyone that does not own an Elvis CD or has thought of buying one they need to get this CD! This CD has all the popular Elvis songs on it and should have something on it for everyone. Enjoy listening!!!
B00006EXDM|5.0|...  In my opinion the Stones sound from the 60's is the best.  They sounded like garage rock from England.  With the Beatles to compete with back then they had to put a lot into their music.  Considering songs like \\"Under My Thumb\\", \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\", \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" , \\"(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction\\" and \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", I think they succeded in arguably being John, Paul, George and Ringo's equals.  No one can play the guitar quite like Keith Richards and it's too bad they lost Brian Jones because I think he did a lot for the band's sound.  \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\" are even on this album, which I believe came out the same year on \\"Sticky Fingers\\".  If you want a Best of the Stones, this is it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!  It is a great one to put on when it's a little rainy outside, and you want to have a cup of hot chocolate and read.  It is smooth, relaxing and soulful.  But it is also great for a romantic slow dancing session on your living room floor with your significant other.  If you like slow, soulful jazzy sounds you are going to love this.
B000069AUI|5.0|Being a fan of 'early' alternative, back when the term actually meant something, Coldplay take the reigns from the early greats and bring a sort of breath of fresh air to the over played pop and R&amp;B infested billboard charts. That is not to say that everything on the billboard lacks creativity or that it is not good, I am stating that it is nice to bring back that feeling from an era of music that will forever stay with me. Early days of 4ad, Pale Saints, Ride, Slowdive, Moose, Stone Roses, Chapterhouse...etc. and never forgetting the band that started it all, My Bloody Valentine. There have been those along the way, yet not so popular..but more than worth checking due to the emotional tones of their music, namely The Autumns. <br />Comparisons have been made, as everyone has this urge to 'label' or a need to catagorize everything for their own lack of understanding. Coldplay stand alone in these times on their own two feet. Watch for them, they will be one of the few that last.
B000002U82|5.0|C'mon, over 750 weeks on the charts,(which is over 14 years)almost 30million coppies sold, the whole wizzard of oz thing with it, and 9 of the greatest tracks by the greatest band ever, you don't really need an actual reason to buy this, Dark side is one of those things which every home should have.
B000002AGE|4.0|This album takes Jazz to a new level.  I'm not really a big Jazz fan but some of it I really like and this is one of the ones.  I'm not really into fast paced Jazz.  I like it to sound closer to the Blues.  Songs like \\"A Remark you Made\\" do, one of my favorites.  \\"Birdland\\" is definitely good but I think \\"Palladium\\" is the best.  The fretless bass works wonder for this album also.  The saxophone is better somehow than most of the stuff you hear by Kenny G.  And the keyboards I would say are pioneering to the world of Jazz.  If you like this album you're bound to like \\"The Leprechaun\\" by Chick Corea. \\"The Juggler\\" and \\"Havona\\" at the end make this album complete.  The keyboard work is reminiscent of Rod Argent. I doubt if there are many Jazz fans who don't own this CD.
B00008DDXL|5.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets was the best movie I have seen in a long while. I love everything about Harry Potter, because I am kind of like him. What I mean is that, I was adopted by some very nice people and i am now 13 almost 14 years old. I love how Hermonie is a sweet and very smart girl, I wish I was just like her, I love how Ron is a very cute, and nicly mannered boy, he is very funny, and he would make a very nice, neat and cool friend. Harry Potter, he is the kind of kid that you would love to be around,he is always there if you need a shoulder to cry on, he is always there if you need someone to stand up fr you. The DvD, is very cool,I am a very big Harry Potter fan, He has Bravery that i have never heard of, It's very amazing. I love to watch it over and over again. Why i love Harry Potter is a queation that a I have to ask my self, i love it because it deals witha lot of problem that the reaL WORLD DOSE. I Love the British Language, I have British in me. I can sit for hours and hours and read Harry Potter, I have read each one about 100,000 times. I really can't wait till the third and forth come out, I love the concept that the author, Rolling ,had come up with.
B00006V9A0|1.0|As perspective, I'm listening to the album right now. I'm fighting the urge to not skip &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; because I'm fairly certain that I'll then have to listen to the first half of &quot;Come As You Are&quot; before skipping to &quot;Lithium,&quot; and the vicious cycle will just take me all the way to the end of the CD.<br />Frankly, this is a good CD. The songs are good. The arrangement is half decent. The band is amazing. I hate and Coutney Love in general and  her track choices in specific. I know for a fact that Krist and Dave would have made better choices, and I base this on the fact that they've done so twice before. &quot;Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; and &quot;Unplugged&quot; are two of favorite albums ever in the history of everything. Krist and Dave (and Kurt on &quot;Unplugged&quot;) were major influences in song choices for those CD's.<br />I would probably rate this album as a 2 or 3, but I balance against those who rated as a 5. The entire album is a series of radio-friendly, bland, money-grabbers chosen by the money-grubbing vixen of court cases and commercialism, Courtney Love.<br />If you want to get into Nirvana, buy &quot;Wishka&quot; or &quot;Bleach.&quot; That was what the trio were about. This CD is what Love was about.
B000002KCF|5.0|To even think that this is Michael Frank's First Album amazes me to this day!!!<br />It's like Tracy Chapman's debut album x100...<br />All the songs and arrangements are superb.  The musicians who \\"jammed\\" on this session, especially Joe Sample, are just on the money.<br />Monkey see, Monkey Do and Popsicle Toes are excellent, but Nightmoves, St. Elmo's Fire, I Don't Know Why I'm So Happy I'm Sad, and the very endearing Mr. Blue are the cream of this excellent album.<br />Truly a must for every self-respecting jazz collector...<BR>Wish they have this on SACD soon...
B000000QFY|5.0|No progressive rock fan should be without this album.  I won't say it's great but I think it is.  The radio stations practically wore &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; out and shortened it besides.  I agree, the rest of this album doesn't sound like &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; but that's the kind of group Focus is.  I've gotten some of the other Focus albums but haven't heard one I like as much as this one.  This album goes good with the two Yes albums, &quot;Fragile and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and also &quot;Trilogy&quot; by Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer.  Actually the first listens will sound the best.  After the years go by the songs are too easy to follow.
0930289455|5.0|After Joker escapes from Arkham asylum he goes out and purchases a run down amusment park. Then he goes to the home of Comissioner Gordon, after shooting the original batgirl and taking pictures of her, he takes Gordon back to the park and tries to drive Gordon over the edge. All during this you learn little bits of the Joker's past.<BR>This is an excellent book that  shows great emotion from all the characters. A must-have for all comic fans.
B0000640VO|5.0|I actual;ly saw this movie the first time on Starz...l My brother and I were locked in the house on a cold and rainy day which was only brightened by this hilarious account of one girl trying trying to help others. I recommend this to any who loves to laugh and be swept up in the mysteries of life :)
0553278223|5.0|Although it was a little confusing at first, I finally understood that it was a collection of Bradbury's short stories. Basically, it is about men pioneering to Mars and trying to civilize it, but alas, fail, save for Walter Gripp, Genevieve, and Timothy and his family. The Martians, before dying out completely, had a few tricks of their own (i.e. \\"Edward\\" -who is a Martian in disguise-killing his brother, John Black) and they also can be civilized (remember the astronaut talking to the Martian?). In all, it showed how men tried to conquer Mars and make it their own, just as the Europeans took the land from the Indians. History does repeat itself, doesn't it? I think, to some degree, this book represents history, but instead of success, there is a great amount of failure. Gosh! People die too much in this book! But it is a good book, nonetheless.
B000002JSN|5.0|Some of the great bands eventually do a double album and this is Led Zeppelin's.  &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;, &quot;The Rover&quot;, &quot;Custard Pie&quot;, &quot;Night Flight&quot;, &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; and &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot; are highlights but other songs like &quot;Kashmir&quot; and &quot;In the Light&quot; got plenty of radio play, especially &quot;Kashmir&quot;.  Some of the songs are a bit lengthy, but if you like Zeppelin, you'll probably be glad you got this.  Disco was starting to take over at the time but not everyone turned on to it. Led Zeppelin's next album, &quot;Presence&quot;, didn't quite have the punch of their previous work although still a good album.  If they had wanted to they could have put maybe 3 good songs on each album and had twice as many but all their albums are packed with good songs.  That's why it seems that they did so much when actually they  only lasted for a little over 10 years and about 8 memorable albums.  &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; is one of the more memorable ones.  Pink Floyd came out with &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; the same year (1975).  1975 was one of rock's biggest years.
B000001FFR|5.0|also, this is anthrax's best from the 80s. among the living is said to be their peak, but this one out does it by far. if you like good, fun, but thrashing 80s metal, look no further.
B000050XEI|4.0|Although I'll still always think of Enya as a member of Clannad, she does well as a solo artist... despite the fact that almost all her songs sound exactly the same! Despite the difficulty in understanding her sung lyrics -- and the few moments it takes to decipher whether she is singing in Gaelic or in English -- the music of this CD is quite lovely, soothing, and ideal to listen to while at work or just doing things around the house.
0446677450|2.0|Emerson was a brilliant writer, and an inability to adapt to one's dynamic environment, on any level, including financially, is \\"the hobgoblin of little minds.\\" However, Kiyosaki is a businessman, not a writer, so one can obtain more enlightenment from an exemplar of RTK's true field, P.T. Barnum. I believe he said \\"A sucker is born every minute.\\" This book does nothing more than pander to the ignorant who want to lament and blame others because they've spent half of their life living the hyperconsumeristic lifestyle that is now biting so many Americans in the butt. I will give it two stars because, if you have no previous experience with accounting, or are uneasy in the world of money, this book does offer entertaining examples of entrepeneurial existence. For example, I found the comic book library story charming. However, the fact still remains this is information most people know, and if one didn't know, one could find in any finacial book. Don't expect earth shattering revelations unless you've been living in a cave since the advent of the Internet.<br />Also, several key points in this book are shaky. The author advocates high-risk high-yield investments, which, for anyone with a reasonable time frame, should be included in their portfolios. However, Kiyosaki doesn't mention the need for a short term emergency cash fund in case your water heater explodes on your road to financial freedom. All financial planners will tell you, any money that you'll need in the next five (for agressive investors) to ten (for conservative investor) years should be kept out of the market. Also, if you lost your job tomorrow and don't have enough emergency funds to last at least six months, you don't belong in the market anyway. Secondly, one would be much better off paying off one's mortgage than investing huge amounts of money in a \\"passive income\\" investment. In short, if your eggs are all in one basket, your house is paid for, you're out of debt, you're traditional retirement vehicles are nice and plump, why not try to generate passive income with low caps, mlm's or even a restaurant? However, hard work, education, and a will to succeed, as RTK so eloquently points out, are not enough. Most self-employed persons are not rich, and most small businesses fail.<br />This book is not special. If you're unfamiliar with the concepts, there are more dull ways of getting it. But the primary point of this book, along with the following titles in the series, is to sell more books. If you think RTK is the messiah of personal finance, whoop-de-doo. I'm for anybody who can get however many Americans to buckle down and think about their finances. Also, I read in one review where a reader was complaing about pension plans and cutbacks on health benefits. DUH. Pension plans are somewhere between the electoral college and fossils on the antiquity scale, and health care, well, that's a whole other issue. . . <br />To surmise, this book offers good basics. The details are sketchy, even unstable. This is not to say that Kiyosaki's advice is misinformed, most Americans aren't just in a postion to take advanatge of it fully.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|The movie's images have long stayed in my mind ever since viewing it over a week ago and I can feel as if it happened in real time. The whole movie was a non-stop ride wishing it to never end, the movements the words, the music everything was beautifully pieced together to create a beautiful film. Jake Gyllenhal is incredible as Donnie, it makes one believe as if his character is so real, as if he actually existed in our world and so watching it to the very end it really made me feel this love for him that I didn't want him to go as he did towards the end...you need to see this film to better get an idea as to why I am saying this. Even after the movie was over it made me question my own existence and where in time and space I stand in, much less this movie can lead everyone who sees it to question the whole point of destiny and existence in the universe we live in. I don't want to go and talk much about how I feel about this movie because its over the five star rating and I have to give it 10 stars, for the quality and the originality this movie has done that it deservers the justice of two great movies. The movie has so many wonderful moments that its hard to pick just one, but if I had to its got to be the last frame of Donnie and his facial expression that god if you really pay attention throughout the movie you finally put the last piece of the puzzle together and you understand that moment and why its the connector of the film from start to finish. I admit I see that scene and feel that there could be a final justice to this life on earth and maybe there could be something greater in the end. The 80s music is beyond any affection its like an addiction that you want to long for that simple time where music was so fun and original. Every frame of the movie is a masterpiece, a dark masterpiece, I recommend this movie be viewed by every physics class either high school or university it does not matter, this movie is beyond anything ever imaginable.

0345457684|5.0|In the twenty-fifth century, former military operative of the Envoy Corps Takeshi Kovacs knows death is part of life so he is not shocked to find he was killed on Harlan's World as a century long sentencing for his criminal activity.  However, he admits to a bit of surprise that he awakens not long afterward on Earth because wealthy industrialist Laurens Bancroft has hired Takeshi to investigate the murder of Bancroft.  The police claim he committed suicide, but Bancroft sees inconsistencies in the official theory that he blew his head off as he questions why he would do so since he always employs an electronic backup and has clones available just in case.<br />Having no choice, Takeshi investigates what happened by visiting the ratty underbelly and the hedonistic elite while assimilating and adapting to his new skin.  However, as the danger mounts, Takeshi's past life surfaces changing the scope of his assignment from determining who would want the mogul dead to personal survival because the threat of death this time could prove permanently real.<br />Though a superb blending of a who-done-in inside a vividly descriptive far future galaxy, the key to ALTERED CARBON is the ethics issues cleverly interwoven within the story line.  The plot is action filled, the earth and technology of the future seem genuine and real, and the lead protagonist feels like a twenty-fifth century Sam Spade not Buck Rogers.  However, it is the cerebral underpinnings that propel the audience to think of current questions on cloning, death, and the widening wealth distribution gap that makes Richard K. Morgan's novel a one sitting gem for fans of both genres.<br />Harriet Klausner

Do yourself a favor and don't get this album, and don't encourage them for releasing this album, like that they will never think about releasing a remix album of them. If you want a good album buy them get hybrid theory or there new one meteora. The reason why i gave them 2 stars is because of the cover pleaes not.
B00005MKRV|5.0|If you are a rap fan I really recomend you get this cd. Some people say his lyrics are just a little extreme, but it is still a very good album, especially for Eminem fans.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This CD has a collection of the best grunge songs ever! The all out headbanging \\"Smells like teen spirit!!\\" and \\"lithium!!\\" and also the sad and dirge \\"All apologies\\" all rocked!! Dude, if you really want a music group to serve as an outlet for all your teenage angst, then this is really it! The \\"new\\" never released song, \\"You know your right\\" isn't Kurt Cobain's greatest but its still awesome whereas you would probably want to blast your stereo when playing it!!
0375414053|5.0|While waiting for a train into Manhattan on a school snow day, trying to arrange rides for the kids with my cell phone, a fellow commuter turned around and recommended that I read this book.  I laughed through the entire book, and bought copies for my friends.  Pearson's Kate Reddy is the working mother to the extreme.  I felt like I was reading about myself, only 1,000 times exaggerated.  The amazing thing is - busy as I am, I still was able to find time to read this book in a fairly short time (less than 1 week).  For every mishap Kate found herself in, I found myself relating to her, whether or not I experienced it.  Definitely a worthwhile read.
0345448898|5.0|I think that the dark materials trilogy is an original masterwork that deserves to be read by people of any age. The characterisation is beatiful and the story has brilliant continuity. People have made a big deal about this book because it glamourises anti christian ideas or something like that. IGNORE THEM reading this book is like a breath of fresh air, if this is anti catholic then so is Paradise Lost.
B000060OFT|4.0|I love this movie.  Clare Danes is awsome and so is Leonardo DeCaprio.  I highly reccommend this dvd.
6305949980|5.0|I love this movie.  I remember back when I was 5 when I first watched it.  The title seems to be misleading to some people, but it isn't really what the title seems to persume.  It's not scary; I was afraid of skellitons when I was little, Jack was the only skelliton I wasn't afraid of.  There's no blood or gore AT ALL in the movie.  It's awsome.  All the characters are awsome and friendly (aside from Oggie Boogie, but that's a givin since he is the villan of the movie).  Awsome music.  Danny Elfman really out-did himself when comming up with the movie.  Awsome storyline.  Tim Burton is a genious.  Original storyline and unforgetable creativity.  There's no violents, but there is action of course.  If you're just cerious about the movie itself, here's a lil' summery.<br />Okay, you got this skelliton in a tux like outfit named Jack.  Now Jack is the Pumpkin King, able to scare anyone out of their wits.  Now being the best and doing the same things over and over again can get boring, so Jack looks for something new.  He ends up finding out about Christmas and loves it to pieces.  He even goes as far as trying to do Christmas himself.  Some things end up getting Santa Claus (funny thing is that Jack always pronouces it 'Sandy Claws') ending up in Oggie Boogies clutches, and Christmas is going all wrong.  I won't revile the end, cuz that always takes the fun out of movies ;) It's a great movie for the whole family.  I suggest you at least renting it and getting a look at one of Tim's greatest creations.
B000060P79|2.0|This is an okay CD. It sounds alot like Good Charlotte, and I hate them with the exception of three songs. A little while ago, I lived and breathed this instrument driven pop-punk monstrosity. There's not alot of variety here, and it all sounds the same. The best part of this entire CD is Mark Hoppus singing a small part on I'd Do Anything, but the rest just blends together. DO NOT compare them to Blink-182 (Yes, it has a dash in it). They may be called pop-punk, but they are hard rock kings compared to this [stuff]. If you are looking for something to really listen to, if you're a teen and you're [angry] at everything like I am, I would strongly recommend against this. Try The Offspring and Sum 41 if you're looking for hard rock, punk mix, Blink-182 if you're looking for all out stupidity and catchiness all rolled into one nice punk roll, and my strongest recommendation (this is probably pretty typical of a die-hard rock fan) Nirvana and Tool, Especially Tool, if you want all out rage and pent up anger to relate to.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|For all those who have not yet seen the movie, this is definitely the version to see.  For those who are die hard fans of the film, this review is for you.<br />I was disappointed that, although Kino International worked so hard to fix the major flaws in this version, they still left some minor flaws in.  One that drives me insane is, on one of the titles which explains a missing seen, they misspelled Freder and instead write \\"Feder.\\"  AHHHHHHHHH.  Anyone who knows German will know that suddenly the character is being called \\"feather.\\"  Speaking of which, I disagree on the choice of digitally translating Hel's monument into English, since this scene never even made it to the English audience anyway.  They should have left the original and added a subtitle.  Likewise for the phrase \\"Great is the world and its Creator.  And great is man.\\" above the ruined Tower of Babel AND the invitation to Yoshiwara to see the robot dance, which in all other versions I have seen has been in German, leading me to believe that Lang did not shoot a separate English version of this scene.  Another glaring error is that, in the picture gallery, a sketch by Aenn Willkomm for Maria's constume is inadvertently referred to as a dress for one of the girls in the garden (!!).<br />As for the digital restoration, it seems they didn't completely restore some scenes, especially toward the end of the film.  On the left side of the screen there is some dust or other markings which could have been erased, and a thin black line running down Freder's face in another scene.  Why didn't they fix this??<br />I also think the film is run too quickly and do not believe for a minute that it was originally run at 25 fps.  I have also read that the original score had to be played faster for this very reason.  The premiere would have been played between 16 and 20 fps, and subsequent showings by greedy theater owners may have sped it up to get a faster turnover.<br />My last complaint is that, unlike the otherrecent restored version, from Munich I believe, this version does not make use of stills to replace lost scenes.  I enjoyed the stills in Munich's version because it helped to visualize the missing scene.  For example, the photo of the thin man dressed as the bishop.  It's not as if these pictures don't exist.  On the DVD of this version, there are many lost stills from the encounter between Josaphat and the Thin Man.  Why weren't these used in the film?!<br />Lastly, I still recommend the other Kino International release of 1989.  The score, written especially for that release, is also good.  Comparing the two versions, this newest one gives an 'evil' feel to the city when you see it for the first time and the robot's dance at Yoshiwara doesn't seem to fit the music.  It is, however, still the best release yet.
B0000039QA|5.0|This is one of the best rap albums ever released, as well as 2pac's 'All Eyez On Me'. When B.I.G first came out, I thought he was just another one of those rappers like Nelly, Ludacris etc. but it turned out he was just as good as 2pac. 2pac and B.I.G. are both my favorite rappers (as well as Eminem and Bone Thugs) but it's a real shame they hated each other. <BR>Anyways, the songs to look out for on this CD are: Hypnotize, Mo Money Mo Problems, Notorious Thugs, Going Back to Cali, Sky's the Limit, The Beef. Almost every song on this is good.<br />It's sad to have 2 of the best rappers dead because both 2pac and B.I.G passed deep messages in their songs. I just hope they are both getting on well up in Thugz Mansion.<BR>R.I.P: 2pac, B.I.G, Eazy-E, JMJ, Big Pun, Big L, Lisa Lopez and Aaliyah
B000089RVX|3.0|I originally heard Evanescence on the radio while driving with a friend of mine.  We both turned to each other and had the same exact question: &quot;Who is that singing on the new Linkin Park single?&quot;  Well...unfortunately, the station never gave the name of the song, and not until watching Daredevil did I realize that it wasn't Linkin Park at all--well, not in title at least.<br />I admit that I really do like the sound of Evanescence.  How could I not--I mean I happen to love the sound of Linkin Park.  However, when a band goes and blatently steals the riffs from one band, how can it not sound almost as good?  I love the singer's voice, and the arrangements of the songs--they are captivating.  However, I can't help but get angry at the same time by the fact that the guitar riffs sound as though they were simply copied from the Linkin Park tracks and laid into the music.<br />It's funny....Linkin Park's last album &quot;Reanimation&quot; sounded like garbage because it didn't sound like Linkin Park--yet it was based on their music.  &quot;Fallen&quot;, on the other hand is not supposed to be Linkin Park but sounds just like it--Evanescence either needs to announce that they knew what they were doing...that the guitar parts are based on Linkin Park...or they'll never sell a single CD to me--I believe in holding some standards in music: this includes some attempt at originality.  But since so many formulas have been tried, it's very hard at times to completely separate your work from past work.  So in that case, you have to at least give credit, right?  Well...I'm waiting to hear it...ears wide open.  I'd have given 5 stars, but I'm still finding the music more than a little bit suspect.
B0000508U6|5.0|I just got this cd today and I must say it's very nice indeed.  I'm old, and I've listened to a lot of music, and this is truly wonderful and lovely stuff.  I'd say in the progression of contemporary music which I've found particularly compelling, I see the lineage as: Abbey Road - Joshua Tree - OK Computer - Parachutes.  I think you should listen to this.
0316666343|4.0|I was leary about the reviews ... how many times had I purchased an Oprah's Book Club selection, for example,  only to be disapointed ... and I couldn't quite grasp reading a book from the viewpoint of a 14-year old, from heaven yet!<br />But I was hooked, from the first two lines through the end and though I finished the book two days ago, I am still haunted by it.<br />Yes, Susie Salmon (like the fish) was murdered and we know who killed her and how; so it isn't a mystery and it's definitely not a thriller.  It's about loss and grieving and the toll it takes on all those who are left behind and whose lives were touched by this person.  But it's not a sad, depressing read.  I think most of us want to believe there is something more after death and Ms. Sebold has provided a most thought-provoking place.<br />Susie experiences life with her family, from above, as she yearns to be with them, she feels their pain.  She also wants to be part of all of life's mysteries that growing up offers, all that was taken from her.  And she offers us wonderful glimpses of her new life and all the joys that it offers as well.<br />I have never read a novel quite like this and I know I will be haunted by it for quite some time.  It is a great read!
B000089RVX|5.0|WOW! This is an awesome recording! An awesome debut!<BR>I was blown away by \\"Bring Me To Life\\". But then I read that the guy that rapped/sang on that song was Paul McCoy from 12 Stones. So I thought... \\"Ah! So the rest of the C.D. is gonna sound nothing like that!\\" But it's even BETTER!<BR>But this is an awesome C.D. The drums are freaking wild and tight. There actually... Can it be? Guitar solos? Yes! A lost art!<BR> The choirs are beautifully scary. Amy's vocals and lyrics are beautiful. Great C.D. It will not dissappoint. BUY IT!
B000008IVT|4.0|Never Ending Story and it's accompanying soundtrack is not all that popular in this day and age, but in my opinion it is a must for any child or teen of the 80's.  I consider it to be an 80's classic.  The music is beautiful, with an almost techno type styling to it, and wonderful to just sit and relax to.
0064471837|5.0|This book is excellent! Its about Sabriel, who goes in search of her father the abhorsen and battles enemy kerrigor and well everyone else has said it so theres no point telling the plot synopsis again but i absolutely loved this ...
B00004T9UF|5.0|... If you can look past the contraversy, the explitives, homophobia, violence and sexism you will see the work of a genius. <br />His second album The Marshall Mathers LP(2000) was the follow up to his debut album The Slim Shady LP(1999). He is part of a group called D12 (dirty dozen) and is well known as the \\"white boy\\" of rap. ...<br />Tracks 1, 4, 6 and 12 are 'public servie announcements, and ... takes of certain people in the musice industry. <br />My favourite songs of the album are Kill You, which is a rage filled song against his mother \\"... you think I wont choke no ... till her vocal chords dont work in her throat no more\\" \\"I dont believe in breathing, Im leaving air in your lungs just to hear you keep screaming\\" it is a very violent song, but listening past the literal words you get true emotion. Marshall Mthers is a song about the man himself, and how he's \\"just a regular guy, no-one ever gave a ... about\\" him till he was famous. My all time favourite has to be Stan, it is such a beautiful song, its about a fanatical fan whos twisted sense of reality ends up in murder and suicide. Its haunting chorus is a sample from the Dido song \\"thank you\\". <br />A lot of the things he raps about are misunderstood I think, when talking about the Columbine high school shooting, a lot of people thought he was agreeing with it, but if you listen to the lyrics, he is saying that when it happens in middle class \\"middle america\\" it is a tragedy but when it happens in the ghettos every day no one cares. He makes a lot of sense if you listen to the songs, rather than hearing the swear words and passing it off as contraversial tripe. <br />I would definately recommend this album to people who like good music, music with a meaning. It is definately not one for the children though, hence the Parents Advisory label, but definately give it a go, its worth every penny. I listen to it that much that the old biddy next door probably knows the words!!!
B00005JLSC|3.0|The journey of CHICAGO from stageboards to sound stage is probably worthy of A LOST IN LA MANCHA documentary. Over the years, I had heard rumors of Liza Minnelli and Goldie Hawn, Tracey Ullman, Madonna, all eyeing the chances to play either Roxie or Velma. Contracts and squabbling led to negotiations and renegotiations, and the project sat shelved and ignored for years.<br />Now, the musical has made its way to the big screen and the wait was hardly worth it. Yes, the score is basically true to the original theater rendering (minus some numbers, abbreviating others)and the dance moments are reminiscent of Fosse's original steps. However, the film doesn't have the energy or the vison of a real musical. Cynical by nature, bleak in subject matter, this certainly isn't MY FAIR LADY or GIGI, but even so, the movie seems self-conscious about presenting its showstopper interludes.<br />Every song in this play was tailored to present \\"Razzle Dazzle,\\" for its original performers (Verdon, Rivera, Orbach) were legends of the Great White Way. Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, and Gere are not musical performers in the same caliber. Gere and Zeta-Jones have musical-comedy appearances on their resumes, but Zellweger was a true neophyte, an actual ingenue.<br />It's Zellweger who anchors this movie. Despite Zeta-Jones's superior dancing skills and belting, full-blown voice, she doesn't really create a character for Velma Kelly. She's beautiful and can take a close-up; she doesn't invest her Velma with any personality. Gere, likewise, looks fabulous, but his Billy Flynn is devoid of the right sleaziness, the correct cockiness and bullishness. (Also, a huge fuss was made about his tap dancing lessons for this flick; yet he is shot in almost total darkness during his big routine. It could have been a dance double doing the two-step.)<br />It's Renee Zelwegger, with her breathy voice, peculiar looks, gangly body, and exposed nerves that catapults this into a memorable flick. She sings her role,but it's so much more than that. She attacks her characterization. She lets us see how Roxie is dying for fame, so much so, that she kills for it. She invests her song-and-dance numbers with honest-to-goodness emotions, and she uses her choreography to make her character both vulnerable and steely, abused and abusive. She is the tour-de-force.<br />Unlike MOULIN ROUGE, where director Baz Luhrmann allowed 95% of the numbers to be shot in entirety, permitting songs to flow from start to finish, CHICAGO's director Rob Marshall relies too much on MTV quick cuts and rapid-fire edits. It's as if he is distancing himself from the very medium he is honoring. It's a shame that the Kander-and-Ebb musical waited nearly 30 years to go on screen, and its arrival is at times disjointed and interrupted. <br />For those who want to see a complete musical, a show that rejoices in its characters bursting into song and movement, rent MOULIN ROUGE or some of the great MGM masterpieces. If you want a sly, wry, cyncial \\"black\\" comedy that occasionally makes a melodious point, go to CHICAGO. It may be a hell of a town, but it's not a hell of a movie.
B000089RVX|5.0|My musical tastes don't generally sway in the direction of rock music, but Fallen is a delightful exception. After hearing \\"Bring Me To Life\\", I knew I just had to have more. I ran right out and grabbed a copy of Fallen, and it was worth every penny. Each song has a unique feel to it, yet has an undefinable aspect that clearly marks it as an Evanescence song.<br />Amy Lee has an amazing voice, and (like the album itself) she seems to know no musical boundaries. No amount of recording studio tinkering can change the simple fact that she has the beautiful voice of a goddess, one that reaches deep down into your soul. Paired up with her excellent piano playing abilities, and the backing guitars, the end result is a killer combination.<br />While there are a couple of tracks I am not fond of (mainly Tourniquet and Haunted), I don't hesitate to recommend this CD. Evanescence has made an amazing debut with this album, and I can't wait for more.
B00005MAM2|5.0|It's safe to say that if you love anime, ..., this is by far one of the best anime I've ever seen (one of the first also). I can't tell you enough how warming it is to watch this movie. You run through all kinds of emotions without really realising. I could watch it 50 times more and never get sick of it; and that is exactly why its worth spending money on this disc instead of downloading the movie from the net .... AKIRA is the story of Tetsuo, an insecure young kid who's a member of a young bike gang in futurisitc Tokyo when political unrest and terrorism seems to be everywhere. These youngsters have no real direction in life and Testsuo finds his identity through Keneda, the leader of the group, also a chirpy, likeable and charming young man. Despite these faily simplistic plot elements, AKIRA is an anime that runs alot deeper then you would imagine and challenges you on several different psychological standpoints. Let's just say the story unravels quiet alarmingly to a climactic, enigmatic ending that you will be trying to decipher the rest of your life! One of the most enjoyable facets of AKIRA is the characterisation. Every person seems quite realistic and I guess people can relate to them on some level - mainly Tetsuo and Keneda. The animation is fantastic, if I'm not mistaken, AKIRA was the first of its kind to use cell based animation or something of the sort. The visuals are great for an anime made back then. The voice acting (I've heard it only English) is fantastic which is something you can't say for many anime. On this special edition, you have the option of listening to the original voice acting or the newley dubbed version which sounds much crisper (although I imagine many AKIRA fans will be slightly dissapointed at the new voices). The original voice-audio track seems a bit muffled in comparison to the newer audio but it's still watchable. I would not hesitate to add this to my collection any time. Those who enjoyed watching the Patlabor movies, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell ... etc (basically any anime which challenges your intellect) should love AKIRA, though there are those of you I know who will grumble about not understanding what is going on. Regardless, it's certainly wonderful to watch and I see it's made an impact on more then a few anime's since its release, eg Spriggan.... Have fun my beautiful readers, have fun.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|WARNING TO THOSE SEEKING REALISM: SEEK IT ELSEWHERE!!<BR>I grow increasing impatient with people when they say, \\"yeah, but it just didn't seem real enough!\\"  Movies are an art. In that context nothing you will ever see on the screen is real.  Personally, I'll take suspended disbelief over reality any day.  Want reality?  Look out your window.  Want a boffo night out with your best girl - indulge in a little vintage Baz Luhrman!<BR>Two words best describe \\"Moulin Rouge\\" - spectacular, spectacular!  This MTV revisionist driven ode to the 50's super musical is a stunning and ecclectic blend of songs and dances.  Nicole Kidman fronts as Satine, the performance artist/courtesan at Paris' most decadent nightclub.  She's pushed into a romance with a duke by her employer, Harold Zeitler (Jim Broadbent) but falls for a penniless artist (Ewan McGregor) instead.  Typical musical fare, but carried off with such flair and good humor that it's captivating to watch.  Even if you don't like musicals you will be hard pressed not to find your toes tapping during \\"Spectacular! Spectacular!\\" or letting out a hearty chuckle with Broadbent's take on Madonna's \\"Like A Virgin\\".  <BR>For conception to final cut this film has been in the mind of director, Baz Luhrman for nearly six years and it shows.  He's delivered an explosive masterpiece with all the trappings of an enduring classic.  If we're still not watching, enjoying and debating over this masterpiece fifty years from now I'll be surprised. Sets are lush and marvelous. So are the costumes. Everything comes off without a hitch.  <BR>Fox Video has done a handsome job of remastering this film on DVD.  There is nothing to complain about here.  Rich colors, exceptional detail - even in the darkest scenes, bold contrast levels and the absence of any digital anomolies, make \\"Moulin Rouge\\" a real feast for the eyes.  The 5.1 stereo mix is bombastic and clever, overwhelming the first time listener with its exemplory sound fields.  Disc 2 hasan HBO: First Look Special, some featurettes, outtakes and a host of other juicy tidbits best left unexplored within the context of this review.  BOTTOM LINE: You can't go wrong here.
6304493681|5.0|So much effort has been put into the making of Ghost in the Shell. From it's haunting, cultural soundtrack to the incredible visuals, to the intricate story - and it's more then worth your time to watch it if you have the patience and brain capacity to give it a chance. The story is slightly akin to the Matrix but not exactly. Entities have the ability to live on 'the net' as we all know it, a source of vast untapped potential which certain persons are hoping to exploit for their own ends. There are scenes in this anime which you will remember for quite some time, each of which are spectacles in their own right. Kusanagi is a cyborg trying to hunt down the Puppetmaster - an intriguing enemy who has all the answers Kusanagi's been searching for. But tracking the Puppetmaster may not be so simple as Kusangi and her partner are led astray several times in the chase with curious results. Watching GitS, you feel a sense of awe, intensity and I couldn't help feeling a little disturbed as well. You are enveloped in Kusanagi's sense of curiosity at times and at other times, on the edge of your seat to find out just what is going to happen next - the events are just that unpredictable. GitS is a fine anime worthy of the attention it's been given. It's mature and well made, I hope you like it as much as I did.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|In 1991 Disney's &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beast&quot; became the only film in the history of the Academy Awards to be nominated in the Best Picture catagory.  And although it didn't win (Silence of the Lambs did), the ripple effect that this landmark had on the Disney legacy was felt for nearly a decade afterward.  The story is based on the classic fairytale but given the &quot;Disney touch&quot; with talking furniture and magical moments that really owe more to a Broadway show than the Brothers Grimm.  <BR>Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were the creative team that penned the Oscar winning score.  But when the film originally premiered one of their best songs &quot;Human Again&quot; was left on the cutting room floor, an artistic liberty that has been rectified with this DVD release.<BR>You get not one, not two, but three distinct versions of this film on DVD.  All are presented in anamorphic widescreen.  The special edition includes the restoration of the Ashman/Menken song previously mentioned as well as an all new, newly enhanced IMAX hi-def print that really makes the film sparkle beyond anything seen in theaters.  The original theatrical cut is also included as well as &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beast: Work In Progress&quot; a wonderful version of the film, shown at a New York critic's preview that includes pencil tests of the film's art work, released before a final version of the finished film was completed.  Disc two of this enchanted Platinum Edition is chocked full of extra features that are too many to be believed.  Some seem rather silly - the dance mix of Beauty &amp; The Beast music video falls into this catagory.  <BR>About the transfer: The opening scene with its stained glass windows is heavy on edge enhancement and pixelization.  However, once these few moments are over, so are both of these distractions.  Overall, the visual quality of either the theatrical cut or special edition is outstanding.  The 5.1 mix is beautifully presented.  On disc two, the menus and some of the documentary footage also suffer from aliasing and shimmering details but nothing that one can't overlook for the sake of getting through the rough spots.  BOTTOM LINE: This tale may be old as time, but it shines like a new penny in this wonderful remastered offering from Disney Inc.  Bravo!
B000002P5W|5.0|If you are contemplating getting this album, but you're not sure, go for it. Any fan of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; would like it, but there are some key differences between the albums. &quot;Axis&quot; is more musically focused, softer and a little slower, and, I think creatively better. It is completely vivid and melodic and you will make you love Jimi Hendrix, if you don't already. I think it's a classic concept album, and I like the concept. Trust me, this CD will never leave your stereo.
B00005JL78|1.0|Set in 2054, \\"Minority Report\\" follows the exploits of a cop and his pre-cogs - his what?!?  Three humans with exceptional clarvoyance and telepathic abilities predict crimes before they occur.  The system is flawless.  That is, until Tom Cruise finds himself being predicted as the next killer of a man that he has never met.  There's a lot of set up to this story that really drags, not the least of which is an extended chase on a vertical highway that is so CGI driven it is impossible to take seriously and a greenhouse segment that is full of lethal plants and a long explicative scene between the women who invented pre-crime and Cruise, who is nearly poisoned to death. In between we have some chase sequences that are not very engaging and a few gross-out scenes that really turn one's stomach, including one where Cruise, who has just had his eyes plucked from his head, eats a really spoiled sandwich by mistake and up-chucks a few seconds later.  I'm not sure what Spielberg was thinking when he made this movie.  It's dark, in a sort of \\"Blade Runner\\" way but with a bleached out color scheme that is not very engaging or easy on the eyes.  In fact it's down right oppressive.  Just in case you were too stupid to grasp the general concept of the film (which I must admit, for the first 30 min. I was) there's a long explanation at the end of the film in which dialogue between Cruise and the killer tie everything up nicely - too nicely and too neatly for a film that teeters between action/adventure and film noir.  Unfortunately, in this reviewers opinion, the ultimate product is neither but a mutt - a mix of a little of this and that, that comes off as nothing special in the final analysis.<BR>As for the DVD transfer - Dreamworks has retained the grain of the original theatrical experience but somehow managed to make the film look so grainy that, not even in theaters, do I remember it being this unpleasant a viewing experience on the eyes.  Quite literally, if you're watching this film on an anmorphic big screen at home, some of the scenes will make you sick.  The audio is nicely represented.  As a two disc special edition, disc two has a truck load of extras that are rather boring to watch.  Cruise looks and talks as if he's just finished an all night B-movie marathon while Spielberg somehow manages to retain none of that magic spark that made him become a director in the first place.  There is a sense, even from him, that he's done all this before and with far greater economy of wit, special effects, storytelling and charm.
B00005N6KG|1.0|Either I am insane or none of you are qualified to review this product.  Personally, I've owned six pairs of these and use them for hours on end each week.  I wear them on 3-hour runs and I wear them in the computer lab here at school, so I think I know what I am talking about.  Firstly, the product design for these headphones is the best I've ever seen.  These headphones weigh nothing.  That is the reason these headphones are so great.  I've looked at other similar products by Sony (they make a model that look similar but are yellow) and by Aiwa and Koss and none of them are as good as these.  They're either a folding design, which is a definite no-no, or slightly bulkier and less comfortable.  The sound is good.  These would be the coolest, sleekest, lightest, most affordable headphones ever, except for one small problem.  They don't work!  <br />That's right, after moderate use, the sound invariably goes out in one ear.  This has happened in six of six pairs of these I've owned.  One pair I had lasted for a year.  Another was broken THE SECOND I TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX.  The Mean Time Between Failure for the six pairs I've owned is probably at or around 3 months.  So, to sum up:  These headphones are awesome.  I'd gladly pay 30 bucks for a single pair that worked for year.  Instead I pay 30 bucks for 3 pairs that, together, work for a year.  I'd write Sony and alert them to the problem, but frankly for an eight dollar pair of headphones, I don't expect much.  My advice is to buy six or seven pairs just to keep from running back and forth to the store.  Hopefully they'll work out the quality issues on this one and jack up the price.
0767821629|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites. While not widely known, it is fresh, ingenious, well executed and very well cast, particularly Gretchen Moll, whose beauty reminds you of Grace Kelly. There are ideological similarities with the martix, but where that film opted for FX and fluff, this movie opts for substance. I was particularly impressed with the feel of the roaring twenties they created. This movie has longevity and stamina in the same way as &quot;Highlander&quot;. You will find yourself rewatching and turning friends on to it as well. A true obscure gem.
B000084T18|5.0|It´s the best Hip Hop Album of the year.The songs Patiently Waiting,In da Club,If I Can´t,Back Down,Don´t push me, are fantastic songs.What up Gangsta and Many Men are also great.<BR>There are no bad songs on the CD.Buy this Cd! Buy this CD!<br />R.I.P. 2Pac the greatest Rapper of all time
B00003CXXM|4.0|While I agree with other reviewers that this film is somewhat predictable, it is nevertheless very engaging and entertaining, and I plan to watch it again. Damon is surprisingly well suited for the role and it doesn't insult your intelligence- everything is plausible. Think of it as Mission Impossible, only not silly like it was. Good supporting cast also. Definitely worth owning. A movie you will most likely watch several times, and still enjoy.
B0000039QA|2.0|Biggie had a good Flow but the lyrics are bad .Songs as Hypnotize,I love the Dough,Nasty Boy are great .But the other songs are not so good.....Biggie wasn't the best Mc in New York.<Nas and Jay-z are better
B00006JL1Z|2.0|This \\"Greatest Hits\\" package is essentially all it tries to be - a chronological history of the band's radio hits, and succeeds on that basic level.<br />HOWEVER, I take EXTREME exception to the HUGE oversight in NOT including the \\"single\\" version of \\"Say You Love Me\\" - easily the laziest and stupidest mistake in this compilation.  The producers obviously thought enuf to include the \\"radio edits\\" of the first 2 singles off of the self-titled \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" LP - \\"Over My Head\\" is soooo much enhanced by the rock-flavored loud cymbal crash that opens the tune as opposed to the lame fade-up you will find on the original CD, and \\"Rhiannon,\\" also, has incredible Lindsey Buckingham muscle-guitar added.  Concidering the fact that the inclusion of the first 2 single re-mixed releases ARE included, I find it downright sloppy to NOT include the most drastically, and most improved, single remix of \\"Say You Love Me.\\"  It was obviously poor original production on the LP mixes (certainly fixed on the flawlessly timeless \\"Rumours\\" LP), and to deny us the rocked-out version of \\"Say You Love Me\\"  which clearly kicked ..., and give us the lamer, weaker original certainly sucks!<br />Also - for PC CD listeners, you WILL have HUGE problems with Disc One - if you just want the tunes, forget it.  This CD has a major conflict in wanting to start it's little pretty \\"extra features\\" over just playing tunes.  You WILL be submitted to a good 3 minutes of video/audio conflict, just so you can see Stevie twirl.  Very disturbing.<br />However, the \\"SYLM\\" and video conflicts aside, it IS the best overall purchase for the whole catalog.<br />Just realize it has significant flaws.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|You've seen them all. Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. They all have hipsy-sdipsy girls who drop hankerchifs and want the princes to pick them up. However Mulan creates Avalanches, Fights an extremley dangerous army leader on a roof top and defeats him and defeats half of the hun army. I'd like to see Cinderella do that. The characters are also great. Mushu the tiny red dragon (who is voiced by Eddie Murphy) is hilarious. Shan Yu and the Hun army are perfect villains for the movie and the ancestors are funny. I always crack up when I see what happens with the Matchmaker.
B00000F3KL|5.0|An excellent movie that demonstrates the sacrifices made by our troops, their willingness to put themselfs in harms way for the safety of others and the cost when a Government fails to back them up for political reasons.<br />I haven't forgotten the sight of dead dragged through the streets in those days.<br />My wife's reluctant decision to back the president in the current was was affirmed by this movie.<br />Watch it and support our country and ourselves.<br />Of course politicts aside, the acting is great the action is great and you feel for these men, pulled off very well.
B000002HPV|4.0|Next to &quot;Post&quot;, &quot;Homogenic&quot; is my personal favorite Bjork cd. I enjoyed &quot;Vespertine&quot; a lot, didn't care for &quot;Debut&quot; (got on my nerves a bit), and &quot;Selmasongs&quot; was only so-so. I love the cold, technological feel of the songs. The only song I really didn't care for was &quot;Pluto&quot; which I found Bjork's screeching at the top of her lungs a bit unnerving to these ears. Compared to &quot;Post&quot;, &quot;Homogenic&quot; is a much more lush album with orchestral strings incorporated into the music. Mark Bell's production style is top-notched. I particularly adore &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Joga&quot;, &quot;All is Full of Love&quot;, and &quot;Bachelorette&quot;. The music videos for those songs are amazing alone. I do think &quot;Homogenic&quot; is a dark album but it is so beautiful. Definitely one of Bjork's best albums to date.
B004SIP6A4|4.0|NOTE:  This has moved moved from the theatrical release page, which no longer exist to the blu-ray page, but is solely a review of the film, and not extras or the quality of the blu-ray picture.<br /><br />  Based on the murders of Roxy Hart in the 1920's, which 2 other(non-musical)films were based of of. One titled [[ASIN:B0001FR54S Roxie Hart]].  The Broadway musical originally stared Chita Revera  and Gwen Verdon, and was more recently in 1996, starring Bebe Neuwirth and Anne Renking.<br /><br />  Roxy Hart is obsessed with becoming famous. She beds a man named Fred because he promises to get her famous and kills him(Fred)when she finds out he was lying.  That same night Velma Kelly has committed a nasty little crime as well and they both end up in Cooke County Jail. What ensues is the a story about what people will do to achieve and maintain fame  when nobody cares anymore.  When the initial shock of scandals wear off, the only why to stay in the limelight is to maintain a scandalous reputation through continued unethical escapades.  Thurs 2/7/13 A message that is especially fitting today with recent celebrities like \\"Paris Hilton\\" who's claim to fame was a sex tape, or the Kardashians or Miley Cyrus who live off of bad press.<br /><br />  The music is timeless, and many of the shows musical numbers have become standards such as \\"All that Jazz\\" and \\"When You're Good to Mama\\", which transcend their source material, and this recording is a little less abrasive than the 1996 Cast recording which I own.  Anne Reinking can be overbearing with her raspy growls, though none-the-less effective, whereas Rene Zellweger covers all Roxy's bases, she has the charm that makes people love her, and the hidden evil and deadly persistence that makes Roxy interesting and who she is, while her voice isn't extremely strong, it is very expressive.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is great as Velma Kelly. Singing all the songs with zest and making them her own, while not necessarily as strong or gleeful as Bebe Neworth, she holds her own. Richard Gere is a better singer than expected and holds his own.  The real suprizes her are John C. Reily is just heart aching as Amous Hart Roxy's poor  husband who she treats like rotten meat and Queen Latifah.  Latifah's \\"When Your Good to Mamma\\" is almost definitive, and John C. Reily's \\"Mr. Celophane\\" is vulnerable while not being slight in his delivery, which has been the problem with some singer's previous versions.<br /><br />  The film is beautiful to watch, and the camera work at times is a little too frantic at times, but it captures the story very while.  The script is tight, and instead of being a musical where people actually randomly break out in songs, all of the musical sequences except the last one, take place in Roxy's mind, which only accentuate her mental instability.  All in all a strong version of the Broadway musical with a message that will always be important as long as celebrities exist, and especially while \\"reality\\" shows remain popular.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amygleeful as Bebe Neworth, she holds her own.

B000002LEU|5.0|Being a big fan of New Order, I was awfully curious to hear what the band sounded like before Ian Curtis committed suicide and Joy Division evolved into New Order. So I checked out &quot;Substance&quot;. What I got out of it was an album filled with bitterness and angst. The music itself veers more on the punk side than New Order's brand of punk and dance music. At least with the first few tracks on &quot;Substance&quot; like &quot;Warsaw&quot;, &quot;Leadesr of Men&quot;, and &quot;Digital&quot;. The band's early music is definitely as sparse and minimal in terms of musicianship like it was with most punk bands during the late '70s, early '80s. Further into the album I definitely can see where the term &quot;darkwave&quot; was first came into existence. Joy Division definitely invented that term, especially if you listen to the dark, brooding sounds of &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; and &quot;Atmosphere&quot;. I must say that I definitely prefer the band's music in the last year or two prior to Curtis' untimely demise. Joy Division is definitely one of the most important influences in goth music today and one of the best modern rock bands ever. What little time they had together, Joy Division produced some of the most angst-riddled music I have ever heard. A lot of bands today could learn a thing or two on angst and despair from Joy Division.
B000089RVX|4.0|Don't get me wrong it's a great album, but it's not a new type of music as i see it get pinned so often.  Listen to Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, Theater of Tradgey, Mortal Love, even throw in some Nightwish. Silent Cry, After Forever and more.  If you Like Evanescence you'll like these bands and most of them have more the one album out, most have 3+ there all similar and have amazing female vocals.  Like I said Evanescence is a great album, but don't say it's a new style.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Very strong songwriting & lyrics.  Bowie's last album before becoming a full-fledged rock star.  A lot of acoustic songs.  Highly recommended...
038533558X|5.0|Some months back, I went to a bookshop in New Delhi &amp; found one copy of each of the Myron Bolitair series. I bought two titles as they seemed interesting.

B00008CMQO|5.0|I have not the words...all I can say is when I listened to this album for the first time I was floored.  They lyrical mastery that Ben Harper has pales in comparision to the ecclectic mix of musical genres that he and the gang drew from to make this album.  If you don't have it, get it!!

B00005YW4H|5.0|While Norah Jones' debut album could use some songs with a faster tempo, this record is a jewel in the midst of a world full of pop nonsense. Like smoke and honey, Norah Jones' voice soothes the weary soul and ears with a interesting combination of jazz, country and pop. Norah played in a jazz band with my best friend Rodney Engelbosch when they were students at The University of North Texas. She didn't sing the night I saw them but she did show off her tasty mature piano chops. Ms. Jones deserves every bit of the acclaim she has received of late, and her humble honest excitement is a breath of fresh air among pompous and arrogant bubble gum and rap stars. You go girl! Just mix up the song choice a bit more next time and you'll be around for a long time.
0790731509|5.0|Paul Newman is riveting as the title character.  George Kennedy deserved his supporting Oscar.  And if you remember the opening music from WABC-TV's Eyewitness News, then you'll remember this movie.  The screenplay is probably the best thing about this movie.  There are so many great lines that come from this movie.  (\\"What we got here is a failure to communicate!!\\")  Overall, this is great movie making!!  Buy it or rent it!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|I thought I'd just contribute my two cents in the ongoing Citizen Kane controversy. Having seen the film a couple of times, I understand why it recieves such accolades. I also understand why it recieves negative reviews. I will be counted among those who believe Citizen Kane to be a truly great film. Even beyond its &quot;Greatest-American-Movie&quot; status, it's a remarkable viewing experience. On my first viewing, several years ago, indeed, I had trouble staying awake. However, I watched it again last year, and I was completely engrossed until the very last frame. I loved it. Every bit of it, from the story to the acting to the photography. <br />However, its easy to understand why other such movies as Casablanca and Gone With The Wind are bigger crowd pleasers while Citizen Kane is pretty much revered solely among film buffs and critics. Those two movies are closer to the typical Hollywood formula. While they don't exactly have happy endings, romance is a big part of their storylines. Citizen Kane is not a romance. It's more about the man himself than his relationship with his wife. Those films also contain more obvious, straightforward narratives than Citizen Kane. Kane is more like a montage than a narrative. Most people seem to prefer a conventional narrative in movies. That could be two reasons why Citizen Kane isn't more highly regarded among the casual moviegoer. <br />I will say this also. The people who make the claim that Citizen Kane is the greatest American movie are people who are generally a lot more familiar with the overall scope of American film than I or most of the reviewers here. They are film scholars, not just casual movie viewers. People who see Citizen Kane in its historical context and not just as an old movie. People who see Citizen Kane in relation to the grand scope of film history. I cannot make the claim that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie of all time. For one thing, I have not seen every movie ever made and I'm not familiar enough with the world of cinema (especially the early half of the 20th century) to even begin to make that claim. However, the people that do make this claim are people that truly know the world of film and study every aspect of it. I'm not saying that you should agree just because movie scholars say so, but I'm saying that those who make this claim generally know a lot more about movies than the rest of us. <br />I wouldn't even begin to know what movie to deify as the greatest of all time. I don't know enough about cinema history to even think of making such a claim about any movie. However, if Citizen Kane is not the greatest, then it certainly belongs at least in the Top 10.
6304708491|5.0|I've seen a lot of complaints on here that the storyline is stupid and incoherant and the acting is bad. I have just one thing to say in reply. Don't take things so seriously! This film is GREAT if you're looking to relax. We all know the music is the greatest and the storyline, although a bit silly, is packed with great jokes. <br />Forget good film making and just let yourselves be carried on this crazy, worldwide adventure with the world's greatest band. You can't help but laugh along with the film!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Mr. Cash, at 71, Can not only still write great music, but gets better all the time.  The title song, &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; is a very profound piece of music which was written by the Man himself. &quot;Hurt&quot;, may have been written by someone else, but it fits Mr. Cash like a glove.  You can't help but listen with tears in your eyes. It's like listening to the story of his life. Great album!  A must have.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Just when many people thought Johnny Cash had retreated into retirement, he porduces this, one of his finest albums of all time. What's particularly interesting about this album is that it not only appeals to Cash's traditional fan base, it has opened up a new generation of fans, like me,who knew WHO Johnny Cash was but never knew how COOL he was. Not only is he cool, he's versatile. How many other singers could take my favorite band's song, Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus,\\" and improve on it? I was skeptical when I first heard about it, but it gave me chills to hear how Cash made it his own, wonderfully haunting and insightful tune. Same with \\"Hurt,\\" originally by NIN. I especially love \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\\" another classic made even more classic by Cash. This album has opened my eyes to a whole new genre of music---Cash music---an art form unto itself! So, here I am, at the age of 24, listening to Johnny Cash alongside Depeche Mode, the Transplants, Garbage and No Doubt. Who would have ever guessed! Rock on Johnny Cash!!!
B00007ELEL|5.0|You wouldn't expect anything lesser from the makers of Fargo and Raising Arizona, arguably two fantastic movies in their own right. The B L is a freaky comedy without any situational plot in particular but weirdly engaging in the theme and its treatment nevertheless.<br />It's about a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself the Dude, and is described by the narrator as the laziest man in LA  County. He lives only to go bowling, but is mistaken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with funny consequences. The Dude is played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, a potbelly, a ponytail and a pair of Bermuda shorts so large they may have been borrowed from his best friend and bowling teammate, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Their other teammate is Donny (Steve Buscemi), who may not be very bright, but it's hard be sure since he never is allowed to complete a sentence.<br />Los Angeles in this film is a zoo of peculiar characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro), who is seen going door to door in his neighborhood on the sort of mission you read about, but never picture anyone actually performing. The Dude tends to have colorful hallucinations when he's socked in the jaw or pounded on the head, which happens often, and one of them involves a musical comedy sequence inspired by Busby Berkeley. (It includes the first point-of-view shot in history from inside a bowling ball.)<br />Some may complain The Big Lebowski rushes in all directions and never ends up anywhere. That isn't the film's flaw, but its style -- ala \\"Go\\" and \\"Swingers\\". The Dude, who smokes a lot of pot and guzzles White Russians made with half-and-half, starts every day filled with resolve, but his plans gradually dissolve into a haze of missed opportunities and missed intentions. Most people lead lives with a third act. The Dude lives days without evenings.<br />Definitely a light hearted allround enjoyable movie -- something that deserves more than 9 reviews at Amazon! (as of this  writing)as of this  writing)
B00005YW4H|4.0|I did honestly think the art of the torch song was completely lost.  But Norah Jones is indeed reviving it.  This is a specialized type of song and isn't going to grab everyone like it does me.  By definition, it's slow and intimate.  <br />The three covers are songs that I hadn't thought of as torch song material, but she transforms them.  Of course, this won't please those who loved the Hank Williams, Hoagy Carmichael versions.  But they do sound good as torch songs.<br />Very good IMHO
B000087EY0|2.0|I expected the DVD to carry the original Lion King movie/story.  Instead, it is a modified story book edition with little if any animation, although the cartoons are all faithful to the originals.  However, it really fails in achieving anywhere near the entertainment value, emotion and wonder of the movie or theatre performance.  All in all - a big letdown.  The only saving grace was that the price fell dramatically by shipment time and there are a couple of neat little inter-active games that keep young children interested for about 15 to 20 minutes.  My suggestion - save your money; wait and see if they ever release the actual movie on DVD.
0375703764|5.0|Because Danielewski has melded a horror story onto a romance, filtered it through an explication of aesthetics, and plunked it all in a box of mathematical impossibility. In a sense, he's going after the world. One footnote, for example, stretches on for page after page, merely listing names of architects from the past several hundred years. The author has simultaneously cemented his story in the real world and thrown the entirety of the world onto the reader, in a sense daring you to try to absorb and comprehend everything. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; reminds you how much you don't know -- which just adds to the horror that Danielewski wants you to feel.<BR>To tell his story, Danielewski uses a number of typefaces to identify different authors and a variety of typesetting effects (a l e. e. cummings, Ronald Sukenick, et al.) to place you more deeply within the story. He has footnotes all over the place, multiple appendices, collages, two-color text (yes, the title of the book is indeed [pretend &quot;House&quot; is colored blue] &quot;House of Leaves&quot;), even an index, for crying out loud. If you feel the need to see which pages the words &quot;hair&quot; or &quot;melon&quot; appear on, you'll be set.<BR>I know, I know, the book probably sounds like a grab bag of gimmicks, a post-modern stew of pretense that's all style over substance. Don't feel that way. Do yourself a favor and buy, beg, or borrow this book, this &quot;House of Leaves&quot; that took 10 years to build. Don't flip through it, though; force yourself to start at the beginning and hand the reins over to Danielewski. He knows what he's doing.

B0011Z1BQK|5.0|A flawed masterpiece, like its successor, but this one has the benefit of showing Zep at its reflexive best.  That well tuned engine, Led Zep, is let loose with fewer restraints than usual.    The truth is, if they had managed to finish up that 'Swan Song' demo and fit it on the album, then Presence would have been balanced by a nice lyrical number and everyone would be singing its praises.    As it is, Presence is noted as a guitar album, Page's album, which isn't exactly unfair.  His solos are outstanding on this album, such as on For Your Life.  But it's by equal parts a bass album.  I know JPJ fancies himself an organist, and he's composed some fabulous parts over the years, but his bass playing on this album is perhaps my favorite bass playing in the whole history of rock music.  There's an earnest matter-of-factness about his playing, and hook filled skill as well.  There's Bonham's assault, particularly on that first number, Achilles Last Stand.  Then there's Plant, who is beginning to take on more mature subject matter, a trend which would continue on In Through the Out Door.  Tea For One establishes the new persona, the Nighthawk.  Well, it's been a long time listening to Presence for me.  It might be my favorite Zep album of all, because it captures the spirit of the BAND.
B000003TA4|5.0|Ok, my friend started getting into Nirvana, and told me I should start listening to them.  So I downloaded a bunch of Nirvana songs.  I had heard Teen spirit before, and thought it was awesome.  But I had no idea it was by Nirvana.  So I downloaded some of there other famous songs....Come as you are, Lithium, In bloom....etc........and I was emediently blown away.  It was the best rock I had ever heard, so the next day I bought this CD, along with In Utero (which I also love) and It became one of faveorite CDs.  However I actually like thier final CD, In Utero better, but this one is still great.
B00006CXXU|5.0|She was always going to be more successful than Britney with a voice as strong as hers! Christina is back with her second major album (not including the spanish one) and this time she means business. Her 1st album wasn't anything special, the lyrics were light and the vocals were often messy, but I can asure you this isn't the case with \\"Stripped\\".<br />Here is my track review (not including interludes):<BR>CAN'T HOLD US DOWN: 8/10- Excellent r and b track to start off with, shame about Lil'Kim's annoying rap though.<BR>WALK AWAY: 10/10- Superb ballad complete with breathtaking vocals, strings and all.<BR>FIGHTER: 10/10- Another excellent track with a raw rock sound. Can you believe this is the girl who was once compared with Britney??<BR>INFACTUATION: 8/10- A latin/pop track which sounds slightly like her older material but it's still catchy and groovy.<BR>LOVING ME 4 ME: 9/10- Sounds like Michael Jackson's \\"Break Of Dawn\\", a really calm and peaceful track.<BR>IMPOSSIBLE: 10/10- Just like everyone else, I find this collaboration with Alicia Keys amazing and soulful!<BR>UNDERAPPRECIATED: 10/10- Couldn't get more 70's funk if you tried! The nearest modern song I could compare it with is Beyonce's \\"Work It Out\\".<BR>BEAUTIFUL: 9/10- Another dramatic ballad with a big climax.<BR>MAKE OVER: 9/10-The song has a rock vibe mixed in with a little Latin spice (sounds very similar to a song called \\"Overload\\" by the British band Sugababes).<BR>CRUZ:9/10- A great mid tempo ballad which is produced by Linda Perry (4 Non Blondes).<BR>SOAR: 10/10- A gospel influenced ballad with some really excelling vocals.<BR>GET MINE, GET OURS: 8/10- The lyrics are a little on the bad side but the song is cool.<BR>DIRRTY: 7/10- At first I really hated this song but it's grown on me considerably. I'm sure you've heard it- hard beats with lots of other things being thrown around in the rhythm.<BR>THE VOICE WITHIN: 10/10- Christina arrives at Disney ballad land with this track, but luckily she hasso much power in her voice that the formula works exceptionally well.<BR>I'M OK: 7/10- Heartfelt vocals and lyrics but the actual melody is fairly slow and bland.<BR>KEEP ON SINGING MY SONG: 9/10- An excellent soul track to end the album on a high note (sounds like Alicia Key's \\"Caged Bird\\").
0671042858|2.0|If I hadn't gotten this one in an airport, and then was a captive audience, I would never have finished it.  I suppose if you were a big baseball fan, it would help your enjoyment of this book a lot.  The end leaves you wondering, in fact years after reading it, I still wonder sometimes.
B000009QO6|5.0|This is without question Glenn Danzig in one of his (many) finest hours.  If you're as much as curious about the world of Danzig outside of the Misfits (and AFI's overt worship of him) this CD is a great way to get introduced.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I was watching MuchMusic on TV about 2 months ago, I saw the video for &quot;Capricorn&quot; and I thought it was amazing song. I checked out the band's website and listened to &quot;Edge of the Earth&quot; and I knew that this band was an amazingly talented band. I recognized the lead singer's name, Jared Leto, and remembered he was in Fight Club, Panic Room, and Requiem for a Dream. He did an amazing job in all of those movies, by the way. After I downloaded some songs (Mission, Echelon, Welcome to the Universe), I knew their CD would be worth buying. I listened to the songs over and over again, and I thought they were (and still are) amazing. I am suprised, by past experiences (seeing Russell Crowe trying to become a musician), that Jared Leto actually did an amazing job being a musician/actor. He has some major potential and I know 30 seconds To Mars will become an amazingly appreciated band, and make it very far. Jared Leto is the first actor I have seen actually do a nice job being a musician. 30 Seconds to Mar's CD is DEFINITELY worth purchasing. BUY IT!!
B00006BXI0|5.0|This album was my first experience with symphony x and to cut to the chase it damn straight blew me away. The fusion of classical, power metal and prog works beautifully and the skill of each individual band member is nothing short of astronomical, they are so tight and skilful it hurts!<br />Comparisons with Dream Theatre are often stated but Symphony X have much more of a power metal feel as opposed to the combined rock/metal styling of dream theatre, metal certainly is the name of the game for symphony x. The neo-classical styling create great melody and harmony and with it's ultimate opposite (metal) the two fuse together quite nicely, the progressive nature of the band is apparent with the long complicated passages and keys which adds unpredictability, a feature so lacking with the mainstream sound.<br />The band generates its atmosphere and melody mainly with the keyboards which are right in the foreground with the guitar, they play off each other so well and as Michael Romeo and Mike Pinella are very close this special relationship really is feature of the magic. Michael Romeo's hard riffing and ripping solos with tremendous melody is a treat, he has such unbelievable control of the guitar he certainly is in the world elite, he combines the melody and awesome control of Iron Maidens Adrian Smith with the speed and technical prowess of Steve Vai, not too shabby!<br />The drums are highly skilled and technical but a little in the background and the poor production give them a rather artificial sound, my only gripe.<br />The best songs on the album are of 'sins and shadows', 'sea of lies', 'the accolade'(beautiful) and the massive title track although all the songs are strong with no fillers. The strength of the songs are that first time you hear them they will blow you away and due to the progressive nature you'll hear something new with every listen so in essence it gets better with every listen.<br />The vocals? well Russell Allen is quite possibly the best vocalist in metal today and certainly my personal favourite along with Bruce Dickinson. He has the required range from the appropriate heavy metal low range rasp to the soaring highs of emotion of operatic excellence, a voice you want to hear over and over unlike Mr.LaBrie who is just plain annoying at times, DT's Achilles heel. The lyrics range from fantasy, mythology and spirituality which is great and they are well thought out and structured but I'm still getting to grips with the meanings and story's because the music really does take centre stage.<br />The music will takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions, vicious fist pumping to on the verge of tears was my experience, it really does sweep you away. <br />If your into any kind of metal or indeed want to stray from the predictable mindless [stuff] on mainstream radio give it a whirl and you'll be a Symphony x nut 3 minutes into sins and shadows.<br />It's magic and texture has a Disney like quality for want of a better word because it has that classy, one of a kind touch with a sound that is brilliantly original and spell-binding, it just oozes class.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  I heard the song &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; on a local station here in St. Louis a while back, so my brother and I delved deeper into the world of Wilco (Thank God).  Well, we downloaded most the songs, then realized it was a sin to not actually own this album, so we bought it.  Every song is compelling and sincere, and Jeff Tweedy is a mad poet.  Believe the hype, these guys are for real.
B0000047CX|5.0|To date, this review has been helpful 26 of 27 times. <br /> <br />A college friend recommended this album to me. He said he didn't think I would go wrong with it, that it was pretty good. I had no idea what it was, or who Jobim, Getz, or Gilberto were, but I figured his recommendation was as good as the reviews I read on the backs of the album covers for music I had never heard, so I bought it. That was over 30 years ago and I still listen regularly to this \\"Getz/Gilberto\\" album........I don't understand a word of the Portuguese but the music is as fresh today as it was back then. It continues to touch my soul and smooth me (especially after a day with lots of rough edges), it lifts me, it soothes me and bathes me in warmth and hope. It is light, whimsical, deep, and beautifully balanced rhythmically.  <br /> <br />Thank God for CD's; the old vinyl disc was worn so badly. I listen and I want the music to go on forever; and for me, so far, it has.  <br /> <br />\\"Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitars, floating on the silence that surrounds us, quiet thoughts and quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams,and the window that looks out on Corcovado...\\"  <br /> <br />This music brings me ageless pleasure, and...as we (the music and I) recede farther and farther from 1963, its velvety chords just getter better and better. <br /> <br />\\"Oh, how lovely . . . \\"
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is the best album of 2002.  &quot;Fight Test&quot; starts the album off perfectly, and the rest is a trippy rollercoaster ride. &quot;In the Morning Of the Magicians&quot; is my personal favorite, but then there's &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; and &quot;Are you a Hypnotist?&quot; as well.  In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a less then brilliant song on this album.  I have probably listened to this album 100 times, and it still moves me each time.  Try turning off the lights and concentrating on the music, it will take you away.  Wayne Coyne and the gang really knows how to make a song dynamic, weaving crazy sounds throughout each track. Please buy this album, you will thank yourself.
B000003Z12|5.0|I have over 3000 smooth jazz CD's, this one ranks at the top.  The tune \\"Espanique\\" is possibly the greatest tune I have ever heard.  I originally had this particular selection on a tape which I could not identify until recently.  I've played this song over 200 times and never get tired of it.  Rest of the CD is rated A+.
6305508550|3.0|This movie has an amazing script.  Every piece of dialogue becomes a line that you end up saying to your friends at a later date.  Absolutely hilarious, and upon further viewings you realize just how clever this movie is.  The &quot;Damn It Feels Good To Be a Gangster&quot; sequence was the best cinematic part, whereas the rest is just brilliant character driven fun. Definitely worth the money, but the DVD itself doesn't really pack a punch.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The thing about Moulin Rouge is you have to see it twice.  You also have to get through the first half hour.  Everybody keeps saying how they could only get throug the first 30 minutes before turning it off.  When I first watched it, I sort of had the same feeling, but after you get past that first 30 minutes, you realize how really beautiful it all is.  Even after you are done with the whole movie though, it may seem a little strange.  That's why watching it twice can change your mind.  You know what to expect and you know it's different from most movies.  It also makes more sense because you know what's going on.  This is a movie that you learn to apperciate if anything.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok, now I only recently really got into Radiohead, so excuse me if I am not as hardcore as some people, but this album is really excellent.  I remember hearing &quot;Karma Police&quot; on the radio back when I was in 6th grade.  I regret not getting into Radiohead sooner, but I am in deep now.  Ok Computer is good stuff, it gets the thumbs up from me.
6305537321|5.0|This movie is wonderful!  I couldn't wait to get it on DVD, because the picture is so much sharper.  It is a must have for any Audrey Hepburn fan.
0385335482|4.0|I picked up this book with hopes of distraction.  It fullfilled my dreams with it's comic look at shopping.  As a bit of a shopaholic myself, I appreciated the detailed descriptions of the items bought.  It was a great book to read on a rainy day.  The book is a bit fluffy, but that is what I was looking for.  I mean, it wasn't easy to mistake for War and Peace.  After reading, I lent it to my 14 year old neice, who also enjoyed it.
B00005JLO2|5.0|Watching the Four Feathers was an amazing experience, shining light upon the true events which occured during the British rule in The Sudan. It made me proud to to see how the British empire had spread throughout the world.(We even ruled you Americans once!)<br />Long Live the Queen!<BR>Long Live England!
B000000H42|5.0|This album is a classic.It's also my second favorite<BR>Mercyful fate album.Lot's of great song's on here.<BR>Come to the Sabbath was a big hit and my favorite song.<BR>This was one of the break through album's for them<BR>and when they were in their prime.<br />All of the musicians on this album are very talented.<BR>Although if your not into listening to satanic lyric's<BR>this is not for you.Musically it's a master piece.<br />I love King Diamond's solo album's.But Mercyful fate<BR>is still one of my favorite Black metal bands.<BR>If you love King diamond's solo album's you'll<BR>love Mercyful fate.
6305014140|1.0|ZERO STARS IF POSSILBE<br />As far as this pitifully over glorified bloodbath is concerned, I am at a loss for words. This pathetic piece of work is something recommended by a friend. So, I end up buying it and find that to my disdain, it is not at all what it is cracked up to be. It starts with Jubei, a ex-ninja turned bounty hunter, fighting two random guys he seems to know and then turning away and walking into a forest where he meets a slue of underdeveloped characters.  Finding the plot for this film is like finding a needle in a hay stack. The grabastic character development went along at a snails pace, often jumping from scene to scene with no introduction the new characters. At times the movie would take a turn for the worst, featuring a LARGE ROCK DEMON RAPING A INNOCENT NINJA WOMAN WITHOUT A REASON OR MOTIVE!!!!<br /> I made myself watch this movie to the end simply to say I saw it. I feel that if individuals concider this, truly a work of art in its own putrid right, to be qualified as \\"anime,\\" that my days for the genre have been numbered.
B00007KQA3|3.0|An excellent transfer of this out of print classic, and a must have for anyone still hoarding a battered VHS version.  Director Radford's straight forward approach to the adaptation of Orwell's novel comes across cleanly and vividly in the widescreen DVD format.<br />A word of warning :  In an incredibly Orwellian manipulation - any remaining vestige of the original Eurythmics film score [which had been severly edited for the theatrical release] has been eliminated.  Extremely ironic in light of one of the underlying messages of the work &quot;Who contols the past controls the future,who controls the present controls the past.&quot;  The absence of the Eurythmics score ultimately deflates the scenes they had been initially included in - which now have no underscore at all.
0920236162|5.0|As an Education major and child care employee, I have scoured book stores and book fairs to find quality literature for use in the classroom.  I often utilize the preschool children that I work with as \\"guinea pigs\\" and rate thier reactions to such literature.  They loved the Paper Bag Princess!  Although I brought the entire Munschworks collection to school last week, I was asked (and often ordered) to read only thie particular story each day, and often several times in a day.  <BR>The children were filled with laughter at various points in the story, especially when I would flip to the page in which Elizabeth tricks the dragon into using up all of his firey dragon breath-the children would instantly yell out, \\"He doesn't have enough dragon breath to cook a meatball...ha ha ha\\".<BR>By the middle of the week, the children were reciting this story to thier friends and parents, and even acting it out (they enjoyed calling each other bums at the end).  Munsch stories are truly a delight for any classroom or individual child's library!
6305013578|2.0|Fritz Lang's greatest silent film, &quot;Metropolis,&quot; is a masterpiece of the sci-fi genre, with some thought provoking social commentary and an amazing, nightmarish vision of the future. In fact, it ranks among the best movies ever made.<br />But you wouldn't be able to tell it by this shoddy Madacy disc. A muddy, scratchy version is introduced by title cards that go off the screen and a pretty bad musical score. Things get so bad that first time viewers will have trouble even figuring out what's going on. There are also the usual not-very-good Madacy extras (Poster, Biography, Trivia Game, Credits). In fact, the only reason that I haven't given this disgraceful disc one star is because the movie is just so good.<br />A prestigious, fully restored and digitally remastered version with a full plate of extras has been released by Kino. Get it.
B000007NYS|5.0|This classic album is full of emotionally compelling songs in the folk and country traditions, boosted by the spirit of rock `n roll. There's worth in the Emmylou Harris comparisons as far as the material and themes are concerned but Lucinda's sound leans more towards folk-rock. I can just imagine how her music would sound if it had a fuller country instrumentation - still superb, but different. Her songs are literate, mature and emotionally gripping, poetic in a down-to-earth way. My personal favourites on an album of uniformly great compositions include The Night's Too Long, a song of yearning and liberation that reminds me of Emmylou's song \\"Red Dirt Girl.\\" Big Red Sun Blues is a burst of power that does have some country twangs and Passionate Kisses is a catchy love song, while Am I Too Blue sees her firmly in the country tradition again. Thematically, there are touches of Springsteen here too, as on Crescent City and Side Of The Road. It's poignant to hear a line like \\"My brother knows where the best bars are\\" when one is familiar with the title track and songs like Pineola and Little Angel, Little Brother on her Sweet Old World album. Many songs on Lucinda Williams have been covered by other artists, proving the quality of this masterpiece.
B000071K06|4.0|I think the Austin Powers series is the very definition of &quot;guilty pleasure.&quot; I have seen all the films several times (sorry to say) and I've laughed at them a lot (sorry to say) and this one is my favorite entry in the series (sorry to say.) It's just packed with great scenes (especially the first five minutes), some memorable characters, and the traditional Austin Powers catchphrases. Plus, Michael Caine and Beyonce Knowles give fun comic performances.<BR>This &quot;Infinifilm&quot; DVD looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous. The widescreen (2.35:1) picture is crystal clear without a scratch to be seen. It also has bright colours and a great 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack.<BR>Being an Infinifilm DVD, there are plenty of extras. There are a ton of documentaries, a strangely uninformative fact track, a commentary by Mike Myers and Jay Roach, Music Videos, Trailers, DVD-Rom stuff, and Deleted Scenes. The deleted scenes, however, are the one big disappointment of this DVD. I read an article in a magazine a week after the film came out in theatres saying the DVD would contain cameos by Elizabeth Hurley and Heather Graham, a scene with Will Ferrell's Mustafah character, and more. It appears that will all the Infinifilm documentaries stuffed on to this disc, there was no room for some of those deleted scenes.
B00000K19E|5.0|Take a combination of exciting innovations in special effects, an original, intriguing hero story, a lot of guns, and a lot of black clothing, and you have the single most essential part of anyone's DVD collection.<br />I've only seens some of the special features on a friend's DVD (sorry, folks, the thing's still shipping, I don't actually own it yet); they offer a fascinating description (for all the nerds out there like me) of how many of the special effects are produced (particularly bullet time).
B000069AUI|4.0|This CD one of the better albums released recently.  The two songs you might hear on the radio are &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;In My Place&quot;, and these are both rather good songs, with plenty of depth and nice sound.  Some other notable tracks are &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head.&quot;  The track: &quot;Daylight&quot; is the CD's lowpoint, but other than that most of the tracks are nice.  Worth buying, but nothing epic here.
B000002JR8|4.0|I had my douts about this cd at first, then I listened to more of it. I realised that this is a good album, but some songs I just don't catch on to right away so I gave it 4 stars compared to 5. My favorite songs on it are:<br />STRENGTH BEYOND STRENGTH-good song, nice and heavy<br />BECOMING-awesome song, nice guitar work and vocals<br />5 MINUTES ALONE-another awesome song,not too much I can say about it but awesome<br />The bottom line is, this album is pretty good. You wouldn't want to be lefd without it if your a pantera fan like most of us.
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|The movie is amazing, and if you haven't seen it, this album probably won't mean as much to you.  That put aside, this is a great album.  Each track reminds you of a particuliar scene from the film, and while it gets a bit repetitive (There are basically 4 or so main melodies, mixed differently), it's still a good CD.
B000002H33|5.0|This cd is just so awesome!! I love it!! Metallica have really out done them selfs this time. The cd is just sooooooo good. Every song is perfect. One of metallica's best cd's, it's a real history maker. Buy it now!!! My master commands it!!!
B000002GMT|5.0|It would appear that this album, when released, was something of an afterthought. Abba gold sold millions of copies, so this compilation was assembled for those who wanted a second Abba collection. Inevitably, it is not as strong as Abba gold, as the most obvious songs were all there, but it still easily justifies five stars.<br /><br />Abba had more hits than can be accommodated on a single CD, so there are a few hits here, although they didn't chart in all the major record-buying countries. These include Summer night city and Angel eyes (both British top five), Eagle (a big hit in several European countries, but not released as a UK single), I do I do I do I do I do (an early Abba hit in Britain, America and many other countries), Honey honey, When all is said and done (both American hits), Ring ring (their 1973 song which wasn't selected for Eurovision), Head over heels and Under attack, one of their last hits.<br /><br />The day before you came was the last newly recorded Abba single. It was a minor British hit but it is one of my favorite Abba songs, which would have been a much bigger hit had it been recorded and released a few years earlier.<br /><br />I am the city was recorded for a new album that never materialised. It is a typically upbeat Abba song, but is one of their rarest tracks. All the other tracks either appeared on original albums, or have been added as bonus tracks to re-mastered versions of original albums - for example, Summer night city is a bonus track on Voulez-vous. Furthermore, I am the city has not appeared on any other compilation (at the time of this writing) except Forever gold, a re-issue of this album and Abba gold as a double-CD. So Abba fans need this CD just for I am the city.<br /><br />For the more casual music fan, this is a great companion to Abba gold. If you don't have either and you want two CD's of their best music, you might consider some of the more recent double-CD's such as Definitive collection - most of the tracks will be the same, but a double-CD might be better value for money.might be better value for money.
B00000FCBC|5.0|The cd is sooo awesome!! I got this awhile ago not knowing it would be nothing but motorhead, misfits and etc. covers. Then after I found out, I grew to love it more. \\"Whiskey in a jar\\" is one the best songs on it, the song is awesome, I didn't really think that that was a cover, so I downloaded a bunch of \\"whiskey in a jars'\\" and I soon realised that it was a cover. That's okay though. \\"Mercyful fate\\" is another awesome song on this album. A bit lengthy but awesome!! I recomend this cd to anyone who is a metallica fan.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Ok, at first I had no idea about the kind of music that this group do... but I found curious the name of the band, so I search &amp; listened some songs on the net and that was it... i was totally surprised 'bout the sound that the band has, and of course, the voices of Lena and Julia. The album it's a mix of pop, rock and electronica and the songs are great well produced and well translated as well... and, plus, all the songs talk about young lesbian love between this 2 girls... &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; sounds like a Matrix song, very upbeat and catchy... the highlights are &quot; Show Me Love&quot;, &quot;Clowns&quot;, &quot;30 Minutes&quot;, &quot;All The Things She Said&quot;, and... well, all the tracks in the disc... this CD will introduce you to a whole new dimension in the sound of the russian music... t.A.T.u. is here 2 stay.
B000002H6C|5.0|I can't belive how some people think this album sucks!! It is one of metallica's best cd's. The greatest song on here is \\"one\\" and with all the bad reviews I'v read, no one even mentioned how great that song is!! They just said it was just a bunch of drunks screaming and stuff. This cd is awesome!! No one's metallica collection will be complete if they don't own this album. Buy it!!!!!!!!!! It's just plain awesome!!
B00006BTCA|3.0|I agree with a previous review...they definitely remind me of Kitchens of Distinction.  I'm glad to see (hear) a lot of new artists return to the [quality] roots of &quot;alternative&quot; rock, those bands of the 80s and early-90s that never really got credit for their efforts and achievements.
B000002HMH|3.0|Not one of the best of metallica's cd's but still pretty good. Sadly, only for 3 stars though. &quot;Hero of the day&quot; is my favorite song on the album.
B000002O4S|4.0|The music in this really is great.  I'm a big fan of the oldies and the 80's so for me there was no going wrong.  The orchestral piece written by Alan Silvestri is totally awesome too.  It's inspiring almost.  Make's me wonder why I can't write music like that.  Anyway, the music is really great, but here's what I think is funny...  if you look on the track list is says that Jonny B. Goode is performed by Marty McFly.  Um, maybe I don't understand the way crediting artists on soundtracks works.  But I don't think that is correct.  Especially since Marty McFly's real name is Michael J. Fox (D'uh), and the voice singing it was definately not michael j. Fox's, and third Marty McFly is a fictional character.  Why oh why do they give credits to a fictional character and not to the guy who actually sang the song in the movie?  I just think thats funny.
B00005JLXC|2.0|Having already detested Spiderman, my hopes for Daredevil, seemingly a lesser relation and a complete cash-in, were not high. I hated it just as much as Spiderman, but for entirely different reasons.<br />Daredevil features a blind lawyer who takes the law into his own hands by murdering criminals who haven't been brought to justice within the judicial system. Were this not a superhero film, that could be a fascinating study of a flawed character. However, because it is a superhero film, he has to be presenting as the hero whose actions are right and are helping to save the city. I find that kind of idea absolutely appalling.<br />Where Spiderman was overly see-through in its aims and jarringly imprinted American family values onto every scene, Daredevil is tremendously under-ethical, promoting the idea of taking the law into your own hands and acting as a justification for murder. In other words, the \\"hero\\" administers the death penalty. Now, I'm not in favour of the death penalty even within the judicial system, let alone for individuals to make up their own minds about when its necessary and to take it into their own hands to kill.<br />If the title character was really on a mission to truly help people, there'd still be no reason to dress up in that kind of costume. Because he's played as such a real person he just isn't right as a superhero - why does he want to dress up in a cape like that? Anyone who did in real life would be seen as a nutcase still playing out their childhood games. I just dislike the whole superhero ethic which promotes violence and suggests its justified this way.<br />When Matt does take off the costume, there are some touching and enjoyable scenes (otherwise I'd have given it 1 star) but the superhero sections are atrocious, immoral gore-fests which niggle so much that I can't possibly endorse this film.
B000063V8T|4.0|Season 5 was a mixed season, with a few episodes shining as gems and others easily forgotten. The opening episodes, which include &quot;Redemption Part II, Darmok, and Ensign Ro&quot; are examples of truly magnificant episodes which define Trek. Darmok, which inolves communication with an alien race, stands out as one of the best episodes of the season. <br />Two big episodes were &quot;I, Borg&quot; and &quot;The Inner Light&quot;. &quot;I, Borg&quot; has been critized because it injects humanity into Trek's coldest villains. The message in this episode is what stands out, however, as both Guinan and Picard have to deal with their feelings towards the Borg, and it conveys a powerful message about prejeduce. &quot;The Inner Light&quot; is an incredible episode in which Picard wakes up in another life and experiences things that he could never have aboard the Enterprise, including a family. <br />However, there are episodes which take away from this season. Two episodes, &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; and &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; are examples of such. Nothing gets accomplished and the only feeling received after viewing these episodes is something akin to relief that you can move on to a better one. Finally, Season 5 is the only season which does not feature an episode with Q, everyone's favorite God. Still, anyone who enjoys Trek will be able to see past minor flaws and take comfort in watching some brilliant episodes.
0316666343|1.0|I got two words for you, Alice Sebold - be bold.  I know it rhymes, but so what.  When I read The Lovely Bones, I felt like tossing my cookies, if you know what I mean.  Let's face it - this is a chick book - nothing more and nothing less.  It's about as P.C. and feminine as you can get.  After a while, I began to skim through the less interesting parts - i.e. the whole book - and found it utterly predictable in its theme and outcome.  I'm sure it'll be made into an equally horrific and abominable movie - so just wait 'til then, unless you really want to throw your money away or are forced to read this for some godforsaken women's book club.  <br />I'm sure Alice had good intentions, but, as is often said, the road to hell also was paved with good intentions.
0688101364|5.0|Rose did an excellent job choosing the recipes for this book.  Some recipes could be difficult to make if you are a beginner, but if you are an adventurous baker, I am sure you will be happy to get this book. The instructions are clear, every recipe has a picture of the final cookie, all in all it is a very beautiful book to have. I have collected all of her cookbooks, and this is one of my favorites.
0375701427|5.0|I read this book based on the recommendation of a friend, and I consider it some of the best advice I have received recently. Roth is a wonderful writer, he uses a passionate vocabulary and creates wonderful characters and in this book writes an engaging story into which the reader is drawn. It follows the hidden failures and internal stuggles of a man who had everything and by all accounts was happy and successful. His life, however, had fallen apart after his formerly wonderful daughter bombed a local store and killed a man. Watching him crumble and have to confront his deamons is fascinating. It is a wonderful novel and I cannot recommend it enough to any fan of fiction who has enough time to read an excellent book carefully.
B000002LBH|5.0|enough said. probably the best band ever. hands down morrissey is the best lyricist of our time.
0446677450|4.0|The book is better as a motivational tool than a guide on how to get rich.  He has some good points, but be very careful about the methods he suggests.  They are not as simple as he makes them sound.  In addition, there's good evidence he never did any of those things.  ...
B00005JKLZ|2.0|The movie has several things to recommend it:  The special effects will probably strike you as more spectacular than anything you have seen to date.  Simon Wells guides his camera with an artisic hand, gently leading us from epoch in time, to the next, with beauty, and panache.  Then there is newcomer Samantha Momba, who gives a moving performance as the time traveller's Eloi love interest, Mora.<br />I liked the remake.  I didn't love the remake.  When I saw it at the theatre, I caught myself dozing, somewhere between the apocalyptic Moon sequence, and Hartdegen's introduction to the Morlocks.  The acting by many of the performers is extremely flat.  The friendship between the time traveller, and David Filby--a marvellous corner stone of the original George Pal film, is greatly diminished here.  The slam bang visuals overwhelm the characters, I think.  Part of the problem is the score.  Many people hold Klaus Badelt's musical landscape in very high regard.  And hearing it alone, on CD, I can understand why.  However, when the soundtrack is heard, in tandem with the images in the film, it becomes extremely ponderous, and slow moving.<br />I purchased the remake because of my fondness for the Wells novel, and for the 1961 film version.  It's not terrible, but I think I'd wait for a used copy to come along, or maybe pick it up in some discount bin.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm most impressed by the stunning range of Amy's voice  -- at times it is angelic, pure and clear -- yet at others she sounds slightly gravelly and a touch angsty, almost like Shirley Manson (of Garbage).  I can't think of a single other singer whose voice possesses the purity of someone like say, Sarah Maclachlan as well as a more Manson-like rich, textured sound. Incredible versatility.<br />The instrumentals and arrangements are also excellent. <br />The rock/guitar riffs at times are truly invigorating -- the opening/guitar theme to 'Whisper', the guitar interlude towards the end of 'Imaginary'<br />Ethereal pads/effects, angelic background vocals in many songs provide a nice contrast to the metal-rock basis of the band.<br />There are some extraordinary piano moments also, such as in 'My Immortal' and 'Hello'.<br />'Going Under', my personal favorite, is pretty pop, and undeniably catchy...expertly mixed, with breathtaking contrast between the harsh/glorious moments of the song, as well as the fantastic opening which reveals the sexy depth of Amy Lee's voice.<br />'Tourniquet' has some beautiful electro-industrial moments reminiscent of Garbage, as well as hauntingly dark lyrics. I find myself wishing there were a bit more of the electronic touch, as these moments are usually breif, both here and in 'My Last Breath'.<br />There is an obvious spiritual undertone to many of the songs, which some might write off as 'Christian Rock' -- this would be a grave mistake, however. The spiritual message in Evanescence's music is refreshing -- englightening without being preachy. And because the spiritual songs in the album are sung in the first person, a personal psychological and spiritual journery is implied rather than proselytism.<br />All around, fantastic album and superbly talented group.
1400031346|5.0|A deightful easy read that will chase away all your troubles. I'm now a great fan of the # 1 Ladies Detective Agency and have read all three books in the series.  I hope that there will be many more wonderful adventures with Mma. Ramotswe----soon, now that I'm hooked!
B000000WFF|5.0|I was rummaging through my old CD's today and came across the Spice Girls. I remember 7 years ago when I first heard \\"Wannabe\\" and I went wild! Awesome song!<br />Anyway, back to the album: Spice World was an AWESOME movie and this soundtrack is an awesome trip down memory lane!
B0000025DT|5.0|This album is one the best Rock albums of all time easily and features Jeff Lynne's songwriting at it's greatest.  TIGHTROPE, probably an overlooked classic, kicks off a New World Record incredibly, great song, good lyrics, nice rythem guitar, brilliant strings, and nice touches with hand clapping and backround lyrics.  Followed by the hit TELEPHONE LINE which is a great love song, with great singing and strings.  ROCKARIA! is a pleasure to listen to with nice guitar, drums and a very risky opera singer move by Lynne, brilliant.  MISSION just got me lost in my mind with headphones on, it's got a nice little instrumental in the chorus.  SO FINE is another overlooked classic.  It's got a catchy tune with exellent strings.  The bass by Kelly in this song is awesome.  LIVIN THING is one of ELO's biggest hits with some nice acoustic guitar, drums, and strings in it.  ABOVE THE CLOUDS is short but sweet to listen to.  DO YA just has great everything, although the guitar is very basic, it's great in the song and it's rock'n'roll.  Finishing it off with flowing SHANGRI-LA which is somewhat of a tribute to the beatles?  But I like it.  Not one weak track on this album, which is very rare sometimes, great work and classic.
B0000029DD|5.0|I am usually suspicious of hype of any kind but with this album it is truly deserved. Jeff was a very talented and diverse vocalist and guitarist. He is the perfect musician that has the capability to move a listener into his world. This is a very convincing debut album. The album features ten songs of acoustic guitar heaven and also some quiter numbers like &quot;hallelujlah&quot;, &quot;corpus christi carol&quot; were Jeff shows great vocal delicacy. My favourites are &quot;last goodbye&quot;, &quot;so real&quot;, &quot;lover&quot; and &quot;eternal life&quot;<br />Its been 8 years but this album is still uplifting and beautiful. I remember working one night when I heard that Jeff drowned and how sad I was (tears). This album was released on Sony music and it is very sad to see the steady decline of mainstream music since.<br />I have since found the same passion in Dutch band The Gathering with their heavenly singer Anneke Van Giersbergen. I highly recommend that you check out their albums: Mandylion, Nighttime Birds, How to measure a planet?, If then Else and the soon to be released Souvenirs.
