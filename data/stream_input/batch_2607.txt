B000GCFBQU|5.0|I love this author's edgy look at life and a subject that might be considered overdone - small town bickering, naïve minister trying to relate to his congregation.  She is truly one of our top contemporary writers and I look forward to her next book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the most awesome racing game I ever played<br />In the world I mean the cars everythin is awsome about it
B0086213XW|2.0|One of the slowest, dullest movies I have ever seen. I only watched it all the way through because I thought something must be going to happen. Likeable characters but too SLOW!!!
B000H5TVJY|2.0|Well it was just alittle bit off the wall for me.I was disappointed with the story and Christian Bale. SAD
1451695195|4.0|Experiences from the other side.<br />An interesting chronicle of Dr Eben Alexander's Near Death Experience (NDE).  Since the dawn of man, individuals have spoken and written about the NDE phenomenon in supernatural terms.  An experience that excites the masses and gives hope to life after death, yet is not strongly embraced by the scientific community.  Rather, science and the medical field tries to explain this universally accepted occurrence in the starkest of scientific medical terms.  Yet, in the end, the reality of it all is scientifically inexplicable as Dr Eben Alexander personally shows.  As Hamlet so eloquently mused , \\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\\"  The fundamental truth of it all is that life and death are more than a simple worldly journey,  but rather a passage to a higher plane of consciousness and understanding.  Dr Alexander, a neurosurgeon, explains his NDE passage in a combination of metaphysical, spiritual and scientific terms to help us better grasp his life altering experience.<br />Proof of Heaven will not answer the profundity of life or the enigma that is God, but it will give insight into the next step after the body ceases to exist.  To possibly think the meaning of it all is a paltry few years in an aging body only to cease ALL existence when the life force ends, is an illogically flawed concept.  Yet proving heaven exists through the scientific method is equally an impossibility.  Dr Alexander's  documented and reasoned after death logic strengthens the personal mystery of faith and gives hope to eternal life.  In the end the mystery of faith appears to be the determining factor.<br />I think you will find the Doctor's personal faith transformation and dramatic final dilemma resolution to be not only gripping but astonishing.<br />Dr Alexander includes an excellent reading list at the end of the book for further NDE study.<br />Recommended for anyone interested in the enigmatic mysteries of life after death as represented by the Near Death Experience.  This is NOT a religious book per se, although it does deal with the  fundamental esoteric issues of Life after Death.  As always, it is for the reader to draw their own personal informed conclusions.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|Was a decent movie...I liked how things seem to fall apart but came together. I liked the cast that was picked.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I am a big fan of Mr. Gaimen but I am dissapointed with this book.  A child caught on the edge of a magical world and in danger by the creatures that live there.  Sound familir?  (Coraline)  With the exception of one scene (what the boy saw through the window after climbing down the drain pipe) this book was no more &#34;adult&#34; than Coraline or The Graveyard Book, which I thought were better .
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|One of those movies you can relate to..just a good story.Ive watched this movie a few times...and Ill watch 3 more times.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|It's late, I couldn't put it down. Had to finish. Now, I cannot stop thinking of this amazingly sick family. Brutal, at times, yes. But, I just couldn't stop reading. Self-harm?...eerie!

B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|I find this app to be misleading and here are the three reasons: 1 The controls are difficult 2 It is ripping off Toca Boca 3 You have to pay to unlock things
030758836X|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have EVER tried to read.  There is not one likable character in the entire book; they are either psychopathic or just weird.  The ending makes no sense.  I am just sorry I wasted my time with any of this author's books.  Gone Girl is the second book of hers that I have read but I will never, ever read anything else by her.

B00B29J0I6|3.0|cute graphics and story. challenging, I wish there were hints. anyway, it is the FAOTD, so definitely worth getting!<br />its basically a physics based puzzle game where the robot is trying to get into a box. he's usually on top of other boxes, and you make him fall into the box that's your goal by tapping on the boxes he's on to make them disappear. its all about timing and tapping the right box.
B00005N6KG|3.0|Great sound quality but I cant get the cord to relax.  I have used this at least 20 times now and the cord still has its original folds from packaging, which looks silly at the gym and it keeps bouncing up at me when Im on the eliptical.  (Yes, I am aware of how strange that sounds but no better way of describing it!)
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I just got the game a few days ago and I have completed almost every level!! you slide the jello (it doesn't look like pudding to me) and connect them while trying not to slide off the table. it can get pretty complicated in later levels, but its never too hard. cute graphics and sound effects!<br />my only complaint is the ads. I don't really care about ads in free games, but sometimes the game freezes when it try to exit the ad.<br />I definitely recommend this game!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful show!  Believable characters.  Phenomenal staging!  I am now &#34;hooked&#34;!  Thank goodness for my Kindle which enabled me to view all three seasons!

B008JFUTT0|5.0|One of the most unique life stories I've ever heard. It is heartwarming & heartbreaking all at the same time. Imagine being a superstar & not even knowing it - if not for 2 people across the world who take on the task of locating a man whose music so impacted their lives they just wanted to know more about him.  Music lover or not you are sure to be moved by this incredible story.<br />Kudos to a first time film maker Malik Bendjelloul who made this film with `soul'.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|Awesome interface !! I'm using it with garage band on my Mac and it sounds great . I've used analog and condenser mics as well as playing bass and guitar with my pedals hooked right into this thing and no problems. Both tracks sound great when recording at the same time. I would recommend this product to anyone, my only regret is not getting the 8i6 or something bigger, it's just a little to hard when recording drums with only two mics.. But other than that very well built.

0307730700|5.0|Fearless by Eric Blehm recounts the story of Adam Brown who came out of the womb a fighter. He was an individual that ran headlong into anything and everything. With a can-do spirit, Adam climbed his way up to the elite of America's warriors.<br /><br />Respectful, compassionate, funny, Brown was a very likable person. Two women had a profound impact on him. One brought him to incredible lows that changed him dramatically. Another was God's gift to him, giving him stability, courage, a reason to live and return home.<br /><br />Coming from Arkansas, Adam was thoroughly country. If you didn't already know he became a Navy SEAL, his escapades would make you laugh, cringe and worry whether this boy would ever make it to adulthood. Yet make it he did and then some. Despite setbacks, Adam succeeded well beyond any preconceived ideas of his abilities.<br /><br />His fighting spirit caused him to achieve things he should never have been able to acquire. Not only did he help himself but whatever team he was on, whether civilian or military, others benefited from his presence, his ability to push on through pain and his can-do attitude.<br /><br />Even while serving in the war zone, Adam made a name for himself. It wasn't just a war of us versus them. His heart for children was demonstrated, whether those children were his own, American or foreign born, it didn't matter to him.<br /><br />Reading the back cover, you will discover that Adam would die fighting for his country. One of the most moving scenes in the book is the one where military personnel, including some friends of Adam, ring the doorbell of his home to tell his wife that Adam was gone. It was only eclipsed by the account of his children finding out that their daddy went to be with Jesus and therefore wouldn't be coming home to them again.<br /><br />It is difficult not to get emotional about this book. You will laugh, be concerned, tear up or even cry from what you find between its covers. If there is only onebook you read from the War on Terror, choose this one. I recommend it wholeheartedly.<br /><br />This book was provided to me by Waterbrook Multnomah for review purposes.<br /><br />http://beacon2light.blogspot.com/2013/06/adam-brown-fighter-family-man-country.html
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman's new book is a pleasure to read.  It's novel length, maybe, because it's a short, compact read.  Also, strangely, it has a shallow plot but reads deep.  That's me just having fun with the ocean part of the title, of course, but it's also true of the narrative.<br /><br />The story begins at a somewhat plodding pace and I was almost tempted to put it away and start something else that hooked me immediately.  I'm glad I didn't, because once this story had hold of me, I couldn't let go.  Interesting stuff, not threatening so much, just kept happening.<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of a grown man who's remembering his childhood.  We don't get a name for him, and we don't even know whose funeral he was attending at the beginning of the novel.  I still don't know why the present day prologue and epilogue were even used other than to say the story took place forty years ago.<br /><br />The boy's childhood is positively Dickensian, a series of events that just breaks your heart again and again as he loses so many things in his life.  By the time he meets Lettie Hempstock, you're all but emotionally drained for him.<br /><br />Then things get weird - and even more threatening.  I can't get into the plot details too much without giving away stories pieces that a reader needs to experience on his or her own, but I will say that the Hempstock women (grandmother, mother, and daughter) are at once the most compelling and intriguing characters I've met in a while, and at the same time the most hidden and frustrating.  Too much of their past is shrouded in mystery, and I know that's the way it's supposed to be, but that still didn't satisfy in some ways.<br /><br />Reading the book is a mystical experience, though, and I'm sure someone will turn it into a great movie at some point, although I'm not sure if it will be more horror or fantasy slanted in that incarnation.  Gaiman's observations of the nature of humankind and childhood are compelling and submersive.  I sailed blissfully right into the read and rowed along with it.<br /><br />However, the resolution is one that will leave a lot of readers discomforted.  I wanted more.  Looking back on the story once I'd turned the final page, I realized how thin the narrative truly was on plot, but the characterization of the unnamed narrator is addictive.  I enjoyed the read immensely, but felt somewhat dismayed by the actual meat of the novel.  The experience is more ephemeral, a wondrous fog, but not so much a full meal.mersive.

B0013V3GN8|5.0|Still my favorite artist of all time. Wonderful memories. Oneo f the best deals available for Elvis fans. If I only bought one this would be the one
B000085RTX|5.0|There aren't many albums I can say I loved from the first listen, but this is definitely one of them. There is so much depth and grandiosity yet the album comes off as simple symphonic metal. The execution by the band is godly, and this is in my opinion Khan at his best vocally. I don't ever see myself getting tired of this album!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I certainly understand why some would not like this movie.  It takes a considerable effort to follow.  But all of the story lines are fascinating, and they way they are related is wonderful.
B000085RTZ|5.0|Honestly I thought this album was extremely overrated my first listen. It took me about a week of constant listening to realize how perfect this album is. All it took was for me to listen to it as if it were a play or movie rather than an album of individual songs. Just amazing!
1481913417|5.0|Excellent and concise writing guidelines for an adult learner or online student. Easy to read book with many different examples.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Perfect follow up to Before Sunrise.. leaves you wanting more! I recommend watching Before Sunrise first though. So glad they released the sequel to this Before Midnight.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think its an awesome game its easy to play and fun. I cant wait for to download the second peps leps world
B00CWY76CC|4.0|can you escape is a puzzle game that requires both inference and no small amount of intuition.  it is challenging but not unreasonably so.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|[NO SPOILERS]<br /><br />I enjoyed the heck out of Hannibal.  You want to view a Psychological Thriller?  THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT!  The characters were outstanding.  Had me from the first episode to the last and wanted to shed some tears that the season ended.<br /><br />Totally recommend this series.  You will not be disappointed.  Kudos to NBC for airing this type of series (shocking of them wasn't it?).  Can't wait for S2. It looks like it's going to be explosive from the way the last episode ended.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I had been eyeing the G930 for a while, so when my current headset failed I picked it up.<br /><br />Software install and setup is a breeze. I initially was bummed that it didn't also use the unifying receiver (I have an M570 and a k750 too), but that would be quite a bit to try to squeeze into one stream.<br /><br />Upside is that the charging cable is a micro-B, so if I'm not charging the headset I can charge my phone.<br /><br />Sound quality is good, would be better if I wasn't too lazy to mess with wifi settings to reduce interference from my mouse and keyboard.<br /><br />Haven't tested the mic quality yet, but that's next on the agenda.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I didnt even know this show exists! I saw them on a talk show...It's great! It's fun, keeps my interest, I feel like I'm reading a good book! I love watching TV this way....on Amazon...because I don't have to wait until next week!
B005TBN3EU|2.0|Beautiful scenery, and cute monkey - but too much over the top DARK drug related humor.  Too raunchy and not silly enough.  The best scene is the father-in-law speech.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I prefer using this app on my android device to using outlook on my laptop.  I have multiple accounts that I use this app to check and this makes it easy.  It provides indications on my device when a new email is received.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Like many, I've read  A LOT of Stephen King, but have not read anything of his for quite a while.  I picked up this up because I remembered all those past novels I loved and, frankly, the title intrigued me.  This is as good a page-turner (or whatever you call it if reading it on a Kindle) as it gets, and King's powers of imagination (combined with an impressive amount of research) are in full bloom.  Fall down the rabbit hole and try it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the first apps I installed on my hand-me-down, 1st gen, Kindle Fire and I use it more than any other. I love the features it has and frequently check the remaining battery life when considering the things I want to do on my Kindle. For example, it let's me know if I have enough charge to read in the waiting room before taking off for an appointment, and how long it will take to charge if I don't. Plus, it's just pretty! Works like a charm and I've never had a problem with it, or with my Kindle because of it. I highly recommend it.
B00993G41S|5.0|Hilarious performances by John Cleese and Kevin Kline.  Add gorgeous Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Palin and you've got a classic comedy.  I re-watch this film at least every other year or so.  It's timeless humor, as relevant today as it was when the film was first released.  If you like comedies, you'll surely find a character or theme that is to your liking!!  The mixture of low-brow American with stately (perhaps some would say 'pompous') British characters is a superb stage for the story that ensues.
B0061S073A|1.0|Advertised as the Free Time App, which it is not, I got accidentally.  I still gave it a whirl but it was not user friendly and I'm sure my son would not be able to work it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is cool. Its so awesome mystery manor incantation wait unfilled I upgrade !!!!!. it may seem babiesh at first but it get better along the way
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This one is fun and silly and has a lot of different pieces.  More complicated/exciting than most free apps.  We love it!
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|Queens Of The  Stone Age's 6th studio album \\"...Like Clockwork\\", is a solid piece of hard rock.  Top tunes include, \\"I Sat By The Ocean\\", the reflective \\"The Vampyre Of Time And Memory\\", with some nice almost Beatle-ish guitar by Joshua Homme.  The hard hitting \\"If I Had A Tail\\", the smokin' guitars of \\"My God Is The Sun\\",  \\"Kalopsia\\", has a quite side to it, then pumps up the volume, then back down again, very good song.  Mark Lanegan helped write \\"Fairweather Friends\\", this free wheeling tune has some tremendous guitar.  The falsetto voice of Josh on the blustery \\"Smooth Sailing\\", a tune that could be a hit, the sharp guitar rocker \\"I Appear Missing\\", nice bass work on this track, the title track is one of their prettiest pieces (IMO), Josh Homme, Troy Van Leeuwen, Michael Shuman, Joe Theodore and Dan Fertita do a great job on this disc.  This 53 year-old gives it **** 1/2.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This does what it says it does... and the rooster alarm is so horrifying that I've begun to wake up automatically before the alarm even goes off.
B002WP1NO8|4.0|The added tracks make it more of a value, but had they re-sequenced the track order including the 2nd cd worth it may've been a more interesting and valued  document for the 40th Anniversary as many have had the LP, the cassette, the first ABKCO cd issue (disappointing sound quality), the 2002 ABKCO remaster which I thought a a few marks above and now this (decide on the files instead of the cd since it likely wouldn't be upgraded); cobbling together a slap-dash package doesn't make it the special item own it could have been, but in the end it will be about the music and this represents a vital time in the life of this band, considered by so many casual to ardent fans as &#34;The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World&#34;.  Now if only the the 2-CD set from Oakland, CA would surface &#34;commercially&#34;, now that would be something.  Well, alright!!!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is a great movie! Its an amazing true story and a family friendly film! Anna Sophia Robb does such a good job!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|.Fun and exciting being chased by the police. Fast moving, nice visuals. If you are not a kid it makes you feel like one again.
B009ANP48G|5.0|I didn't even know how awesome this was until I recieved it! I can watch it in 3D, bluray, dvd, or on VUDU, FLIXTER, ITUNES!!!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|kind of relaxing. Nice colors and not to hard to play but can become a little boring but wont make you crazy like some of the other games.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It requires a large amount of thinking, so if you don't like thinking don't get this game. If you are not in 6th grade yet I wouldn't recommend  it for you because it involves larger grade math. Other than that it's a great game!!!!  (;
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Great album if you are into Celtic music. Had not heard of artist before, came as a recommendation from previous purchase. Was very surprised in the different ballads. Al tracks were great
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game. My only suggestion is that the game makes it easier to earn gems instead of buying them.
159463176X|3.0|I finished last night with quite a disappointed feeling.  I loved the first two books, and couldn't wait to read his third.  There are several stories within the story, with the characters of each story loosely connected to each other.  I kept waiting for some sort of final connection between all of them that never came.  A few of the stories just ended with no resolution.  Why were those stories even told in the first place if not to somehow impact the major characters?  I don't want to give any spoilers, but the drug king and his family vs. Iqbal and his son?  What was that all about?  What happened to them and how was it relevent to the main story?  The greek doctor, his mother and Thalia?  OK...what about them, how do they connect to the main characters at the end?<br /><br />And the disfigured grown up girl and the two brothers?  What was this story supposed to tell us and what happened to them?<br /><br />The stories and writing about their lives were intriguing, but left me with an unsatisfied feeling because I wanted to have it all sewn up to a good conclusion, which never came.  The actual ending was bittersweet...but the last few paragraphs?  Really, that was the end to the story?<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't recommend this book.  I really give it 3-.<br /><br />I don't know who is giving it 5 stars, but I've stopped reading 5+ ratings on most things on Amazon.  This is due to one of my favorite authors.  Her latest was horrible, and everyone on the fan website didn't like the ratings it was getting so came over to give it a 5, even if they hadn't read it yet.  so, I find the 5 star ratings not credible.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Just yes. This is kind of a &quot;waiting to get on a plane&quot; game so obsessers turn around and go back to your hole. Very smooth. Casual. Overall an amazing game.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Ms. Sebold's own story as a young rape victim is an inspiring story of survival and very highly recommended.
0307352153|5.0|This book changed my life. I constantly found myself saying \\"hey that sounds like me\\" and I took comfort in knowing I'm not the only one out there. Every introvert and any extroverts with introverts in their lives should read this book.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game, I have played till my fingers cramp, and then some. I will get other games released from this company. Hours of fun await me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This basic instructions before leaving earth, and I am able to read in any type of language or layout that is suitable for me so I am able to completely comprehend what it is I am reading, which has always been so difficult for me to read the BIBLE, and being able to apply to my Life !! And Allows me to stay focused and in tune and strengthens my relationship with my Lord and saviour!! Grateful! Thank you for the great app!!!
B00CBKLO52|5.0|Great game, I have played till my fingers cramp, and then some. I will get other games released from this company. Hours of fun await me.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This novel is so much fun to read. I found it impossible to predict what was going to happen next but I couldn't wait to find out. Imagine combining the technology of Google with the fantasy of Harry Potter and you'll have an idea of this original plot. My favorite read of the last year! Highly recommend.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game, I have played till my fingers cramp, and then some. I will get other games released from this company. Hours of fun await me.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Every novel by Kathy Riches is eagerly anticipated and eagerly read.  She never disappoints.  Bones are Forever finds Temperance back in Montreal faced with the problem of the remains of three  dead babies and a mother who has disappeared.  The search for the mother leads to Yellowknife, the capitol of Canada's Northwest Territories and the country around the Great Slave Lake.  More bad guys turn up, more dead bodies appear and Temperance, herself, is in danger before this well done mystery is solved.  I recommend it highly.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Okay you can't jump without it killing you and way too many DAMN adds I hate this game don't buy
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I loaded it. I fought with it. I deleted it.  Partial functionality is no functionality.  I suspect the problem lies with Amazon.  Really irritates me.  I wonder if the Kindle Fire HD would make a good frizbee.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I got the free trial version of this game and really enjoyed it, when I got to the end of the free trial I didn't hesitate to upgrade to the full paid version. The problem was it wiped my original game so I had to start all over again! It was really annoying and oddly in the achievements section it showed my achievements from the free trial trial but the actual game restarted. Would be 5 stars if it wasn't for that, it is a really enjoyable game.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Such a good game..... Love the graphics and how free it is.. thank you for making this game. I also like the singleness of the game
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This app runs flawlessly on my Kindle Fire.  The resolution and sound are incredible, but more importantly the speakers are amazing.  There is so much garbage on TV, radio, and the internet, I encourage everyone to give TED a try.  The speakers and topics really make you think outside the box and are filled with wisdom.  I tend to be more conservative, and even the more liberal speakers make excellent points that cause you to pause.  Highly recommend!
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Although I am a big fan of both Maggie Smith and Dustin Hoffman, this effort didn't seem<br />quite worthy of either of them.  I think that her character of the aging opera singer was<br />way too one dimensional and the whole thing with her ex-fiance was hokey at best.<br />Sorry Maggie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fast read on a very different subject.<br />Read the first and you will read the others to find out how it ends
B00B69UQEO|5.0|very good and beautifull<br /><br />great album!!  i like very much<br /><br />thank you for buy the best album of depeche mode
B00722ZHG6|5.0|I love this album.  Birdy is a remarkable young emerging talent and we will be hearing more from her I'm sure.  Some songs remind you of Adele.
B00A3VLJCE|2.0|This is not intuitive and the &#34;tutorials&#34; are not clear.  I'm going to keep trying, maybe I'll figure it out.
B000001ED1|1.0|I heard one song from this album on a reality singing show and loved that version.  It's not as good on here and the rest of the songs do not appeal.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love &quot;cut the rope&quot; and omnom is SOOOO adorable. I can't get enough of the game try the other games it is TOTALLY worth the money
B00CWY76CC|4.0|About 80% of the solution is based on solid logic, the other 20% is a bit of random tapping on the screen. Can't complain given that it is a free app, but I would not pay for it
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I absolutely all of the songs on this CD.  I have been a great admirer since Susan Boyle appeared on television.  It was so much easier to order this on line instead of going out to a store to try to find it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good game sometimes a little frustrating. You have to write a review in order to move to the next floor.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|was not what I thought it was going to be not real happy with it I deleted it becouse I didnt understand it and found no fun in it

B00007AJGH|5.0|I love this movie so much. It's such a fun movie and it is extremely well made.<br /><br />The film is based on a novel by Gary K. Wolf, and it takes place in a town filled with cartoon characters and real people. The film is about a detective named Eddie Valiant, and a rabbit named Roger who is an actor that plays in cartoons. Eddie is getting payed to take pictures of Roger's beautiful wife Jessica, who seems to be having an affair with a real man. We later find out that was not true, and that Jessica was forced to pose for those pictures, otherwise Roger would never work in that town again. Throughout the movie, a creepy man called The Judge and his Toon Patrol are after Roger after he gets framed for murder.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie in so many ways. It is also the film that helped the Disney company get back on it's feet when it was going through a hard time. I totally recommend this movie to anyone.
B006PKQQJS|4.0|Sallys Salon Luxury Edition seems a little more challenging challenging diner dash and is a lot of fun to play.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has always had a brilliant mind, he has used spare human parts that he robbed from graveyards with the help of his assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye) as he intends to bring a dead person back to life by re-animation process. His fiancee Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) is worried about him and curious about what he is doing, Frankenstein has created a monster (Boris Karloff) that he brought back to life as it turns out to be a bewildered creature who just didn't want to hurt anyone but some people push him too far as he is frightening some people in a local town.<br /><br />The definitive Frankenstein film no doubt! this movie with Dracula made Universal a horror house in the 30s/40s/early 50s as both created a franchise called \\"Universal Monsters\\" which both films are landmark films in horror cinema. Director James Whale gives us a moody and atmospheric adaptation of Mary Shelly's classic novel, this mix of sci-fi and horror is just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended). The film co-stars Edward Von Sloan and Lionel Barrymore as the acting in this movie is superb, the film oozes with gothic chills and thrills with plenty of excitement. There are memorable moments like the misunderstood creature with the little girl to the line \\"It's Alive ALIVE!\\" by Colin Clive's character. The film shocked audiences in theaters even with gasps and screams as that in the beginning of the film that a person with a weak heart should leave the theater if the film is upsetting them, it worked like a charm as the film over the years has been hailed as a masterpiece by critics and audiences alike making it one of the most beloved horror films of all time. It was followed by a dozen sequels with \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" being a TRULY worthy sequel and one of the greatest sequels of all time.
B0018OIK0E|3.0|i understand this is just supposed to be a comedy, but the timing issues in the movie irritate me. In some of the zombie scenes the camera cuts away from the zombies as they are walking for a bit and then when it again focuses on the zombies they are still walking in the same place, If these issues of time don't bother you, then it will be a great movie!
B000035Z3K|5.0|A man named Renfield heads to Translyvania where he meets the mysterious Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi) then drugs him as he turns him into his slave. Dracula turns out to be a vampire who uses him for his bidding as they go to England to do some terrorizing especially to a lovely girl named Lucy (Francis Dade). A woman named Mina  (Helen Chandler) has now become the target of Dracula's desires for only her fiancee  Dr. Jack Stewaret (Herbert Bunston) and Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) can save her.<br /><br />One of the greatest horror films of all time and an all time classic film no doubt! but this wasn't the first adaptation of Dracula by Bram Stoker, in fact in 1922 the German silent film masterpiece \\"Nosferatu\\" was the first adaptation of Stoker's classic novel. Universal bought the film rights from the Stoker house in 1931 as they made their own adaptation of the novel and it went on to become a critically acclaimed and beloved masterpiece of the horror genre. Bela Lugosi became a major name thanks to being in this movie embodied the role of the character yet others are quite good but i still believe Christopher Lee is the best Dracula and Bela is second, the acting is great mainly from Bela as he became a horror icon with taking the part. Great direction by Todd Browning who directed the controversial classic \\"Freaks\\" and fine production values, there was a Spanish version which came out the same year with a different cast and in Spanish language no doubt for Spanish speaking viewers which is also worth a look.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a great game. You have to buy this game. You will have fun .I had fun. Good thing it is free.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I don't think I'm smart enough to describe clearly why this book is as good as it is.  I was both startled and dazzled by the unique world, original story line and careful character development.  I believe Sanderson is one of the top authors for this genre.
B0001I561E|4.0|The case was torn and very worn. The disc itself had small scratches and a needed to be wiped off.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It had been so long since I had read the books in this series, I went back and re-read the first two so I could refresh my memory. I am glad I did cause there was so much I had forgotten! I REALLY thought this was the ending to the story. Man was I wrong. Sylvia......your are evil......in a good way. I hope I don't have to wait to long to see how this all unfolds. So many ways this story could go. Way to keep us on the end of our seats.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love it. I always enjoy BBC productions. The story content is so good and you look forward to each episode.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|I wasn't sure about this film (Arnie is getting old) and so it was with some trepidation that I clicked on the buy button.  I'm glad I did.  This is a really fun movie with lots and lots of action and a good dose of humor.  The car sequences are topped off by a two muscle car race through a cornfield.  The supporting cast really carries Arnie but he manages to hold his own.  The story is only a little far-fetched.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I love the music.It is a good mixture of hard rock with great singing. And they are not afraid to sing their mind.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Great movie. Very interesting, great story line, keeps you interested.<br />Bradley cooper plays a writer not doing so well in life, but then is given a pill that changes his life. With this pill you are able to use 100 percent of your brain. But there are some bugs that have to be worked out.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|I love the music. It is a good mixture of hard rock with great singing. And they are not afraid to sing their mind.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is by far the most engrossing, action -packed game I've found for my Kindle Fire. There is no second place! And it's free.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this app but I think that kindle fire hd users should get the update the same time as other devices get theirs
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Publisher did him a great service with the title.  But it is very misleading.  But he is making a career out of it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Wonderful app for cleaning your app caches on your android operating system. This app just does so much more than some of the others it can't be beat.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Did not like ending otherwise good reading. Cannot wait for next novel. No other comments to make. So thank you
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have not seen the movie yet , but due to how great the book is I'm not sure I want too ! Great book, easy read, couldn't put it down
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|.... I've ever read. If you haven't read someones life story before and you don't even get Apple, read this.
B000V63BN6|2.0|A great collection, but the Amazon MP3s version is not very good: Dull and slightly fuzzy, with not much bass and none of the sparkle and excitement of the originals. Wish I'd bought the CD instead of the Amazon MP3. Usually Amazon MP3s are quite good!
0446547638|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has done it again! I could not put this book down. I love how the characters were written as if you really knew them. I kept wanting to read more to find out what would happen between the young loves and their families. I would recommend this book 100% to anyone looking for a good read.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is so awesome!! Yes, when you reach the end, it does say 'buy more world's' world's', but once you reach that point you can go to the title screen and do free play. It is so fun. It is a dollar well spent.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|It is cheesey and the graphics aren't that great but it is on par with other BBC shows.  I found myself waiting very impatiently for my boyfriend to come over because we watched an episode every night and neither of us wanted to miss it.  I realized the extent of my addiction when I found myself watching youtube fan videos!!! If you don't have an hour to burn every night for the forseeable future, beware.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|It was a bit difficult to negotiate.  I wanted to be able to find particular songs more easily.  This is somebody who's just begun using it, so no doubt there is a learning curve.  So glad I chose to save my songs to Amazon's cloud, though, because it's not eating up memory and I won't lose them no matter what happens to my devices.
B000VK99Z6|1.0|I was excited to watch it, but...  boring, seldom funny.  I kept waiting for it to do something with what it was trying to develop, but it never happened and then it degraded ridiculously.  So sad, I'll never get that 2 hours back -- its gone forever.  Do yourself a favor, rent ANYthing other than this.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I guess it is ok I mean it could have improvements. first they need automatic villages. second they need to ad more diamonds nd gold /:
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can,t wait for more.  It was a little quick but I really enjoyed it. There were a couple times I was challenged but found my way out.
B0086700CM|1.0|I swipe right, it goes straight.  I jump, it slides.  I give up.  My kindle fire won't control this guy at all.  Unplayable on this device.  Time to delete.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Audio and video load down quickly, and automatically in the genre (MP4, MP3, etc.) you can best use.  You will be happy with this one.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I like knowing what the weather will be doing by the hour, and this app has it all in one screen. Twice, I've had to contact support with questions, and both times I had an answer emailed to me within three minutes. I highly recommended this app.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Works just fine, seamlessly.  I think you will be happy with this; the price is certainly within everyone's range.  Buy it!
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|This game addicting. The only bad thing is that I can't think of a good name!Doodle Jump never gets old!
B0091REZMW|3.0|game. does not have the best instructions.<br /><br />don't really understand how to banish any phantom. don't really know how to get or use the diamonds.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the best game I have ever played. I would recommend you to get this game. its easy but not too easy
B0081336FO|5.0|The plot continues to thicken in this second season - I only regret that there are only 3 episodes...and rumor has it that the next season won't be aired until the end of 2013 or early 2014. :(
B005C9YZIW|3.0|Just received this dvd and, while it is shrink-wrapped, the dvd case is beat up. It looks like it could have been used?
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a fun and interesting twist on the original characters...if you like Elementary on TV you will enjoy this!
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|I love the graphics and the variety of hero's is a big plus.  The only real problem with the game is the inconsistency of level progression.  Easy levels are followed by near impossible levels the take so much time to upgrade the necessary allies power-ups and such that I come close to delete the game.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Amazing, to see it in a different perspective. I had a lot of fun reading it. Could not put down the book so read in one night.
0609610570|5.0|This book was a bit of a slow read for me, but it was packed full of great information.  Anyone interested or employed in business will appreciate reading it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't enjoy this season quite as much as the first  because the war felt like such an intrusion into the fairy tale that I had built around their lives but that's part of life and all fairy tales have villains.  Everything is done so very well in this series.  I looked forward to the third season very much.
0066620996|5.0|I don't read tons of books, probably only 2 or 3 a year but this is a great book for anyone interested or employed in the business world.  It is a very scientific approach to understanding how great companies stay great.  This book is a great read, when I find time I will probably buy the next book in this series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked the game but it was way to SHORT  it should have 100 levels I can't wait for more levels to come
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great book I could really relate to the story. The correlation of metaphysical and spiritual worlds collide. I would recommend this book to everyone
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|If you like bad cops, boobs and violence that would make Dirty Harry go &#34;Whoa, that's enough!&#34; then this is the show for you.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I normally have a difficult time falling asleep, but the various water sounds lull me into a sleepy cloud of comfort. I use it every night. And even use it for much needed naps, which my otherwise racing mind would not have allowed.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book kept my attention from page one to the end to the interview and the discussion pages.  The writer's ability to develop  these characters is amazing. He really did his research on North Korea and you don't need to read the interview to know that. And the reader is definitely left with a new impression and appreciation of the quality of life and the freedoms that we tend to take for granted. I can't even begin to express how beautiful and well painted this book was with capturing the essence of the people and the location. I recommend to non-fiction readers as well as fiction because the author delivers it in a manner that makes it hard to believe any of it is fiction.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I'VE READ ALL THE THEODORE BOONE BOOKS, TO DATE, AND I'VE FOUND EACH AND EVERY ONE TO BE FASCINATING!

B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought this app because I play minecraft on my xbox 360 and love it.  This app did not even come close to my expectations and I felt ripped off.  This is what you get for SEVEN DOLLARS: a tiny world with a small variety of biomes, limited animals, only a small selection of objects, no nether or end, no tutorial, no enchantment table, no brewing, and countless more.  I personally feel that this game is worth 1.99 at the most, and my $7 was wasted.  Please take my advice and don't waste your money on this crap.  if you want a game like this, try survivalcraft.  its so much better!  plus its only $4 and worth every penny of it.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|This movie may not be as good as the lord of the rings trilogy but a good addition to the set.
B004SBX112|4.0|This Game is addictive and fun... Great for passing time and its strategy is great when attempting to win! The game makes you think strategy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson really likes this game.  It challenges him and gives him instant feedback which is needed for young children.
193700788X|5.0|It was different from the other books in the series.  It ends the way I predicted, but  liked that.  I will read the whole series again.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Zero Day kept me glued to my Kindle. Lots of twists and turns but outstanding writing by Baldacci. Another winner.
B00127RAJY|5.0|OK I've bought a few workout DVDs in the past, but this is the first one I've managed to stick with. I think I spent the first few days screaming at my TV screen and being on the verge of quitting, but something about Jillian kept my going and the workout was over before I knew it. I'm 5'4\\" and 140 and I have zero upper arm strength. I could BARELY do one pushup with good posture, but I was able to do at least 10 by the time I was halfway through level 1! I still do pushups on my knees, but I've made a big improvement before Jillian entered my life! By day 7, I started seeing some serious definition in my arms, stomach, and legs.<br /><br />If you want to workout at home and see improvements I would buy this DVD! You'll need to buy some dumbbells, but this DVD is inexpensive and 3lb and 5lb weights were all I needed and they didn't cost much.
1416596097|3.0|\\"Astounding, nearly perfect\\" says the San Francisco Chronicle. \\"Surely one of his best\\" quips the Los Angeles Times. I beg to differ on both counts. For starters, the denouement of this thriller is oh so similar to that of Absolute Friends. The only difference is that the two protagonists are gunned down in the latter.<br />Secondly, words like \\"astounding\\" and \\"perfect\\" do not belong here. They must be reserved for his greatest novel, A Spy Came In From the Cold. This tale contains so many twists, which are believable, that it takes one's full concentration to follow the plot. And Le Carre comes out in spades. And, of course, any best of list of Le Carre's works must include his spymaster classic, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. These two novels put this his latest effort to shame. Dare I suggest that at 82 the British author is running out of ideas? Give us another classic, Mr Cornwall!
B001IF277K|5.0|This product exceeded my expectation has a lasting hold after charging it up it is better than ordering it from Sony I recommend this item if you are in need of a new battery for you Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 cell phone.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|The male version of Rihanna's Unapologetic. Different musical sound on this album similar to 808's and Heartbreaks. Kany'e definitely went crazy and the beats are very different. I had to listen to the album a second time to really appreciate the Kanyeisms. *BLOOD<br />*ON<br />*THE LEAVES
B00AZF13KG|5.0|I have watched this movie like 100 times at least. I know all the quotes from this movie lol Great Movie!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I hope the next one has more content. This story didn't really go anywhere, kind of felt the the author phoned this one in
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|The best in the Star Trek movie series in my opinion and a good job pointing out declining populations of endangered anmials
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|This has the same action that we are use to with the Die hard movies. The interaction between dad and son are priceless.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|I have a Kindle Fire and no problems downloading it. I have only just started playing the game but it seems like it will be a fun little game.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|The story all comes together in the end even explaining why someone that sounds like Arnold is in the border town.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|i love the plot turns and weaves and the fact that George RR Martin is not constrained in his story telling like most other writers,<br />and the many story lines that are on going at the same time.
B002OKGJUO|5.0|This movie stands out as a classic in vampire movies. It is truly scary, even today. Love the makeup and lighting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun challenging exiting  I love this app the best app so cool and challenging interesting boy will you have fun with this
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|I thought this would give me insight into discrimination in America as seen through the eyes of a Non-American Black, but it was only given in brief segments.  The bulk of the book was about the unrequited love of the main character and it soon got to be real!! long.  The poor communication skills of the main character were never fully explained and it was very frustrating.  It was an interesting concept, but not properly played out.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This is the set of films that set the mark for so many others to measure up to. I saw the first one when it was first released. Must own type of films.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I play once in a while this is setup nice so maybe Ill play more often we'll see.not a favorite.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I have played guitar for many years and he is up there with the best I have every heard. Great to watch and listen to.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's kinda fun. Easy, but fun. I'm looking forward to more challenging levels.<br />And this is just here to fill the word quota because I didn't have anything else to say.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|As a Die Hard series fan, I was looking forward to the latest entry in this franchise. Unfortunately the action scenes are so outrageous and impossible that it makes it very hard to suspend disbelief, no matter how hard you try. Bruce Wllis puts no effort into his part, and the plot is mostly nonexistent. The characters are completely flat, and the acting is terrible. This movie is yet another case of trying to squeeze a few more dollars from a dead franchise with as little effort as possible.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|The grandchildren loved the gift.  &#34;The best gift ever&#34;  I bought one for $34.99 and the next week it was $49.99.  I thought that was a little expensive.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great tower defense game, Middle-Earthish with trolls, wizards, etc. Build archery towers, artillery, wizard towers, or castles. Good graphics, good gameplay. Test drive the free online version first if you like.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I really enjoyed the historical value of this book and can't wait to read book II which I will start today!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Excellent music!!!  This music will make you happy, the CD is great but the DVD will blow your mind!!!  Wonderful, talented and enthusiastic .  Would recommend this to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Hey, if it keeps the kids entertained while I clean the house then it must be amazing. Personally, I cannot get past the third set of levels, but I accept the challenge! I shall defeat the angry birds... eventually.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun kinda challenging but good brain tester. Took a few minutes in different rooms but kept me entertained the whole time
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love this calculator. I must say, it rather surprised me at how much of the screen it used when turning on the app. Then I realized, that should not have surprised me -- I am just accustomed to the mini calculator on the work computer. This makes it so much easier to see!
0743579631|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading the mortal instruments series! City of Glass was just as fun to read as the 1st 2 books. Cannot wait for book 4. If you haven't read these I recommend they be your next series :)
B0094BB4TW|4.0|One cannot access sending/receiving friend requests or searching pages, but those are the &#34;big things&#34; best saved for when one is on their computer. Otherwise, this gets the job done to keep up with news-feed and contacting those on the friends list, and it makes it so much easier than opening a browser page from the Kindle.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Violent but in keeping with the story line. We are big fans of SOA.  Start in Season 1 or you'll be lost.
B004C6QCT6|5.0|Think &#34;Oye Como Va&#34; is Santana's staple song? Listen to music that is not commercialised and played to death. Great innovative musicianship by Carlos and fellow musician.s
B004D7GU3M|5.0|I wished Yeezus came out on vinyl, so instead I just bought his second greatest album. Now if only they'd repress 808's...
B00C061I3K|5.0|I can't describe in words how much I hove this album because so many of the individual tracks stand apart as key pieces of playlists that it becomes almost irreplaceable.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|From start to finish, Hanson's &#34;Anthem&#34; album is phenomenal. It's so great that I have to break it down song by song.<br /><br />Fired Up - If this isn't a summer classic, I don't know what is. The perfect drum/guitar intro literally gets you fired up for this track and the album in general. And is it weird that I could totally hear this song being played on a sport/poker commercial?  &#34;... You better run and hide, cuz we're about to bring the fire... Game. Set. Match... Don't pause, don't bluff, just play to win...&#34;<br /><br />I've Got Soul - this song totally has me dancing in my seat, rocking my shoulders and slapping my steering wheel.  &#34;... I've got soul and I'm not afraid to use it, you want more?, I can show you how we do it...&#34;<br /><br />You Can't Stop Us - ::fastens seatbelt and prepares for rock overload:: the double bass drums and guitar riffs on this song just make it. Holy awesomepants, batman! This song was made to be played in large amphitheaters with closed fists flying in the air. &#34;... Soldier of fortune tried to shoot me down, beating his chest only to hear the sound, pumping his fists saying that our cause is dead, go put your lies in somebody else's head!...&#34;<br /><br />Get The Girl Back - first single and what I believe to be the 'poppiest' of songs on the album. Who doesn't love a song with cowbell? No one, that's who! And the music video (filled with a few of Hanson's famous friends) is hilarious. &#34;... Tell her she was always right, you were in the wrong, you can't deny; cuz once she's got somebody's eye, it will be too late to apologize...&#34;<br /><br />Juliet - sweet love song with a killer musical intro (not gonna lie-I totally pretend to conduct an orchestra when this song starts) and a stuttering Zac Hanson. This is one of my favorites to belt in the car. &#34;... Ju-jujujujuju-Juliet, once upon a time is not enough, don't you know that I'm a man in love, and I can't get enough of you...&#34;<br /><br />Already Home - love love love this song. Such profound lyrics with an insanely catchy chorus. Perfecto! &#34;... I don't know what is broken, you act like you don't belong here anymore, if you've really lost something, maybe you should start where you've been before, I think you're already home...&#34;<br /><br />For Your Love - since Hanson fans were depraved of an Isaac solo on their last album, Shout It Out, we were anxiously awaiting his return on this album.  Such a sweet and heartfelt love song. I love his voice because it can go from romantic crooning to raspy rocker in a snap. This song is just further proof of his talent. I definitely foresee this being a first dance wedding song for some. ;)  &#34;... If you're lost then ill find you, and if you ask me, I'll lay my life down, not for glory, I'm striving for your love, I'm fighting...&#34;<br /><br />Lost Without You - I can definitely see this being the next single. Just an awesome song from the opening organ chords. ;) Such a beautiful and hopeful story being told. And the chorus is so GD catchy I catch myself singing it all the time. &#34;... I see it all align in front of my face, but like a shooting star fades, it could be gone just as fast as it came, I'm gonna take this moment and chase this fear right out of me, come what may, I will have no regrets after today...&#34;<br /><br />Cut Right Through Me - cute pop/rock song. Windows down, volume up, season to taste. &#34;... I say a word and I've said too much, you take a piece of everything you touch... Without a second look, you caught me on your hook, I've never felt like that, gave me a heart attack ...&#34;<br /><br />Scream and Be Free - I love the title, I love the song, I love the music. This is the epitome of HansonRock. The lyrics are a slap to the gullet to get up and just friggin DEW something. &#34;... If you're always living for tomorrow, you're gonna miss right now. If we're only looking in the mirror, we'll never see ourselves... Sing it if you know it, scream it if you feel it, there's nothing standing in our way, follow along with me, scream and be free...&#34;<br /><br />Tragic Symphony - I have to say, hands down, this is my absolute favorite song on the album. I just love every single aspect and can't get enough of it. Lyrics, notes, beats, voices all combined to make three minutes and ten seconds of perfection. I wish I could type all the lyrics... But you'll just have to download :) &#34;... I'm just a part in your masterpiece, a minuet in a minor key; a sad song that you know so well, you're cheating me but you have no tell...&#34;<br /><br />Tonight - I loved this song from the beginning, but when I went to a show and heard Taylor say that this song was inspired by the fans... Made me luff it even more. I also love songs when they take turns singing lead like this. &#34;... Say what you mean and mean what you're saying tonight, chase down the dream and don't give up without a fight, and don't wait for tomorrow's daylight, cuz it just may be tonight... When you're too tired to walk, and too scared to run, and your heavy weight knees buckle under a ton, your blue sky visions turn into a storm, and I got suspicions you won't make it one more, when there's no silver lining, there's nothing to lose, so don't wait for tomorrow...&#34;<br /><br />Save Me From Myself (Encore Track)  - ((grabs tissues)) such a sad sad sad heartbreaking piano ballad beautifully sung by Mr Zac Hanson. &#34;... Amelia, was always the one for me but she wouldn't stay, on a warm day I came home to find that she had sailed away, maybe I am broken, in someway I can tell, I don't want to change, but Lord knows I need some help, to save me from myself...&#34;<br /><br />So with all that being said..  You need to buy this album. Now. And buy a copy for your spouse, child, mailman and tax preparer. ;)g it if you know it, scream it if you feel it, there's nothing standing in our way, follow along with me, scream and be free...&#34;<br /><br />Tragic Symphony - I have to say, hands down, this is my absolute favorite song on the album.

B00A8OWOSO|1.0|Just not my kind of thing, I guess.  I just couldn't stay interested, and kind of daydreamed through most of it.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|It is very diffrent but I couldnt stop listening to it. Kanye is an artist plain and simple..Its like nothing i have ever heard before.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This movie was just great fun and very entertaining overall. The story of this movie is a prequel to the original wizard of Oz movie and answered many of the questions I had about the original. Overall though this movie is a must buy even though it is overpriced if you get the 3D version like I did cause you only get the 3D copy and digital copy and then they give you the option to buy the blu-ray edition for another $6 which would almost make this movie $40 compared to other movies where one can get dvd, blu-ray, 3D, digital copy, and ultraviolet for $25-30.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|After finding out what this movie was about, I really did not have much interest in watching it. But then a couple of people whose opinion I respect told me that it was not really about religion and that I should give it a try. I am not sure what they watched, but if this movie is not about religion (or at least about belief in God), then I am superman.<br /><br />The parable used for communicating the greatness of believing in God is actually entertaining, which is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1. The animation used for the tiger and in several other scenes is breathtaking. But ultimately, I could not help but feel disappointed in the constant hammering of the idea of God.<br /><br />Of course, it is pretty clear that there is a huge number of people out there who will not find any issues with the concept behind the movie, and as such will have a great time watching it. Since I have to acknowledge that if you are a believer, no matter of which religion, this is probably a very enjoyable film. I understand that. However, for those out there that are similar to me, do not believe in deities and have no interest in watching a film that argues for believing, then this is probably not a good option.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Awful.it was not fun to play because you couldn't continue to play easily or without paying.liked the wa ups but couldn't advance without money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. Like others have said it is not too easy or too hard. Good game would recommend.
B00005M1Y2|1.0|There was no disclaimer stating the DVDs would not play in the US; however, they would not work.  The DVD player plays all other discs, but displays a message \\"disc cannot be read in this region\\" for these discs.  Disappointed.
1452101248|4.0|I sought this book out for its non vegetarian premise. I'm an omnivore but am happy to forgo meat in the majority of my meals.
B0019T7PC2|1.0|We received 2 DVDs and they did not work when placed into our DVD player.  The DVD player works well and plays all other DVDs, but displayed that the DVDs could not be read in this region.  I saw NO warning or disclaimer when I purchased them that they would not work in the US.  I am very disappointed.
B004OT6PR0|5.0|My son wanted it I could not find it in stores. I got it here and he has not put it down since. Love it and a very fast shipper!

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have rushed to read Hosseine's books, since &#34;The Kite Runner:&#34;  While I have trouble putting this book down, I find the jumping from one generation to another a bit difficult.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It took my 5 year old and I a while to figure out anything past the first puzzle, but we figured it and it was so fun!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I have read most of what Neil Gaiman has written, and i was expecting this book to be good, but it still surprised me. I think it may well turn out to be one of his best books.<br /><br />What is this about? (no spoilers) Is it autobiographical? Is it a fairy tale? A nostalgic look back at childhood? A story of doomed love? A fable about values and sacrifice? All of the above. It also contains one of the most memorable characters that Gaiman has created (and he's created quite a few).<br /><br />Is this a book for adults or for children? It is /almost/ kid safe. I would say it's a book for the kind of adult that is not embarrassed to admit to liking children's books. Which makes it perfect for me.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was fascinated by the historical perspective of World War II that was presented. I was also pleasantly surprised at the way the author brought the different story lines in the book together. I couldn't put it down. Well worth your time and money to read.
B00B29J0I6|1.0|It's fine to warn me it's a 50mb download,  but don't tell me I can't use the *MY* data connection *I* pay for.<br />Can't provide any other review input because I'm not permitted to download the app.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Kanye West is back with another exercise in messianic myth-making. It's equal parts compelling and repellent but it's also great fun
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I recently got this set and I am blown away by all the extras. It is stacked from top to bottom with every kind of extra there is. I highly recommend it to any fan of zombie movies.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I loved the book &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; by Charles Dickens! My favorite part was pages &#34;70-73&#34;. I'll recommend this book to everybody especially my brother & grandma.I would not recommend this book to children ages 8 & below. From now on I'll share the Christmas spirit.<br />  🎄Merry Early Christmas🎄
B003O86FMW|5.0|You'll not want to put it down.  Collins is a master story-weaver and book two is as engaging and creative as the first. This series deserves the acclaim it's received. Great read!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|The whole family loves this movie.  This is great for those who remember the games and for the new kids that want to play the retro games now.  Just great.
B0091X2K0A|4.0|This was my first time seeing &#34;Full Metal Jacket.&#34;  Sure brought back many memories, good and not so good.  Men should enjoy this flic, while women would generally take a pass.
B007FLHW3K|3.0|I like this, it is a little smaller than I thought, but still pretty darn cool.  I did notice I had to ride pretty fast to get the full effect.  I mean well over 20mph.  But you can get a pretty good graphic at about 10-15mph.
0679805273|5.0|I was however very disappointed in the condition of this book as the pages didn't lay flat, they were wavy like it had been stored wrong or in moist condition. Im not sure but that was very disappointing to me as Im very pickie about my books. These were given as a college graduation gifts and I just wished the pages laid &#34;FLAT&#34; as a books pages should. :(
B006GWO5NE|1.0|it's not the cable because the kindle still doing the same thing. not charging. it has to be the kindle. the area where the charger is plugged.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The USB Cable works excellent with my Kindle. I am very pleased to have it. Thank you all so much for helping me, I was at a lost for words when it was not charging at first, I thought it may have had a defect.
B000HF0KXU|5.0|John Travolta plays the main character & has top billing, but the rest of the cast makes this movie a true action adventure story. If you like an action packed story, you won't be disappointed in choosing &#34;Swordfish&#34;.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love a good search game. And the plot for this one is fantastic! A must have on your phone or tablet
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|&#34;Willow&#34; is a wonderful tale that showed the acting talent of Val Kilmer & that he can make us laugh. The story is well written & the kids were very entertained. When I was questioned what the movie was like I responded, &#34;You've seen &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;?&#34; The girls chimed &#34;Yeah.&#34; I said, &#34;It's nothing like that.&#34; They looked puzzled so I explained they need to watch the movie & see for themselves what journey Willow would embark upon. This is great entertainment for the entire family, hilarious action scenes & romance.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this game to be incredibly addicting, and very different from what I normally play. It is very easy to waste an hour on.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie have an electrifying performance as husband & wife in a love hate relationship that crashes upon the rocks due to their work environment. The action is explosive & the dialogue is so hilarious at times even though death lurks just around the corner. I enjoy how light-hearted & funny the characters portray themselves when the story could be so dark & sinister. Why is it we find so much humor in the disparity of others especially that of a husband & wife? To me &#34;Mr. & Mrs. Smith&#34; is a classic that will remain one of my favorite movies.
B008M721MS|4.0|I use skype as my primary chat client ever since yim and aim stopped being as wide spread. I know nearly no one that is still on msn and I don't use oovoo or anything like that. So I know skype has great potential. I use it all the time. The issue isn't skype.<br /><br />The issue is whoever designed the skype app for kindle clearly has never used a kindle. The app will ONLY stay on one orientation. If you turn the kindle over and any other app would change orientation, this doesn't. I understand the issue that could arise with video chatting, but make it so it can't change orientation while you're video chatting but so it can for instant messaging. This is extremely agitating when you want to flip the kindle so it's closer to the charger.<br /><br />AND it's also extremely annoying because while in landscape mode the keyboard takes up probably 75% of the screen and you can't see much of the chat window. It's possible to scroll up to read messages if you miss anything, but the skype window simultaneously tries to sync to the most recent unread message. If you're in a busy chat (which I happen to be in like 3 of them) you literally will not be able to read the old messages without it taking you all the back to the most recent.<br /><br />Another thing is the skype app crashes when you have a busy chat that has a bunch of messages to sync.<br /><br />It's still USABLE, it's just annoying.<br /><br />Edit: They added the ability to change to portrait mode and it crashes way less than it used to. Changing my review, thanks for listening!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
B000J103PC|5.0|Meryl Streep is a suburb actress that played this part perfectly. Anne Hathaway is another great actress. The two together was a delight to watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|didn't know what to expect but everyone was right. the perfect balance of perplexing visual game puzzles. not outrageously difficult but doable. not too easy either that you just breeze though. can't wait for more levels.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I love ABBA and listening to these folks sing ABBA songs and watching how the songs were woven into a story was a true delight.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Just got this game a few hours ago.  I really enjoy playing.  Loved the movie NEMO so just had to try this game.  So far there seems to be no way to EARN the pearls.... except maybe when you spend pearls to buy a random chest that pops up on your reef.  I have not bought one yet, I just open the ones that are free or can be bought with coins.  Other than the pearls, the game is pretty cool to play, hey it's free, why not give it a try.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This story is about a dog who suddenly finds himself facing great hardship . He becomes  a sled dog in the attic. At the end , he becomes part of apack
0812983459|5.0|I heard the author interviewed on NPR and thought I'd give it a try. Absolutely loved this book! It was endearing and introspective and absolutely wonderful. A must read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i really enjoy this game it passes the time and makes you think.. i would recommend  this game to anyone.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book. Her words reach even a lowly mid-level employee and make me want to pursue a career that I can be proud of. It helps erase some of the doubts of being a working mother and helps turn them into thoughts of being a strong role model for my daughter. This will be re-read over and over again!
B005ZO6NRA|4.0|Its Conan there is nothing left to say so by crom watch it aronald is the true Conan but still great
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey has an amazing timing, even in her writing. As a parent and as a professional woman, her stories are hilarious and inspiring.
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|A dark foreboding leads to horrible tragedy. This film will really make you think and creep you out. A very sad and startling story. Flawless acting and the perfect horror story makes this one of the most horrible movies of all time, in the best sense of the word.<br /><br />I highly recommend to all horror fans, and especially to those who've liked another of Stephen King's films. This is by far the best horror film I've ever seen with his name on it. This is the reason Stephen King is called the master of horror. This is a magnificent masterpiece.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Rarely do I consider a movie better than a book, except in this case. The main character came across as less than intelligent. As a bipolar person, I much preferred the more proactive character as played in the movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched Season 3 on the PBS station.  I liked it so much I decided to buy  season 2 as well
193700788X|1.0|It's really upsetting how quickly one of my favorite series became absolutely horrible. Books 1-9 were a ton of fun, they were definitely my guilty pleasure. They weren't exactly sophisticated but they were extremely entertaining. Then came along books 10-13, each book felt more excruciating and terrible than the last one. The most recent Stackhouse books are at best subpar, why did Harris have to unnecessarily stretch out this series? I feel like Charlaine Harris didn't put any effort into the last 5 books and that she was just in it for the money. In my mind, the Sookie Stackhouse series ended at book #9, it's ridiculous but that's how I feel. The last 5 books are pointless to the series and didn't really provide me with any closure. Sorry for rambling, I just had to let out my feelings about this series.<br /><br />  Dead Ever After was absolutely dreadful, this is definitely the worst conclusion to a series I ever read.  Everything about it is poorly executed and it was an ordeal to finish this book. I easily could have went on Goodreads and found out who Sookie ended up with yet I continued to read in hopes that this book would somehow redeem itself after the poor quality of the past few books. I just wanted to get this series over and done with so I wouldn't feel bad about leaving it unfinished. Truthfully if I had known how low this series would sink, I probably would have never started this series from the get-go.<br /><br />  Dead Ever After is extremely tedious and lacks anything compelling. I could have just tossed the book out the window and I wouldn't have had any urge to continue. There was nothing that kept me turning the pages and I had to suppress the urge to toss the book across the room multiple times. For starters, this book's plot is extremely diluted and feels like one huge drawn-out mess. You would think it would be relatively easy to tie up all the loose ends in this series, considering how little has happened in the last 4 books! Yet Charlaine Harris does a poor job of wrapping up plot points and she tries to add more conflicts to this book. There was one plot point that was supposed to be over books ago and it randomly made a reappearance.<br /><br />  Do you like to read a book about a woman who cleans? Do you want to spend pages on reading Sookie doing chores? Do you want to listen to Sookie drone on and on about moisturizing her legs? If so, then you most likely will love this book! Truthfully I didn't care about Sookie's legs or how she moisturized her legs. The \\"plot\\" of this book is literally Sookie doing chores with a badly executed mystery in the background.<br /><br />  While people were dying in Bon Temps, Sookie doesn't really care and all she cares about is herself. Seriously who cares about people dying? Let's go to a random boutique and harass one of the workers there and be a total jerk! Sookie was so rude to this saleswoman in one of these little boutiques where she was shopping. Even when Sookie is danger, she doesn't even care at all. When she is danger with the vampires, all she cares about the table in Eric's house? She even says that she hates a vampire she doesn't even know because she walked on the table. Why the hell do you care so much about this table? Even in the last book, Sookie was constantly obsessing over Eric's furniture? A better ending to this series would have been if Sookie married that table because she is so obsessed with it. Seriously I wouldn't have been surprised if that happened because her obsession with the table is so peculiar. Sookie acts so stupid during this book that I wondered if Harris forgot to write her a brain.<br /><br />  When Sookie gets arrested for these murders, she isn't even slightly bothered by the fact that someone is accusing her of murder. All she cares about how she doesn't look good in orange, honey no one cares whether you look good in orange or not! At one point in the novel Sookie is having a conversation and she randomly suggests: \\"Maybe I should write a rap song called Flanked By His Flankies\\". Where did that even come from? Please don't write a rap song for the reader's sake! The old Sookie would never have been so unsympathetic, stupid, and she would have never suggested writing a rap song! Sookie doesn't get any better throughout the novel and she says cliche things throughout the entire book like: \\"How could people so in love judge each other?\\" Give me a break, you're stupidity made me feel like I was going to lose brain cells.<br /><br />  The so-called romance in this book is absurd and is a disgrace to books everywhere! I could tell early on what Harris's formula for this book's romance was. She devoted an entire chapter to each guy Sookie was involved with and she made the guy look like a jerk. Why would Quinn and Alcide randomly just pop in to Sookie's life? Harris tried to intertwine the plot with the romance but it was an epic fail! I think Harris was trying to make readers comfortable with who she chose but it was a lame tactic on her part. I knew who she was going to choose for Sookie long ago because she made it so obvious! Let's just say that I'm not happy at all with who she chose and how she made all the men Sookie was involved with. Worst case scenario: I would have been happier if Sookie decided that maybe none of the guys in her life were right for her.<br /><br />  Seriously Harris turned all the guys into such jerks and yet Sookie continues to chase after them and obsess over them. Sookie, you don't need a man to support you! The ending of this book was such a cop-out and was so terrible! I hated the ending so much and this is easily the worst conclusion to a series. The ending made me so angry and I felt like I had wasted my time reading this entire series. The ending was cheesy, cliche and absolutely predictable!<br /><br />  I wouldn't recommend reading this book at all and it was torturous to read this book! Unless you're a die-hard Sookie fan or you need to know what happens, I wouldn't even bother picking up this book. There's nothing redeeming about this \\"final\\" book in the Sookie Stackhouse series and it was such a cash-cow scheme. I can't believe there's an epilogue coming out in the fall and I wouldn't be surprised if Harris added another 5 books to cash in even more on this series. This book is possibly one of the worst books I've read in so long and someone on Twitter tweeted me a blessing when they heard I was reading this book. Yes it was that bad that some random follower who I don't know blessed me after hearing I was reading this book. I refuse to pick up another Harris book ever again and I intend to keep this promise. Honestly I don't think this book even deserves 1 star!: \\"Maybe I should write a rap song called Flanked By His Flankies\\". Where did that even come from? Please don't write a rap song for the reader's sake! The old Sookie would never have been so unsympathetic, stupid, and she would have never suggested writing a rap song!

B005MLOKXA|5.0|Acting & writing both first-rate; and who decided that there should be a minimum-word limit on these reviews? THAT'sj dumb...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Another great season! I had no problems streaming it.<br />(Although its annoying that I must find 20+ words to say, just in order to give 5 stars...)

B00B29J0I6|5.0|Just downloaded the game with no problems. Game runs smooth. My grandkids love the game. It does get harder as you increase in the levels but that just makes it more fun.
B00A83075M|5.0|Two Years ago, if you had told me Disney (not Pixar) was making a movie with video games as characters, I would simply laugh and say \\"the people at Disney have gone nuts\\". Here recently however, I have found that sometimes its the movies we write off or ignore, are the main movies that should not be missed. That said, Wreck It Ralph should not be missed. It is one of Disney's best movies. I honestly do not understand how Brave won the title as Best Animated Feature at this years Academy Awards when Wreck It Ralph is clearly the better movie, but oh well.<br /><br />Wreck It Ralph stars John C Reily as the title character Ralph. Enter Ralph: 9 feet tall 640 something pound character in an arcade game who is a bad guy that desperately wants to be a good guy. For what its worth, his character is very likeable. Then we have Jack Mcbrayer as Fix it Felix, Jane Lynch as Sergeant Calhoun, and Sarah Silverman as the loveable Vanellope von Schweetz. Vanellope's character is also very interesting. She is a young girl who is initially an outcast because she is a \\"glitch\\" in the game she is in but as the movie progresses, you ultimately come to realize there is clearly more to her character than meets the eye.<br /><br />The story line is what this movie delivers best. It not only brings laughs, notable touching moments, and video game cameos from past and present, but it also deals with issues (like bullying) that need to be addressed and it does it very well. It also goes to show that sometimes it IS the little things that count.<br /><br />I have to say again, I did not expect to like this movie. But after multiple viewings, it is one I love and had to own in my collection. People young and old will enjoy Wreck It Ralph.<br /><br />5 Stars
B00BESFWBY|2.0|Performance and script not very good. The fact that a teen rode maverick isn't a great story line. x x
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love love love this!!! Heard about this book many times, but finally broke down and read it. Wow. Now I need to watch the show too.
0345803485|1.0|I ignored this book for quite awhile, mainly because I've heard it referenced as \\"mommy porn\\" on several occasions. But one day, I was bored and my friend lent me the book. All I can say, is I'm glad I didn't pay for this. There is no plot whatsoever. All it is is sex. It sounds way too much like Twilight and is more fan fiction than anything else. It's sad that this book made it to the top of the best sellers list and that there's a movie deal in the works. Honestly, I don't see how they can make a movie out of this book and expect to make money.<br /><br />The characters are far from believable. One, there are very few people who can become billionaires by the age of 26 (not saying it's impossible, just improbable). Adding to that, he is strikingly handsome, athletic, is great at practically everything he does. Why would he be interested in a plain Jane woman who is the complete opposite of what he originally wants?<br /><br />Then lets add to the mix that he is a complete ass who stalks the main character Anastasia. She finally gets the balls to leave him with five pages of the last book, but happily rushes back to him in the second. He's abusive, sadistic, and cruel. It's sad to think that this is what people are finding \\"sexy\\" these days.<br /><br />Overall, I say don't waste your time. It's basically Twilight minus the vampires and more sex. At least Twilight had a plot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome.  I loooove it you can battle and farm and liiiiiive!! I also love the skins available its woo cool everyone needs it
B00ATPVA78|4.0|It is very detail oriented and was intellectually stimulating always. This game was interesting and continually changed directions in the area of plot.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|It was good to gat the picture from Abby's point of view. Like Walking Disaster this is also brilliant book.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I downloaded this game after reading the reviews. they all said this was easy and fun to solve.  1 review said it was not good if you did't know the rules.  Well i tried to play and can't get passed the first puzzle.  NO NO NO! waste of my GB space.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is just a great story teller.  He has a phenomenal sense of structure and an uncanny way of bringing everything together in such a smooth and seemingly effortless manner.  Clearly he loves his Afgan culture and describes it in such an effortless way that this reader effortlessly felt like I was a part of it.  I came to appreciate the softness of this people - their depth - their poverty -  their soul.  The coming of full circle.....  It was just a great read and I couldn't seem to lay it down for long
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Different take on puzzles. Kept me interested and the puzzles kept me guessing many times. Hope more neat interesting puzzles are added.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The final installment of Nolan's \\"Dark Knight\\" Trilogy sees several new faces (including Tom Hardy as the mysterious Bane, Anne Hathaway as rogue Catwoman, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a cop who knows a little more than he lets on) as well as some wonderful twists and turns from one of cinema's most important modern directors. Acting as the final act to an epic yet character-driven trilogy, this film also underlines the themes of chaos, pain, guilt, and destiny. A near perfect ending to a near perfect trio of films.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We loved every minute of this series and cannot wait for Season 4!  When does Season 4 begin?  5 Stars!!!!
B0013WJGJ0|4.0|The film that relaunched the Batman craze put Michael Keaton in the Batmobile opposite Jack Nicholson as the dark hero's greatest adversary, The Joker. Adding a good mix of dark humor and light drama, this exciting opener for the franchise does a darn good job of introducing Batman to a new generation. My only real complaint about this film is that it acts like more of a vehicle for Jack Nicholson's career than for Batman's, with the Oscar-winning actor receiving more screen time than the title character.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love to put this on and sit in the hot tub in the sun and listen all day long.
B000P0J06U|5.0|While this is the darkest of the Batman films until Nolan came into the picture, it's easy to forget how much of a dark comedy Burton's second stab at the caped crusader really is. Featuring a better story, better development, and great performances from a cast that includes Keaton reprising his role as Batman, Michelle Pfieffer as Catwoman, Danny DeVito as a truly disturbing Penguin, and Christopher Walken as the film's true villain, Max Shreck. Everything Tim Burton did with his sophomore venture into the DC character's universe made up for any misgivings about the previous installment, with an ending so perfect that it still gives me chills when I watch it.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|the first one was great.  the second one was ok.  but man, I wish they would stop making these?  this seemed to be nothing more than a made for video movie.
B000HF0IIC|2.0|In Joel Schumacher's first swing at the franchise Batman is portrayed by Val Kilmer and Chris O'Donnell makes his first appearance as the boy wonder. While the film falls flat in terms of story and development and is setup more as a formula action film, the leads work really well in their roles, with Kilmer playing a decidedly reserved Dark Knight, O'Donnell doing well to capture the anger and vengeful nature of Robin, and two pretty fair villainous performances by Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey \\"Two-Face\\" Dent and Jim Carrey as The Riddler. While overall a pretty weak film, Batman Forever proves to be a fun two hours of entertainment and is loyal aesthetically to the style of the Tim Burton installments.
B00BNPUA5Q|1.0|I can't believe I wasted $16 on this crap.  I and 2 other friends with android tablets have had so many problems with this set of apps that we've uninstalled all of it.  Don't waste your money or your time.  It's pretty but way too problematic to spend $15.99!!!
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|This film has the unfortunate title of \\"Best Film Ever Made\\" which puts the film on such a pedestal that it's hard not to go into it with high expectations. The funny thing is that Welles' directorial debut actually lives up to those expectations. Little more is left to say about this film other than that it is completely deserving of its secondary title as \\"Best Film Ever\\", and any attempt for me to analyze it would be completely redundant. It's unfortunate that it's one of Welles' only films that he had complete creative control over.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|While I generally love John Scalzi's writing, this isn't his best work. The characters are interesting, but the basic concept behind the story isn't enough to sustain a novel. Kind of liking taking a simple joke and making a comedy movie about it; the joke gets stretched thin after a while
B00CATSONE|5.0|Loved the info and tying to his resilient creativity. Absolutely screwed by Edison, Westinghouse, Morgan and often the press, he killed no one, just started a new project......
B005ZOCF5E|1.0|Without spoiling the ending, the plot has the main characters jumping through hoops, dodging danger and criss-crossing the solar system to chase an improbably poorly-laid trail of clues. At any point, the trail could have been lost, and humanity's greatest discovery would have been lost. The protagonist could have simply left a message to be opened at a later date, avoided the whole pointless chase, and assured the message was received.<br />Total disappointment when the Great Secret was revealed
B004SCN2F6|4.0|No, but seriously, this is a great game. It took a couple of characters to work out certain aspects, such as how to juggle faction politics and that it WILL occur that choices will bite you really hard later down the road. All in all, a great text based space game, even if your crew has a worse mortality rate than the Star Trek red shirts.<br /><br />It only lost a star cause I'm nit-picky and wanted to be able to control a fleet instead of a solo ship.
B0049VZ222|1.0|after 3 months purchasing this video.. its not working anymore.. i think you should get to keep the video since you paid for it..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love the game. It's challenging, yet not too challenging that I get frustrated and don't want to play anymore.anthem only problem I have with it is that there's only ten levels. I hope you update soon.
1623420148|5.0|I love this book it is so funny. He got what he deserved.<br />She made him suffer for a bit, Very, very funny and witti.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so addictive! but i love it. this game has kept my intrest for so long. greaf game for people of all ages
B00A757EFW|2.0|I love pac man because it is the only video game I can play. But what I do not like about this app is that it is not very easy to move pac man.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect before I watched this movie but, let me tell you, this one had it all. It has a great story, fantastic acting and action to die for. I actually rented it and, while I was still watching it (yes, in the middle of the movie), I ordered it from Amazon. It was that good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book ever !!!! Awesome ending and clearly written. Easy to understand and full of detail in an enjoyable way. Great job.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Do you really need a review of this movie? This is a classic. Even though Stephen King didn't like it, it's still a great movie. In fact, out of all the King stories made into movies, this has to be one of the best. Is the book better? Sure. Most of them are. There's only so much you can do in 2 hours. It's still a fantastic movie and the blu-ray conversion was great as well.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Really loved this CD. Billy Porter tears it up! Not My Father's Son is so beautiful.  Buy it.  I promise you'll love it too.
1781162646|5.0|Another excellent story by Stephen King. Hard to put down. Great characters and story. Mr. King is one of my favorite authors.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|i really don't like writing reviews and this is actually the first time i write a review on a game. Because this game is really THE best out there. You will never get bored.<br />And this is a unique game where there is actually no need to spend money on powerups because points are easily made. have been playing it for almost a year now. still not bored :)
B001974DG0|4.0|Quite over the top with a dog that can play Scrabble and read books!  But it was an enjoyable read.
B0013ND30W|2.0|i'm really sad for my money, i have not the french on the bluray, not the slipcover and disc and for the dvd dics he is scratch, great !
B003F3PMYI|5.0|A new way to look at things.  Easy read.  Full of reasons to look on the bright side of life.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I have read all of the Theodore Boone books.  Can 't wait to read the next one when it comes out.
0307887448|5.0|Highly recommend for nostalgic value alone and the storyline is really fun.  Couldn't put it down.  My 14 yr old boys also loved it.  They got a kick out of recognizing the 80s pop stuff.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I will admit, I love books with an unreliable narrator. This book was marketed as a suspenseful psychological thriller, and it was definitely that. Once I got through the first section, I could not put it down. I would highly recommend it for readers who enjoyed \\"Gone Girl\\" by Gillian Flynn or similar works.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Does sometimes get bogged down in the telling of her past but overall a very enjoyable, interesting account of one woman's journey of self-discovery. And a fun, humorous travel adventure account.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I'm so glad I discovered Susan Boyle!! Her music is great and listening to it makes me happy. She is fantastic!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I cannot stop playing this game. It's so addictive! Extra lives are easy too earn so the fun never stops.
023076651X|5.0|This seems like a good book. I haven't read it all the way through yet but I will. I would like to start my own business someday soon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One may not want to read this if a movie goer and await the movie.  I like to read the book and then sere the movie because movies leave out so much of the story.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. I can see a lot of my relationship between myself and my mother in this movie. I think this movie would be good for the family. The mother reminds me a lot of my mother always telling me what is good and unwanted advice. I say this movie would be a good movie to watch on mother's day.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Finishes the trilogy. Evil is taken care of. The bad guys get what they deserve only to have the good guys take over the bad guy roles, Government always does this.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is a great CD. Love all of his music. The cd is full of lots of great songs. Can't wait to check out more from him.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Fun and challenging. It gets 5 stars from me. Need more levels ASAP. It's a very fun game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have resisted reading these books for years and now I can't put them down.  Action and intrigue, interesting characters and plot development.  I appreciate that  it is not as relationship driven as the Twilight series.  Can't wait to plow through the third book....and maybe even watch the movie.
1600595871|5.0|This is an A to Z book on how to make handmade books.  The illustrations are good with instructions that are complicated when the books are complicated; it takes concentration to understand.  Not a criticism; I couldn't have done as well.
B004XZR63M|5.0|The first several chapters of this book made think I was back in my grandfathers living room listening to him give me financial advise.  Most important point in the book was, &#34;make your money work for you.&#34;  My grandfather used to say this to me over and over again.  It's amazing how those who have accumulated wealth though complete strangers give the same advice.  I don't think the book was as much a blue print for wealth creation as it was a rough sketch.  You won't be able to take this book by itself and plan out your fortune.  If you could Mr. Kiyosaki wouldn't have needed to write his other books.  However, this is a great starting point for someone who is not very confident and/or uncertain on how to start investing.  There are is very profound advice on the skills that every entrepreneur needs:  accounting, marketing, and sales skills.  The idea that fear and greed are what keeps people from investing is spot on.  The fearful are afraid to start and the greedy can't handle market fluctuation.  I highly recommend this book to a beginner.
0810993139|4.0|My 8.5-year-old daughter loves to read and I try to guide her on which books might be appropriate and not, especially given that she reads several levels above her grade. Some of the YA books that she has come across and expressed interest in turn out to contain more mature themes which I feel she is not ready for.<br /><br />The \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" series of books is fun and we came to this series by way of the movies (three out so far) and I made it a point to read it first before allowing her to read it. The protagonist is a young teen named Greg Heffly who is not exactly role model material. In fact, throughout this book, he displays undesirable behavior such as trying to get away with not putting in his best effort, lying, manipulating others for his own gain, and being far too self-absorbed and interested in becoming popular. Greg is a shallow character for much of the book but despite these flaws, he is an interesting character, and similarly the situations he finds himself in.<br /><br />Luckily, I was aware of the content and discussed it with my daughter, especially regarding Greg's behavior and some of his choices which my daughter agrees weren't the best or appropriate. I feel that depending on the child's level of maturity, this book can be handled by a younger reader, ages 8-10, but there needs to be some level of discussion or guidance provided. The story makes for a hilarious read and readers, especially adolescents might even empathize with some of the teen angst displayed in this series of books. Overall, I give it 4 stars for being entertaining and also for encouraging children to read. One of the kids I tutor who is about 12 years old is a self-confessed reluctant reader but devoured this series within weeks, so that's another appeal to this series.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Because it is fun to play on<br /> It is reflex<br />I like that you can change a lot of things.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a must see!!!  If you have not watched this show yet, please do!  Great!  So excited to see what's to come
B001WCBPCW|5.0|My thanks to the seller for service. Goods were happy with the price and quality. Especially for the price. Why are like because I do not use expensive things, but I try to buy in the Amazon. The only thing that I would like that the country has given a lot of music
B0027MJU00|4.0|Enjoyed this book. It was definitely dark, but Gillian Flynn delivers with this one.  The characters are so interesting.  Not quite as suspenseful as  Gone Girl,  but more heartfelt.
B005IY3DP2|5.0|My thanks to the seller for service. Goods were comfortable with the price and quality. Especially for the price. Why are like because I do not use expensive things, but I try to buy at Amazon. The only thing I would like that the country gave a lot of music
193700788X|4.0|It was better that expected considering the two prior to this one.  I liked it and it answered some questions and there was closure for many relationships and new beginnings for others.
B0078ZTWP4|3.0|I'll just second (third?) what some others have said. My experience is that the Rayovac Sportsman LED Lantern [[ASIN:B0018S4XIS Rayovac Sportsman LED Lantern (SE3DLN)]] is brighter. Other reviewers find this one to be brighter. Maybe it's a quality control issue.<br /><br />The green blinking \\"here I am\\" light on this guy is a lot easier to see than on the Rayovac.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|That book was very real life showing the hard ship of being bullied. I really enjoyed the book a lot and I thought the author did a great job on telling a story about real life
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I had to ask for clues way too often but maybe that is just my problem.  this game should be called Fix Things So You Can Move Forward. because that's what you do. you dont find clues that tell you any thing about the snark. you just fix stuff and move on......but I'm only 1/2 thrum the game. maybe it will be about the snark eventually.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a simple yet challenging game that can be addicting. there hundreds of different levels and puzzels are never the same
B000UGG39Q|5.0|Alright im gonna keep it short. This album from the first note til the very last this is a hauntingly deep album that talks directly about alot of different issues(katrina,death,rehab,etc.) This album is another step forward in the progression of the band DOWN . I hate it when people bash cds,it's the same artist that did NOLA so don't expect a newer album to sound like the one before it,that's why i say progression. My absolute favorite track is Walk Away(Nothing In Return) That song is such a beautiful,perfectly constructed song that just should be played at the close of every single DOWN show it's vjust that amazing. Other favorites are N.O.D, Pillamyd,Never Try and the rare unreleased bonus track(so ive been told its rare) is the song Invest In Fear. I don't think it is on the Black covered album but if you get the deluxe package with the bonus dvd (which i recommend if you can find that copy) It has some rare footage of the band in the studio jamming some net material and playing some old tunes live. Also the deluxe package which has the song Invest In Fear which comes on after Nothing In Return. Buy this album !
B00AB7HESI|3.0|its pretty fun at first but you get addicted and you fjnish it in like an hour not worth it if u want to pay more money
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I don't really understand all the negative reviews. Yes, I understand all the disappointment that the series has been extended from 3 to 5 books, especially at $9.99 per book. That isn't a deal-breaker for me.  I really enjoyed Entwined with You. I won't give away any details but I think Gideon and Eva are growing as individuals and it shows in their trust for each other. It was refreshing to read, especially after all the angst Eva went through in Reflected in You. I can see why Ms. Day decided to extend the series...there are so many plot twists that everything can't be resolved in one last book! If you're like me, then you'll agree that it's always sad when a much liked/loved series ends and you're left wanting more. Well, here's the more you've always wished for...who wouldn't want another book in the Fifty Shades of Grey or Up in Air Series? After my disappointment with Reflected in You, I'm back on track with this series and am looking forward to the next two books!
B0042J6VUS|4.0|The iPhone holder to place on a larger tripod works really well.  Clever yet simple design. It is light, easily attaches to iPhone and is stable.  The included mini tripod is really not too sturdy.  I am using the mini tripod to display an older camera I have in a bookcase.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|love this song. GO DAFT PUNK! cant really complain, i mean i got the music credit for free, so this is one of those free legitimate downloads.
0345803485|1.0|The writing quality is low.<br />It's not all that s&m.<br />Repetitive in writing style.<br />Writer did not research portland. Writer has never been to portland. It's evident. Feels like a 4th grader wrote as short story and tried to stretch it out into a novel. I bought as a trilogy. Bought into the hype. Borrow from your public library instead.<br />I had file these books with my other mistake....a million little pieces.
1936891026|5.0|I rated this War of Art 5 stars because it's a great source of motivation for me and helped me overcome some personal issues that were causing a lot of resistance in my life.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anybody because there's something each of us can take note of. I really don't want to give too many details about the book specifically either because I don't want to be 'that guy' that spoils it for anybody.<br /><br />I read the entire book within 24 hours of receiving it and I'm not really the greatest reader. I'd assume that anybody with average reading skills could do the same. I don't have any complaints about it, I really liked everything about the book.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|I get that it's a Conan movie and all but it had no soul even for a pulp action movie.  I liked the bad guy but that's kind of it.  It just kind of ended and the major battle was pretty lame and way too long.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|~ (Religion-friendly alternative romance) ~<br /><br />(Underlying pickups) Symbolism makes a movie more interesting.<br />When a man takes a woman as his bride, the father passes his responsibility into the groom's hands. \\"It is up to the boy now [to protect her].\\"<br /><br />We all must battle the darkness trying to overtake us, but to have faith (stay constant/ steadfast) is how we persevere.<br /><br />-- more comments to further this.
3836538725|3.0|Spectacular book, super print quality, eye popping subjects and landscape.<br />Comes with a cheap paper handbook with detailed description of the pictures and a brief introduction of the area photographed.<br />Most pictures cover 2 sides of the page with the middle rung ruining the overall view. Some of the pull outs have such small pictures.<br />Horrible choice on part of the Taschen design team.<br />Overall, for the price and photographers vision is a good buy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator works perfectly for simple math which was all i needed.  I would recommend it to any one due to its ease of use.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Only a couple died of the original cast and left the rest of the forsaken alive!  Clause for another book or just a poor ending!!  Over all the battles and pace of the book was great but the ending needed more to it I think!  I would still recommend it to anyone though!  Not a bad job by Brandon Sanderson picking up the remaining books!
1250027624|4.0|I don't think I enjoyed this book as much as the one from the first season, but will have to have them all anyway since I am a huge fan of the series! I know this did go into more depth on the characters, but nothing that surprised me or seemed &#34;new.&#34;  I do enjoy reading through it as I do the book from the first season.  Pictures are beautiful and i can never get enough of the gorgeous clothes!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel because of its accurate depiction of how life in Afghanistan is like. The Taliban's curality towards women and their disregard in considering them as human beings. Lailia and Mariam's abuse at the hands of their husband was vividly presented.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is another wonderful book. Hosseini is an amazing storyteller. He weaves his characters throughout the book so beautifully and compassionately.
0988936402|4.0|I enjoyed the story. The book ended in a way that makes want to read the sequel when it comes out. Great book for young adult readers that shows what can happen when people make the wrong choices and the fall out that comes from that.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I had heard of this book but never read it. I came here from Scotland in the sixties and the title did not not not resonate with me at the time. We could all learn from the frugality in this book.  What a pity that the family could not communicate.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read other books like this and this author did a good job of trying to describe what happened to him. Some of the medical terminology was a little difficult to understand without a medical background, but a good read.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|So I'm doing my part.  5 star rating and review.<br /><br />35 years have passed since we've had a Black Sabbath album with Ozzy as the front man (the Reunion Live album didn't count... let's be honest).  You would think that the band's sound would have changed dramatically, but to almost everyone's surprise (myself, included), the band actually sounds better now than they did when they ended in 1978 with the subpar \\"Never Say Die!\\" album.  Although \\"13\\" doesn't quite match up to the quality level of, say, \\"Sabotage\\" or \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", it's at least better than the last 2 Ozzy era Sabbath albums.  It's hard to believe that they could seemingly pick up right where they left off 3 and a half decades later, while not sounding dated or stale.  Sabbath's sound remains relevant today, and the modern touches found throughout the album do not appear to be out of place or contrived in any way.  They have blended the old with the new perfectly.  There is not one bad song on this album.  No filler to speak of.  Ozzy's voice does not have the same power it did back in the 70's, but on this album, he sounds better than he has in years.<br /><br />I really wish Bill Ward would have been on board with this album.  It would have been awesome to have all of the original members back on such a classic album, but we will take what we can get.  This IS classic Sabbath.  It's not modern day Sabbath pretending to sound like classic Sabbath, this is the real thing.  It's a great thing to witness them hitting #1 for the first time in the US.  It's been a long time coming, and they deserve it more than any other band out there.  If they never release another album, we can all take pride in knowing these guys went out as winners, with a great album.  Their legacy as metal gods is enshrined forever.
B000001Y79|5.0|The case was cracked but was unopened and the cd was perfectly fine.  Very happy I found the cd here!
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Let me start by saying that I own more than 1000 concert DVDs, and I hardly ever write a review. However, I am making an exception in this case. For one thing, I was a huge Supertramp fan growing up, and to enjoy this concert you would have to be a fan of their music. Secondly, there is unbelievably little live footage of this band in any form. There are other bands with many DVDs out, and most of them from this period are not worth watching. And then there are the bands that do reunion tours years later. For the most part these DVDs, especially on blu-ray, sound and look great. However, some of the band members are usually different, and the ones that remain are no longer in their prime (to put it nicely). But here we have what I would call \\"The Holy Grail\\" for Supertramp fans. A film of the band performing one of their greatest concerts -- not a reunion tour, but an actual recording of the entire band in their prime. It's like having a time machine.<br /><br />VIDEO QUALITY:  I know that some people will knit-pick about the video quality; but it wasn't shot in Hi-Def -- that did not exist back in 1979. What you do have is an amazing restoration of what is probably 35mm or perhaps even 16mm film. And for what it is, it looks great. The lighting is good, so you can see the band members, and the camera work is decent. If you are expecting this to look like it was shot in Hi-Def, just because it is on blu-ray, then you do not understand blu-ray technology. But I can honestly say that I got so caught up in the music, that it did not bother me one bit. I would much rather have this video, such as it is, than a Hi-Def recording of the band today trying to recreate the magic they had back on this night in 1979. It is not even close.<br /><br />AUDIO QUALITY:  This is where the blu-ray really shines. This is a true 5.1 surround sound recording. If your system can decode DTS-HD then you are in for an unbelievable treat. If you do not hear how incredible this sounds, then the problem is your system. It is just superb in every way. Regular DVD sound simply can't touch it. I wanted to shout for joy during parts of this concert, it sounds that good. Every band member had it going in this concert, and you can hear it all. Over and over again I found myself cranking up the volume in another of the many great moments in this concert.<br /><br />Let me end by saying a little about reports that one or more band members are unhappy about the release of this DVD. All of the guys in the band made a ton of money off of us fans. How about letting us have this one -- I think we deserve it. I know that you created the music, but we supported you for years by buying your albums. Why should this concert rot away in a barn just because you can't get along now. Anyway -- nuff said.

0061002860|5.0|Seriously such a great book that pays homage to Conan Doyle and at the same time pays it forward to the great Poirot. There is an astounding simplicity to the plot as well as a brilliant definition of character that will carry you through to the wonderfully constructed and so shocking ending.  I have read this several times and I'm still amazed at how deliciously perfect it is every time. Really truly read this, even with the modern sensibilities you will be gratified.
B002S45V32|2.0|Maybe I'm not a teenager anymore and this is why this movie doesn't appeal to me. Though it does illustrate quite nicely the fickleness that is teenage love. They meet eyes once, hold hands and go to prom, and then they're in love. Completely unremarkable main female character ditches dorky best friend  Ducky for the handsome (eh) rich boy that smiled at her once. It's like twilight set in the 80s with about as much depth and far fewer vampires. (Though that Cindy Lauper wannabe comes close)
B000FC146C|5.0|Well written, holds your interest all through the book.  You felt like you knew the Cleary family and witnessed their lives in Austrailia.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Just finished this incredible book and wonder why I waited so long to read it. The story is fascinating; the characters so very real and there are so many memorable phrases that I HAD to highlight for future review. Oscar Wilde was a master storyteller. This book is a solid five star read!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I'm a child of the Star Trek generation and I have always felt a sense of \\"hope\\" in watching the Star Trek series.<br />This movie gave me a nice jolt of that feeling. Our country and our planet are in serious peril at this time but watching<br />these movies helps me not to lose hope in our future.  I've seen all of the original 60's TV series and all of the movies in the past. I own all but 2 or 3 of the movies(the very 1st one with a bald woman was pretty bad).<br />  I've read all of the 1 star reviews from the \\"haters\\" and agree there is room for improvement. But considering how many bad movies I've seen over my lifetime this film doesn't even come close to being a bad movie. How many superhero remakes are going to be made? This summer's heroes are Superman and The Lone Ranger. Both are completely outdated. Neither one could do anything to stop the Taliban. IRONMAN 3? REALLY? I fell asleep during the first one, it was so boring in the beginning. 2-hated it. 3-will rent it but probably dislike it. Sadly, not enough people appreciate what STAR TREK is really about. It brings hope to fans today and it has brought hope and inspiration to millions of people around the world since the 1960's.

Their album &#34;The Walk&#34; is I still feel their best album to date (I'm a piano girl) but Anthem is right up there with it. This album full of heavy guitar rifs and power lyrics is one to turn up and roll the windows down with this summer. Buy this you will not regret it

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I had no idea, really, what to expect from this new novel. I had not \\"tripped the literary light fantastic\\" with one of Neil's works since the fine \\"Graveyard Book\\" and he had been so heavily immersed in the vortex of social media (from what I could tell) that I wondered if his output --or the quality of his output-- might be adversely affected. Indeed, after reading his prologue, (the protagonist is never named as a child or as an adult in this first-person narrative), I wondered if Gaiman had perhaps gone off the rails. The prologue was such a disoriented, rambling mess full of commas and clunks and stuttered sentences and so much disconnected atmosphere that I began to panic.<br /><br />\\"We've lost the great Neil Gaiman!\\" I gasped to the wall in disbelief. I think I may have even started to sweat, for I have so enjoyed and treasured his work through the years -- its reliability and soulful craftsmanship.<br /><br />I need not have feared, and no Gaiman fan ought to fear, either. It soon became apparent that the aforementioned prologue was intended to introduce the reader to a man clearly mired in confusion and a haze of uncertain memories about his past as he attends a funeral and decides, on an inexplicable impulse, to take a drive down the country lane where he lived long ago as a child. He finds an astonishing-but-subtle magic waiting there for him beside a nondescript farmhouse pond and the sweeping truth of his lost youthful experiences in the neighborhood comes flooding back.<br /><br />Once Gaiman begins to weave the narrative of the story proper, he is in full command of his usual powers, duly unraveling for us a tapestry of imaginative brilliance, unforgettable imagery, poignant reflection on the nature of worldly (and otherworldly) reality and some of the most opulent, original characterizations of his entire career. The unnamed child at the heart of the tale is a book-loving, introverted, but never the less brave little fellow in his own way, and a series of events both mundane and disturbing lead him to visit the farm down at the bottom of the lane, where dwell the three Hempstock females -- eleven year-old Lettie, her mother Ginnie and Old Mrs. Hempstock, the matriarch. It becomes swiftly apparent that these women are not exactly \\"of this world,\\" despite their homely and winsome ways. The imperative destiny of their existence in the boy's suddenly frightening and fast-changing life is never fully explained, but their relationship to him becomes crucial, for the child has stumbled upon a gateway between worlds, as if by accident, and he is soon to need the mystical and powerful help of the Hempstock women ... for other, less benevolent forces have found their way into this innocuous corner of the world, as well.<br /><br />At the symbolic heart of this novel is the barnyard pond, which Lettie Hempstock calls her \\"ocean,\\" for it has apparently carried her and her mother and grandmother across vast expanses of time, space, and magic despite its seeming insignificance, its everyday plainness. The aching, almost heartbreaking simplicity and poignancy of Gaiman's use of the pond is one of the most subtly powerful devices he has ever employed in his works.<br /><br />I will reveal no spoilers, beyond the fact that Gaiman re-explores the themes of lost worlds, parallel worlds, doors between worlds, and the helpers and villains who journey to our sphere via those doors. Mythological themes are likewise evoked, in grand Gaiman tradition, but one of his finest strengths has always been the glorious economy of his writing style and the ability to resist telling the reader too much, thereby leaving us tantalized and struck with a sense of awe, wonder and mystery appropriate to this kind of fairy tale or fantasy. Some have noted that this book bears a great deal of similarity to \\"Coraline\\" but any similarities are incidental, at most, in my opinion. This book has the potency of a long-cherished fable and is rendered in the first-person (very beautifully, I might add) and, as mentioned, Gaiman's themes of primordial myth, god-like beings dwelling among modern humans, and interweaving worlds are hardly unique to \\"Coraline\\" or this new book; these leitmotifs are features of almost all of his books and the presence of a child protagonist and some decidedly adult themes make this book quite different from Coraline or Graveyard. In tone, \\"Ocean\\" stands wholly on its own while reminding me in some ways of the splendor, dark charm and radiant beauty of \\"Stardust,\\" only the setting is more contemporary and thus perhaps a bit more accessible and relevant. It is also more daring in its insinuations about the very nature of the fabric that holds the universe(s) together.<br /><br />When I mention fabric, I do so with the warning that fabric might just instill a bit of the same terror that buttons managed to instill in Coraline, in an altogether different way.<br /><br />The book is indeed short, and in just a few places the dialogue gets a small, very tiny bit trite when it comes to certain characters seeking to explaining great mysteries of creation, but these factors are negligible only for the deduction of one half-star (I would have rated this a 4 and 1/2 read). With \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" Gaiman has delivered yet another work of completeness in its beauty, terror and affecting honesty.  With the mountains of unreadable pulp and garbage heaping-up all around us and posing as \\"novels\\" in today's market, Gaiman's latest stands as a beacon and reminder that good books require good writers who have worked relentlessly to pay some dues, hone their skills and who pride themselves on their craftsmanship, along with the impeccable standards exacted by proper editors.<br /><br />Watch, read, learn and enjoy, book-lovers of the world -- we are fortunate to have Gaiman write so beautifully for us in this often undeserving age of compromised quality.

B0012TWRAO|3.0|I bought this RAM mount as part of my three-piece setup for my Ninja 650.  I really like the mount design and it works great on my handlebars, but I found that the two mounting nuts strip VERY easily. I had only tightened and loosened these nuts twice (while trying to find the right position) and they were all chewed up and void of almost all their coating. The nuts are coated just like the ball mount, unlike what the picture shows.  The ball mount itself was shedding its coating right out of the package, which was disappointing.<br /><br />This mount comes with two different sized u-bolts, which was very convenient because every bike has different handlebar diameter.  I had a lot of difficulty making the small ABS plastic piece (handlebar protector) stay in the right position...I might just take it off and use electrical or rubber tape instead to protect the handlebars.<br /><br />Aside from these issues, it is a great mount and works flawlessly with my other two RAM pieces (short arm and x-grip).  It hasn't moved an inch and I went on a 60-mile trip the other day at freeway speed.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|From start to finish the movie is a wild romp! Rebel Wilson is a sensation, an unexpected and unbelievably funny powerhouse actress throughout the movie. The entire cast pulls their weight and the laughs don't seem to stop.<br />The music is awesome, the premise is novel and the characters are well played and believable.<br />My daughter is in choir, I watched the movie first and KNEW I had to buy it for her, she was blown away! She loved every minute of it.<br />If you're into singing, or enjoy watching/listening to singing, along with smartalec humor... this is a must have!

Such a disappointment, True Blood is so much better I recommend that over the books any day!

B00C7EGV5U|4.0|This compact but revealing story, woven with the threads of humility, hubris, arrogance and compassion, is as compelling as any Greek tragedy. The author has been meticulous in the presentation of his characters, but the eventual fall and &#34;disintegration&#34; of his main character was never predictable.  Who could have imagined that the arrival of &#34;civilization&#34; and a new, competing religion would have such a transformative effect on an older &#34;culture&#34; with well established historical and social, mores and practices? One does have the feeling that this was the recounting of a true story ... rather than a prelude to the tragedy of the more recent exploits of &#34;God's army&#34;.<br /><br />George Nicholson

B00263HWM8|4.0|The soundtrack to this movie is one of my most favorite soundtracks (not the music inspired by, but the actual music used in the film).  It really brings the level of the movie up.  I also really enjoy John Woo's direction and style in this film, dramatic slow motion (the flamenco dance scene anyone??) and stylized fight scene (the motorcycle battle - yes! yes!).  Tom Cruise also looks like he is having fun.<br /><br />This is an excellent popcorn flick.

1490313370|4.0|If you read James Altucher's blog you're in for more of that. If not, I'll tell you he's honest, hilarious, and inspirational.  I found this book to be very similar to his previous, I Was Blind But Now I See. If you read that book it's pretty much the same concept with similar stories.  However, there are new examples of his points that are detailed in this book.  I found this work to be very good.  Just like with the blog and previous book, I laughed out loud, I got some new insight into the way the world works today, and motivation to \\"choose myself.\\"  This book reminds you that the world is ever changing and you have to always make yourself a priority in your own life.

B00AIBZM40|4.0|Over the years the \\"horror\\" genre has become synonymous with gore and violence and it's nice to know there are still people who know how to terrify without spraying viscera everywhere.<br /><br />Mama pulls out all the horror film clichés: disguised dream sequences, sudden foreground appearances, orchestral stings, and a fair amount of running.  And yet I found myself genuinely frightened and completely entertained.<br /><br />The acting is excellent: Jessica Chastain is matched by the two children, and the supporting cast do fine.  In fact it's a relief to see character's in a genre that usually relies on stereotypes.<br /><br />The camera work is deliberate and cleverly planned: all those clichés actually pay off in interesting ways.<br /><br />The violence is almost all off-screen, and the entire movie reminded me of M Knight Shamylan's best work -- tension and terror.<br /><br />Some have complained about the ending -- and it doesn't pay-off the way other sequences in the film do -- but they had me all the way there.<br /><br />Completely enjoyable.

B005LAIIMG|1.0|I saw it in the theater second day of it's release in 3D and -- being a Brad Pitt fan -- was absolutely horrified (and not in a good way) by this nonsense.<br /><br />And yet I can't help noticing a lot of 5 star reviews -- almost as if it's being seeded by the studio -- for a movie that has no characters, none of the traditional zombie violence (there's a lot of shrieking and running, but nothing remotely approaching \\"graphic\\", and not a single head-shot, which is how you kill zombies... isn't it?), and a story that is just silly.<br /><br />The camera does a lot of flash-panning and blurring, so it's almost impossible to tell what is happening -- which is probably for the best, because the director doesn't seem to have any interest in the story anyway.<br /><br />Every sequence in this film, from the very beginning where Pitt and family have breakfast, devolves into a tedious cliché.  The \\"acting\\" is pedestrian at best -- Pitt's two \\"cute\\" daughters are annoying enough that I actually found myself wishing they'd get eaten.  Every scene feels contrived and often like a cut-and-paste from another movie -- which I suspect most of them are.<br /><br />The zombies are those high-speed dudes from 28 Days Later (now THAT is a zombie movie), and they make a lot of noise and shriek -- but someone decided to trim (or not even shoot) any kind of carnage, so while there are some spectacular crowd scenes (you've seen most of them in the trailer BTW) there isn't any visceral threat, little tension, and no horror to speak of.<br /><br />The film makes the classic mistake that most Hollywood groupthink projects make: disrespecting the genre.  In \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" the dead rose and feasted on the living -- and no one wasted time trying to figure out why.  In \\"28 Days Later\\" a virus got loose, and the infected feasted on the flesh of the living -- and no one wondered why.  In Zac Snyder's silly remake of \\"Dawn of The Dead\\" one of the characters died, and then it was revealed that if you're not bitten you don't come back: so where did the first Zombie come from?  HINT: it didn't matter until the idiot screen-writer brought it up.<br /><br />WWZ has Brad Pitt on a quest for Patient Zero (a la \\"Contagion\\" -- a great apocalyptic movie BTW) so they can do what?  Find a cure?  You turn Zombie TEN SECONDS!  Find a vaccine?  They BITE you!  It's like creating a vaccine for shark-bite!<br /><br />By the time Pitt arrives at the final act you can anticipate the dialog word for word, and then it all turns into a Doom-like videogame.<br /><br />But wait, maybe I was just jaded, with ridiculous expectations?  I felt so bad about feeling bad about this movie that I rented \\"Mama\\" just to see if I was having a bad day: \\"Mama\\" scared the pants off me.<br /><br />WWZ?  Forget it!  This is the zombie movie you can take your parents to -- and then you can listen to them listen to them call you a wuss all the way home.

In a world of miserable NOISE that is touted as music - this is a rare pleasure, a trained voice that can actually sing.

0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman's 'The Graveyard Book' has been my favourite piece of literature since it first graced the shelves of my local bookstore. Now it may be pushed aside by 'Ocean'.<br />This brilliant piece of literature combines the innocence of a children's fairy tale with a deeply dark undertone that makes it a perfect read for adults who can still allow the matter-of-fact belief in magic into their hearts. It sums up all of the fears one has as a child when a new babysitter comes to call as well as the insecurities of adulthood when that babysitter tries and succeeds in winning over everyone except for the one little boy who knows what she truly is.<br />Three strong female characters are poised at the centre of it all when evil comes to call and the little boy has nowhere else to turn except to the odd little farmhouse at the end of his lane-- the house that has an ocean in its backyard. The Hempstock women are fearless, mysterious, and wise beyond the years that their faces show. So when evil comes to the border of their property, they calmly do what must be done before the fabric of the universe itself is torn to shreds.<br />This is a story a the courage of a seven year old boy, the cowardice of an old Opal Miner, an oblivious and easily manipulated family that is on the brink of losing their home, a cat plucked from the ground like a bulb plant, an evil presence that threatens the lives of those who are near it, and the three women who can stop it.<br />I devoured this book in a single afternoon. If you have never read a Neil Gaiman book, this is a superb way to be introduced to his style of storytelling. If you have read his books before, you already know that it's going to be a flawless gem in the eyes of a black cat with a white patch of fur on one ear.<br /><br />--Soulvei

B0000AUHOH|4.0|I strongly disagree with the notion that ST V was the worst of the film series.  That distinction rests with the incomparable first film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, a turd that has no equal.  There were several areas in which ST V fell short, but it works in one way, and in my view it's the most important way: the film is a celebration of the Kirk / Spock / McCoy friendship, which is the core of Star Trek and its appeal.  The Motion Picture had a poor plot and characterization that ranged from faulty to non-existent.  Everyone was cold and isolated in ST I.  Shatner's vision for ST V-- that of the crew looking for God-- was flawed and problematic, and ultimately condemned this film to the lower echelon of Trek outings... but at least we got to go on an adventure with our old friends, and, in its better moments, have some fun.  Camping in Yosemite was fun.  The three of them trying to make it to the top of the elevator shaft on Spock's rocket boots was fun.  The film is definitely not on par with The Wrath of Khan, but at least it feels like Star Trek.  Shatner's heart was in the right place, and while he made mistakes, I think the studio also stacked the deck against him in terms of budget, etc.  I think people who enjoy the comraderie / friendship aspect of Star Trek can find entertainment and enjoyment in The Final Frontier.  Grab some marshmellons (and maybe some of that bourbon and beans to get you through Uhura's strip tease) and give it another a chance.

0452289963|5.0|True freedom is found in the present moment.  Of course, sometimes our present moments don't feel like freedom.  So, how can this be true?  Because no person, situation, or thing can keep you from fulfilling your destiny.  The destiny that is yours is not in the future.  It is right here.  It is right NOW.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome but hard! I didn't need a cheat on this game. Took me one day to complete this. I don't know why it says coming soon? Can't you complete all the rooms?
B000E1NWJQ|1.0|I remember the RCA living stereo series from my childhood, my Dad was of the \\"play it loud\\" school of hi-fi enthusiasts.  I am sorry to say that the sound, on this CD at least, is dead, flat, has no bass, and has no dynamics.  I wish it were otherwise, but it ain't.  The Reiner perfomances are terrific, everyone seems to agree on that, but there are just no highs, no lows, and no dynamics in between.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Has tons of sounds that you can personalize! Also, the different screen settings and color choices are a nice feature.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I like games like this. This one is great for me. It's a very fun game.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|It was a thriller from the beginning to the end. I love how the ending is absolutely nothing that I could have imagined!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is so much fun. I love the fact that you don't need WiFi to play, so I can play anywhere. The first few levels are crazy but as you progress they get harder. Love it!!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Very good book.  It was action packed and definitely left me wanting to read what happens next in the 2nd book, city of ashes.  Go Clary Fray!
030758836X|4.0|This book was great to read. It kept me on my toes. You think what is going to happen... happen and it don't. When you think you have figured the whole think out, you haven't.

B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this weather app and all the options/info you can get from it. daily, hourly, the week in advance, etc. lots more I haven't explored I'm sure. I use it for planning around my garden too and it's been really helpful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great! Really challenges you to think! Doesn't hand you the answers easily..  Good game to keep you thinking what is next.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|\\"Access fine (e.g., GPS) location<br />Access information about Wi-Fi networks<br />Access coarse (e.g., Cell-ID, Wi-Fi) location\\"<br />.....<br />Too many invasive permissions that are not required for an app of this sort. This type of app should not require any permissions. AVOID!!!<br />.....<br />Spyware is spyware and does not belong in a game/app that the seller is charging the end user a fee to own. I can somewhat understand greedy programmers putting sypware in free games, but once you start charging a fee for a game/app, all spyware should be removed.

0307887448|5.0|The mix of futuristic virtual reality technology along with 80s nostalgia was an incredibly unexpected mix which kept things interesting. There was a future which I would have to stretch a little bit to see and understand. There was the past which I also watched the characters stretch to understand.<br /><br />I beamed ear-to-ear as I caught a few Easter eggs of 80s trivia which weren't fully explained. When the main character assumed the alias of Bryce Lynch, I nearly hit the floor. But the author didn't ruin the moment by explaining how the name was chosen and who the original character was. He let me savor in my personal knowledge.<br /><br />Later, he gave only the most subtle hint when he talked about the virtual assistant in the protagonist's apartment. Bravo. The author makes me wonder how many more Easter eggs of information I might be missing in my first read through the story.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Have been using swift key for nearly a year now and can't see going back to anything else. Responsive, sleek, and love the predictive words. Also the swipe text option is very smooth.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a good game.  way too short.  level 10 was the hardest one in my opinion.  looking forward to more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is an entertaining puzzle game.  Makes you think.  Graphics are a bit simple for the platform. That's the only reason it's getting a 4.
B00571F26Y|4.0|You will never pick up any item with wheat as an ingredient.  I've only read about 25% of the book, but it inspired me to cut out all wheat products and have lost 10 lbs. so far.<br /><br />Sometimes a little too technical, but a good read for those who are serious about their health.
B0009UVBQI|5.0|Good Kung Fu, nice story line, makes me laugh.  0 to hero. Not all that many good karate movies and I can watch this over and over :)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|What a wonderful dystopia you've created Mr. Howey!  Characters are brave and human, real.  A terrific saga. As one who read The fist chapter as a single, I loved the premise and hoped for more.  Now I see a prequel of sorts and a sequel and embrace them both with anticipation and excitement.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot of fun, definitely would recommend to anyone! Even my kids caught on quickly and had hours of enjoyment.<br />Can't wait for more levels
B008PWUYVA|5.0|This case provides the desired protection we wanted so that if my daughter was t odrop my Kindle it would be protected and is still slim enough that I do not find it to be bothersome when reading.  This really is a nice case and we are very happy with it.
B001EBWIUO|5.0|The actors are excellent with a great script . Walter Huston is incredible ! It is obvious why he won an Oscar for his role.<br />The dialog flows with great fluidity.Bogarts performance is somewhat predictable but his transformation well done.<br />I was impressed with T im Holt who I watched in early westerns .I feel it had all the ingrediants that I find myself watching<br />it many times.The lure of gold,bandits.federalies,indians,what else can you ask for.! And the ending,WOW !!!
B0079R8KO0|2.0|Had to return it because the Kindle just clips in, this was not described in the product description and in the picture it appears to slide in which is what I wanted.
B009MYAQK4|1.0|So disappointed by this book. It read like a personal Bible, with a weak story plot. Paulo can do so much better than this.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I can relate to a lot of this Movie, as I grew up traveling around Canada and the U.S. on my own. That's all I can say.<br />Curt

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've had the mouse for almost three months now, and it is still going strong. The UI for the software that it comes with is simple and easy to use, and the mouse itself is amazing. I really love being able to fine-tune the weight of it to my liking. I am a college student and avid gamer across all platforms, and in the PC realm this mouse is a cut above the rest. I almost don't know what to do with all nine buttons. It's nice that the LED of the Anker logo can be changed to any color you could dream of, but I only wish that is would change the LED color of the middle mouse button and profile selection light. All-in-all, it is a great mouse and I absolutely love it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I get lost trying to beat the high scores. The graphics are tremendous and the high scores are unbelievable. I keep on trying though.

B00DF0POXA|5.0|At first listen, this album is kind of... strange. It feels like Kanye, yet something is different.<br /><br />Somewhere in the middle, you begin to feel the music more, and you want to listen to it again. And again.<br /><br />The 808 & Heartbreaks esque auto-tune is fairly annoying, but can be overlooked at most parts. The lyrics are sly & self-aware, and the music is exciting & interesting.<br /><br />Love it, can't stop listening.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I absolutely recommend you purchase not only this season but all of them. You gotta love the complexity of Dexters character. Who knew you could not only sympathize but actually like a serial killer character. The writers do a great job, even though they have killed off some of my favorite characters. Buy it, watch it, enjoy the wild ride that is Dexters life.
B007UEJEMO|5.0|This product comes from Italy, but I assure you everything is in English. No voice overs, no subtitles. And the shipping cost and transit time were both very respectable.<br /><br />Love this movie, love the soundtrack. Great purchase.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|Good film but unfortunately I could have seen it for free on TV while it was being broadcast.  I feel it was way over priced.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was fun! I couldn't put it down once I started.  Just hard enough to keep you going but easy enough to be fun. I cannot wait for more levels.
B008G3N71W|3.0|Ok, this book is not really for impressionable people and not even for a reader that - like me - enjoys time to time reading good erotica. This one has absolutely EVERYTHING you may imagine and then it takes you even further...<br />It is well written and it has a conductive argument for all the sex but it really can be too much for most people; I would not recommend it if you are not open to read about all kind of stuff such as fetishism, hard BDSM, multiple partners and more...
B00847KFDS|5.0|Great CD!  Loved CCR and John Fogerty did a good job teaming up with other artists.  Some of the songs weren't as good as the originals recordings with CCR, but each were unique!  Loved the artists he chose to work with.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|I have trouble with &#34;To Be Continued&#34; shows. If miss one program then miss an important part of the story. Must watch the program EVERY week to get just a little tidbit of background on what happened on the island. As I said, I have trouble with &#34;To Be Continued&#34; shows. Also, plot has become too complicated. I lost interest.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie was good. It seemed like the plot was a little short. like it should have been part of a movie.. not a movie
0062255657|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this writer-I have enjoyed NEVERWHERE but this one, I could not get too far in to it. Seems like re-hashed material. Perhaps he is over-stretched? This author's earlier works are far better.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I liked the cast of the movie. It had a strong plot and kept my interest. Lots of shooting and other good stuff
0143122916|5.0|Mesmerizing and awful to think of people living in such conditions today.  Now that I know such a place exists these people are in my prayers and I pray for their deliverance regularly.  The story of this man's evolution into being fully human demonstrated that the human mind is not able to heal by the paths or plans  of others but must take its own path, as Shin did in his search for true emotion and what his role in life should be for him.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is awesome! I cannot wait till next season starts. It's about time they come out with a good zombie series!

B005ETA5K2|2.0|I will voluntarily increase this rating once Alfa assures me that it will not (in the future) 'forget' to point out that as the SUCCESSOR to the AWUS036NH (without the R) it has the one MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR inability to work in PROMISCUOUS MODE.  If the 'previous version...ie AWUS036NH', (the one that AWUS036NHR was intended to replace) was used AT LEAST PRIMARILY as a pen-testing USB dongle WITH BACKTRACK and the primary reason to BUY A DONGLE IN A PEN TESTING ENVIRONMENT is to MONITOR, then it would be reasonable to make ABSOLUTELY certain that the most prominent selling point for PEN testing is non-existent in this new USB dongle.<br /><br />In that way, Alfa could have instilled trust in poor schmucks like me, who have never had any dealings with them before this.  As it is, I bought a two NHRs thinking that I should be able to get it to work with a little work on the drivers, but found that ...at least too my naive and ignorant knowledge it is NOT POSSIBLE TO RUN IT IN PROMISCUOUS MODE (ALSO KNOWN AS MONITOR MODE).<br /><br />Please give me a reason to increase your rating and I gladly will, (even if you point out something that I missed, ie...perhaps you did mention unequivocally and in a transparent manner that the Alfa AWUS036NHR unlike it's predecessor CANNNNNOT work in PROMISCUOUS MODE (ALSO known as MONITOR MODE).  Did I beat the dead horse enough?
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Worth 99 cents.  Fun puzzle game, fast paced and better than other games of this sort (can I say bejeweled?)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVE this game hopefully it has more levels after 10 ASAP!!!!!!! I love games like this they are very challenging!!!
B00062PN6I|3.0|Overall it sounds pretty good. But very murky on uncompressed lows.<br />It is what it is. Low cost. Decent quality.

B00AW8VUDG|5.0|I love Krokus, have since 1982.  I'm a huge fan, hoping for a 2013 US Tour.  Their last two albums have been the best they've done since the 80's.  Good ol' sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll, the way that nature intended.  These things don't come along every day.  I intend to save, and savor.  Rock on, my friends.

Palms sweaty, mouth dry, big lump in my throat, two big lumps in my pants-one in the front, one in the back, because I'd never been so excited or scared in my life.  This music flowing through my ears.  Need I say more?  Glad to have it back!
B00C7BZYF6|4.0|\\"The Bling Ring\\" (2013 release; 90 min.) brings the now-familiar story of how a group of teenagers living in suburban Los Angeles, with too much time on their hands and an insatiable appetite for \\"bling\\", decide to start robbing houses of celebrities while they are out of town. I am not spoiling the plot when I tell you that the \\"group of five\\" (4 girls and 1 guy), along with a couple of others, eventually get found out and caught. The first 50-55 min. of the movie deal with the break-ins and the remainder of the movie looks at what happens after their arrests.<br /><br />Several comments: this is the 5th feature movie directed by Sofia Coppola, and as has been the case with her previous films, this movie is highly stylish in the way it looks at and brings the lives of these teenagers. In fact, the movie is eye-candy pretty much from start to finish. Coppola wrote the script based on the 2010 Vanity Fair article that exposed it all in details not seen before. As to the Bling Ring members themselves: it is perhaps somewhat understandable as to why Marc would get involved with this, as he is new to the school and desparately trying to fit in and make friends. But what about the four girls? There seems no rhyme or reason, other than the \\"need for greed\\", while apparently lacking any and all moral compass. Equally telling is the almost entire absence of parenting. Yes, there are parents, but they are too busy or too clueless. At some point we see Marc's dad asking Marc and Nicki what they are doing (while they are smoking weed in Marc's bedroom), and when Nicki simply says \\"sorry we made too much noise\\", Marc's dad simply walks away. An equally telling moment is when Nicki gets interviewed by a reporter towards the end, and she gets visibily irritated when her mom (played beautiflully in a small role by Leslie Mann) says a few words (interjects herself, in Nicki's mind), and she hisses \\"mom, this interview is about ME!\\" Yes indeed, the \\"me! me! me! culture is everywhere. The role of Nicki is played by Emma Watson, and she seems only to get better and better in her post-Harry Potter days (last year in the excellent \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" and recently also in a minor role in \\"This Is the End\\"). Can't wait to see what she'll do next.<br /><br />Coppola doesn't take a strong \\"social stand\\" as such in the movie. Instead, she lets the camera do all the talking, easily exposing the hollowness of the bling culture. \\"The Bling Ring\\" opened with a lot of positive vibes at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and the screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati this afternoon was reasonably well attended for a matinee. It might be the case of clever counter-programming, as it appears every week there is another superhero movie or some other mega-production movie opens (how many Iron Man 3, Man of Steel, After Earth, World War Z and other such movies can a person see in one summer?). If you are in the mood for something else, \\"The Bling Ring\\" may be just the thing for you. Slick and entertaining, yet exposing the moral vacuum that exists in certain environments, this movie flew by in no time. \\"The Bling Ring\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. The role of Nicki is played by Emma Watson, and she seems only to get better and better in her post-Harry Potter days (last year in the excellent \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" and recently also in a minor role in \\"This Is the End\\").

B000W9399S|2.0|I generally like fantasy series - Chalker's Wellworld and Anthony's Xanth in particular, but found this boring. I know lots of people love it, but it took me three tries to even get through it. I just don't care what happens to Twoflowers or Rincewind.
B000FC11A6|5.0|The first edition was published in 1999. As I read it on my iPad I wondered how I missed it back then. For me it was the one of the best reads since I read Joseph Heller's Catch-22 in the early 1960's.<br /><br />At 918 pages, Cryptonomicon is not for everyone. It really is two stories - one set in WWII focused on code-breaking and the other is about the evolving internet in the late 1990's - that come together at the end involving the grandchildren of some of the key WWII characters. It has it's own Wikipedia site.<br /><br />Both periods are now history which makes it a fascinating read being a member of the generation between - a child of a WWII vet and a parent with kids in the generation of characters in the 1990's.<br /><br />It has a subtext and major story arc related to computing, but the WWII generation is depicted expressing the same kind of humor and sarcasm found in Catch-22.<br /><br />It is a long book and you have to be a patient reader. But it is very well written and rewarding. I don't usually write reviews, but I have a hunch many in my generation who would enjoy it would not be attracted this book.<br /><br />Yes, I was working with computers in the 1970's and with microcomputers beginning in 1980 a part of my work. So I lived the computing context of the story.<br /><br />And yet, it isn't a book just for computer nerds. It even has \\"action\\" and some significant character development.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love that Amazon Prime has Downtown Abbey Season 3 so I can watch it at my leisure! I was on a very long list at the local library and now I don't have to wait!
B000SGRONM|5.0|I received this as a gift and now I give it as one to those I think might appreciate Sedaris' humor and wit.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There was a time when all I read was science fiction.  But science fiction changed and became mostly fantasy or supernatural.  This story has brought me back to the genre.  Reminiscent of authors like Heinlein, Asimov, and Clarke it's a good old fashioned science fiction mystery.  Yes, set in a post-apocalyptic society as seems to be the trend, but in a society well crafted and believable.  The story relies less on the fantastic than it does on character development and intrigue.  A must read for anyone who misses the \\"Golden Age\\" of Sci-Fi.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|...they might be ready for their next Sedaris' installment. All his work is wonderful, but this is my personal favorite.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game kept me on my toes. Although I wish they had a few clues that clued into other clues.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was always a fan of the Myst games and this has the same feel, just on a smaller scale. The music is inviting and the puzzle aspect is great. A very intriguing game to say the least. After working through the first few puzzles I was thinking that the idea must continue. I will be finished with this and wanting for more shortly. Great execution, production, and delivery. Exquisite!!!.
0452298482|5.0|As an elder myself it could agreed quite often with the experts quoted in this book.  I have given a copy to a grandson who recently graduated from high school.  Advice from someone with life experience (other than his relatives) may be more appreciated.
B002KKCVVO|5.0|My husband has been wearing Tevas for over 20 years. He has finally graduated from the budget styles to these mid-level sandals... and he was very impressed with the difference an extra $**.** will buy: nice, thick soles with good arches, better strap support around the ankle, and the quality Velcro he's come to expect from this brand. He normally wears a 10.5 dress shoe, but the size 11 Tevas seem to fit him a little better than the half size down. I have the feeling that we won't be going back to the Hurricanes.  :)
B00C2VIA52|5.0|wish gameloft would come out with a similar game that has a scifi them to it. but this game is still awesome as well even when I get frustraghted with try to be some of the characters its still a fun.game to lose time in

B009XIXVU6|3.0|Since I read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, I was really looking forward to this latest one. However, I was sadly dissappointed. It came nowhere near the first two. The story jumped from characters to characters, country to country, events to<br />events. I found I was forcing myself to finish it or hoping it would get better. It never did.
1582701709|5.0|this book is very uplifting.  Even if you don't get the desired results, it teaches  you to think positively - which is great for<br />your mental outlook on everything.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Intelligent, interesting story.  Great music.  It is wonderful to see a movie that is about relationships, not violence.  And of course, great group of actors. Dustin Hoffmann did very well as director.
B00000JZI9|5.0|This movie has a great cast. There is humor and action. Kevin Costner is a little over the top in his portrayal but overall I really think this is a good movie.
0307352153|5.0|I personally found this book to be very useful.  I spent years thinking there was something wrong with me because I've always been on the reserved side and not interested in things everyone else seems to enjoy.  Of course, I  was long ago able to go beyond that and have even learned to be very extrovert in certain situations.  Still the book was eye-opening and a confirmation of many things I had learned.  I especially recommend it for families with introverted children.so they can build on their strengths and avoid the many pitfalls.
B001ER4CSO|5.0|Love the movies and Selma Blair. The whole premise is about a who knows what little alien who grows up to be this Hellboy. Ron Pearlman is excellent.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This isn't my normal type of reading material.  But I ENJOYED THIS BOOK SO MUCH!  It is an easy, entertaining read.  If you are looking for some light, entertaining reading, do yourself a favor, and READ THESE BOOKS!
B00004D0EP|1.0|I guess I shouldn't rate it so low but I couldn't play it since it was region 2 and not one. I tossed it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett effortlessly brings history forth with a gentle but realistic human touch. I cannot wait until I finish the trilogy!
B0002V7ODI|5.0|Ron Pearlman and Selma Blair, good stuff. The premise is not bad at all and the supporting cast is excellent. I find it pretty funny as well as a good action movie.
B005LAIIMG|2.0|Big dissapointment for a summer \\"blockbuster\\". The film starts off smartly and keeps you at the edge of your seat in the beginning when the plague first hits philly and Pitt and family get their first encounter with the zombies. Once on the run they get lucky until Pitts old boss sends a helicopter to pick them up and deliver them to an aircraft carrier on the eastern coast. From there the story gets more and more unbelievable as our hero jaunts across the world trying to find the origin of the disease and survives everything from multiple attacks to a plane crash. South Korea, Jerusalem, Wales. Our UN inspector is made of steel and figures out how to defeat the zombies. By infecting humanity with H1N1 meningitis!! Because the zombies wont eat an icky diseased person. Really?? Have not read the book, was hoping for a good zombie film and recieved instead a huge dissapointment. Wait until the rental and you will be thankful not wasting your money for this at the cinema.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good, challenging fun. Great app. Kid love to play. Well done. Nice graphics. Music is not annoying. Waiting for updates to play some more.
1484156005|4.0|Set during the Great War and the dying embers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Sebastien is the tale of an eminently unlucky man. Fischer paints the picture of a lapsed Jewish family in Vienna who seem rather distant from the struggling Jewish clans of outlying districts of the Empire.<br /><br />The father and grandfather are mildly successful businessmen and despite having to work hard to maintain a vibrant shop in the competing tapestry of Vienna, do not appear to want for much. Until that is. Sebastien has the misfortune to lose a leg. Then misfortune follows the family like an unwanted friend.<br /><br />Sebastien is more concerned about how others perceive him than how he is actually perceived and his lack of confidence and self belief leads him into a sea of self-loathing and pity. But throughout this tale, he is sought out by people who love and support him. Despite some massive set-backs and emotionally crushing experiences, he moves on.<br /><br />Fischer has painted an in-depth picture of the Empire, the insecurities of its subjects and the rivalries and suspicions of competing ethnic and religious groups. Whilst in some places it makes you despair at the stupidity and naevity of the uneducated, it also bolsters your belief in the ability for people to survive.<br /><br />I took the time to read this book because the characters are so emotionally invested in one another. It is the beginning of a saga and forms a great foundation stone for the rest of the series. I recommend for people who enjoy these epic familial tales!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I love time management. Games and this one is the best. It is very addictive and some strategy required. A must have game.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Please never stop making this show. It’s so funny, & I have actually learned a lot from the show. P.S. Sheldon is my favorite.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best the the others because it has more games inside and it has a little challenge to it.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|It’s filled with Great characters. Towards the very end of the whole show we were a little afraid the writers weren’t going to end the show well, but they nailed it. It couldn’t have been more perfect.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|The free paid app of the day from the Amazon App Store for June 21, 2013 is Rescue Roby from Runaway Studios.<br /><br />This is a game which is rather similar to Red Remover and Red Wrecker where you have to remove platforms in a certain order and at the right time in order to get what appears to be a robot's head into a crate box that has the title character's head on the side of it.<br /><br />It seems like a fun game that is close to 5 star quality, but I am deducting a star for several minor reasons.  Every time you accomplish something in the Amazon GameCircle list, the game abruptly stops to show you your accomplishment right in the middle of a game.  That is also the only time you can see what the list of accomplishments are unless you press on the Amazon GameCircle button when you first open the app.  The app maker did not provide a link to the Amazon GameCircle accomplishment page on the main menu page of the app.<br /><br />Also I feel that many of the early levels I have played so far seem a little obvious as to how to complete them.  An example of this is when you have just one bomb in the level instead of 3 or 4 placed on the screen to confuse you as to whether you are supposed to use all of them or only some.<br /><br />For those minor reasons above, I am giving this game a 4 out of 5 star rating.  This would have made a much better free app choice than the Father's Day choice last Sunday, and it is really too bad Amazon didn't use this game instead of the hidden object game last Sunday.

B00C0UHGLO|2.0|The free app of the day selection for June 22, 2013 is Abalone from Advanced Mobile Applications.<br /><br />This appears to be a board game that is popular in foreign countries such as Mancala and Mahjong.  The rules of this game were very difficult for me to figure out at first because I had chosen the Free Play option.  If you haven't played this game before, you should select the Level option on the main menu which does go through the rules with you as you play the first levels.<br /><br />The objective of the game is to isolate your opponent's marbles on the edges of the board and to create a row long enough to push your opponent's isolated marbles off the board.<br /><br />The game board looks nice and you can watch the game be replayed in a fast forward fashion as well as restart the game from a certain point in the game after the game is won by you or your opponent.<br /><br />Now I am going to explain why I am giving this only 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />I felt that parts of the game's interfaces were confusing and poorly designed.  For example there are sliders on the Free Play menu page which you slide left and right to select the time, number of pieces, difficulty level, and the starting layout of the marbles on the board.  Since there were so many different starting marble layouts, it was very difficult to see all of the different layouts since it moves rather fast when moving your finger sideways on the slider.  It also made it hard to see the options since they usually appeared on the slider part where your finger is.<br /><br />In the game when selecting marbles, I found it somewhat difficult to move my marbles at times.  Sometimes I was sliding the pieces by just touching them and then sliding them where I wanted them to go.  Other times it was like I had to push the arrows to move the pieces back and forth.  It might have been better if they would have highlighted the marbles you select a different color temporarily and then you could move the marbles to another spot after you have a better idea which ones are selected.<br /><br />The game would probably be better played against a real person rather than the AI built into the game since the AI seems somewhat smart.<br /><br />I found the option to tilt the board angle view using the slider thing on the left hand side of the screen and the zoom in feature to be not very useful in this game.  It was probably included for those who like to look at the board in different ways, but it is not necessary to play the game.<br /><br />So that is why I am giving this game only 2 stars out of 5.  The menu and marble selection interfaces needs some work and the AI could be \\"dumbed\\" down a little bit on the easy settings to give you a better chance of enjoying the game if you have no human opponents to play against and you are just starting to learn the game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is very well written and acted. It draws you into the story line and isn't overly predictable. I can't wait for the next season.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the most fantastic novels I've ever read. Emma has many of the same great characteristics, including insightful character study, very witty dialog, excellent plot and plenty of period atmosphere. I do not like it as much as Pride and Prejudice, but if I weren't comparing it with something else, I would probably be raving more than I am.
0446572993|5.0|This was one of David Baldacci's best novels.  It had a great plot and character development was superb.  I have read most of his books, and this rates up there as one of the best.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|A fun little game, similar to wake the box and a few others.  Actually gets five stars because the loading screen was silent and the next let me mute in under a second.
B004EIZCPM|3.0|The movie is adorable and I love it. But Amazon streaming often leaves me buffering for 5 minutes or more at a time. I will no longer purchase the movies for streaming. I'm sticking with Blu-ray discs!
B0091REZMW|5.0|The game really is free if you take your time. You only have to pay if your impatient. I play until my energy is low and then I move on and read or play another game, you get enough energy to play more then enough rounds.
0425252868|5.0|Great book. If you are looking for a new take on World War II this book will definitely give you a fresh perspective.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is really fun. I play it a lot but it needs to update more often. I am 2 or 3 updates behind the Apple app store and the Google Play app store. Other than that, great game.
B007KGXY0K|1.0|I bought this motherboard with an Intel 2687w in hopes of having a powerful machine to work on.  Unfortunately, after 1 week, the board never powers on anymore.  I will say during that first week, it was an okay experience (I have an nVidia GPU, so had to jump through hoops to get the BIOS flashed, first).  However, now I have a bunch of equipment that's useless, as the board won't even power up anymore.
B003L77FYS|5.0|One of my favorite shows, will buy more seasons as they come out.  This series is definitely a great show.
B00BC24NT4|2.0|Le Carre has become more and more politicized with a definite agenda in his later novels.  It detracts from the story.<br />Charles McCarry is a far superior writer than Le Carre and I would suggest that the readers of that genre read those.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|One of my favorite shows, will buy more seasons as they come out.  This series is definitely a great show.
B005OUHOLY|5.0|Music pedagogy has been long overdue for a review and rewrite. Werner offers a stupendous model here for a replacement. This is priceless stuff and just what I was looking for as a way of answering my many frustrations with and distrust of the old constructs. I'm fortunate in that I'm largely self taught apart from a stint at university. My guitar teacher there was enlightened in that he realised he could only guide me in how to make music out of the dots, and I'm eternally grateful for the omission from the typical way music is taught. I would not have persisted otherwise.<br /><br />'Effortless Mastery' is as much a spiritual guide as anything. It's principles apply to all human activity and endeavour. Its tacit message is, get your head out of the way and let your mind/body/spirit/training accomplish the task.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was an amazing book. Sanderson completed the story nicely. It wasn't an ideal ending to the story, but a very satisfying one. The book was mainly action too.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|In the main I appreciated this book but found the author's chapters of &#34;the other side&#34; too brief even though his experience was vivid and unforgettable with the receipt of a lot of information. This was a let down. Perhaps this still needs to percolate and we can look forward to another book. Beware, the book deals in the main with the author's quest to explain how his adoption moulded him and the reason why he contracted the disease (essentially to experience the afterlife).
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|27 year old male, no children and just watched it for the first time.  It is really disturbing to know that people watch a movie about kids butchering each other for entertainment and worse yet allow there young impressionable children to watch it. It was very hard to finish this movie, the only thing that kept me going were the little moments when the characters in the movie showed love and compassion for each other, but it was all overshadowed by a theme which I think highlights what is so very wicked about our entertainment industry, including the people that enjoy these films. Maybe in the sequel they will include some scenes were underage children are having sex, why not it's all in good and fun right? After all it's just a movie. Here's some entertainment I'd like to share, \\"Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy
B00007J5VN|3.0|What should have been a fireworks display of energy, music, comedy and dancing simply comes sleepily to life only occasionally. Bob Fosse's imaginative choreography transfers from stage to screen wonderfully in a couple sequences, notably Big Spender and the dynamic There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This dance number for leading lady MacLaine, and Chita Rivera and Paula Kelly, but his direction through much of the rest is often  slow and listless. The film tries to be hip and trendy in it's effort of capturing 60's hippies and styles, but only comes across as corny and silly ( Sammy Davis Jr over the top in Ryhtmn of Life).<br /><br />Shirley MacLaine is dynamic and if the whole package were better she might have been Oscar material. Charity Hope Valentine was a perfect role for her brand of vulnerable ditziness at that time, and she manages to propel the film along as much as she can. John McMartin does his servicable best re-creating his role of Oscar from the stage. With more energetic pacing and a little less corn it could have been a terrific film musical, what it lacks is an edge and zest that would have made it fantastic.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Hardly any commercial breaks, just amazing music! Great selections, no skipping, pausing. Don't hesitate to purchase. It's the best I've tried.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It might seem fun at first but,after awhile it gets totally boring.I got ,my kindle for X-mas,and this was my first app.but,as I said.....it might seem fun at first.worst app ever.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is one of the better mobile games I have played and is very fun and I highly recommend you try it
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Finally got to see Snow White in a long time. Brings up my childhood. I would recommend it to anyone who loves the disney classic
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|While time travel, people with powers and fighting against evil are not new in fiction, the way Riggs uses and frames these themes are unique and interesting.  just like his 'peculiar' children.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I've read all the Reacher books (I think) and have no great objection to someone of Tom Cruise's size being cast as JR. As far as I am concerned, however, the film didn't do enough to differentiate itself from the many other 'Action movies' already made.<br /><br />Not enough was made of the calm and brooding menace, and the great powers of deduction. I think that's a combination of the screenplay and direction, as well as the acting. TC can do many things but he certainly couldn't stride manfully about the police station in the early scenes and he couldn't scowl or stare down anyone, as in the scene in the bus depot. The attempt at a 'seven samurai' moment immediately before the car chase was quite poor.<br /><br />And why have a car chase? That just put the film into similar territory as the Bournes, Bruce Willis and others. I think the time should have been spent developing and illustrating the character, to create something different and play to its strengths. Talking of acting; I thought TC looked quite anxious whilst driving the car - I imagine JR isn't anxious about anything.<br /><br />I enjoyed the opening scenes, the telling of a story without dialogue. We saw something of the analysis and sleuthing but not really enough. I just think that in the end we had a passable but identikit action movie when there had been a good opportunity to create something better.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|Seriously,  how did it get this many stars? I have played  many dark hidden object games and this one was horrible. There was no map at all in this game, that I could find. I hate games without maps and refuse to play them. I don't care about hint and skip buttons but I need a map!
B007SO31BQ|5.0|I've been a TV follower of F1 for many years, ever since I went to Brands Hatch to see Senna drive for Lotus in the 80s in the British Grand Prix; hence my initial interest in this film.<br /><br />This is a gripping film, wonderful in concept since it uses only contemporary footage and commnentary. No doubt there could have been scores of interviews analysing Senna's talents and being lavish (justifiably) in their praise but that would have spoiled the concept and the flow. Naturally there would be many F1 geeks who would have liked to have seen in depth analysis of engineering, driving style, tactics, preparation of the various cars but in my view they are missing the point of this film. This is not a film about motor racing, it is to do with sporting talent, determination and personal values.<br /><br />I would have liked to have heard more commentary from Murray Walker (who incidentally is the joint best sports commentator of all time, along with Bill McLaren) but I would have thought that Murray's sheer enthusiasm for all that he saw would have changed the calm and atmospheric tone of the film. It was good to hear James Hunt's praise for Senna. Sure, it would have been good to see additional scenes - the race at Donnington being near the top of the list. Perhaps there was not sufficient contemporary material available; that goes for the other scenes that other reviewers have listed. It would have been detrimental to add interviews and talking head pieces to camera to cover the gaps, since that would also have changed the feel of the film. As I said, this is not about F1, so did not need to include absolutely everything.<br /><br />Highlights for me included the scenes from the drivers' briefings and the immediate aftermath of the 1991 Brazil GP. If you're not affected by those post-race scenes then you might as well stop watching the rest of the film. The geeks will have noticed that although the car was stuck in 6th gear, the soundtrack included a gear-change;this film is a work of art so I don't care.<br /><br />It was touching to hear Senna speak of the purity of racing juxtaposed with most of F1 life - but then that's true of life generally probably. As to the build up during the Imola weekend; the selection of the scenes was phenominal. I agree as to the level of detail, it must have been tempting to go on at length as to why Senna was gesticulating at the safety car, the effects of cold tyres and ride-height, and so on.<br /><br />A tremendous film, could only have been improved by at bit less ESPN and a bit more Murray Walker and James Hunt - and a couple of additional races if the footage had been available.
B005COO1X6|5.0|This was classic Stephen King. The threat being believeable, yet not and the kids getting a terrible life lesson. I loved it.
B0058O84G0|1.0|Too long, too many characters and too woolly; thankfully, I bought the Kindle version so I didn't have to lug the tome around. Somewhere in here there just may be a good book (or two, or three) but somehow I doubt it.<br /><br />The first scenes, set in and around the mine, were quite interesting but it was all downhill from there. Most of the characters were just cardboard cut-outs and when I arrived at the `aristocrat and maid' storyline I couldn't believe what I was reading - surely a professional story-teller could do better than that? From some reason I continually had a vision of a Terry-Thomas comedy film, so stereotypical was that plot.<br /><br />Just about the only character for whom I had any sympathy was Maud, yet the description of her life after the war was over in a flash whereas we were asked to endure page after page of `working class hero(es) dragging themselves up by his/her/their bootlaces' - not original and not clever. Why didn't the author have the imagination to chart Maud's change of lifestyle at the end of the book in more than a couple of paragraphs?<br /><br />What was the point of the Russia and USA storylines? Why not throw in a couple of characters from the Far East and South America for good measure? That would have eaten up a few hundred extra pages, since size seemed to be the main concern.<br /><br />Clearly I have not understood the point of this book. Why, for example, in the midst of dialogue, descriptions of emotions, gratuitous sex and so on did we suddenly have an essay on the formation of Russian committees, pages of prose with no characterisation that could have been lifted from a school textbook and was even less entertaining?<br /><br />I've enjoyed some of Mr Follett's previous books but this was a complete waste of my time; thank goodness I was sitting on a beach at the time so I can brand it accordingly.
0385535147|3.0|I read this for book club. I doubt I would have finished it otherwise. It was just okay, not one of his best.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|The story is somewhat predictable, with stereotypical characters but the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts. A delightful, whimsical, film that manages to balance humour with pathos and has a serious side too. There are some great one-liners that are both clever and funny.<br /><br />As mentioned elsewhere, the collection of on-screen talent is impressive. It is good to see quality actors engaged in quality acting. Penelope Wilton succeeded in making me dislike and sympathise with her character; Bill Nighy played Bill Nighy yet again but rather well in my opinion; Maggie Smith had turned everything up to 11; Tom Wilkinson was great - especially during the cricket lesson and game in which there was a moment of great emotion where if you had blinked you missed it; and so on through the cast list.<br /><br />One could get picky and criticise some parts of the characters and plot but overall it is a nice, quaint, comfortable film that entertains without being demanding whether by complicated story or unnecessary `realism'; well made and well acted.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was the most challenging game ive ever played, it was fun and i recommend it for all ages. The best game ever
B0059XTUVI|2.0|This is a sub-standard film about a lady who appeared to have dementia and who loved/loves her late husband. Along the way it was interrupted by news archives of some of the most important events in the UK in the second half of the 20th century as the country's economic and social situation was changed almost beyond recognition. Perhaps the film-makers had a little too much funding because in some places reconstructions replaced the archive footage.<br /><br />I finished watching this with mild feelings of anger towards those who made this film. Like her or loath her, Margaret Thatcher was one of the major forces in not only UK politics but the world scene as well. This was an attempt to portray `the woman' so it was long on pathos and the love story between her and Dennis yet almost completely lacking in analysis and chronicling of her achievements. The final scene where she washed up a teacup was particularly unnecessary.<br /><br />Jim Broadbent was excellent, as he often is; Meryl Streep did a fine job; Olivia Colman did well as Carole Thatcher and Anthony Head was good as Geoffrey Howe.<br /><br />I wasn't looking for a documentary but I did hope for some dramatisation and explanation of some of the seminal moments of the late 20th century. Where, for example, were any of the following, or perhaps I blinked and missed them:<br /><br />* Standing up to the naysayers (even in her own party) as the economy worsened before it got better following her formulation then implementation of a monetarist economic policy.<br /><br />* Any sort of scene with Ronald Reagan apart from a few seconds of dance.<br /><br />* Any coverage of her dealings with Gorbachev - whom she had described as `a man we can do business with' whilst disagreeing fundamentally with his politics.<br /><br />* Anything to do with her arguments with the European Union.<br /><br />* The miners' strike - pretty much a civil war. What about the preparations made by the Government, the tactics, her feelings regarding the destruction of several communities.<br /><br />* Northern Ireland and terrorism in general.<br /><br />* The Falklands War got more than a few seconds of screen time but the scenes were so disjointed as to be barely worthwhile.<br /><br />By simply showing clips of what had happened the film implies that she merely dealt well with events as they unfolded. Margaret Thatcher had strategies and principals and we should have seen more about how she made plans and put them into effect. I got no impression of her analysis of the country she started with nor her strategy to change it for the better (by her definition).<br /><br />The opening scenes may have been fine to set the tone and use of flashbacks was perhaps a useful idea. However, the dementia scenes went on far too much and all we got in the end was some form of luvvie/arty self indulgence rather than a serious film charting her personality and life of achievement.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book is one of the best books I've ever read.  The emotions felt so real, and I fell in love with every one of the characters!!!
B0059XTTW8|4.0|Why compare this 2 hour film with the 6 hour serial, or require it to be a precise rendition of a book of more than 400 pages? I thought it a fine attempt to take many plot threads and make two hours of entertainment from them, I enjoyed items that were not present in the book. I do wonder though how the following books will be filmed now that Guillam's character has been changed.<br /><br />Firstly, there are no explosions, chases, babes or helicopters so be prepared to sit, watch and think rather than expect action and glitz to flow over you. Sure, there are some holes and inconsistencies; I suppose that I take a less forensic view to viewing films than do many of the reviewers here.<br /><br />I don't care that we don't see the characters build to point the way to the identity of the mole because for me the identity of the mole is immaterial. This is about loyalty, betrayal and sacrifice. A few examples:<br />* Guillam ends his relationship immediately on considering that it might be used against him, quite a sacrifice in my opinion.<br />* A terrific moment of acting as Smiley makes a deal with Tarr that he knows will violate Tarr's trust because he can't fulfil the spirit of the deal.<br />* What a strange world where someone who makes such a sacrifice for their country ends up living in a caravan and teaching at a boarding school after being bunged only a few quid and a car.<br /><br />There were some nice juxtapositions that made me think of how fragile lives might be and the fine line between normality and hardship. During a most stressful task undertaken by Guillam we see many characters singing along and playing along to George Formby singing Mr Woo; presumably chosen in the script as being light and frivolous and something that Roy Bland would be likely to sing afterwards to show Guillam how closely he was being observed. Whilst Prideau was being tortured his `minder' was just sitting by reading a newspaper to while away the time.<br /><br />The atmosphere was wonderfully dusty, smoky and brown so conveying the impression that these are strange, quiet people in a strange world. Oldman's acting was great but then I almost always agree that `less is more'.<br /><br />Lastly, there was the great irony of the Soviet national anthem at the Christmas party; tremendous, made me laugh.<br /><br />If you judge it on its own merits and treat it as entertainment then I think it is good value. It's not as good as the TV serial but why shouldn't it be different?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love it can't wait for the new boards!!!!! Great game to keep your brain stimulated...... please release the new boards
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|This did hold my attention (just) and maybe this book is worth the price, but not more than that. I am by no means a literary connoisseur but even I could see that the writing and the story lacks depth. It seems that Lee Child has relaxed quite a bit, letting his standards slip and allowing too many colloquialisms - but then I am rather tired of \\"....in terms of....\\" just to quote one example.<br /><br />There were too many \\"startling\\" revelations for me, I don't recall so many in previous books. I was also disappointed that there was no description from anyone else's perspective, just a simple recounting of events that might as well have been written in the first person. In previous books time was taken to make the 'baddies' something more than two-dimensional. There was too much trundling around and racing around in wide open spaces - that's been covered in previous books - and no significant suspense in the final scenes that might as well have taken place with cardboard targets on a firing range.<br /><br />I kept reading, hoping that it would improve but alas it did not. I won't be buying the next one unless there's been an avalanche of good reviews of it.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This was a gift for mmy grandmother. It arrived on time, and she was pleased and surprised when she recieved it. She can't wait to watch sesons 1 and 2 again, since she hasn't watched those in a long time!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Fantastic perspective, witty and fresh. Laughed out lound many, many times. Great romantic story from the male PoV. Very talented new writer--keeping her on my watch list. And thank you, Ms. Chase, for actually ending the book without a \\"to be continued\\" at the end! You just get it.

B0055EDCGU|5.0|Heavy riffs, fast guitar solos, blasting drumbeats, along with my favorite style of vocals for a metal band (the equal and complementary blend of the screamed and clean) ... I've listened to this album repeatedly and it just gets better every time!
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Pretty damn hard I guess. As my foggy memory recalls, they had tried it twice before with less than satisfactory results, and they did that to my favorite Marvel character?? So when I heard another Captain America movie was in the works I was a little dubious, not as much as I would have been 14 years ago though. Since then Marvel has upped their game and really put out well done movie versions of their super hero's. When I heard who they picked to play Cap, I wasn't exactly thrilled because I connected him with his previous Marvel character - the &#34;Human Torch&#34;.<br /><br />Nonetheless my wife I and I went to see it at the theatre and it was great, finally Captain America had been done right by the movies, and he was even better in the Avengers movie. Hopefully they won't change actors in upcoming movies (a.k.a. - the hulk movies, which btw, the last hulk in the Avenger movie was probably the best - don't change the actor).
B002436WFI|3.0|It was well done. I am only a fan of Sam Vimes. The wizard books aren't that funny to me. It was a present for my nephew who always LOL when he sees them
B001AR0D4A|3.0|We saw this at the theatre, and later bought the DVD. When I saw this 2-disc Blu-ray set at a very good price (about $8) I bought it. Not because I thought blu-ray would make it a better movie, but one disc had the movie in color and the other in black and white, which we thought would be cool to see. It really wasn't that cool. It looked like a picture you pull into photoshop and click &#34;Turn to black and white&#34; and end up with a black and white picture that doesn't really look like it was taken in black'n white. I've done better with a video camera, premiere, and after effects to give something a more realistic looking &#34;filmed in black and white&#34; look. However, if you liked the movie, never bought it, have a blu-ray player and $8, it's not too bad.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|It is a useful app. Helping me to syn all what I want to share on different devices, iPhone, laptop, desktop, Kindle.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|I've watched him bumble, stumble, and rumble his way since I was a teen. It's a credit to the writing, the guest stars and Mr. Falk to pull off so many of these TV Movies (Mystery-Movie-of-the-Week Series, etc.) when you saw who killed the person in the beginning. You'd think it would get tiring, and I believe no one but Peter Falk could pull it off so successfully. The way the DVD's were dished out in small numbers at a high price kept me from buying all but the first one set. We had a local channel that showed an episode every week and that was fine. The price of this bundle sometimes remains high, then drops for awhile. I think I got it for about $55 and if you're a fan, and haven't bought almost every release of those small expensive packs, you should buy it.
1451648537|3.0|I read this book because I wanted to learn what made Steve Jobs so special - how it is that so many things he was involved with seems to have ended up becoming \\"insanely great\\".<br /><br />At 627 pages this book is quite a volume to read through.<br /><br />It seems evident that the goal of this volume is the attempt of a complete documentation of the events that connect to the life of Jobs.<br />Like a historic scribe, the author takes a strictly sequential approach, and as such it can probably serve as a resource for \\"what really happened\\".<br /><br />However, what the book does not do is interpret Jobs life, connect the dots and come up with enlightening commentary on the man, his life and his efforts and successes.<br />The way the protagonists in this account are quoted is also somewhat flat - I was sometimes wondering if people around jobs really all had such simple things on their mind, or if this sometimes simple interpersonal drama is something inherent in the authors perspective.<br /><br />What I got form the book is a detailed overview over events and simple portraits of his interactions with colleagues, family and business partners - but I'm still not really closer to understanding what really made him such an extraordinary figure...<br /><br />This book definitely leaves space for someone to contribute a more overtly analytical approach to the Steve Jobs story.
B00871C09S|5.0|There are a number of qualities that make Rear Window one of the best films of all time. Set entirely in a single room facing out onto a courtyard, a photographer recuperating from injury and confined to a wheel chair spends his days observing his neighbors through their windows. His natural voyeurism becomes obsessive as he begins to draw conclusions about each of these people and give them nicknames ( Miss Lonely Heart...etc) based on what he sees through the window. Jimmy Stewart is fantastic in this role. His fashionable socialite girlfriend is played by the incredibly beautiful Grace Kelly , who is slowly drawn into his obsession that one of his neighbors is acting suspiciously and his wife is uncharacteristically missing. Suspicion and Suspense builds from there.<br />Hitchcock had tried something similar in his earlier film Rope, also set in a single setting and involving suspense around a murder. Here he succeeds in taking that concept and directing two incredible actors to create a film that deserves it's reputation and longevity. Rear Window doesn't feel dated and still has the quality to grip the viewer and maintain it's suspenseful quality even 60 years on.

B000023X9W|2.0|A huge sleeper!<br /><br />The last two tracks saved this from earning a one star rating. Mr. Young has delievred far better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Update 0.8.0 is the best update that the Pocket Edition has had in a while. My favorite part about the update is that you can now mine redstone and get redstone dust. Plus you can make clocks, compasses, and power rails out of redstone now. My other part i like about this update is the rails, power rails, and mine carts. Right when i got the update i make rails all the way down to my mine at the tenth layer above bedrock. This has been the best update in a while and it is a really awesome update so i would recommend this app to you.
B00BB67UNW|2.0|I was excited to see this film due mainly to the cast.<br /><br />The storyline is ok, but the film drags in several parts. I kept waiting for it to shift into high gear, but was left wanting far more.<br /><br />Thankfully it cost me only a buck twenty to rent from Redbox.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Easy to watch on our iPod. First time using this feature.  Really easy and reasonable prices. I would do this again.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've debated Altucher on TV... He's wicked smart, a truly gifted story teller, and the zen master of business and life in this era of omnipresent connectivity. I wish I had written this book. I've never read anything better about the business of life. - Porter Stansberry
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|There are a lot of 1 stars, and honesty it should be. The controls suck for God sake. If you want a game that has limated amo and shoots when you don't want it to then this game is for you and you were born with problems.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Pretty good performance by Ben Affleck. Plot somewhat thin. Acting somewhat thin. Not a movie I would recommend to anyone.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Love this app cause even on the go no matter how busy I may be to get a little stress relief all I have to do is open the app click on the sound of the ocean add the seagull and close me eyes....then after a quick 5-10 min break I'm ready to go. I also use it to calm me before bed
1616550414|5.0|Very well printed! The ink is vibrant, the paper is a nice quality and the content is a dream for every Zelda fan out there :3
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These worked perfectly in the watches that needed new batteries. I love that they came in a package of five so that I didn't have to buy individuals.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr Alexander offers an honest and thoughtful depiction of a remarkable personal experience. His observations and conclusions cannot be ignored.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|the movie itself is great,but the stream on amazon can sometimes be annoying. The picture quality isn't always the best but it might have been due the the internet i had access to that had 5 gamers using it.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Good movie. Enjoyed watching with my family. Romance. Comedy. Action. Fun. Also had a great soundtrack.  Able to watch movie again and again.  Followed the book for the most part.
B00C0UHGLO|2.0|We put locks on our doors, windows, cars, to protect us from those who want to take our stuff, that we earned. We put up curtains on windows to keep people from prying into our private lives so that we can have privacy. We have doors on the stalls in public bathrooms to have privacy. We shield our passwords from people around us when using the ATM or internet banking.<br /><br />And yet people who agree to the permissions of this app seem to think it's okay to let people [through apps] learn everything about you. Nope, it's not. And we are tired of it. To let somebody who we have never met let into [take over] all the private information stored on our devices, so that we can play a so-so game is like letting any person that you have NEVER met, wander into and stay in your house and use your computer while you are on vacation. I take advantage of 75% of Amazon's FAOTD but install only 5% because of their permissions.<br /><br />A scenario of this is that I am an app programer, living anywhere where it is difficult to prosecute someone [Russia] who makes a cute game app. You give me permission to snoop through accounts listed on your phone and your stored passwords via permissions that you have granted me. After 18 months and 20,000 downloads, I update the harmless app with one that has spyware in it, and I get enough information to \\"order\\" $1,500 of goods from 70% of the people before I am stopped. How much is that free cute app REALLY worth?<br /><br />To the Developers of Apps: Enough already.

B0020EK4QY|4.0|The movies I selected are very good and entertaining, They are very good movies. Movie Lincoln the dialogue was very very good.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Shantakumar
B00A85EMVK|2.0|While I enjoyed the movie and it's storyline, it was ruined by the very poor 3D effects.  I expected so much more, but was so disappointed.  Money wasted.
B00006GEB4|5.0|This record is red vinyl! How cool! I received this record early in great condition. It's a joy to listen to and I love the sound of the flaming lips on vinyl!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|WOW is all I can say about this touching movie.  The 3D effects made the characters come to life.  The fact that the star never acted before is unbelievable, he was absolutely fantastic.  I was so impressed with the movie, I watched it twice and bought a another for a friend.  I highly recommend this movie, and suggest seeing it with all it's wonderful 3D effects.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|brain game. I love it. its challenging and frustrating.  my daughter and I had so much fun figuring out all the puzzles.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|The first 45 minutes of the movie were very funny!  I especially loved the &#34;torture&#34; scene with its hilarious put-down of the low quality torture instruments.  After that the movie just fell apart - gross language substituted in place of the earlier humor.  I DO NOT recommend this turkey!  jamie
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the twists and turns this book takes one along, I had a hard time knowing who to root for.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Enjoyable cast and terriffic charactors showing their acting talents  Best Trenton Territino movie I have seen yet.  Really cool stuff.
B00000I07P|4.0|this is a good CD.  I got it because the price was right.  too bad that Amazon got a bit pricey on shipping CD and DVD, but if the price is right on the product, I will consider.  I do compare with other suppliers on these things.  this CD has some good songs on it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Possibly my favorite book to date. Sad and entertaining, I had to finish it in one sitting. Recommend to everyone.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Acting wasn't so good.. I wasn't even interested enough to see how it ended. Might be too scary for young children.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I'm in love with this flash, I'll be using this for everything I can think of.  A second one is on my list...
0385751532|5.0|This is from my wife's book club. They all loved the story and spent hours discussing it.  Again personal taste.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The book is good, surely a must read. Although there are too many characters to remember, they are portrayed well.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Awesome, yup, what more needs to be said...<br />They did what all the wanna be's try to do.<br />Just create great Rock that will live forever.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Awful plot, my nine year old agreed it was &#34;pretty bad&#34;. Sexist, the movie takes all the interesting magical power Glinda and the witches have in the books and reduces them to girls fighting over a guy (you wish, Hollywood script writers---actually she is not that into you).The original books are over a hundred years old and provide kids with much better female role models :) As well as an imaginative and crazy world all their own. Check em out!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Sometimes I felt as though I had entered the room in the middle of a conversation, and it took me a few minutes to get with what was going on. From chapter to chapter, it would take me a few pages to figure out who the players were. I would have liked to have seen the stories each played out a bit more, but that's not Hosseini's style; he's good at leaving parts of the story to the reader's imagination.  Hosseini never sugar-coats the situation, as sad as it may be sometimes, and I appreciate the &#34;slice of life&#34; he gives the reader, as frustrating as it may be. I enjoyed this one maybe a little better than his other two books, as I felt the characters were a little more believable and likable.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game every night. Only thing I don't. Like is having to wait for more chips. I would play more often but have to wait to build up chips. Otherwise I enjoy playing..
B001223BLU|5.0|My wife and I had recently seen &#34;Jersey Boys&#34; and I was cheerfully reminded how much I enjoyed these &#34;ubiquitous&#34; songs.  This particular set covers the best from the sixties and seventies.  The melodies and energy of the songs just feel good.
B008MM9630|5.0|So far I have had a lot of fun playing this game. The game is very colorful and interesting. Try it.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|My family and I thought the film was pretty good entertainment.  Our ages range from 12-52, and we have a couple of girls to (somewhat) balance out the outrageous amount of testosterone around here.  The guys LOVED the action; the girls enjoyed the males in the movie that were NOT scripted as metro males and who actually had a value judgment/ moral issue-weighing ability in the character development.  These days that's an incredible plus.  Please don't listen to the trolls who are denouncing this fine stand-your-ground movie.
B0009P66TK|5.0|I read the reviews before I bought it and was a little worried, BUT it looks great, works great. I work in a law enforcement field and you can imagine the jolts it takes, it is still working like a charm.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun and does get you to think.  I do wish they would come up with different clues. I'm already conditioned to look for certain color combinations which is making it easier to complete the levels.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I like it and easy to use even on the Kindle HD. I think you would enjoy it as well......
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I'm a big Hans Zimmer fan to begin with, but he just keeps getting better and better. This music is incredible. Uplifting, powerful, quiet, and serene all at the same time. Close your eyes, and you can see the movie while you listen to the orchestra. Watch the movie, buy the soundtrack. You won't regret it.
B0058PJ6NE|5.0|I read several reviews which were all negative, therefore I though twice before buying the YouTube Pro. The reviews were quite old, thus I took a chance. So far, good decision!  The app works great and I would highly recommend to all users of YouTube.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|addictive and challenging but not too frustrating can't wait to see more levels! this is a game for puzzle lovers.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This fun app is well worth the cost once you play all of the free puzzles.  You have different difficulty choices so if you want to share this with a child you can make it easy for them and then give yourself one that takes you several sittings to complete.  The pictures are beautiful with lots of themes from which to choose.  I highly recommend this app if you're a puzzle nut like me!!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|works very nice.  large improvement from previous versions - find myself using kindle only for most things i do on linkedin.  would like to be able to manage groups from kindle but cannot with this version.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Just did an update (6/22/13) and it killed the app! App keeps freezing, and when it does load, it's incredibly slow. I can't even see people's profile pictures or any pictures posted. Wish I could go back. Update sucks.
B0064QNS62|5.0|works great - looking for a lemmings type game to provide mindless entertainment.  fits the bill - but has not set the hook on me just yet
B000LXHK22|5.0|A Good Year (Full-Screen Edition) I love his movies and will buy more in the future definitely! Thanks<br />Russell Crowe
B003747252|4.0|I enjoyed the concept of this story - is the future fixed or not?  An interesting story of how people would cope if they knew the future and ultimately does it matter?
B00CATSONE|5.0|one of the best book on amazon. everyone should read this book to learn in depth about history's genius Nikola Tesla.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Warning:  I have not finished this book,however...It is full of twists and turns that I didn't expect (and I pride myself on figuring mysteries out in the first three chapters). It's a great summer read that I recommend.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|We hadn't heard much about this movie when we decided to watch it, and the reviews were so mixed it could have gone either way. 3 hours later, we can say that we more than liked this movie. Though we can understand how fans of books can often dislike the movie, we thought this was very well done.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Took me about two days to complete. I was expecting it to be more levels. It was fun while it lasted.
B00000DRA9|5.0|As a fan of the film and its music, I think this soundtrack is phenomenal.  Listening to it takes me right back into the film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|At my age, I didn't think I could still do these games. Fun!<br />Had a great time playing.<br />Would like to try more.

1416550542|5.0|'The Forgotten Garden: A Novel' was highly recommended to me by a good friend. I was not disappointed and found it every bit as good as she had said.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|A fun game but not too easy that the young people become bored with it.  It does take dexterity and planning to get that little ball going.  It's hard for grandmas to work it, but as long as you have a grandson around to tell you what to do, it's good. Definitely not for children under 3, but the 8-11 crowd here loves it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a women at a tough point in her career, and hoping to soon have children, this book really enabled me to make some important decisions for my happiness despite many telling me I should<br />\\"think about what's really importantly\\" and discourage me from taking that next challenging assignment. Thanks Sheryl!!!!

0425263924|5.0|I absolutely love this series. These books are amazing. Can't wait for the 4th one. Fan for life.  Love love love
0316777722|3.0|I don't know what finally made me sit down and read this.  As a voracious reader of magazines, I have come across Mr. Sedaris' work often and enjoyed it well enough, I guess, but I wouldn't really call myself a fan.  Still, for some reason his name came up recently and I decided to turn my attention to some of his collections.  After reading this one, my opinion of Mr. Sedaris hasn't moved much.  There plenty to enjoy here, but I wouldn't call myself a fan.<br /><br />All of Mr. Sedaris' essays here are drawn from his own life, which is OK if you find the author interesting.  Unfortunately, I don't think Mr. Sedaris is all that interesting.  I can sympathize with his struggles as a boy and his troubles with fitting in with the French.  On the other hand, I find things that pop up in his stories like his interest in soap operas and his cavalier attitude towards education, art, and drugs irritating.<br /><br />Fortunately, the people other than himself that he discusses are often fascinating and well-described: his father; his sisters; Valencia, for whom he worked as a personal assistant; the members of the moving company for whom he worked; Hugh.  He is also occasionally quite funny and funny forgives a lot of sins.  \\"City of Angels\\" where he describes the visit of Bonnie, a friend of a friend, and her visit to NYC is a laugh riot from beginning to end.  \\"Smart Guy\\" is also brilliant, joining the story of Reggie, a guy with whom he worked once who claimed to be a genius, to his own attempt to pass the MENSA test.  It's also funny how well Hugh comes across in this one as someone I'd like to know.<br /><br />In the end, I think this is a nice collection.  The stories are all a good, rather brief length which lets them pack a little more punch.  And there's enough here to carry a reader to the end without much difficulty.  However, I wasn't blown away.
0345803507|5.0|Amazing series of books. Fell in love with the story. With every book I was left begging for more. I hope there is a movie to come :). I would recommend this series to any one of mature age.

B008QE9XD2|1.0|Burton ruined a show that for all it's flaws was still engaging, frightening, developed and entertaining.<br />In the 1990's there was an all too short remake that also captured the heart of Dark Shadows.<br />For a person who claims to have loved the TV show Burton managed to defecate on the memory by turning it into an unfunny piece of crap. (Amazon will not let me say what I want here)<br />When this movie was first announced and it was said that Depp was playing Barnabas I was excited. He is a good actor with great breadth and talent.<br />What could have been a suspenseful and terrifying tale does more to ruin vampires than Stephanie Meyers with that twilight train wreak.<br />There are not enough tortures, insults or methods of inflicting pain upon Burton for destroying Dark Shadows. Some one put a stake through Tim and this s*** film before he makes another.<br />Shame on you Tim, eons of shame. My childhood was raped.<br />Aside from Tim's blatant disregard for the TV series he takes a show that was developed over hundreds of episodes and crams so much into it that the only character with any semblance of development (minimal that it is) is Barnabas. It was free on HBO... so I watched I saw 2 main problems. 1) it is a comedy not a horror. In my mind it disrespects on the original, and poor comedy at that. 2) it doesn't even develop any of the other characters at all AND all but completely ignores the Victoria Winters character.<br />At it's core the original Dark Shadows was a tragic love story between Barnabas, a several hundred year old vampire and Victoria's uncanny resemblance to his long lost love Jos&eacute;tte Duperies. But they basically threw in the major characters that were in the original series jut to get them all in an didn't really use them for more than set dressing for Depp. They were never fleshed out at all, provided no motivation and you had no idea who they even were (unless you knew from before).<br />Did you even know that many stars from the TV show made a mass cameo? Including Jonathan Fried? The original Barnabas? I didn't and I didn't after seeing it because they were just there not acknowledged.<br />Burton didn't just drop the ball, he never even touched the ball.<br />Epic Fail Tim, EPIC FAILe TV show made a mass cameo? Including Jonathan Fried? The original Barnabas? I didn't and I didn't after seeing it because they were just there not acknowledged.<br />Burton didn't just drop the ball, he never even touched the ball.<br />Epic Fail Tim, EPIC FAIL
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game. just the right amount of difficulty. waiting for more levels! only 10 levels so far. very addicting. hopefully the new levels will be out soon.
0143034901|5.0|I am a new fan of historical fiction and this is a perfect fit. Mr. Zafon's introductory paragraphs will transport you. I highly recommend the &#34;Cemetery of Forgotten Books&#34; series.<br />PS: Read Angel's Game first.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|it is so nice to be able to look and what % I have used and not to worry about using up my battery and then having to wate to charge my Kindel.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Honestly, if everyone was to read this, (if not for the sake of their relationship but for themselves) then I predict less separation rates and happier individuals. Spectacularly insightful.
B0049U4NQO|2.0|*SPOILERS* I can't believe he kills JACK!!!!! I finally found an author I like , and he kills a major character!!! The book was ok, but overall,it was not a very good book!!!!!!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app it totally helps. You should get it now! If you get this app, you are smart.
B00BXHE0CI|4.0|Greg Puciato (vocalist) has stated in the past that even Dillinger can sometimes fall into patterns and repetitions. With the last album, Option Paralysis, I thought that this sentiment was very apparent. It was a solid album, but with really no musical progression. One of Us is the Killer is everything you love about Dillinger PLUS some cool new stuff- songs with clean vocals, interesting musical harmonies, all with that signature Dillinger twist.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I was encouraged to read this book by a member of my church.  I found the writer to be sincere and the details thought provoking.  Too much of the research data for my liking, but it was well worth the read.  I would suggest it as a read for others who have questions regarding our place here and beyond.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|So much more than a Zombie story! Max Brooks brings forward the inner most emotion we try so hard to suppress-our fear.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is one of the most a some games ever I love it but I think my children like it better.So fun I think every one who tries it will love it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Yes, I was getting cranky about all the interruptions I had to endure (phone calls, dryer buzzing, cooking, kids, etc) because I just wanted to read this book! Kept my attention.  JK about the kids...:)
B001NOQI3U|5.0|One of her greatest movies.... Barbra not only directed but she co produced and stared in this movie about a woman who wants to study the Torah and is barred from doing so because she is a woman, so she pretends to be a man. It is funny in spots and her singing is as always amazing.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am not a health fanatic.  I am not a tree hugger or save the whales or granola type.  No offense to them.  Live and let live. This book is an eye opener. This was the first book I read in this genre. It has opened up a whole new world and education about what I'm eating and feeding my family.  It made me sad and then angry and then determined.Literally had my mouth hanging open at times. We're all dropping weight following a wheat free and sugar free diet. Even better than that is how we feel!!  Headaches and pain are disappearing.  My husband has been able to quit Lipitor prescription and his back pain has all but disappeared. I've quit one of my high blood pressure meds. This book led me to Maria Emmerich's cookbooks and blog, as well as the wheat belly blog.  I'm on a quest, a crusade if you will, to change my kitchen!  I just heard today on the news about foods that are banned in other countries because they are so toxic and harmful.  Not banned in the good ole USA.I LOVE the USA, but not the USDA! Check out the other authors that are trying to teach us what is wrong and toxic with our food. Gary Taubes and Robert Lustig are two good places to start, after Dr. Davis. Please do yourself a favor and open your eyes, too.  You won't be sorry!!  BTW, we eat pancakes, hamburgers, pizza, pasta and desserts galore.  They are just no longer made from wheat or sugar.

B005D4YOY6|4.0|This is my second pair of new port sandals. These fit much better than my previous pair of the same size, I have used them in every weather imaginable, thrown them in a washer and have held up to the punishement reasonably well. The actual color is lighter than I expected from the pictures available. May be a tad expensive for many.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|needs always on connection to play.  get tired of holding it if i'm laying on couch.  no speed settings which would make it easier, especially with a screen protector on the kindle.  always tries to sell you something, just be a game.  would recommend if you enjoyed the first one, but... just my thoughts, probably delete it later.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|While the book is predictable if one has the mind of a writer it is still a fun read and something that can be done within a few days. Very recommendable and I would encourage anyone who is looking for a fun read to look into this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Okay, I loved the book, ominous ending, riddles, rebellion, even the games are awesome! Trust me, if you loved the 1st, you'll love this 1 too!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome it's. fun. trying to figure stuff out and find the hidden items and passages I would recommend this game to others
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as good as the first one. I strongly recommend the reading. Though I might say you'll just want to read the third one right after that.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Our first Prime free borrowed book, more of a thumbnail sketch of Tesla as a come-on for another full size book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this game way better than the other of these types of games I have played.  Some of the others were practically impossible to figure out.  I enjoy a challenge or it gets boring but there is no reason that the only way to beat a level is to buy hints. I don't know if this game even has hints bc I didn't need to use them.  It was challenging without being so difficult it is annoying. I can't wait for more levels!
B009NY43NY|3.0|!! SPOILERS !!<br /><br />To be honest, I expected a bigger, more elaborate scenario for the last book of the series.  At the end of the previous book, Deadlocked, it seemed like her situation with Eric was going to be at the heart of things. I was surprised to find Harris didn't go into much detail about Eric. Hopefully she'll tie up those ends a little more neatly in After Dead.<br /><br />I had hoped to be content & feel like everything had come full circle once I finished this book (if that makes sense).  Unfortunately, I feel as if many characters were kinda left in limbo. I guess that's to push us into reading After Dead, so we can have closure.
B00BGICGJ8|3.0|Glad we did not see it in the cinema.  Good movie to watch if you in that stage of your life... :)
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Really compelling story line, but I would have preferred a little more character- and plot-development. Still, a fun read for the price.

B009PAETCG|5.0|this is the best game ever and is really fun for kids . kids can always play anytime anywhere that's the best part of this game. your kids  will love this app more than you do. your kids will enjoy this game very much and so will you
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a great and very entertaining game! Unlike a lot of swapping games, this one has a purpose for each level, not just to earn points and it gets challenging. It is with getting. You won't get bored!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love how they mix in so many aspects of deception and you have to constantly pay attention to your surroundings
B00DF0POXA|5.0|While there are only ten songs, they are ALL amazing. I don't even mind the few songs because I listen to them each over and over again. He's gone through somewhat of transitional period which was sometimes awkward to listen to (808 ...) but understandable considering his loss. However, his cd with Jay-Z was only a preface to his powerful and hard-hitting come back album (in my humble opinion). This is the Kanye that I fell in love with. And many have said that he's on some other stuff because of the comparison to Jesus; however, if you listen, he's acknowledging Higher Powers. He believes he is omnipotent which is a little arrogant but you have to love him because he's keeping it '300'. You must listen to the lyrics as they are extremely profound and clever.
1604597348|4.0|I feel silly giving Jane Austen less than 5 stars, but this novel is not as good as some of her others.<br /><br />I should mention SPOILER ALERT for this review.<br /><br />I read this after reading Wuthering Heights, which I hated, but even though it was written long after Northanger Abbey, it actually made me appreciate this book more. All of Austen's mocking of gothic novels was not lost on me after my atrocious WH reading experience.<br /><br />I appreciated the satire, but had a few problems with the book.<br /><br />First, the love story was not very believable. I didn't see how the love of someone so witty and superior as Henry could be bestowed on someone so slow as Catherine.<br /><br />That's the second point. Yes, she was sweet and good natured, but not much brighter than Mrs Bennett. I fear poor Henry will end up like Mr Bennett, resigned to his marriage to an idiot. I like my Austen heroines to be smart, like Anne Elliott. It was personally dissatisfying to me to be privy to Catherine's inmost thoughts, because she just wasn't very intelligent.<br /><br />That Austen was capable of creating Anne Elliotts, Lizzy Bennetts, and Elinor Dashwoods makes me wish that she hasn't wasted her time creating a Catherine Morland.<br /><br />The third point was what another reviewer alluded to: the ending was rushed and somewhat unsatisfying. Despite disliking Catherine's slowness, I still wanted her to get the guy. It was the one part of the novel where I wanted to be inside Catherine's thoughts, but strangely, Austen slipped into narrator mode instead. Bummer.
B0042LJTQO|5.0|When i was first introduced to classical music, my father who was a classical music lover and pianist (amateur) introduced me to Alfred Brendel doing Schubert. I was about 17. I remember thinking that it was really hard and I wasn't sure how much I liked it but 2 or 3 sonatas stuck with me as did Brendel's playing in a group setting of the Trout Quintet (Phillips). My problem was getting used to the solo piano. All this is by way of saying that you must beg, borrow, listen or have these recordings. Brendel is simply wonderful, better than any interpreter i know of Schubert and for that matter many others.<br />If your not used to them, they will grow on you- but I don't think getting used to them will be a problem. Brendel has recently retired and one of his last releases was an 8-disc set of recordings with 4 discs devoted to Schubert. One of the discs is live. A real treat. It is on Decca, and is carried by Amazon. So give a listen. You will love this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Realistic, for the most part. I actually ride and I have a few discrepancies ...but the graphics are good and the game is entertaining
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Just having learned it wouldn't be the last of the serie, I expected to be disappointed (you know, when an author is dragging a story just to make more money).<br />Well, I honestly must say this was not the case (fortunately).<br /><br />I read \\"Bared to you\\" and \\"Reflected in you\\" once again to remind me of the plot and enjoying the story and the characters once again.<br /><br />In this third book, there are still angst and twists but I found them more \\"bearable\\" because Gideon and Eva are growing more secure in their relationship.<br />They are more \\"mature\\", their love blossom and settle, even if it's still incredibly hot! The sex scenes remain really good (maybe unnecessarily present at times but whatever!).  I love the evolution of their feelings, the way they learn not to make the same mistakes, no more runing when problems come along but talking through them.<br />They trust the other more than they trust themselves, blinded by the other \\"perfection\\". They still doubt are flawed, so are simply human. And don't forget Gideon remains a \\"hot bod\\" ;-).<br /><br />I still hope there won't be five books but rather four (because I don't think you can build indefinitely on this kind of story) but I'm glad I've read it and it remains on my favourite shelf.<br /><br />I must humbly confess I reacted too quick saying \\"God no, not a fourth and an fifth!\\". Sorry miss Day, I sincerely admit you did a great job! Congratulations (but please, don't loose the spirit and fire of the serie in doing one too much).

B000JMKRKC|4.0|I would recommend this book.  It was well written and kept your interest throughout.  I liked the characters and the ending was not predictable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a really fun game.  Not too hard but challenging.  I would recommend it if you like games that you have to think outside of the box.  It is a good winding down game for people who like to think.

B00BGD8CFK|5.0|This is one of the best cases i have bought for my iphone 5 in a while. Its very stylish yet protective and i love the fact that you can interchange the back plates to go with your style. Even though there is no lay on the table on this case, its dont matter i never put my phone face down anywhere:). I have already bought 3 of the color back plates to go with my style. Very inexpensive and a great way to show off your phone!. I have gotten many compliments on this case, everybody loves it! The best part is that it cost merely  as much as a more expensive cases on the market. If you have a tempered glass screen protector it works excellent together! I have the glass TR Slim and its the perfect combo!
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is an extremely watchable movie. That is because of JJ Abrams. Say what you will about JJ Abrams, the man is a talented visual stylist. The way his camera moves, his edits, the set piece sequences he creates are all pretty great. He can make any movie fun. Hell, I even like his overuse of lens flares. His work in these areas is once again excellent in STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS. Unfortunately, he's never worked with a good script. When MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3 is the best script you've worked with, you're not doing too hot. Most impressive is Abrams' ability to make watchable, even sometimes good movies out of bad scripts. Abrams, along with his excellent cast, do their best again here in STID, but the script they are working from is just too vile to save.<br /><br />Again, most of the movie was very watchable. It never \\"feels\\" like Star Trek (whatever that means) to me, but it was enjoyable, in a dumb, obvious 9/11 allegory sci fi way. (Btw, have these writers seen the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA reboot? Cuz they kinda already did the whole space-opera-as-9/11 metaphor thing. 10 years ago. Before the allegory had been done a million times.) Honestly it felt more like a dumber version of Mass Effect than it did Star Trek. And I was fine with that. I love Mass Effect! But then, the wheels start falling off the wagon.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />For context, I looooove THE WRATH OF KHAN. I'm not crazy about everything relating to Star Trek, but that movie is great. So when STID very openly invites comparisons between itself and TWOK, it looks absolutely foolish in comparison, and frankly, made me mad. The writers may love TWOK like I do, but I don't think for a second they understand WHY that movie is great. Let's break this down into the two plot elements that most directly relate to TWOK.<br /><br />1.) Khan - The reason Khan is the most popular villain in Star Trek is because a) Ricardo Montalban's pecs and b) Khan has a history with Kirk and hewants revenge. When Eggs Benedict Cumberbund reveals himself to actually be Khan, NOT A SINGLE CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE CARES because he has no history with anyone. Hell, he hasn't even been talked about prior to this reveal. His name could have been John Bon Poopypants for all they care. It is a \\"reveal\\" that only exists for fan service and it falls completely flat. And then after that, he bears absolutely zero resemblance to any Khan I remember. Basically what they did was name a generic bad guy Khan for the fans when it really had no bearing on the movie they were making.<br /><br />2.) The Self Sacrifice Ending Inversion - This is the one that pissed me off. Kirk sacrificing himself for his crew and ship is a pretty obvious ending to his arc in this movie, at least after Pike spells out what he needs to do to be a good captain. But why, for the love of god, why, reprise Spock's sacrificial ending in TWOK? Why turn what should be an emotional moment into one where the writers are elbowing you in the side going, \\"Eh? Eh? See what we're doing here? Eh? Get it?\\" It was even worse for me because I knew pretty quickly that they weren't even going to follow through with Kirk's death and they were going to cop out with Magical Khan Blood (dumbest plot device ever, btw), basically rendering Kirk's arc completely pointless.<br /><br />TWOK is great because, on top of being a great popcorn film, every element of that movie comes together to say something about life and death and the relationship between the two. The Genesis project, Kirk having a son, Khan being a villain from Kirk's past, Kirk feeling old, and Spock sacrificing himself are all about these things. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. STID has no understanding of this. STID just takes a couple surface elements from this great movie and throws them in its movie and thinks that's enough. What it is instead is a hollow and cynical re-appropriation of the genuine article, and at that point all you'redoing is fan-fiction. BAD fan-fiction.<br /><br />I do, however, have a few friends who have never seen TWOK and they all think this movie is great. So if you've never seen the masterpiece that is THE WRATH OF KHAN and have no interest in doing so, maybe you'll like this.<br /><br />STAR WARS RELATED POST SCRIPT: Honestly at this point, the only hope I have for STAR WARS EPISODE VII is that Orci, Kurtzman, and Lindelof won't be involved at all and based on Michael Arndt's previous work, EPISODE VII will be quite easily the best script Abrams has worked with. It'll at least look nice...

B00393SFU2|5.0|M the film, shows the life and times of a serial child killer and the way his psychotic obsession drives him to kill. Peter Lorre gave a master class in acting in this disturbing film. The Criterion restoration is simply superb, reminding us that b&w can heighten the tension and drama. Cannot recommend this enough.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Long wait for a fine costume drama. Fascinating to see the class levels crumble a bit, but even more so to see the class structure upheld by the people below stairs. I often wonder what strata I would be assigned to by birth. Wonderfully entertaining and thought provoking series.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I do enjoy this story line.  I liked the fast pace action scenes and hoped this had the same kind.  It is probably more true than we care to think about how dirty so called responsible people can be in the way they treat others.  Or how there is no emotion or connection to other humans to the point of elimination them just because they can.

2707306959|5.0|I read the English version and wanted to compare the English with the French. It worked perfectly.<br />The author has many excellent works but this is my favorite. It addresses poverty, survival, relationships and is very enjoyable to read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Its so magical the characters come alive and  you really learn to love them. It creates this little window of how its like to have cancer. With my vague description it still sounds like a wonderful book and quite truly, it is.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even more gripping than the first book.... had a very hard time putting it down. It kept me reading, even when I should have been working... however, as riveting as this book is it can depress you with every frustrating emotion portrayed. Two thumbs up... I do hope the 3rd book is even better!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|On a whim I bought this Trilogy recently to find that these books are amazingly well-written and really engaging.  I've been unable to guess what would happen next throughout each of the books. The books deal with political oppression and sic-fi-type situations that seem quite plausible in the 21st century. They make a compelling anti-war statement in a world of high-tech wonders where the subjects of a depraved &#34;Capitol&#34; suffer unspeakable horrors on a daily basis. . My 14 and 16 year old granddaughters recommended these books to me some time ago.  I realize that there was a lot of publicity about them a couple of years ago and that a movie was made and released. I ignored the recommendation because I thought the books were written for teenagers.  To tell the truth I'm 89% through the 3 books and I can't imagine the outcome; or, rather I can image several different outcomes but the author, Suzanne Collins, has so-far been coming up with such unexpected happenings that I'm eager to find out her chosen conclusion.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|What more is there to say......I have always loved this movie, and it is even better on blu-ray. For those of you who have 3 or 4 other copies on dvd, special edition dvd, etc...., buy it!

B003LSTK8G|5.0|If you're looking for a book that really paints a picture of the recent financial crisis, then look no further. Michael Lewis takes you inside the heart of Wall Street, the deeply complicated securities they bought and sold, and the few people who made bets against those very products to show us what really happened inside an industry that has long been shrouded in secrecy. It's a great read for anyone looking to learn more about the sub-prime mortgage meltdown.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|This film had to have been made on a paupers budget and it looked like it.  I'm still unclear about the storyline of this film.  It was very poorly done, and seemed to wander aimlessly.  Don't waste your time trying to watch this film.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|&#34;Man of Steel&#34; is an entertaining reboot of the Superman franchise. Like &#34;Batman Begins&#34;, it focuses on the journey of the future superhero, investing in a serious way in the origins of Clark Kent, including the challenges of growing up different.<br /><br />The movie begins with the birth of Kal-El, the future Superman, on the dying planet of Krypton. A deadly feud between his father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and arch-enemy General Zod (Michael Shannon) leads to the launch of the infant Kal-El to earth. Clark Kent's difficult childhood is told grainy flashbacks as the conflicted adult Clark (Henry Cavill) wanders from job to job, performing guardian angel good deeds while seeking answers about his identity. The discovery of an ancient spacecraft in an Arctic glacier leads Clark to some of his answers, while putting him in the path of investigative reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Lois tracks Clark and the story of the century back to Kansas, just about the time General Zod arrives on earth. Zod will make life-changing demands of Clark; Smallville and Metropolis will become battlefields, and the Man of Steel will face tough choices.<br /><br />Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are wonderfully convincing as Ma and Pa Kent, teaching life lessons to the young Clark Amy Adams is a different Lois Lane, a plucky collaborator willing to give up her big story to help Clark save the world. Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, editor of the Daily Planet, is part of a solid supporting cast.<br /><br />The movie runs a little long, but it is good entertainment and the ending is wide open for a sequel; recommended.
B003K16PAU|1.0|The Kindle version of this classic book is riddled with typos and, perhaps worse, seems to have been formatted using the original censored version--thus even mild slang like \\"bugger\\" is represented by dashes, surely not what Orwell or his estate would want. What a disgraceful job. The same is true for the Kindle version of Orwell's \\"Burmese Days.\\" I am demanding my money back, and Amazon should root out these frauds, which do a disservice both to great literature and to e-reading in general. If rights holders are going to charge real money for backlist e-titles, they should make the small investment in proofing them first. And if they don't care about readers, maybe they will listen to Amazon.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The series is a wonderfully written erotic romance with diverse characters with complicated backgrounds and entanglements. Must read the series in order to fully follow and appreciate the storyline. The author keeps you enthralled. This book ends with a CLIFFHANGER and wishing the next publication was already available. The writing style is fluid and a page turner. Gideon is the complicated, passionate, powerful man all women would wish for but this author makes him real, believable, and human with flaws and strengths and a loyal love and passion for a woman who makes his difference

B00DF0POXA|3.0|I have been a kanye fan for a long time. I feel he is one of few rap artists out there right now that are keeping this style of music going. I'm sorry to say, but this cd is probably the worst one he has ever made. He experimented to much with the beats and some of the lyrics on the songs are garbage. There also aren't enough tracks, and only half of the songs on the cd are even good. Maybe because he has made such classics in the past, I expected only the best from him. I would pick up j cole's cd instead and download a couple of songs from this cd especially Black Skinhead. Hopefully Kanye can recover from this one, because if he keeps this trend going, he is going to go downhill just like lil wayne, really fast. Songs to Download: Black skinhead, Blood on the leaves, and Bound 2.

1781162646|5.0|Set in a seafront amusement park in 1973, Joyland (2013) by Stephen King is a bittersweet coming of age story with all the heartache, sadness and nostalgia such a story warrants.<br /><br />It's the story of one 21-year-old Devin Jones, how he lost his first love, wore a dog suit and solved a murder while working a summer job at a dilapidated indie carny with colourful characters, a secret language and a ghost.<br /><br />The ghost of Linda Gray fittingly haunts a ride called Horror House. Her killer was never caught, but some can still see Linda at the site of her murder, holding her hands out, appealing for help.<br /><br />The crime and the ghost are secondary; the main focus is on Devin as a young man. Similar to King's other nostalgic tales, such as The Body or Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, Joyland is a sepia-toned account told in the first person by an older Devin. King balances his storytelling well; the reminiscence never feels manufactured or saccharine, but genuinely heartfelt. Devin's girl troubles and emotions are, after all, known to all young men.<br /><br />Naturally, Devin's experiences go above and beyond the norm; with the help of his friends and co-workers Erin and Tom, he begins to research the murder of Linda Gray, eventually figuring out the clues (this is a Hard Case Crime novel, after all). Along the way Devin befriends a dying boy and his mother, who become instrumental in the redemption of both Linda Gray and Devin himself.<br /><br />The setting, a second-tier carny, is a world unto itself, complete with its own slang, the Talk. Full of terms and expressions such as \\"rubes\\" or \\"tipsed\\" or \\"carny-from-carny\\", the secret carnival lingo is half invented, but most of it is based on real slang and all of it works to create an atmosphere that convincingly transports the reader in both time and place.<br /><br />The slang may have inspired King to write some of the best storytelling of his long career; the language flows effortlessly, filled with small details, humour and warmth. King's always been a great storyteller, but Joyland is something exceptional. In spite of being low on horror and action, the first three quarters of the book are spellbinding, a true testament to the power of fiction. The final quarter, with its emphasis on the crime, feels almost unnecessary.<br /><br />Read all my reviews at mikareadshorrorfiction.wordpress.com

B001ANYDAO|5.0|This is going to be one of those books I recommend highly to people and that has made my favorite book list. I find myself thinking about it from time to time because it's that kind of book - thought-provoking. Everything from why this one is successful and that one is not; why Southerners have a specific type of honor code which is often maladaptive; what leads to Asian superiority in mathematics, and so forth. I can always pick it up to reread it and find something I have missed. I have it in hardback and audio.

One thing you need to know is that if<br /> you can`t solve a room in one sitting, you better remember what you have solved so far because when you exit the game and come back later, you will be starting over in that room.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved The Kite Runner, and did not think anything could surpass it. But this story of universal themes of family losses and searches for identity is even more insightful and even richer in painting the character's feelings.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Probably as good as Huntington.  Should help  Hernando De Soto.  Should be read by Larry Kudlow. Provides a context for Ian Bremmer.  Should inform public interest test in LNG export decisions by DOE.  Should be read by WSJ, NY Times, WP editorial boards.  Tells the environmental NGO that serious global issue resolution is grounded in basic institutional prerequisites, ie., property rights and rule of law.  Tells business that monopoly is deeply embedded in human nature and is almost always present at some level.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has done it again. I didn't think it was possible but I loved it even more then I loved his other books.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I am really liking the series.  Ender's Game is a little better but I like this one in a different way.  The writing is the same and I like his characters.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Absolutely awesome.  Wish there  was a game like this you could just buy and be done as oppose  to IAP.  That is th  only bummer. The game itself rocks
B000MD9UJC|2.0|It work ok, however the lumen does not have power in the distance.and when place in the punch some time power off
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This is one of those rare things in life where you are not worried about watching it with children nearby.  It is a captivating story that keeps you wanting to know what happens next!
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|amazing movie !!! love the filming and the quality of images . great for everybody to watch and see what s up around the world
0425263924|5.0|OMG Sylvia day has out done her self again I love this series Gideon cross is the man !!!! The story lines are awesome and I love that Eva will not play the victim she's strong and a woman of her own right ! And Cary is a mess lol I would love to have a friend like him never a dull moment !!! Thanks Sylvia day for an amazing series!!!!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is easy to play. my grandson and I enjoy playing it together. I help him build the kingdom and he helps me fight the battles.
B000R55J1S|1.0|Early Kathryn Bigelow, strong on some effects, miserably weak in story and character.  Viewed and analyzed for a class, so it was worthwhile as a learning experience about directors and their learning curve.
157421327X|5.0|This is a must when purchasing the Zentangle Starter Kit. Provides basic instructions with many examples from simple designs to very complex combinations of just simple markings that are so incredibly artful. Hugely inspirational. A great stress reliever as I just tune out for a few minutes and play with my pen and gaze at the great images on my paper.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|super app but needs more levels. I beat all ten levels the same night I installed it. played well on my kindle fire
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The entire series is in need of a new proof reader.  Hackneyed and poorly written.  I do not recommend it.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I love that Amazon Prime is offering free movies, especially this one, considering how I love dance, Julianne Hough, romance, and oh yeah, Kenny Wormald.<br /><br />Great movie, my second fav to Great Gatsby, but trust me this movie probably didn't cost anything compared to that million dollar production.<br /><br />I love love love this and I hope Amazon comes with new movies and keep this one to!!!
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|Forrest Gump is a classic movie we'll be discussing and enjoying years and years from now.  Superb performances by all.  Sound track is a unique use of music/songs from different time periods to &#34;set the time frame&#34; as the movie progresses over the span of Forrest's life and experiences.  And Haley Joe Osment is the precious young son of Forrest.
B000059GEH|5.0|Classic actors and actresses in setting of New York City. Love this movie! Amusing, entertaining, heart-warming. While the desire of the three main actresses is to marry wealthy men, they all ultimately end up marrying for the right reasons...with a bonus thrown in.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awesome game everyone this is exactly what you will expect from gameloft one of the best organization of rpg games
B004H3WWU2|5.0|BOOQ Support = Excellent.<br />Build Quality = Excellent.<br />Water resistant = Excellent.<br /><br />This is really awesome for commuting, it's slim profile allows you to sneak into tighter spots without having to take it off (but, you still should when you can anyway, as all good, civilized and considerate people should.)<br /><br />Do not drop your bag vertically. Have a padding, a cushion or similar that is below your laptop. I dropped the bag accidentally once and it made a dent on it :/ so add extra padding if you are the kind of guy that may be prone to this.<br /><br />One of the shoulder straps has a nice pocket, I think it was for a cellphone? (but its pretty tight) -- I keep business cards there instead.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I loved every bit of it. I would recommend it to. Anyone from 10 to 18. Some younger kids might find it scary. I chose this rating because it was a wonderful story.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Game is ok. Freezes slot...coins sometimes do not collect. Otherwise it is a fun game. Just needs to retool the game.
0345803507|5.0|I loved the book i really needed this last one and for as much as i paid it was in wondeful shape i would recommend other people to buy books from this seller. And i got the book faster than expected!
B001P9EQH8|3.0|I was expecting more amplification out of it. For that price I guess that all you can get, although in my experience price does not always reflect better quality specially when buying online. I will keep it, however I am still searching for a more powerful amplifier and I will make sure that the product specifications describe the product in detail.
B00821OX98|5.0|Fun show to watch.  A few situations leave you wondering why anyone would do that.  Like playing a piano when hiding out from bad guys.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the SF setting and the focus on foster care. Very good book, recommend it to everyone in the Bay area
B00001OH7P|5.0|Great Album takes me back to the summer of 1972 when I heard this on my friends cassette recorder he recorded it from album to cassette to make a copy. It blew me away great piano & guitar tones just fantastic. Something about Ziggy Stardust , a turning point for that decade !!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have found this game to be very enjoyable.  It's  not too hard but yet not too easy so that younlose interest.  It really makes you think.
0812550706|5.0|Read it in a week, went by fast.  Exciting, good character development.  Hopefully one will be about Peter.  Will continue reading series.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|not user friendly can't make it work.  Help sends you to a total useless app that doesn't address the problem of how to begin using the camers
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's fun because it has more than one game but you have to have wifi fyi. that id why you should get it.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|WD's My Book Live.  I just bought the My Book Live by WD.  My Kindle Fire HD worked like a charm with this little app.  It was a pretty intuitive setup.  The deal is that the activation code was not necessary.  The thing I really needed was my password to protect my data.  The username and password you enter into the software setup for mobile devices is all you need on Kindle Fire HD. At first all I got was the white screen previously mentioned by another user.  But as soon as I installed the software on the computer that is connected to the Internet WiFi router, the little icons came up.  I pressed connect and entered the password.  It immediately recognized any music I put in the public folder.  Use the Public folder on you WD drive.  It works just like Amazon cloud once you get it set up.  The app is free too!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The game is great love the concept.. my issue is I'm a level 19 just barely ..Well each level they give new things to do well it seems they are running out of stuff to have you do because I do maybe two to three quests and then it's done so I find myself racking up sand dollars pearls etc not wanting to use them in case I need s them for the next level... I wish they had more quests for the higher levels.
B00992CF6W|4.0|On kindle, my friend also has MCPE but on  lpad.He said that he has redstone. So I went to creative mode and looked in my inventory but I didn't see any redstone. I have the 7.1 update and the next update is 8.1 for me so I was wondering if y'all could fix that to update for every .1or .2 update please and thank you
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Great Movie for Imax. I hope they come out with a remake of The Wizard of Oz. Brings the Movies together perfectly.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. It's so addicting. I play it every day. Also the updates are out of this world. You must get it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics on this are really excellent.  Operation of the game is smooth.  Text is very readable.  Even the music is cool.  The only &#34;down&#34; side is that it takes a couple of minutes to load.  It's not instant like most other games.  If you are looking for a little fun and intrigue, it's really worth the buck-ninety-nine.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|You have to get this app. I play it every day. You will like it. I know I do. I keep on getting new arrivals.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The complexity of the project kept me reading at a rapid rate.  The beautiful thing is that this is a free library book from my library.  Overdrive is the app for those interested.  Another great John Grisham book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. I play it every day. It's creepy and cool at the same time. Loving the game you must get it.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|I must have seen Jurassic Park 30 times in theaters when I was a kid. What's not to love about Jurassic Park the movie and Blu-ray picture and sound? I love it!
B001XV09UG|4.0|The movie is pretty dark and sexually drived but it was extremely interesting.  I thought the movie concept was unique and I'm glad I watched it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|At first I wasn't sure if I liked it but it is challenging and fun, harder than you would think, makes you really go fast.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This may be a book you love or hate, but I have loved it for years. It should not be read literally. Coelho wrote this after going on a 500 plus-mile religious pilgrimage in Spain, where he experienced a spiritual awakening. The book addresses wide truths: pursuing one's dreams despite what others say, finding out what is really valuable in life, etc. Many Biblical allusions. Short and easy read. If there is any &#34;go with the flow&#34; in you, this book is really great.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|No instructions on how to play this game.  Total waste of time. Therefore, I was unable to rate this game except for the graphics.
B000I9YX06|5.0|Great for discussion in terms of what Asimov had in mind: what place does technology have in our future? Or watch just for the fun of it! Vastly entertaining, esp. if you like any kind of sci-fi. It's not crazy &#34;out there&#34; like Aliens vs Predators, etc. And Will Smith? He's serious and funny. Great choice!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun for children who love horses and for other horse lovers of any age<br />Also.....ITS FREE so have fun
B005HSL626|5.0|Oh my god this game is so fun this is a game your kids will love fruit ninja  but my favorite level is arcade mode this game fun  has good graphics and all the other stuff very fun and awesome.
B007SGM084|5.0|I heard many rumors about this book and I was actually afraid to read it.  I purchased the books for my Kindle, and have not been able to put the book down.  A very good story, along with a few extras.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Compelling book....I couldn't put it down. Great writing style. Reminds me of Margaret Atwood. I hope there are more silo stories to come!! Hats off to Hugh. Stunning work.
1936608898|5.0|Love this book! So enlightening and helpful! I would heartily recommend it to anyone trying to clean up their diet and thereby regain their health!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This app is awesome! I love the idea and physics of the game I would recommend this game to everyone! I cant wait for the next update to come out so I can keep playing!! Good job Rovio!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. this app makes you use your brain. I had a great time playing this game. it was fun. and I really enjoy it. I wish there were more stages.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Something different, my favorite song off the album has to be &#34;New Slaves&#34; hands down....the rest of the album was pretty interesting.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An extremely well written book that you don't' want to put down. Fantastic reading. Very much looking forward to more of E.L. James.
B005544V6A|5.0|this was a great series that i just happened upon on my kindle...i was surprised to learn that it was around for a few years already....looking foward to seeing the next year
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.<br /><br />On the positive side, I felt like the worlds were very vivid. I also enjoyed the fast pace of this book. It's obviously a YA book, and I think teens will find this book very accessible and easy to read.<br /><br />The book's downfall would be a lack of development. Maybe it's because it is a YA book, but I found myself wondering what the motivation of the villains could be. The fast pace is great, but I think it comes at the sacrifice of making this book lacking a bit.<br /><br />Other than that, the writer is a very good writer!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Wish there were more levels! But for the most part it was pretty entertaining. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a suspense game!
1449437524|4.0|It was in a way childish in some respects and yet in a way (at times) too crude for a child.
159463176X|4.0|Another winner by this wonderful author. I was so excited to see Housseni had written a new book and he didn't disappoint.<br />I gave it four stars instead of five because of the ending. Somehow what happened to Abdullah did not seem to mesh with the rest of the story<br />That being said, I believe him to be one if the best contemporary authors today
0743490304|5.0|I read this years ago and wanted a hard copy for my permanet library.  I only buy hard copies of books I truly love; otherwise you end up with a warehouse.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Life by Keith Richards is simply one of the best biographies I have ever read! Indeed, it is easily the best music bio ! The key to a good bio is honesty and this book has it in spades, from the first page to the last. When most people (including me) hear the name Keith Richards, they immediately think of drugs first, then music. After reading life, when you hear his name, the word 'drugs' will be further down the list. Son, father, friend, swashbuckler, survivor will easily be top of the list. After reading the book, you feel that Keith is an old friend that you could just pop next door to chat with. Life is honest, fun and packed with amazing stories and musical anecdotes that come straight from one of the original music rebels. The recipe for bangers and mash is great too !
0312335164|2.0|I asked for a hard copy, and this was listed in with the hard copies, imagine my surprize when it came as a paperback.  It also didn't look new, so I couldn't even give it as a gift.  It was too much trouble to return it so I'll just give it away,  but I'll never buy from this supplier again.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is constructed of quality materials. The inside compartments are adjustable to fit snugly around your gadgets. Plenty of space.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The story line is good but the editing is very poor. There are multiple errors that a simple grammar checker should have caught, and a cursory proof reader would definitely catch. Some of the story is \\"conveniently\\" contrived. Would have referred series for middle high school students but between the excessive rape scenes in book 5 and the horrendous grammar it really has little merit.
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|Some songs I really like, and some I find a little too repetitive or boring. Still a wonderful and creative album.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I bought this product because my dog bite the mic out of my old one. The description says new but that is questionable. It came in a bad with no box and no software..... Which u need to run all the extra stuff on the head set. The only reason I'm not returning it its because I already have the software CD from my last one. Saving the 10 dollars from not ordering it from another provider was not worth it.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|This is an enjoyable album that you can drive/dance/sing along/chill/work/etc. to. I like the variety of song styles and the flow.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Since I was little I have wanted a horse but no where to keep.... this allows me to live out one of my childhood dreams
B002JVWR4A|4.0|Love Bones! Great show! Oddly though the 5th season disc 1 was a repeat of 4th season last disc!? Have I missed something?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love that you have to do a series of puzzles to get out of each room. Can't wait for more levels.
B0000074FG|5.0|With that opening blast riff of Jailbreak, no one in 1976 was prepared for that song. It's gotta be one of the greatest rock n roll songs of all time. That killer riff and those smoking little lead bits before the 2nd and 3rd verse. That chorus with that multi tracked backing vocals, Lynott's cool swagger in the vocal delivery. The chorus itself's main hook is the rhythm guitar belting out that power chord, with the lead phrase overtop of it. There's really nothing like it. Sadly Phil could never write anything as grand as this song on a commercial scale but if you're a Lizzy fan you've learned to live with that and most likely love everything else they've done. Angel From The Coast is a fun rocker, it carries the momentum from the classic title song very well. Featuring some awesome galloping drum/lead guitar sections. Running Back is another of those mid paced \\"light rockers\\". It has a nice little riff, some slight background organ work and really nice vocal/guitar hook in the chorus. Romeo And The Lonely Girl is a minor highlight. It goes for that formula established on the previous year's Fighting album of multi-tracking acoustic and electric riffs together to create a rocking but retrained sound. The chorus is a little weak on this song, it features Phil crying out \\"oh poor Romeo, sitting all on his own-eo\\". But, still a nice tune and it does have another inspired guitar solo.<br /><br />Warriors starts out slow, but erupts into a tough rocker, it would go on to be one of the bands live staples. It has another killer punchy riff and some explosive twin lead lines.  Fight Or Fall is the albums ballad, and much like The Wild One, it has a some delicate guitar lines and vocal melodies that are really very pretty. It's been said before and will be said again, the heartfelt working class rock ballad's undisputed king was undoubtedly Phil Lynott. Few rock bands could do ballads in general as well as Lizzy did. The Cowboy Song is of course one of the bands most well known songs. A live staple from here on out. It starts out with a pretty nostalgic slow opening that really does evoke the imagery of the old west before morphing into a fun brash rocker with another great set of vocal/guitar melodies and some great hooky leads that you'll never forget. Then there's...The Boys Are Back In Town. What can you say about it that hasn't already been? The song is a rock n roll masterpiece much like Jailbreak, oddly the only 2 Phil ever wrote. The song came at just the right time. 1976, a year before Springsteen had become a huge star with Born To Run. And you also had Tom Petty's debut record hitting the same year. Yeah Tom didn't experience breakthrough success in the US with it but the overall notion of the \\"nostalgic songwriting musings set to epic poetry style\\" was breaking in at the time. And the song evokes it to a T. Bar fights, Dino's bar and grill, jukebox, summer nights, it's all there. Street level romanticism's that most US audiences would identify with. And the music...the main riff is simple but it's the later half of the song's twin lead lines that are just majestic. Some of the finest twin leads ever committed to tape. The song embodies rock n roll as an art form. The album wraps up with Emerald. A bombastic rocker filled with Irish imagery. It contains one of the heaviest Gorham/Robertson riffs ever, and a breakdown twin lead riff that is purely epic.<br /><br />Jailbreak doesn't exactly feature the best set of Lizzy songs, there are some amazing gems on their other records for sure but in a way it is lightning in a bottle almost. The overall feel of the album catches something truly special. Phil Lynott wrote some awesome songs on the bands following albums but for some reason none of them became big hits like Jailbreak or the Boys. Because of that the 2 songs themselves became culture landmarks of the 1970's. Jailbreak WAS the perfect song for the mid 70s, it has that wild rambunctious juvenile feel and the cover art itself IS Thin Lizzy. The band here is depicted in comic book form much like Kiss was the same year with their breakthrough Destroyer album. So it captured that youthful pop culture fascination kids had with rock and it's general mystique. Phil spent the rest of his career chasing that success again but never had it, still, Jailbreak is a milestone hard rock/heavy metal album. Is it Lizzy's best? It's debatable but in a way it probably is because even though they made further masterpiece hard rockers like Bad Reputation, Roisin Dubh, Holy War, Cold Sweat and Waiting For An Alibi, the Jailbreak album has the band at their hungriest and that certainly is always the most important era of any great band.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I just finished playing this game and really enjoyed it _ the best of Fishdom, and of Jewelquest combined. It isn't just board after board, you feel like you're doing something for these people.
B00D6OV57O|4.0|A well balanced score full of heavy percussion and rock influence.  Epic scope with hints of aural heart.<br /><br />My favorite track is 'Han's Original Sketchbook'.  I love listening to the genesis of Zimmers full score.  I wouldn't be surprised if that itself informed Snyder's edit of the movie.<br /><br />Other Notable tracks:<br /><br />You Die or I Do<br />Flight<br />If You Love These People (I hear a lot of Zimmer's Lion King score here)<br />What are you going to do when you are not saving the world?<br />Goodbye My Son<br />Tornado
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I picked up this game as the free app of the day.  I like the board game, so I thought I would enjoy this.  BUT, with these permissions I refuse to install.  I would be happy to try the game without the permissions.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game lets you interact and capture different animals in fluxing animals<br />bears shoulder be added if there are none. you should also start out with more peanuts to speed things up.
6305428387|5.0|I simply love this movie, it kept me laughing and sitting on the edge of my seat. It is based on a true story and it has a wonderful cast. The DVD itself is an excellent addition to any collection. My 7 year old daughter even enjoys watching it with me and finds it funny and enjoyable.
0425263991|5.0|Heart of Obsidian is the twelfth full lenght novel in the outstatnding Psy-Changeling series and the fisrt novel in the series to feature a Psy-Psy couple. Since Caressed by Ice, ounselor Kaleb Krychek has always appeared to be a shadowy, suspicious character whoe motivations and alligiances were ambiguous and \\"fluid. I've always wanted to beleive that Kaleb was redeemable but over the course of the sotry arc I just could not fathom how Nalini Singh would be able to make this remote and cold man into a believable heroic leading man. Well, she went beyond all my expectations and blew away all my doubts with this superbly written story of a man whose dark inclinations to annihilate his entire race had been held in check by one thing...his fierce determination to find the one woman who held his soul.<br /><br />The love between Kaleb and Sahara was a thing of beauty and made even more poignant by the knowledge that they met as young children, he a tortured thirteen year old boy in the clutches of a psychopathic monster, and she a bright, spririted nine year girl who kindness and empathy for this tortured boy bound them as kindred spirits forever. Torn apart by violence and evil when she was sixteen and he twenty-two, it was Kaleb's promise to find Sahara that lets the reader delve into the true heart and soul of Kaleb and o finally understand what really drove him.<br /><br />I was completely stunned at how much I lovedthis book. I am a die-hard Changeling fan and never thought I could connect with a story that did not feature my beloved Changelings.  But as a journeyed more into the background and center of Kaleb and Sahara's backstory, I was delighted that the focus of the sory was on this couple, getting to know them as they are reunited after seven long years of lonliness and pain was such an exquiite look into the true power and salvation of a love that sustains the darkests of souls and triumphs over evil. Heart of Obsidian was simply amazing and has earned everyfive star review on this forum. Unquestionably, the depth and commitment of this couples love for one anoter won me over as I basked in their forging a new world order for the fracturing Psy race. Kiss of Snow is still my absolute favorite, but Heart of Obsidian, Sahara and Kaleb, stand side by side with Hawke and Sienna in quality and poignancy. I look forward to the next book in the series and the aftermath of the fall of Silence and its impact of the Psy race and the Psy-Changeling world.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was tempted to give this game 4 stars, because it is too much fun!  Great fun.  It is a challenge, but the more you play the better you become.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|After all the latest about NSA spying and the backlash, you'd think developers would get the idea.  My data is my data you don't need to know that I'm playing this at the restaurant across the street.  Especially for a game, that had no need for this requirement, why add it? It doesn't enhance the app.  Also, if every  app you have tracks you, battery life  will be abysmal.  1 start until changed.  Not really fair, I know because I won't even install to test.  Fix this and I can rate your game for real.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game BUT it needs more content.  I finished this game in less than a day!  That is why it only got 4 stars.
1422161978|5.0|Only halfway through, valuable info for businesspeople looking at now and future. Great examples so far, still reading the analysis and roadmap.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|This is a great movie showing a different side of Josh Duhamel. I read the book and still enjoyed the movie. Recommended for everyone as was in good taste.

0345472322|4.0|I'm late to the party on this book. I'm also glad I finally read it. Dweck's book is important...the principles can be applied in just about any aspect of one's life. Sure the book is a little repetitive, but Dweck is advancing a big idea and, no doubt, wanted to demonstrate that the idea played out in a number of areas---parenting, teaching, business, etc. Naturally the stories are going to overlap a bit.<br /><br />Chapter seven 'Where Do Mindsets Come From?' is worth the cost of the book alone.<br /><br />For those that have a 'success or achievement orientation', this book will be especially pertinent. A great many examples in the book were from people who certainly appear to have had that orientation. Yet there are many among us who don't value 'success' as the be-all-end-all. For them I'm not convinced that all of what Dweck advances in this book holds true. For instance, Dweck advances the premise that those holding a fixed mind-set begrudge the success of others (page 245 in the paperback version). That's not my experience at all.<br /><br />For many 'personal growth' is simply not one of their top values. Many of these same people also hold what Dweck refers to as a fixed mind-set.  I've met many such people in my lifetime.  Yet the vast majority don't begrudge the success of others.<br /><br />I bring this up as an illustration that, to me, Dweck tends to generalize a bit in this book---the begrudging the success of others being one example.<br /><br />That said, Dweck's work is important---certainly worthy of your time and attention.<br /><br />Bill Wiersma--Author, The Power of Professionalism

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I really like this game. It's just challenging enough that I don't get bored with it.<br />One of the things about it that I like is that you complete challenges by accruing things like wood, leaves, food, etc, instead of just coins or weapons.<br />I enjoy seeing each building grow and I think the art and animation are nicely done.<br />For now I can only play it on my Kindle Fire HD and can't install it on my older Kindle Fire yet, but that's not a big deal for me.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is addicting, I could not put it down. I was quite upset when I was finished and haven't been able to find a book that keeps my interest since. I read a review about the movie and apparently it's nothing like the book. That sucks. But I have yet to see a movie that does a book justice.

B000TEUSJK|3.0|Caligula may be a fairly good historical account, but the very explicit sex scenes became a bit to much for me.  I know the Romans had orgies, but was it really necessary to concentrate on them in the movie?  Caligula was a ruthless Roman Emperor.  Tell that side of the story.
B00C0UHGLO|5.0|I don't see the problem that everyone else has with this app.... yes, it does ask for permission to use your GPS location, but the solution is simple. Agree to the terms. And if you don't want your information shared, turn the GPS on your phone OFF! It isn't that hard. If the GPS is off, they don't know where you are, and the game still works just fine. It is a good strategy game and a lot of fun. People shouldn't give it such bad reviews just because they are too stupid to turn their GPS off..
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|there should be no need to know my location through GPS it's a game please remove all unnecessary permissions. I paid for app why do need to market you popup ads to me
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However, I have yet to read this particular book that this film adapted from.<br /><br />I think the film had an overall theme that explains fairly well how justice is not always in plain view nor could be sought without questioning some of our own limits.<br /><br />I think the main character, Rudy, (Matt Damon) is one that viewers can empathize with. The movie is from his point of view, he takes you through the steps of what he thinks, what he's up against, and his frustrations as a new attorney.  I personally liked Dick's character (Danny DeVito)only cause I wasn't sure if I could trust him at first, but as the story goes on, I realized he posses all the traits that those lawyer jokes are about, but you like him because he's on the right side (the underdog) although he's not very heart felt, I still like his part in the telling of this story.<br /><br />This may be a feel good movie, but narrows down to the point with law suits -You can sue just about anyone and win. Doesn't mean you'll always get to see the monetary amount that is awarded to you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|so much fun need more room tho love doing it with my husband and we have a blast helping each other out and getting the puzzles done

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|EDIT: Friend received the replacement a week ago, about 3-5 days after he called it in, and it works perfectly. Since I don't have the mouse, all I know is that it's one of the best gaming mice that he has used, ever.<br /><br />Purchased this mouse for a friend after he begged for it.<br /><br />He got it about 2 days later, and it had worked fine for a while. Then later, when he had stopped using it and unplugged it for storage (he uses a laptop), when he tried to use it again, it refused to work at all, not even showing up in Windows' device manager, and claiming there was a power surge on the USB port, which, from what I've read, is common for some mice.<br /><br />After some messing around with solutions to get it to work at least a little bit, that's pretty much what it did, work a little bit. The cord protruding from the mouse had to be positioned just right, lest it think it was disconnected. Only after some moving around would it work again.<br /><br />Friend contacted Anker and is getting a replacement mouse soon, hopefully a working one and a return label for the current one. If that one works properly, this would be a 5 star pretty much.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This was a very long tale of death, misery, sadness, and disaster, leavened by splashes of humor and even joy.  Highly recommended.

B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Bruce Willis in his greatest movie franchise. For a little guy he is tough as steel. I have liked him in everything he has ever done. I had a business opportunity to be in Idaho. I scheduled 2 extra days so I could go to haley and meet him and Demi at there famous bar. They were both out of town and I was sooooo disappointed. I love both of them and I missed them. Had a number of libations and had my partner drive us back to our hotel. The die hard franchise is terrific. I have them all!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|great game keep the ages coming. I think the next level should be 1960s hollies that would be kinda trippy
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game. the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because it needs more levels. its challenging but not impossible. love it!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Our 8-year-old son loves this film.  The animation is perfection, and the story line never lags.  He's hoping there will be a Tintin II out soon!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is an excellent game and love the challenges that it provides.  Would love to see more levels of this game very soon.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|This movie was a great magical romance bonded by choice of good and evil .What would you do for love ?<br />Would you hang on or let go ?  Would you kill or save ?  Would you live or die ?  Darkness or Light ?
0385491026|5.0|Margaret Atwood is an excellent author.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that called this \\"grueling but gripping, haunting\\", and similar descriptions.  This book weaves the life story and coming-of-age time of a woman now in her 50s.  It is a retrospective & honest look into her thoughts, actions, and reasons for her responses to situations in her life.  A pervasive theme in the book is how her childhood friend or FIEND shaped her and made a huge imprint on her life--it is something she constantly looks back at, and it can be a painful experience for the reader.<br />Atwood makes some brilliant comparisons--a true artist.
B00C2VIA52|1.0|Game keeps taking me to page to update application, but when go there only get gives me an option to open it.  Really annoying.
0142000655|5.0|John Steinbeck--WOW!! This has become one of my all-time favorite novels.  It encompasses the human condition, the struggle between good & evil, is interspersed with history/a complete picture of a time period, has a large group of inter-connected people and well developed characters, and is told from an interesting point of view (Sam Hamilton's grandson, who is a friend of the main character).  It is filled with philosophy and an observance of human behavior and reasoning.  I got so attached to several of the characters.  It is the complete life story of a (fictional) family and is very engaging.  Absolutely brilliant!!  Highly recommended!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I've heard nothing but great reviews about this movie so I thought I would try it out myself!! It is Awesome!! Definitely be prepared for a sequel!

1476734941|4.0|I do not give it a blanket recommendation:  Those being treated for serious or persistent medical problems such as diabetes, COPD, etc. should first discuss the diet with their physician.  As I said, it works for me but I am well monitored by my physician.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book to read via my Kindle Fire. I had heard about the movie but have never seen it. I was leery about the book/movie. It sounded depressing listening to others describe it, however I decided to purchase it anyway. It is very good so far. It's a unique story and it makes me think of the tv show Revolution.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|Absolutely brilliant! I was skeptical that a bunch of guys in their 60s could reproduce but they exceeded my expectations - this music is as alive for me as when I was a prepubescent lad and heard Sabbath for the first time. And let's not forget Rick Rubin in this `comeback' - his guiding hard helped bring out the essence of Sabbath that the musical landscape was missing for decades!
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Good storyline, several new twists to the old story were a welcome surprise, very enjoyable rendition.  I recommend this film if you like the original story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the swift and easy install and transfer of all my kindle books to my nexus 7! Great job!
0307200477|5.0|I would highly recommend this book! It's larger than the copy I had as a kid, plus it has the extra pages. Like most of us, I don't like the plastic comb binding, but it isn't available any other way. I guess it's necessary because so many of the pages have objects hidden inside to make the buttons rattle and the ball squeak. Also like other reviewers, my little girl was able to pull it apart in about 2 minutes when I wasn't watching. To take care of this problem, I put a couple drops of super glue on the top and bottom loops of the comb binding. It's been several weeks now, and she hasn't pulled it apart. She actually finds this book and brings it to me to read -- over and over and over and over...
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Hard to put down. Easy fast read, another great Robert Langdon story. I can't wait until the movie comes out.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|Read it on a whim, because I enjoyed Blade Runner. It's a good book; solid characters, good story, decent ending.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|For any science fiction fan, especially anyone who loves time travel movies, this film would seem like a must see.  Even more so with tuff-guy and fan-favorite Bruce Willis in the starring role.  Unfortunately, as the movie progress and plot holes begin to pile up like dirty laundry on the bathroom floor, the viewer is left more puzzled that satisfied.  Without giving anything away, let me just say after watching this movie I found myself thinking more about all the ways the movie could have been better rather than anything I liked about it.  My recommendation: Good way to kill two hours on a rainy Saturday, but don’t set your expectations too high.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Andy Weir does a good job illustrating the plight of a lone astronaut, stranded on mars. At one point, it has that Apollo 13 feel, but that might be giving too much away. Not as bad as it sounds, one man &#34;Castaway&#34; story and all.<br /><br />No longer available for digital purchase... pft... Don't read it or support the new publishing company in any way whatsoever. Really isn't that great of a book, anyway. Probably could spend your time better. One man stranded on a distant planet... It has about as much substance as could be expected of one character. Go outside!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Other than the dull Ukrainian mob subplot, this season is a strong one, with Debra finding out what her brother really is and then abetting and protecting him from their captain.  Carpenter has never been better.
B004JHYRP4|4.0|Anticlimactic, but a good read. Without giving anything away, it felt like there were a few loose ends. However, the book is an interesting and well-written take on an alternate fuel source and the difficulties associated with the science of it. Easily compared to recent events and concerns, such as global warming and, of course, the fuel crisis. Asimov manages not to be messagy, and it's a good example of this type of science fiction.
B005MHI0QM|4.0|I found the last several pages a bit preachy and seriously doubt that a girl of that time would have had the views now know as feminism.  I suspect that these  paragraphs were someone else's ,not Anne's. A young girl who had been a virtual prisoner during her early teen years most probably would have  been more concerned with gaining her freedom and her life back , not the status of women in the world.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|The book is a quick and easy read. It has many connotations to religion mainly Christianity and its impact on mankind. It is fictional and set in the distant future and other religions have replaced Christianity but mankind's relentless pursuit of godlike abilities is the basic premise. When it comes down to it is probably easier to want to be a God than to actually make godlike decisions.
1400067820|1.0|I am a huge fan of the Black Swan and think the concept of understanding the treatment of nonlinear systems as linear is not an approximation, but is instead a recipe for disaster.  Our desire to simplify and quantify the unquantifiable does not make us safer, but instead, creates exposure to unpredictable and devastating outcomes.  This is one of the more impactful ideas in the last 20 years in the areas of finance and decision theory.  In Black Swan, Taleb presented his thesis in a methodical way and managed to keep his massive insecurities and passive aggressive ego at bay.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Antifragile defines the \\"one book too far\\" problem where the same useful material is rehashed in a less interesting and random way and the author spends the entire time trying to codify and categorize minutiae while he tries to convince you that he has never been wrong and has read every book ever written (in the original language - no less).<br /><br />In a nutshell, the books message is, \\"If volatility is bad, then expose yourself to things that get stronger or benefit from  a volatile environment.\\"  You have to put up with endless pedantic ravings about how robustness or resilience simply resists volatility rather than benefits from it, so they are not the same.  OK, we got it, now what's you new point?  Well, there is no point, other than the fact that Taleb believes that the success of the Black Swan is a mandate to provide us  career advice, views on our breakfast choices, and to bash so mercilessly every other living author, professor, banker, doctor, lawyer, MBA, government official, etc as misguided, at best, or truly evil, at least in his deranged mind.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, pass on this one.  As a matter of fact, if you haven't read the Black Swan, skip that one too.  We shouldn't be financing this guy's ravings.  Hopefully his 15 minutes are up.<br /><br />If you are looking for a thoughtful book by an adult, read Thinking, Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|Not  much to saY. DEX IS ALWAYS VERY GOOD. NEW SEASON, MORE GREAT STORYLINES AND PLOTS. CAN WE GET A SEASON 8?
0316067938|5.0|*Spoiler* though everyone should have read or seen the movie by now :)  I personally think this book could have been longer and split in two. I still think Stephanie Meyer had to put a lot into one book and probably left a lot out.  I get the imprinting thing as the author needing to figure out how to keep everyone a family.  Obviously she grew very fond of them all and how could she reconcile the wolf issues and the new vamp baby.  Imprinting seemed the most logical with the 'imprinting clause' built in. She also had developed these characters in the first three books and knew even more than us readers did what was most important to them.  As weird as it may seem and odd as it is to take in, I don't believe Stephanie Meyer had any weird intentions in doing it. She just wanted to keep her family together and she found a way.  I LOVE the movie by the way, I thought BD II was one of the best.  Some reviews get angry that it all works out in the end.  I think it is brilliant in this day and age that a book is written where verbal resolution and quick thinking and deliberate strategy are demonstrated to prevent violence.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Actually ended more food for thought than information. The information was the real dirt not some watered down version. Loved it! I'll be sending a copy to my niece. It is provoking as well as Fun.

B0093Q8W0C|3.0|I didn't have time to finish it. You shouldn't survey people that only watch five minutes of a movie<br /><br />Have more respect for people's time.<br /><br />The forced options of your survey are very tedious.  Please FIX your survey process or stop bothering people, AND stop nagging if they don't respond.  <<<Let's review>>><br /><br />1.  Only survey people that watch the ENTIRE film.<br />2.  Eliminate forced choices such as TOPIC and minimum words responses.<br />3.  Don't nag people that don't reply! Relax your process a little.<br /><br />Please confirm that you are implementing these recommendations.<br />YOU WILL HAVE HAPPIER RESPONDERS AND GET MORE RESPONSES!!!!!!!

0345803485|3.0|It took half the book before I could get into this. I am also not into s&m stuff so this book didn't thrill me, but by the end of the book I was left wanting to know where they would go from here... So, I'm waiting on the 2nd book and hoping its better.
B0087ITBPC|1.0|BARBARA IS FINE BUT THAT --------SO CALLED COMIC IS A TOLAL LOOSER. ANYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER<br />HE RUINED THE WHOLE MOVIE,
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|I bought the first set of these and they didn't work!  Amazon as usual was instantly responsive to take them back.  I ordered another set for my grand daughter and they didn't work either, just as others have said (but I didn't listen).  My daughter in law called Mattel and their customer service said that the base unit must be bad since all voices are the same!  They said they have NO SPARES to replace faulty components so just send everything back to them and they will give her a voucher for other Mattel products.  She has a lot of the components including the castle.  Unfortunately, the grand daughter has fallen in love with the figures and doesn't care that extra money was spent for Chinese technology (an oxymoron) that doesn't WORK!<br /><br />So my warning is to not buy unless you want to spend extra for the Chinese kid earning a bowl of rice to screw up the electronics in this piece of crap.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I EJOYED THIS MOVIE. TOM CRUISE CN ALWYS HOLD MY INTEREST' EVEN MY GRAND KIDS LIKED THE MOVIE.HE ISONE OF MY FAVORITES
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My kids love watching this movie.  We must have watched it everyday the 1st couple of weeks after receiving it.
B000002HHB|3.0|By the finale track, we hear a good mix...no metronomic, interloping, too-loud drumbeat....these songs are not for dancing...or are they?<br /><br />I consider Merchant a Poet-Stylist - her writing is compelling and her voice is often enchanting - though I wish she'd sing without lozenge lodged in her left molar. After 3 minutes or so, we wish she'd let out a primal scream, or do something. I think fans of Melanie Safka should get a used copy of this CD, as the sonic resemblance is interesting. Also, the album has some of the feel and atmosphere of Joni Mitchell's BLUE. This album can work for them, too!<br /><br />RIVER is a little long but works as a commemoration of River Pheonix; best tracks are THE LETTER (wish she titled it THIS LETTER); WHERE I GO and SEVEN YEARS.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|This is the second of the three Bourne movies.  It's equally as well done as the first movie and it's fun to watch.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Kate Morton is a favorite arthur of mine. This book was long and you have to read alot to get to the good stuff but well worth it once you get there.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the Bible App to have. The company is constantly adding new features. I have been using this for about 2 years and have use different Bible studies with its variety of choices. I especially enjoy an audio version of the ESV Bible. You can even have the company send you emails to remind you if you get off track.
1400052181|5.0|This is a very well-written book about a woman who contributed so much to medicine without even knowing it.  It was a compelling story that I had to finish reading.  It was very touching and emotional; especially the last few chapters that told about Henrietta's children and grandchildren.  It is a true story that I believe everyone should read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|love it
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|\\"After Earth\\" is a science fiction and adventure genre film starring Will Smith (Cypher Raige) and Jaden Smith (Kitai Raige). The real life father and son combination have some family chemistry onscreen and the story is set well in the future when Earth has been abandoned and the human race has inhabited other planets.<br /><br />The viewer is presented with some interesting scenes of a new world but the narrative is generally quite weak with a predictable sequence of events. At no point is the viewer truly challenged with any great suspense or dramatic turns/twists in the story. There are some anxious moments but the movie falls short with its basic plot of frustrated Ranger Cadet Kitai bonding with his distant and highly decorated Ranger father Cypher when they are marooned on planet Earth and Cypher is injured.<br /><br />Kitai braving the dangers of wild Earth so they can both be rescued has an opportunity to prove he is a worthy qualified Ranger and in doing so hopefully earning the respect and approval of his father, which is a likable facet of the narrative.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B00B89WXYS|5.0|If you love OneRepublic, this is a MUST HAVE!!!!  Waited three years for a new album but it was worth it!!  They are absolutely awesome!!  Ryan is sooo talented!!!<br />Update...just saw them in concert and met them with VIP meet and greet!!  They were all so nice!  The concert was surreal!  They sang over half of Native and previously released songs!  Native wont disappoint!!!  Can't wait for their next one....
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This bookcase was very enjoyable and adventure packed but did have moments in the book were I wanted to cry
B0084O8P9C|4.0|Loved watching the movie and enjoyed the music. Bought the cd to play in car during rush hour traffic. Music just relaxes me and makes the drive a lot more tolerable!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I really enjoyed Side Effects. Even after watching the trailer I still felt like there was a lot of \\"meat\\" left to the movie. The way that the movie is so intricately woven together making it difficult to write a review without spoiling the movie.<br /><br />After watching the movie I did look at other reviews to see what the reason was for only a mediocre rating. Many comments towards the lag or slowness in the movie caused reviewers to turn it off and I agree it tends to be slow moving in the beginning however it becomes more intellectually stimulating as the movie progresses and is worth the wait.<br /><br />From the cast I would expect nothing less then a great performance. Rooney, Tatum, Law, etc., lived up to my expectations and created a movie that I could immerse myself in, wanting to know what was next, and having the urge to work through the characters lives as a detective on a case.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who enjoy working through the plot as it unravels.
B009X01D9U|3.0|The indentations on the built in stand are not secure enough to keep the tablet firmly in place, it has a tendency to slip off.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I haven't gotten very far with the levels but each level has been lots of fun. You don't have to spend any money to get coins to get better vehicles just keep on playing the level and you get coins for your effort. What's so enjoyable is that your driver can get injured and it's not a real person getting hurt. The sound effects of a broken neck are especially neat to hear. I like the fact that the scenery and characters look more like cartoons than real people. G rated level violence :-)
B002NJWHHA|2.0|While the book was a typical journey-to-greatness kind of story, the movie is even less compelling. Special effects are so-so, and the acting is pretty bad, to say the least. Nothing really stood out for me. Would not watch this again. Would not recommend this to anyone else.

B008NIS2AG|5.0|I've had this collection for a little more than a week now and have barely begun to explore it's contents.<br /><br />What it is is a collection of Maurice Andre albums previously released by EMI, so some of the music I already have. Be aware that if you already have an extensive collection of Maurice Andre music this may not be the collection for you. For others, this collection is a rich exploration of much of the best music by the greatest classical trumpet player of all time. He brought a beauty and richness to his work that just needs to be heard to be understood. I look forward to the hours I will spend exploring this collection.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|...but not as good as the first two. What I found the least plausible was the idea that world figures of notoriety would be found in one Scottish Rite meeting for any honorary degree that is given all over the country every year. It gives far too much credit to the Scottish Rite as a far reaching Masonic body. It isn't and in the US alone there are three jurisdictions between the northern, southern and PHA.
B00A50PBEA|4.0|I am very surprised that this movie took soooooo long to make it over here in the States on home video... but... where's the bluray??  for a film that is gorgeously shot and features great singing (and music) - this should have been released on bluray, but no such luck.  Oh well.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|This is extremely well done with a lot of footage not seen before.<br />The seller met or exceeded my expectations as well in the delivery and I could not be happier.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|Ok, in all fairness, it's not like I expected it to be good, but it was my husbands turn to choose the movie, and so we watched it. It was even worse than I expected, and given that my expectations were low, that's pretty bad. I felt embarrased for all of the actors who were in it. It should be burned.

B006T3RM08|5.0|I looked at many different options for combining my Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad. The Henge Clique seemed to fit the bill, although I was a bit concerned about the reviewers who said that, once installed, the click function on the trackpad wouldn't work as well.<br /><br />I have not found this to be the case. The keyboard and trackpad installed, literally, in two snaps and the trackpad works just as well as it did sitting on my desktop. The low-profile Clique doesn't make a noticeable difference in typing on the keyboard, and I really like the convenience of having a single thing that I can move around my desktop or put aside when not using the computer.<br /><br />All in all, a very solid product.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I got this for my daughter who is 3, for when we went on a plane. It kept her entertained for most of the flight. But, you know how kids attention spans are short. I still recommend the game to everyone. 1 thing I would add, is a \\"tip\\" feature. One where if u can't figure out how to get something weither it be a gnome or a duck (where's my water), or the items on the spin off games; show you, if you want, how to get it.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|This game is not intuitive in any way. I read the instructions, which made no sense (English must be a second language) then tried again, to no avail. If you're looking for an easy game, this is not it.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|It gives you things to think about yourself and tools to handle the days.  It is good to read the book several times.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Had a great time playing this and still playing this. While most reviews here explain the game play I am just offer this advice. Get it. Yes, I gratefully found it as a FAotD but it would have been well worth the dollar or so for the enjoyment I have playing it.<br />It plays crisp and clean on my Wife's HTC Incredible 2 (she got hers on FAotD too). I use my copy on SG3 and a Nexus 7. I prefer the &quot;smaller&quot; screens because you can see more of the tiles at the same time with less looking around t st I do on my tablet.<br />A definite 5*.<br /><br />To the developers ; Thank you.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I will not lie, at the beginning I did not like this book. I thought it was slow to start, a bit confusing, and the time jumping was hard to get used to. But as it went on, I began to fall in love with the characters, the story line, the creativity, and the vision.<br /><br />This book delighted  my imagination, and kept me  guessing as to how it would all end.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars and would give it more if there were more available to give.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Really enjoyed how challenging but not impossible the puzzles were. But really disappointed at how short which is why I gave 3 stars.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This was brought as a gift, for my sister. Because she is a big fan of the series Columbo. Plus getting it as a comptele set was a great deal.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|So I am a huge fan of the original Evil Dead Trilogy, and I was a bit skeptical when it was announced that there was a \\"re-imagining\\" as it was called. However, I went into this movie with an open mind, and I was extremely impressed to say the least. The story follows David, Eric, Natalie, and Olivia as they go to a cabin in the woods to help Mia kick her drug addiction. They find the book of the dead and of course some idiot reads it, otherwise we would've had a very boring movie. Anyway, Mia becomes possessed, but it is easily played off as withdraws...until the others begin falling victim to the demon.<br />The story is actually believable, and the gore is absolutely delicious. The best performances in the entire movie were Lou Taylor Pucci (Eric) and Jane Levy (Mia) they just shone for some reason. (Poor Lou Taylor Pucci takes a serious beating, you'll see what I mean.)<br />I don't get the criticism comparing this to the original. I felt that way at first, but we have to remember that this ISN'T a remake, but it IS a re-imagining.<br />This movie gets 5 stars...cause it's....Groovy.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a great period movie with great actors, musical score and a fantastic ending for all you romantics out there!

141659521X|3.0|I'm a huge Vince Flynn fan, and have loved all of his previous Mitch Rapp character driven books, which I can't put down until I've finished the book.  However, &#34;The Last Man&#34; fell well short of my expectations, and, I dare say, well short of Mr. Flynn's usual, and expected, story telling.  To me, it didn't feel as though Mitch Rapp was the focus point, in this book, as he has been in all of Mr. Flynn's previous Mitch Rapp driven stories.  In fact, Mitch Rapp is removed from a portion of the book, as the novel revolves around other characters.  With such being the case, rather than reading, and sometimes re-reading, pages of Mr. Flynn's past books, because they are just that good, with &#34;The Last Man&#34;, I found myself only skimming, if not skipping, pages, until the story somewhat picked back up, and re-inserted Mitch Rapp, again.  I'd have to say that I felt like Mr. Flynn phoned this book in, and unlike his previous books, the ending to &#34;The Last Man&#34; was utterly forgettable.  If you are a first time reader of Mr. Flynn's work, this is not the book to start with.  If you're a fan of Mr. Flynn's work, as I am, though I'm sure that may seem hard to believe, based on this review, I would still recommend this book, only because it does introduce a story line, involving one of the supporting characters, which will effect Mitch, and those in his inner circle, in future stories.
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|Capital Cities' debut album is full of awesome dance beats, and I am surprised I am saying this but, awesome synthesized beats. It has a very upbeat, feel, everything you love about 80's British pop and today's dance beats is very effectively interwoven in their songs. If you want to let looses dancing and partying, this is the next album you should buy.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|One of the very, very few movies I look forward to viewing again and again.  The fact that it's a true story makes it even more compelling.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Great movie, as probably you all know. I was actually looking to buy it, but then decided I couldn't wait and wanted to go ahead and watch it. This Amazon instant streaming thing is pretty cool.
B00CFA225Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and wanted to start off by saying that the 3D version is the way to go with this movie and I will go into a little more detail on the 3D later, but first the story.<br /><br />This movie is a re-imagining of Jack and the Beanstalk. Jack, played by Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies, X-Men: First Class), who grows up listening to the story of Giants that live on a land in the sky and come down to earth by beanstalks that grow from magic beans, and have a hunger for humans. Erik the king makes a crown from the heart of a giant, and whoever has the crown has the power over the giants. With the use of the crown king Erik sends the giants back to the land and the sky and chops down the beanstalk so they cannot return. Upon king Erik's death the crown and magic beans are buried with him, or so the story goes.<br /><br />The movie then picks up with Jack now 18 and living with his uncle, played by Christopher Fairbank (The Fifth Element, Batman), due to both his parents being deceased. When Jack's uncle sends him to town to sell a horse and cart he meets and saves the princess Isabelle, played by Eleanor Tomlinson (Alice in Wonderland). While trying to sell his horse after saving the princess and having his cart stolen, he runs into a monk, whose has stolen the beans and is being sought after by the kings most trusted adviser Roderick, played by Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games, Captain America: The First Avenger). In exchange for the horse the monk gives Jack the magic beans. When Jack returns home with the beans and no money his uncle becomes upset with Jack and spills the beans on the floor. One bean falls in a crack in the floorboard. Later that night a bad storm hits, and well I guess you know what happens when the bean gets wet and this is where the movie really starts to take off.<br /><br />The cast did a terrific job and, there are alot of good actors, besides the ones I mentioned above. Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episode 2&3) plays Elmont, Bill Nighy (Underworld) plays General Fallon, Ian McShane (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides) plays the king, and the list goes on. They did a wonderful job casting this movie.<br /><br />The visuals were really well done also. The landscapes looked really vast and beautiful. The land in the sky was really awesome and I loved the waterfall. The giants are really well detailed, right down to the hair on their noses. I also like the POV shots from the giants perspective, it really gives you a since of how tall the giants are.<br /><br />The 3D was really well done and like I mentioned earlier, it is definitely the way to watch this movie. The depth is nicely done and adds alot to the film, especially in the POV shots I talked about above from the giants perspective and also with the landscapes. There are also some nice pop outs here and there, mostly flying debris, but it all helps to just immerse you into the movie.<br /><br />Overall this movie was a great experience and should definitely be recommended. If you have a 3D setup you have to watch it in 3D, I just can't stress that enough. If you don't have a 3D setup this movie is still worth checking out. If you enjoyed Lord of the Rings you will definitely enjoy this, because it has a Lord of the Rings feel to it, with the story and the vast landscapes. Anyway be sure to check this one out, you won't be disappointed!Nighy (Underworld) plays General Fallon, Ian McShane (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides) plays the king, and the list goes on.

I'm telling you, this album is timeless and will go down in history as one of the greatest albums ever!

B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|One star only because there is no \\"zero stars\\". The album is very bad, the music is very dis-tonic and robotic. There seems to be no coherence of music style in the same track let alone across the whole album. This seems to be a new style for West and it's an EPIC FAIL!

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Django Unchained has been a controversial movie, but then it is dealing with a controversial subject and it isn't holding back. For the sake of this review, I will ignore the controversies, though suffice it to say it is dealing with subject matter (slavery) many would prefer to not be reminded of. In telling its story there are many instances where some might perceive racism or racist sentiments. If you feel that this is something you might not want to deal with (or gory violence) this is probably not the movie for you.<br /><br />What makes this movie so fascinating to watch is that it has a strong message, it doesn't hold back (it may well not go far enough, but within the scope of the movie I'd argue it goes the distance) in conveying the horrors that was slavery. Still, whilst it has that strong message, the movie is not really a movie about slavery, rather it is a revenge film, with some elements of a heist/con, all whilst trying to robe it self in the clothes of a Spaghetti Western.<br /><br />But it is so much more, there is a meta narrative completely detached from the events, that is entirely focused on direction and effects. This isn't about violence, though naturally it applies to everything in the movie. The camera angles, the color saturation, the set design and scene setups are all copied from other films, and generally the genre of old (though color) Westerns. And the some of the blood splatter, that goes back even further, to Japanese Samurai films which were the inspiration for the Spaghetti Westerns. It's almost like watching [[ASIN:B005BZQVJ8 Paul]] and noting how movie quotes from sci-fi films are re-used both ironically as well as straight faced. And here is the thing: Tarantino pulls it off. The movie looks and feels right, and more honest than any Western before it, precisely because most Westerns were being idyllic even as they discussed crime, by glossing over what those times were probably like. So big props for style, substance and story.<br /><br />The acting is superb, and really this should not be a surprise. None of the major roles are portrayed by unknowns, but instead fantastic actors. Christoph Waltz was brilliant and unnerving in Inglorious Basterds; Jamie Foxx with the right role is always great, and he is right for this role. Not in a typecast sort of way, but precisely because it isn't and he pulls it off unwaveringly and with conviction. DiCaprio is stellar though arguably this is the weakest character because you could believe he is just being himself. I don't mean DiCaprio is the kind of guy that would do what his character does, rather that his character just is so oblivious of his own nature, and it is incredible how well DiCaprio brings it to life. And finally, Samuel L Jackson ... when is he not doing a stellar job, but being such a vindictive and backstabbing bastard, with that much costume ... I didn't initially pick that it was Jackson. Again, fantastic performances all around.<br /><br />So, is this movie really this perfect? No of course not, because firstly there are language, setting and style issues. This is a movie made in 2012 (or whatever) imitating something 50 years older, but at the same time it isn't trying to imitate the product, rather the style and time those movies were imitating. Think of this as being a \\"retro\\" style movie, with modern language and some technologies, and probably attitudes. This isn't a docu-drama, this is a Tarantino film, and it has many of the hallmarks, especially in language, interesting use of techniques and Samuel L Jackson swearing. But if you accept that he set out to make roughly what you made, you will see that he made exactly what he aimed for. All those things you might note and think \\"that's not right\\" are probably there very intentionally.<br /><br />The subject of this movie is a sensitive one and it should not be made light off. Still, it is treated well, and with respect. The film is definitely one of Tarantino's best (thoughwhich movies was not great).which movies was not great).

I noticed on the video the lady had some problem also. but she used a candle instead of the hot water bath. All I can say is patience
B00127RAJY|5.0|I didn't need to lose 30lbs, but wanted to get into shape, tone, and help my shorts fit again! I also don't have the time for long workouts nor the attention span. So I decided to try 30 day shred. Jillian kicked my butt! With three short circuits of strength, cardio, and abs to help the body. When I started out I got easily winded, and my wrist was weak because I hadn't been using it for a month because I had was having problems (later found out I had cysts). The weights was one of the reasons I wanted to use the DVD to strength my bad hand. Weight isn't main goal, but to get healthy. Building muscles is part of that, it takes more then being a skinny minnie. My endurance was improving and you really do see results quickly (if you do it everyday, and eat decent). Jillian is a good motivator, she laughs, she warns you what not to do so you don't hurt yourself. Will be checking out other videos :)

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Nothing more, nothing less. Ordered it to replace my Kindle cable. Charges my kindle and sits there waiting to be used again. :)
B006M4RN3U|5.0|My only problem with this music is that it is so infectious that I am listening to it too much and may burn myself out on it. Of course,  I've been listening to Bruce Springsteen since 1976.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|This movie was creepy cool.  There's a place in the last third where you think it's over....stop there! It gets stupid,  unbelievable sci-fi-ish and leaves loose ends.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars til you get to the 1* end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a challenging game that is entertaining and fun to play. The background music is nice and the puzzles are thoughtful.
