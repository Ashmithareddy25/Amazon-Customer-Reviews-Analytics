B003YL4LYI|1.0|I love books 1-4 I couldnt put them down. But have to say that this last book looks like was written by another author or Martin was tired to write.<br />I'm really disapointed !! Compared to the other books its overpriced by the quality that we find inside.<br />If there is more books I'm not sure that I'll buy them.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Easy read, filled with drama, choices of love, a young girl's passion for her family, and a lot of fight against the majority law.
0761944524|5.0|This book is very helpful and easy to read. It even has a little humor in it to make stats a little bit tolerable.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have enjoyed this weather app more than the other that I tried.  It seems to be very accurate, with updates that are frequent.  I love the map in motion which is very handy to keep a watch out for any inclement weather that might arrive.
B002ZCY7SW|3.0|I gave this season 3 stars(instead of 2) because they redeemed themselves with a good ending. But overall, this season wasn't really that great. And I'm a huge 24 fan. Bauer wasn't really his normal self throughout the season. President Taylor, after refusing to cover-up a murder that her own daughter was responsible for in Season 7, she has one conversation with that schlep ex-President Logan, and suddenly she's persuaded to cover up the murder of a President of another country, along with several federal agents, and Renee Walker? Yeah whatever, like that's believable. And the whole nuclear bomb thing, like the terrorists would've really turned it over to the authorities. This season wasn't nearly as intense as the others, and it lacked that whole plot-twisting, edge-of-your-seat experience the other seasons had. And when the plot did twist, it just wasn't that dramatic. Something was definitely missing from this season. I think the writers ran out of ideas.
1565114582|5.0|Very sound and wise advise for some of very complicated issues. My issue was sleeping and it gave step by step instructions of how to get child accustomed to his room and his bed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because it was on the Best Seller List and I felt if the author could create a trilogy, there must be a serious story line.  How mistaken I was!  I am only one fourth of the way through this book and will just erase it from my kindle unfinished.  Besides the stupid porn that was the main theme, the prose and people within the story were utterly disappointing.  It felt like a teen wrote the thing hoping to gear up some reputation for the exotic sex she wishes for.  How can intelligent authors write such drivel?  In the future, I will certainly delve more deeply into the contents of a book rather than assume if it is a \\"best seller\\" the author must have at least some literary talent!  Amazon needs to create a category for such sexual explicit books.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|the game was fun and addictive but after updating lost all my coins and game is frozen.  i have probably spent $30 so far on it.  You cant contact GLU.  they don't answer the phone or return emails.  great company if you like giving them your hard earned money for bad services.
B000001DWG|5.0|I had this album on vinyl back in the day. How I didn't duplicate it on cassette or CD when they came out is a real mystery to me.(Yeah, I'm old) I heard one of the songs on XM the other day and remembered how great this band was. Bought the CD immediately. Awesome and just like I remembered it! Dont mess around buying individual songs, the whole CD is great.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Excellent beginning!  This is always the first of a list of  books I recommend to friends and family when life gets tough and they're looking for a change and/or to feel better!  It's a quick read with a great message that can be followed up with some hard science in Bruce Lipton's books (The Biology of Belief & Spontaneous Evolution-audio).  Even the previously close-minded can then embrace the ideas and suggestions of Dr. Wayne Dyer and Deepak Chopra, taking us all one step closer to more peaceful and happier human existence (as a whole) and further away from the \\"dream of hell\\" that The Four Agreements suggests that so many of us are experiencing.  My suggestion: Read the Four Agreements, then The Biology of Belief, then The Mastery of Love, then listen to Spontaneous Evolution, and finish up with any of Dr. Dyer's more recent books but especially The Power of Intention.  Do this and it WILL change your life!
B001EAWMGA|5.0|This movie is a great sci-fi film. It brings together, sword fighting, Space travel, and gruesome monsters. I say that this is a sleeper hit.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|When I watched this movie, I was so thrilled by it's cinematoghaphy, humor, and suspense, I left the theater mouth wide open in aw. Before you watch this movie you should first watch: The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man 2. I don't know if the instant video will have it but be sure to watch the credits through for this movie and the other avenger movies.^

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I feel that Fiona Apple is the Laura Nyro of today. Why? She could very well fall back on her pop chops but instead follows her own artistic vision and puts out the record that she wants on her terms. Yes, it takes a few listens to fully appreciate the dark, seething and sometimes funky and jazzy sounds that emanate, but when you do, you'll be rewarded. My favorite songs are Every Single Night, Werewolf, Regret, Anything We Want and Hot Knife. Enjoy!
B007SGM084|5.0|OMG.  I purchased this upon my girlfriends suggestions. Let me say, it has been a really long time since I have been able to become so involved in a great read.  I have a really hard time putting it down at night.  I say night, because there is less chance of interruptions. I find myself actually speaking to the characters. LOL. I know when I get to the end, I will really miss Ana and Christian. One of my girls is reading it for the 3rd time!! Bottom line, it is a great read.

B003PAXONC|5.0|Just received the boxed 'I am Legend Ultimate Collector's Edition'. The set looks real nice, it's well thought out and done. Took less than a week to get from NJ to San Diego, in it's factory sealed packaging.<br /><br />I enjoyed this in the theater and have seen it a few times (DVD), I'm looking forward to seeing it in Blu-Ray and the Alternative Version (second of the three disks).
0345803507|4.0|There were parts of this series I enjoyed and others I could have lived without. Some of the scenes seemed redundant at times. There are only so many ways you can read the same conversation without it grating on your nerves after a while. This was a long series, and while I'm glad I read it, I'm not sorry to say farewell to Anna and Christian. While I saw a lot of growth in his character, I can't really say the same about hers. I feel that he overcame alot of issues, but she still seemed like the same naive girl she was at the start of their relationship, which dissapointed me.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|With all the ho ha about this book in the media, I was expecting a far better read. I like a book to have a believable story. I found it hard to believe that a 22 year old uni student would not have her own computer & email address, & in this day and age could be so naive. As for Christian Grey, he needs to find another shrink. Mills and Boon on Steriods, & with as much depth.

B0064BWDRW|5.0|Damn - is this really the end of Harry Hole.  The book is presented as the last with the great harry Hole charachter, but surely not Jo Nesbo, surely not.  This book needs to be read by those that understand the relationships that Harry Hole has with Rakel and Oleg, and the police force he once worked for.  It is a another great book and the story and plot is think with mystery and intrigue, pretty much until the last chapter.  Really enjoyed it and now a bit lost and looking for the next author to get into.
B000066C6Z|5.0|in this movie Val Kilmer is a singer and an ambassador for the U.S.A.  if you loved airplanes then no doubt you will love this movie.  Val and friends in the movie get in a fake cow to get through easy but a bull humps them.  watch this you will not be upset at all.  just like a Mel Brooks film.

B00006B1HH|5.0|not many special features on this DVD.  the feature is the trailer basically.  same classical songs.  this is one of the best high school movies ever made.  the movie is about life in the 50's as a high school student.

B005V20JKI|1.0|As of this writing, Google's Play Store has Muffin Knight version 1.7 available for download. The version you get from Amazon is version 1.4.1, which is more than a year old, and doesn't contain the multiplayer update (among other things). This old version of the game will never receive updates, but is discounted to $0.99. The newer version, which adds many great features and will receive updates, is $2.99 on Google Play.<br /><br />The biggest addition made after 1.4.1 was local multiplayer. If you can live without that, save your money and get this version. If you want to have multiplayer (and continuous updates), you're going to have to purchase the game from Google Play.<br /><br />UPDATE: This game is now $0.99 on Google Play. I wouldn't bother getting this old version.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This entire trilogy was memorable and powerful. I am glad that it received so much attention but I have to say that I feel that the majority of the readers are not getting the weight of the subject matter discussed. Many of my friends love the first book and by the end of the series are no longer happy readers. Personally I feel that the author sticks with her purpose of showing war and violence to be as horrible as they are. If these books were to end in fairytale fashion they would not be nearly as worthy as they are. Read them! They are griping, moving, and truly great stories.

B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. The opening chapters of Jack London's \\"White Fang\\" are one of my favorite piece of literature, and the \\"man versus Wolf\\" set up, with the wolves representing wilderness, seemed really promising. However, this movie has just too many holes in it.<br />The basic premise makes no sense. Here we have a sizable aircraft with dozens of passengers crashing on a known route of flight out on an open plain. There is absolutely no reason for the assumption that they will not be found very soon.<br />Second, even if they were far off the planned route, leaving the relative protection and resources of the aircraft wreckage in order to be floundering through the snow doesn't seem a very smart choice.<br />Next, Liam Neeson's character makes a big deal of standing firm and facing down the wolves, but then several times changes the strategy to: \\"RUN!!!\\"<br />Those are just a few samples. I'll move on to the general weaknesses of the movie.<br />First, while the acting itself is good, Liam Neeson plays, well, basically Liam Neeson, and none of the other characters give us any particular reason to care about them.<br />Second, the utter predictability of the storyline. The characters die one by one, and did anybody seriously expect the finale to be anything but a confrontation between Neeson and the alpha wolf? And to add insult to injury, the audience is even cheated out of that.<br />Finally, the wolves. The production uses some footage of real wolves, but mostly they're a combination of really bad special effects and pretty amateurish CGI. For example, when we first see the whole pack through the reflection of their eyes outside the fire circle, they basically look like a bunch of production assistants holding pairs of LED lights (which is probably what they were) The alpha wolf in the final scene looks more like the black smoke from LOST than a wolf. I mean, the producers of \\"The Ghost and the Darkness\\" were able to manage fully grown lions ina credible way, and here they can't get the wolves right?<br />So overall, a movie with a lot of promise was botched.

B006T5G73Y|2.0|I love Clint Eastwood but am terribly disappointed in him for this effort. This had the feel of an Olliver Stone movie...and no..that is not a good thing. Too many unverified rumors and conspiracy theories passed off as being factual for my taste. DiCaprio isn't bad and the movie is still better than most of the crap Hollywood puts out but it falls far short of the mark Clint set with Unforgiven, Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby.

0553573403|5.0|As warden of the north, Lord Eddard Stark counts it a curse when King Robert bestows on him the office of the Hand. His honor weighs him down at court where a true man does what he will, not what he must ... and a dead enemy is a thing of beauty. The old gods have no power in the south, Stark's family is split and there is treachery at court. Worse, a vengeance mad boy has grown to maturity in exile in the Free Cities beyond the sea. Heir of the mad Dragon King deposed by Robert, he claims the Iron Throne.<br />Martin's epic fantasy series, `A Song of Ice and Fire,' has managed to - in both scope and creativity, not to mention simple writing ability - capture and recreate the story that started in Martin's head. Some authors try, and fail miserably. Some capture and recreate perfectly, but the author's scope is minimal. For Martin though, in scope, creativity, and writing ability, A Song of Ice and Fire is everything you want in an epic fantasy tale.<br />The first book, `A Game of Thrones,' was first released in 1996, and since then another four books have been released. Set in a world very akin to our own medieval history, specifically the English War of the Roses, A Game of Thrones introduces us to one of the greatest (and largest) character lists around.<br />The story is told from eight perspectives. Each perspective is held within a chapter which, when the characters move away from each other, allows the author to continually leave minor cliff-hangers at the end of each chapter. While six of the characters from this first book are from the same family, the perspective is shifted around in preceding books. Death is commonplace, almost to the point of horror, but conducted in such a way that it, sadly, reminds us of our own bloody histories. Martin does not shy away from the death, rape and plunder that would have been norm for the setting and in doing so provides a much more complete story.<br />Mindless destruction is often the cause for character splits and confrontations, and by the end of the book characters you assumed you would be attached too for some time are left headless, gutless or simply gone.<br />Throughout the entire series Martin focuses almost primarily upon one continent. However there is one character, Daenerys Targaryen, who has been forced to flee to a separate continent as a young girl. At first I remember feeling disorientated and a little slighted at seemingly being provided this perspective, which seemed nothing short of pointless. However as I have continued to read, she has become one of my favorite characters.<br />`A Game of Thrones' is without a doubt one of the most involved and simultaneously enjoyable books I have ever read. Dense to the point of labor, but captivating well past my bedtime, Martin knows exactly where to draw the line between lots of information and tedious boredom.<br />The novel, A Game of Thrones, begins with an encounter with supernatural beings; this may give a false impression as to what will come. As the story begins to unfold, the theme moves strongly into the area of political intrigue and this forthcoming war that will happen as a result. The fantasy element, while always there plays only a minor role in the majority of the rest of the book.<br />A Game of Thrones in not your usual fare, it is hard-hitting and bad things do happen to the good people. Two families take centre stage in a battle for the Throne; the Starks and the Lannisters. The Stark family live in the cold hard North, Winterfell is the seat of their domain. We are, using chapters headlined with the family names, introduced to the Stark family.<br />Once we have familiarized ourselves with the Stark's, King Robert and his family visit them at Winterfell. King Robert is married to a Lannister, Queen Cersei. The King's main reason for visiting is to offer Eddard Stark the honor of becoming his Hand (most trusted advisor). Eddard unhappily accepts and he must move to King's Landing in the South.<br />Eddard Stark's young son Bran is injured during the King's visit, whilst this is originally thought to be an accident that occurred when he was climbing it becomes apparent that the Lannisters played a part in this tragedy.<br />In an interesting sub-plot Jon Snow, Eddard's bastard son, joins the \\"Black\\" or the \\"Night's Watch\\", a company of men who's role is to guard a huge wall of ice in the far North. Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf, accompanies him there. Although they do not become friends they end up with a grudging respect for each other. Once Jon has pledged himself to the \\"Black\\" he must forsake friends, family, marriage and children and his whole life will be spent in the protection of Land.<br />With Eddard now in place as the King's Hand, tensions rise between himself and the Lannisters. Then, suddenly one day, the King is killed hunting wild boar and Eddard and the Lannister are drawn into a battle for the throne.<br />Finally, at the end, the fantasy element once again returns and we are left looking forward to the second installment. This is a very good novel, full of twists and turns. It leaves you wanting more and moves on to A Clash of Kings.<br /><br />Martin, G. (1996). A Game of Thrones.

B004SEUJX2|4.0|I keep my review pointed at the packaging and DVD itself.  There's plenty regarding subject and stars.<br /><br />I like the digibook packaging for the same reason I like albums notes on their covers and liners, their usually full of fun facts.  This one is a little dry on those and it's a bit on the cheap side when you look at the binding and paper.<br /><br />The DVD itself needs work.  I believe this film won awards for the photography.  It didn't come through the transfer.  From what I've read it's because of the source material or $$$.  That's one reason why Criterion costs so much.  They concentrate on the transfer.<br /><br />Now that said I did pick this up on sale and I've watched it a few times already.  Looking forward to 4K resolution in the not too distant future.
B0084P9202|2.0|First off, I have all of the previous Sigur Ros albums in my collection.  In each album, I could find at least 3-4 songs that I can lose myself in.  Sigur Ros is an amazing band, with the ability to touch listeners on a deeper level.  However, this album is \\"yawn\\" worthy.  Nothing to it.  I'm disappointed, and I know if other fans were truly honest with themselves, they would say the same.  With that said, it's currently at a decent price (I think five or six bucks), and it may be worth the purchase.  Don't say that I didn't warn you about the average-below average experience you will have.

0756404738|3.0|I Loved the first book, and this book was a very wonderful romp through the interesting world of Kvothe. However, my opinion of the book soured during and after Kvothes trip to the Fae.<br /><br />If you read the first book enjoying the story of a rather remarkable but human individual, and the \\"Reality behind the legend\\" feel of his exploits, you will be sorely disappointed here. I loved the \\"behind the scenes\\" feel of the first book. You get to see the birth of a legend, both by accident, and by the protagonists clever rumor spreading. While Kvothe was an extremely talented individual, he isn't as godlike as his legends portray him to be.<br /><br />After the Fae incident however, he suddenly has become the legend he was making himself out to be. That is fine for some readers, but for myself, and toward anyone agreeing with my review, it is a problem. I don't want my relatable character to be superman, I want him to be human. I want him to be clever or lucky in the face of his disadvantages and fall on his face when he is not. Alas, it is not meant to be, and Kvothe IS now apparently the legend people described him to be; and we can only see him becoming MORE  fantastically legendary as we progress.<br /><br />This is a problem for me not only because it makes the main character less relatable due to the fact that nobody is superman; but also because a superhuman character is able to free himself from any overly tense situation. A human protagonist is in trouble, and we suddenly move to the edge of our seats as to how he will survive. *spoiler* Now that Kvothe has a deus ex machina ability that can even overpower Fae creatures, we know that should the writer write him into a particularly tense situation, he can just \\"Superman\\" his way out of it. *end spoiler*<br /><br />There are a few other flaws with the book, masterfully listed by other reviewers on this website, Things like poor pacing and character development; but I wanted to cover my own problem with the book, and give a warning toward anyone who was enjoying the series for the same reasons.<br />Otherwise the book was rather enjoyable, the writer continues to deliver beautiful prose that is almost song-like. And much of the book portrays Kvothe as the \\"Truth behind the legend\\" type. It is in a much later part of the book that its problems begin to outweigh its triumphs. (after the Fae scene)
B007SGM084|1.0|This series is so repetitive and predictable, there's rarely anything other than eat, sleep, sex, \\"I'm sorry, don't be mad at me\\".  Boring is the best word to describe this series.  I thought that they may get better as the series progressed, but it's the same repetitive nonsense for the entire 3 books.  I knew this was a dominant/submissive story, but it's so much more demeaning than that.  Grey is a control freak and she is a wimp.  It makes women look ridiculous.  I didn't like it.  I won't recommend it, in fact I have told people that inquired, not to bother.  I don't see what all the hoopla and hype is about. Probably the absolute worst piece of literature I have ever read.  Should have stopped at page 3.<br />'
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Writing was just ok. Nothing that great.  The main point of dislike is how Grey is not a true dom.  He is a bit weak for that role.  I think this was written for the mid 20 somthing age.  Not for a mature reader.  I was  dis-appointed that it was given so much hype in the media.<br />At this point I am not going to spend the money for the other two.
B00701L5XS|5.0|this app is awesome. I always had trouble making knotsand I like fishing so it was a problem. but this app has taught me a lot of them. the playback option that lets you grab and end and slowly pull and see its the best learning method I've seen.
030758836X|4.0|Awesome book. Not that I needed a reminder, but some people are truly crazy. This book reminds you of that fact.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game. I play everyday. graphics are great. very challenging. I would recommend to anyone who likes to play manning. one of the best out there
0385342063|3.0|This book was lighthearted and well-written, as is usual for Sophie Kinsella. However, the characters were very unengaging, the plot line was thin and predictable and the content of it was a snoozer.
030758836X|5.0|I loved reading this book.  Flynn has an ingenious way of bringing the husband and wife to the reader in the first voice.  Don't get too hung up on the cursing or start hating any of the characters.  This reminds me of black comedy especially when Nick wants to kill.  Hysterical!  I am looking foward to her other reads and enjoying them as well.  Have fun and enjoy!
B00637HXNG|5.0|Unbeleivable seeing this on 3D. Its the nearest to being at the live concert. A must have for all SCORPIONS fans.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|I was looking for a casual Seiko sports watch(preferably a dive watch), and this watch is exactly what I wanted. Case is nice and thick and a 42 mm face make this watch perfect for me. My first Seiko dive watch is 24 years old and still kicking so hopefully I'll get good time with this one!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Great collection of songs. Garth at his very best. This is one of the the family's favourite. A must have for all country music fans
0425263908|3.0|I liked this book ok.  I will probably go ahead & read the sequel when it comes out.  However, I read the 50 Shades of Grey series, and I liked that one far better than this one.  The love scenes were hot, but the story line didn't captivate me as much as he 50 Shades of Grey series did.  When I read 50 Shades of Grey, I wanted to read the sequels immediately.  I couldn't put them down.  However, with Bared To You, it's not driving me crazy to see the next sequel immediately.  But again, I will probably read it when it comes out just to see what happens with the storyline.
B005LMEB8E|5.0|I think this album is Demi's best one yet. Each song has a different vibe and music style to it, and it really showcases the versatility of her powerful voice.<br /><br />There are fun dance tracks and beautiful ballads. Upon first listening to her dance tracks (All Night Long, Who's that Boy, and You're My Only Shorty) I really didn't like it because it didn't sound like this genre suits her and the featured artists didn't really contribute much to the songs. But I went to see her in concert and after seeing the energy and passion she puts into every song, it changed my mind and I love the songs now.<br /><br />Together featuring Jason Derulo, sounds great but I'm not too fond of the lack of depth in his lyrics.<br /><br />My favorites are Fix a Heart (so beautiful and you can relate to her pain), Lightweight, Skyscraper, Give Your Heart a Break, Unbroken (so good!), Hold Up (so catchy!), In Real Life (has a vibe similar to her Here We Go Again album), and My Love is Like a Star (has a sultry R&B feel).<br /><br />Definitely get this album! Demi has been through a lot in the past year and this intimate album really shows her progression and I can really relate to her. This is the first album that I have bought in its entirety and its the best to try to sing along to!
B005IQZB14|2.0|It wasn't very \\"wild\\".  The same chapter over and over.<br />It was ok for the price but it was pretty boring at times.  Iwishshe wrote more about the struggle.  Not just \\"yeah I did ____ & ____ but now I don't and I am now ok\\". I don't think addiction works that easily..
B008K8U13K|1.0|i spent $4 for this app an it doesnt even work....cruz tablet t410. i want my money back i really wanted to play it.
B005VPRGB0|4.0|Hey guys It's Cheeseball Mc.Silly again reviewing another lego let me just say that if I could give this 4 and a half stars I would because it's great fun to play with but on mine when you push it the entire engine rattles like it's going to fall out. But thats no big deal it's still got independent wheel suspension great styling and handlebar steering.The price is excellent for what you get. Thats pretty much all you could ask for in a lego so yeah.<br />  This is Cheeseball Mc.Silly Signing Out
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots and lots of games I actually thought this game was going to be wack but proved me wrong tight.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard this book was a best-seller so I popped it into my grocery cart while shopping.  After reading the first few chapters I thought perhaps I bought the wrong book because there's no way this book could be a best-seller. The book I was reading was repetitive, juvenile and full of cliché's.  I double checked the title and author and confirmed it was indeed Fifty Shades of Grey by EL James.  I feel sad for the intellectual standard of the human race if a book of this poor literary quality can be rated so highly.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|I have been a fan of Chris Robinson and the Crowes sine I saw them in '93, when I was in high school. This album has the more ethereal sound of his other solo projects and is the most Dead-like of them all. It comes across well, and not like a rip-off, as he has been spending time with Bobby and is clearly inspired. I'd recommend it.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this was the best mobile game ive ever had I like that you get to free roam and there is good action I don't like how much memory it takes up or the graphics but its worth 7$
0345529057|3.0|Product came in pristine condition.  Books 1 and 3 the best.  Book 4 has too many characters and battles to follow easily. However, easier to follow reading each book in succession.  Looking forward to finding out what happens in Book 5!
055357342X|5.0|It is so excellently done! Martin includes some absolutely shocking surprises and twists to his plot here - I can't wait to see what the next books have in store for these wonderful characters. He has really done a good job of balancing his vast and varied cast - often in epic fantasy novels, only one or two characters are ones that I really connect with, but here each storyline is one that I am eagerly wondering where it will go! I do have a few favorites, but each thread in this plot is exciting and his penchant for making some genuinely startling shifts in the plot keeps you on your toes and flipping the pages as fast as possible. I can't wait to read the next book! I am glad that I waited to read this series, because I can't imagine facing a long wait for the next one to be published - though after the fifth one, I know that is what is in store for me, unfortunately....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Get this app, it is great, it is easy to find what page you are looking for and everybody needs to read the Bible
0553579908|5.0|After finishing the first season on HBO, I knew that I just couldn't wait for the second season to begin to find out what would happen to all of these new favorite characters of mine! So, I read the first book, and began this one. It picks up right where the first book leaves off and I had fun relaying what he might expect to happen in the second season. Some new characters are introduced, and while initially, I just wanted the focus to remain on the Lannisters and Starks, the Onion Knight in particular managed to hook me in his storyline. I am anxiously looking forward to starting the third book in the series, and am hoping that the second season of the show aligns as closely as the first season!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am glad that they finally made this game for kindle fire, anybody that doesn't have this app, u need to get it!
0553801503|3.0|I opened this book after several warning from friends and reviews that it didn't hold up to the previous three books in this wonderful series. And, even though I expected it, I was still disappointed after finishing it. I guess my real problem with it lies more at the hands of Martin's editors than the writer himself. Though there is a note explaining that this is just one half of the story, by dividing it geographically we lost that more epic and cohesive feel. The absence of so many characters - like Jon Snow, Tyrion, Daenerys really made a gaping hole in the novel. And I have the fifth one all set to read - I can't imagine what it was like for those fans who waited five years for this book and five years for [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5)]]!<br /><br />The action did not really start for quite a while in this one as well... it just felt surprisingly slow, and every single page of its hefty weight. And though the writing was as strong as ever, this is the first time that I actually found myself anxiously counting pages until one section was over. I hadn't been expecting a standalone novel - you simply can't in an epic fantasy series, but I did expect this to feel a bit more like an actual book and not just a placeholder until more interesting things happen in the series. For the amount of pages in this book, it just didn't feel like the series progressed very fall at all.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the 3 book series.  I normally do not read but have really gotten sucked into to some really good books.  The whole series was great and now I can not wait till August to see the movie.  I am sure the movie will never live up to the book but I am sure it will be good too.
0743298020|4.0|This book had been sitting on my shelves long enough that when I finally picked it up again, I had completely forgotten the premise. So, when I started reading it, I really had no idea what to expect. And the beginning pages of the book with Margaret's deep love and passion for books immediately ensnared me. The strength of this affection for the written and printed word throughout the entire novel really gave this book the feel of being a novel tailor-made for book-lovers. And though Setterfield emphasized 19th century English literature, all book-lovers will undoubtedly see reflections in Margaret and the other characters in sharing this passion for novels.<br /><br />I really had not expected this book to be a story about twins, so I was quite pleasantly surprised (thanks to be my deep and abiding passion for Sweet Valley) that it turned out to be a twin story and I know that this definitely deepened my overall enjoyment of the novel. The layers of the book (there are stories-within-stories here), and particularly the interior layers, turned out to be more fascinating than the original outer frame which at first so intrigued me. Miss Winters' story was more developed and far more interesting than just Margaret's.<br /><br />The hints of incest and the overtones of violence darkened the novel, and upon turning the last page, I was completely satisfied with the book. However, that night, holes in the plot quickly became apparent and the entire novel began to really bother me as nagging points gnawed at me as I tossed and turned. So, I did enjoy the book - I just wish that I hadn't started to overthink it, because there are some very big holes that are revealed at the end of the story. They may not seem apparent at first, but once you start thinking about them, it's hard to remember anything else of the book!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't have an interest in reading Hunger Games, but I do have an interest in conversing with my grandchildren. Once I started reading I couldn't stop. Now ready for book 2.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|While this fifth installment in the A Song of Ice and Fire series is stronger than its most recent predecessor, it still doesn't match the excitement and overall strength of any of the three earlier volumes in the series. The beginning of the novel was clearly the other half of a [[ASIN:0553582038 A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)]], which gave the whole book a slightly skewed and convoluted chronology. Once the two plot lines caught up in chronology - and the story moved forward from there - it started to feel more like a real book and not an oddly jumbled rough draft. It still ended quite abruptly, and the prospect of having to wait potentially five years until the sixth book is published is downright depressing... But, hopefully the wait won't be as long as the previous two waits!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is one of the best apps in the universe. It is smooth fast and fun. This game is very well put together. Huge props to fallen tree games
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Oh please someone out there give us a good hidden object game!  I keep looking for a good one, so far it's twisted land and hidden mysteries of the amazon-while I'm still stuck or frozen on chapter 20, I will still play this one.  I guess I'm spoiled by these, I have to have hints and be able to zoom & pinch. A story line I need as well, I'm still searching, maybe Special inquiry-the hand that feeds will do for now.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I have owned every album that linkin park released and am very happy with this most recent album. the easiest way to describe the music is it seems like about 75% old stuff(like meteroa) and 25% new stuff(like a thousand suns). it has more of the feel of the old music which i like a lot more than their last 2 albums before this, other than 2 songs that seem like a stranger 'death metal' style. overall its still linkin park and i still enjoyed it a lot.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|F&$% you Hollywood, F&%@ you.<br />Please stop making bad movies.<br />I can only suspend reality so much, unless it's a cartoon.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I've never reviewed a book here, but I've read so many over the years. This book was refreshing. This was a thowback to a time when authors wrote books that found a way into the very memories of your soul. A brilliant debut novel.
B005ZUR724|4.0|the only thing that could be better is not having to pay every couple of months just to play more
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great game to snap the ole cranium into shape. it pleases both the creative areas and problem solving areas of the mind.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter and I love this game! We play on my kindle and my iphone! Sure waste a lot of time.
B004UB9SKS|4.0|Although I have not used this product, I have seen that it is easy to use and that is important.  I will update the review once I have used it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|awesome:) i love this app is great. if you like wheres my water than you will love wheres my perry
B006RUJST6|5.0|I've never taken the time to write a review, but I just had to with this book. Slammed had me laughing and crying a number of times. (I really can't remember the last book that did that.) The characters were so likeable. The story line flowed very nicely, never left you questioning things. All in all, a great read...one of my new favorite authors! I can't wait to read book two.
B007SGM084|5.0|Before purchasing the fifty shades bundle I decided to read some of the reviews. I hate to say that I was very disappointed in what I read. I had heard nothing but wonderful things before then. I decided to buy it anyways and must say I am extremely glad that I did. The first book certainly set the stage for the other two. I love that the author was not as graphic as some \\"love\\" stories that I have read. It was racy in an innocent way, of that makes sense. I completed the entire trilogy in under a week and am currently reading it a second time ensure that I didn't miss anything. Which I tend to do. Over all though this trilogy is one of my favorites. I would recommend it to anyone with the advice, you be the judge! Not everyone is going to agree but the ones that gives this trilogy an honest shot should not be disappointed.
034580404X|5.0|Hold on to your seats! This trilogy is one ride you will never FORGET! Not what I was expecting :) but totally worth it. I cant wait for the movie.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is entertaining. Wish the energy wasn't used up so quickly though. I really enjoy this game though. Was expecting the original Oregon Trail but this was a nice surprise!
B00785P2QC|3.0|you should be able to get investment points easier because you need them for everything but the games free so its ok.
0345803493|5.0|You won't be disappointed. The read was easy and a page turner! I read the trilogy in 3 days! Enjoy!
1576875776|5.0|This book is definitly a \\"must have\\" book. It's the only way to discover the talented street photographer Vivian Maier who was absolutely unknown during her life. She captured the real essence of the fifties with a woman sensitivity and with an extraordinary talent most of her contemporary photographers never reached.
0345803485|5.0|You won't be disappointed. The read was easy and a page turner! I read the trilogy in 3 days! Enjoy!
B00506NRBS|5.0|Derek Sivers is a good guy. He is one of those people who really WANTS to give back...and does! He gives back in abundance in his book about what brought about something of a revolution in the music producing world, and all quite innocently as well. The success was never taken for granted and when he eventually sold the business for a whack of money, he simply shared the wealth and started with his next pet project with the same philosophies. I wrote to Derek as he asks you to do at the end of his book and he took the time to write back in a manner that showed his humanness and total dedication to helping people. I like Derek, for having written the book in the first place and for being a nice guy.
0143034901|5.0|My favorite book of all time! Picked it up at the Airport on an 8 hr flight delay and the time went by quickly!
B00846REIS|1.0|I LOVED \\"50 shades\\" series and \\"Gabriel's Inferno\\", so I purchased this book. Quite honestly I found it too offensive to read. The \\"sexy\\" language was flat out vulgar and the love scenes not far behind. The story really didn't go anywhere and I felt like I was just reading a dirty book. I will not be reading the second!
0345803507|5.0|You won't be disappointed. The read was easy and a page turner! I read the trilogy in 3 days! Enjoy!
B004XJHBCE|3.0|I guess it's my fault. I assumed I could organize my books. I don't want my 4 year old seeing some of my book covers.  I was at least able to put all his apps and games in a folder.  sad I paid for something I cant really use.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty good for someone like me that can not play one game for very long at a time or stick with a game more than a day. Worth a try.
0345529057|5.0|Like most other books that are turned into a movie the books are better than the show.  I was impressed that the HBO series was close to what is written in the books.  Very enjoyable read, even when I knew what was going to happen in the 1st two books from the shows.  Looking forward to reading the 3rd and 4th book.  Also great price for the 4 books.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game was soooooo fun!!:) So addictive I couldn't put it down!!! Awesome game. For it to be free was surprising to me. I will definitely be getting part 2 when it comes out and I hope soon!
B007OAAK0O|4.0|This is a dvd taken of old performances but the quality is surprisingly good. Diana Ross is a graceful as ever. She really is the Diva we all know her to be. I would love to see her Live one more time, but it must be here in South Africa.<br />Diana is good on stage but i think outdoor is not her scene. i think she is much more gracious in the in door arena. Her sexy outfits mached her sexy dances she belted out on this set.<br />What a hot bod.<br /><br />You keep on going girl. We love you. This is by far the best Diana Ross DVD.
0307593312|5.0|How can I even put into words what the experience of reading this book was like? It was unlike any book I've ever read before, though I guess the only reason I can say that is because it was my first Murakami. Lyrical prose painting a surreal, dreamy, lonely, atmospheric universe that completely envelopes you. Alternate universes, worlds within worlds, religious cults, allegories, Proust, Jung, dreams, memories, reality, time, space, sex, life, death, moons, Little People, towns of cats, dohtas, mazas, things I still have no clue how to explain but at the center of it all: two star-crossed lovers whose impending reunion will keep you anxiously turning all 900+ pages.
B00785P2QC|5.0|itsa ssuch a fun and easy game to play i love it becuse its like running your own city actually that's  exactly  wgat your doing
B0086700CM|3.0|I loved it until the glitches started :/ the farther you go the worse the glitches get. this needs to be fixed soon

B006Z20976|4.0|We love the movie. The blu ray plays fine, but we were very disappointed that there were no special features on the blu ray disc. It had a menu for them on the blu ray - but they were not on the blu ray disc. Very disappointing because they were suppose to be on there and had to watch them on the dvd instead.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a Great game. It is simplistically fun in the fundamental design. The puzzles themselves are getting harder. Thx. Love it!
0307730697|5.0|Inspirational & humbling.  Adam is a true Hero of America & humanity itself.  I thank Adam, his family & Team mates for thier past , current, & future sacrifices.  Eric Blehm captures the essence of life with in the pages of this book.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|I have never read any of this author's books, but I may just have to try another! This book got my interest right away and kept it throughout the book. I usually only read at night, but found myself picking up my kindle or my ipad to read just a few more pages of this book. I found it funny and entertaining and liked how the story moved right along without any slow boring parts that some chick lit books tend to do sometimes. The only thing that I didn't like and it seemed to be throughout the book was the use of the word \\"er\\". For some reason, I found it annoying and overused. It was used in the right context and I understood why the author used it but I think it should have been changed out for Ummmm or uhh occasionally, if that makes any sense to the readers.
B0000640VN|1.0|I don't understand why Meg Ryan is personally criticized for doing what the director demands and the studios want.  But I don't understand why Meg Ryan would persist in doing these films as a \\"type,\\" unless there is some financial mess she is in.<br /><br />And, this is yet another Nora Ephron-style women are truly stupid - always infantile, always giving up what little they might have to, like Daisy Mae - GET MAH MAN.  If it is true, and, sadly, it does seem to continue to be the case, that women will give up all just to have a man, then let's stop the pretense now.  It is as tiresome as the infantile portrayals of and by Meg Ryan.  Men continue to have so many more resources than most women, and the worst man can snap his fingers and get a woman.  But enough of that.<br /><br />Not only are we subjected to the infantile behavior of the heroine, (again, and as with 'You've Got Mail', etc.), blatant historical inacurracies, etc., but we are presented with the ultimate proof of women's willingness to do as she is told, in this case, to, figurately, jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.  But not just to believe her ex-boyfriend and brother, that she'll be okay, but to walk across an openwork steel girder in high-heels to do it.<br /><br />Get the promotion you've always wanted?  Time to kill yourself, because you've lost your man in the process.  This is no leap of faith - this is suicide.<br /><br />Kudos, too, to all supporting cast members, although I was dismayed to see Philip Bosco in an almost invisible role; this actor gets out attention no matter what his character, and his invisibility here was unworthy.<br /><br />It's not good when all any of the females watching this movie can say is how much they wished the movie had been solely about inventors, Leopold, and JJ, with no women involved whatsoever.  Very sad.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|really enjoyable read, couldn't read it fast enough and loved that I could get next book in series straight away and start reading it. I enjoyed the story behind the erotic parts of the novel, it was not over the top.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I once owned this in Hardcover. It is a great read for lovers of Sherlock Holmes.  The illustrations are exquisite. I was so happy to find this book on kindle.  The hard cover edition is massive.  I share reading it with my family. So it's become a family favorite.<br />This is a great classic to share for generations.

B000NY17J6|5.0|Okay, I love Linda Ronstadt, it's sadly not the other way around. She had me from the \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\" album. Her \\"Hasten Down The Wind\\" album is my top pick to have with me if I ever find myself on that deserted island, hopefully with a turntable, a little electricity, and a margarita or two. I still have my original copies of Greatest Hits I and II on LP (if you have to ask what's an \\"LP\\" you can stop reading now), and I also have Greatest Hits I and II on CD. This is a fantastic set of songs from the time Linda left the Stone Poneys to the time she left her folk roots to start venturing into new music styles (\\"Mad Love\\" anybody?). Those were better days for music and these songs were a big part of the sound of those days. For older or newer fans as well, check out her work with the Stone Poneys prior to her solo career.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it! I read it in two days. Couldn't put it down. i was only dissapointed that the publisher set such a high price for the e-books. It was cheaper to buy them in print. Kindle books should always be discounted a least a little! Come on! :)
0451169514|4.0|*There are some SPOILERS throught this review, most of the major ones confined to the \\"Negatives\\" section*<br /><br />Quick plot summary: in an event-filled summer in Derry, Maine (a fictional town) in the 1950s, seven children (six boys and a girl) encounter a shapeshifting monster that eats children (mostly)...a monster that can become whatever its victim fears most.  Brought together by forces beyond their understanding, they manage to stop ITs rampage (this is SO not a spoiler, as it's made evident within the first ten percent of the novel that our adult heroes encountered and survived the big baddy in childhood), but have to make good on a vow they made soon after...to come back to Derry if IT ever returned...which IT most certainly does in the mid-1980s (made clear in the first 30 or so pages).  The childhood and adulthood stories are told in parallel, and both build toward that (those) evidently pre-destined final battle(s).<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />1) The emotions and relationships of childhood are deftly evoked, getting at (I think) exactly what the writer had in mind (some of my favorite King writing ever is after their re-emergence from their final childhood encounter with the eponymous monster--well, the part after the major negative encountered below).  This book is as much about the bonds of friendship as it is about a big, scary monster.  These are REAL children with child-like thoughts and feelings, not grownup minds shoved into children's bodies.<br /><br />2) IT (the monster, that is) is almost always legitimately scary...managing to be both otherworldly and yet very humanly cruel at times.  We are taught to loathe IT as well as fear IT, and this is very well accomplished.  One of my favorite scenes is when Ben sees and hears IT in his nostalgic tour back to the children's library...but no one else can see/hear IT...so IT taunts and berates him while he attempts to have a normal conversation with a librarian, IT knowing that if Ben respondsit will look like he is out of his mind to the librarian and the patrons (and perhaps make them suspect he is the kidnapper/killer at work in Derry that spring).  The tension and hopelessness is GREAT in this sequence.<br /><br />3) While certain revelations about the nature of IT are not good at all (see negatives below), when we are finally able to take a peek at what drives IT, what its motivations and feelings are...well, with that aspect I was well-satisfied.  I find myself constantly re-reading the few passages told from ITs perspective, fascinated by this take on \\"evil\\".<br /><br />4) Tension is slowly ratcheted to the point where the reader is absolutely DRIVEN to finish the novel once they get to the last couple hundred pages (even if those hold more than their share of disappointments).  The back-and-forth from childhood to adulthood odyssey to the monster's lair is magnificently done.<br /><br />5. I like that more than half (arguably all but one, perhaps two) of the children have somewhat abusive relationships with their parents.  This ranges from literal, corporal abuse with overtones of molestation (Beverly) to making their kid overeat (Ben) to emotional freeze-out (Bill...some utterly heartbreaking passages here if you have ever experienced grief and what it can do to people) to smothering protectiveness (Eddie) to disregard (Richie).  This increases the feeling that the children have only one another to depend on, and makes their affection and support for one another that much sweeter, and makes the whole thing seem more \\"real\\".<br /><br />6) While the book meanders a bit (see negatives below), some of that meandering is great.  I particularly enjoy several of the historical segments that shed a sinister light on ITs relationship with the town of Derry.  I also like seeing IT successfully pursue, kill, and eat one child in the first third of the novel.  It lets (maybe \\"makes\\" is a better word) you open your imagination to the various horrible fatesof the dozens, perhaps hundreds of children that IT has killed and eaten over the years, and makes our heroes' evasions of IT that much more tense.  The description of ITs \\"low, satisfied grunt\\" upon tearing the head off of this child before continuing to eat fills you with the appropriate revulsion and hate you should feel for this sickening antagonist.<br /><br />7) Oh boy are some of the images scary.  I'll never be rid of the idea of Pennywise's wet, sodden tracks next to Mike when he wakes up to his own face on one of Pennywise's balloons (\\"Do they float?\\"), with the balloon face's eye sockets empty and bleeding, and the balloon popping right when Mike screams.<br /><br />8) I enjoy the way the monster transforms from a childhood nightmare to a cosmic entity of terrifying power over the course of the book.  Certain aspects of this aren't handled very well (see below), but it's nice that the whole thing feels so epic by the end.<br /><br />*MAJOR SPOILERS, many of them to do with the climactic scenes*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />1) One had to know that when they encounter IT in ITs final shape, it was going to be disappointing.  But boy is it ever (Stephen King's endings are, I find, notoriously anti-climactic, but this may be the peak of his missteps).  Even less imaginative than I had hoped...to be perfectly forthright and spoil the whole affair *I'M WARNING YOU ONE LAST TIME, STOP READING FOR SPOILERS* IT is...a giant spider.  \\"A nightmare Spider [wow, Mr. King, the capitalized \\"S\\" really makes me take this more seriously] from beyond time and space...\\" but still an effing spider, giant web and all.  King tries to sort of hedge this disastrous choice (I am not sure what IT could have been in ITs final shape to even be vaguely satisfying, but I darn well know it shouldn't have been a spider) by a) having one character note in their thoughts that anything given a final incarnation is less scary than the unknown (yes, absolutely true, but COME ON!) and b) noting this isn't *really* ITs final shape.  Rather, this is the shape we humans can readily translate IT into upon seeing it uncloaked.  ITs \\"final final\\" shape, which one character momentarily sees before the last \\"nightmare Spider\\" illusion re-asserts itself, is said to be insectile...an endless, crawling, hairy thing made of the same orange \\"deadlights\\" we are told make up ITs cosmic essence.  This is relatively more scary, but still a short drink of water for the incredibly long walk the reader has made.  Honestly, I think it's better if you know you're in for a disappointment here and just enjoy the rest of the book without getting geared toward finding out what IT is/looks like.<br /><br />2) The manner in which IT is hurt in the ultimate confrontation(s) is a little vague.  Yes, fear is (in an almost literal sense) ITs meat (or at least ITs seasoning), and therefore happiness or laughter or belief in one's own strength could be seen to be ITs poison...but this isn't set up very well, and detracts from the climactic semi-verbal exchanges between IT and a couple of our heroes.  The whole trip into the void is very strange, really.  Then the metaphysical encounter is almost completely set aside for a purely physical one for the moment when the creature finally meets its fate...very wobbly, this bit.<br /><br />3) Our heroes (in childhood) get lost in the dark, winding sewers under Derry after their final childhood encounter with IT, but the girl among them knows how to put their heads back on straight...she has sex with all six of the boys subsequently there in the nasty sewer.  This is NOT A JOKE, and King certainly doesn't think so, as he lingers in some detail on the intercourse with several of the boys.  Leaving aside the questionable taste level, what the heck kind of sense does this make?  Certainly sex can clear one's head, but why must she sleep with all the boys?  They're mystically bound in so many other ways that this feels unnecessary and yeah, icky.  Seriously, Mr. King, a childhood orgy/gang-bang as vehicle for unifying the group and alleviating their fear?  WTF?  I tend to \\"fast forward\\" through this segment (along with the part where one side character murders his infant little brother...but only because that makes me sick as a parent, not because it's just a weird, unnecessary, off-putting choice like the group sex).<br /><br />4) The novel sometimes wanders a bit directionlessly.  I am usually comfortable with its winding, sidetrack-laden narrative, and appreciate the larger scope that the historical sections and some of the \\"from a victim's perspective\\" segments bring into play, but pages upon pages could have been cut without losing anything in the overall feeling.  Its almost-1100 page length could certainly have been tightened more towards the 950 range.  For instance, did all (or just about all) of the non-Mike characters really NEED to have an encounter with IT upon their wandering exploration of the town in adulthood?  It feels like it was filled out for a sense of crossing each character off a checklist rather than for the sake of the story or any emotional payoff (this is not true in every case...Ben's and Beverly's encounters with IT in this portion of the book hold weight, but Richie's and Eddie's do not, in my opinion).<br /><br />5) I think Bill comes off as something of a Gary Stu (the author inserting himself for fun/self-congratulatory purposes), in that he's a successful writer (King!) who is apparently a great leader, brave to the end, never weak or selfish.  While I appreciate certain things about his encounter with his professor and classmates RE: literature/great authors (yeah, I agree, Shakespeare/Faulkner/whoever were at least as much in it for the cash as for pointing out any great \\"truth\\" to the reader/viewer, and I agree that literature is over-analyzed to the point of seeing things in the work the author certainly did not intend), it feels a little defensive for a successful author to write about this and I wonder if it mightn't be based on any events that actually happened to King along the way.  The worst, though, is the way he has Bill have a super-hot, super-successful Hollywood wife...and then Bill also has sex with the perhaps-even-hotter Beverly in adulthood.  It all feels a bit like fantasy fulfillment.  Maybe I'm off base, but that's the way it comes across to me.<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />In summary: a very good book that finds itself a bit off the rails in the climactic segment (and sometimes elsewhere).  The book is so engaging, and the characters so \\"real\\" that this is very much forgivable...but it still hurts to see something with that much potential peter out in the last bit.  I recommend it, though I think going in with your eyes open is for the best.
B008BM9L72|3.0|This trilogy is in my opinion very close to porn.  The sex scenes became very repetative, and I skipped most of them after the fist book.<br />The story line was ok, but for all the fuss being made I found on the whole the trilogy dis. appointing
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|If you like science fiction, you will like this show. While it has very little in common with the Colorado Kid novella that it is based off of, the writers do an excellent job of weaving in other King characters, locations and maladies into the plot. The show centers around a small town, an FBI agent her police department partner, and the incidents in said town caused by \\"the Troubles.\\" It's entertaining and has quick wit humor. Great cast, too.

B005LAII0S|5.0|What a lovely family movie.  Definitely a modern take on the DISNEY classic.  Humour, adventure, and thrills the entire movie.  Costumes were also excellent.  Julia Roberts did definitely not disappoint.  She played the role of the wicked QUEEN masterfully and the rest of the cast were superb.  We have a weekly family movie night and I would thoroughly recommend this movie to all.  The only thing I found really hard to get past were the big eyebrows of SNOW WHITE.

0312370849|4.0|The flipping back and forth in the beginning was jarring and took me a while to adapt, but not long. Once in the story, I looked forward to going to bed each night to read it. Sarah was well developed. Julia was easy to like. The book could have been gory, but it was not, keeping the reader on task, to learn more about Sarah, and for Julia to find herself. I felt entrenched in both France and New York. I'm glad that the author didn't leave us completely hating the French. Very recommended.

It's the type of book you get annoyed being interrupted reading! The 2 main characters are well developed and deliver a sinister 'there's something not quite right' feeling whilst you are reading. You cannot wait to get to the end of the book to find out how it will all end and then feel sad once you've reached the end because you know a great read is all over.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Batman. Rarely is there a character that can inspire so much love and ire at the same time in the cinematic world. The more extremist cross-section of fans view co-writer/director Christopher Nolan's BATMAN films as \\"too real\\" and \\"too boring\\". Some of the critics reviewing this film feel this film, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES which is Nolan's finale to his epic DARK KNIGHT trilogy, is \\"too unrealistic\\" or \\"too cartoony\\" because of his brilliant and more realistic takes on the Batman mythology in the two previous films BATMAN BEGINS and THE DARK KNIGHT. Basically, everybody wants their cake and eat it too with these films. However, if you truly look at this film for what it is and not what you think it should be or what you want it to be, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is still an excellent film and a perfect cap on the end of Nolan's BATMAN trilogy. It's also worth knowing that as you read this review, you will probably notice that I am something of a fan of Batman, not only these films, but the comics as well.<br /><br />The film opens with almost a similar epilogue to THE DARK KNIGHT, with Commisioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) espousing the virtues of Harvey Dent, who tragically had succumbed to grief and madness by the end of THE DARK KNIGHT and the murders he committed while in that state were covered up by Gordon and Batman (Christian Bale) in order to make sure that Harvey's reputation remained as pure as he was believed to be. This opening begins just one of the themes that this film will deal with throughout. Once that opening ends, we find that it has been eight years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT. Bruce Wayne, devastated by the death of his life-long love Rachel Dawes and hunted by the Gotham Police since he (as Batman) took the fall for the murders Harvey committed as well as Harvey's death, has become a recluse and is no longer Batman. Gotham is apparently cleaner than ever because of the systematic removal of organized crime and imprisonment of over a thousand offenders due to a municipal law called The Dent Act. There is still discontent amongst the populace and that is represented partially in the daring and sultry cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). She represents some of the downtrodden of Gotham who feel that people like Wayne have far too much when so many more have so little. It is also represented in Officer John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an idealistic young police officer and an orphan like Wayne himself who sees behind the veil of lies perpetrated by Gordon, but with a different perspective than one might originally think. And most surprisingly, it is represented in Alfred (Michael Caine), who has been Bruce's most loyal confidante over the years as well as his father figure who sees no future for Bruce as Batman other than death. Unfortunately for everyone involved, a new villain comes to town in the form of Bane (Tom Hardy), a masked steel-eyed hulking predator with a mind for war and a desire for destruction. Wayne, finding some new purpose not only due to a specific crime perpetrated by Kyle (who, while costumed similarly to the comic character of Catwoman, is never referred to as such in this film) but also in the form of Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), a woman who represents hope for Gotham in the assistance of funding a fusion-powered renewable energy prototype and also as a potential love interest, once again dons the cape and cowl to fight the chaos that Bane seems to be trying to bring to Gotham. In a brutal fight between the two, Batman comes out very badly on the losing side and is cast out of Gotham into an underground prison in a distant land; the very prison Bane was born into, as we find ties into BATMAN BEGINS with the more we learn of our new villain and how he knows Batman's true identity. Upon returning to Gotham, Bane begins his \\"liberation\\" of Gotham as we see a terrifying display of city-wide destruction that separates Gotham from the rest of the world and the same device Wayne Industries planned for Gotham's salvation has been retro-fitted for its destruction. Meanwhile, Bruce has to watch as Bane holds kangaroo courts for Gotham's priviledged and its protectors which ultimately leads to execution or exile across its frozen river, and as he watches, he begins to feel the fire rising within himself once again as Gotham's race against time is coming to a close.<br /><br />It's obvious that Nolan (and his co-writer brother Jonathan) found inspiration in two, maybe three very important works of the Batman comic mythology; the most obvious being KNIGHTFALL, which was when we first were introduced to Bane and his epic battle with Batman; also NO MAN'S LAND, where Gotham has been deemed an isolated island city-state of sorts; and somewhat with Ed Brubaker and Darwyn Cooke's reinvigorating of CATWOMAN, where she was still a femme fatale jewel thief, but also was a guardian for those that were considered expendable by Gotham society. All of these elements are on display here, and done in a far superior and more emotionally-charged way than what was in the comics (perhaps with the exception of the Brubaker/Cooke work on CATWOMAN, which was brilliant).<br /><br />I have to admit, despite the brilliant, genre-defining work Nolan had done previously with Batman, I was a little less than enthused to see Bane as the villain of the film when it was announced. He was someone I felt originally that was a bit of a one-trick pony; a new character created solely for the purpose of upsetting the status quo. As years went by, Bane had been given more of a back-story with more motivation and some of that characterization is brought to vivid life here by Nolan's storytelling and Tom Hardy's hypnotic performance. Bane's face is covered by that strange but purposeful mask during almost the entire film, but Hardy, having done incredibly charismatic and brutal work previously in films like BRONSON, INCEPTION and WARRIOR, brings a swagger, attitude and cruelty to Bane simply through his eyes and his body language. The addition of Selina Kyle to Nolan's universe also seemed equally fitting as someone who always SEEMS to be looking out for Number One, but ends up as having something of the proverbial heart of gold. Hathaway, who has been impressing since her work in more dramatic work in films like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and RACHEL GETTING MARRIED but has been primarily a staple of rom-com work with films like LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA and BRIDE WARS, is on equal footing with the rest of the cast here. She brings a necessary dynamic with Batman/Bruce Wayne and moments of brightness and humor in this almost unrelentingly bleak film, but don't expect purring. Gordon-Levitt continues his run of tremendous performances he's been turning in since his revelatory performance in BRICK through THE LOOKOUT, (500) DAYS OF SUMMER, INCEPTION and 50/50, proving that he is rapidly becoming one of the great actors of his generation. Other Bat-verse newcomer Marion Cotillard sadly doesn't have as much to do here as an actress of her caliber should, at least not until the third act. It does seem like while Nolan was doing INCEPTION, he just asked if a lot of his actors would be willing to make this film too; hence Hardy, Gordon-Levitt, and Cotillard.<br /><br />As far as the returning actors are concerned, Oldman continues to redefine his place in these films. He is, at least in part, the conscience of Batman, but in this film, there's a very deep weariness he evokes because he's partially corrupted himself in order to serve \\"the greater good\\". Morgan Freeman returns as Lucius Fox, and has some strong moments, but there's not many moments here for him to sink his teeth into. Caine rounds out this trinity of Bruce Wayne/Batman's most trusted friends, and gives a more raw and emotional Alfred than we've seen in the past. He is much less the wisecracking and wisened Merlin to Bruce's King Arthur, but is the voice of regret. He doesn't seeBatman as a failure, but he loves Bruce too much to let him continue on with that life. But the film ultimately belongs to Bale. This is the most emotional and most complex Bruce Wayne/Batman we've seen yet, and he brings him to very vivid life in this film. At the film's opening, he's bearded and gaunt-looking. He's become so much more damaged from the result of the last film that he feels he's lost everyone he loves and believes could give him a normal life. As stated in THE DARK KNIGHT, he doesn't want to be Batman for his whole life, but for better or worse, it's part of who he is.<br /><br />The film as a whole is a tremendous achievement thematically, dealing with a lot of things you don't see in a big-budget summer release: things like economic disparity (keep in mind, though; this film was in production before the whole \\"Occupy\\" movement began, but because of the economic crises in Europe and the U.S., it was definitely something worth approaching) the corrosive nature of the truth and the fall of a city from without and within.<br /><br />The film is also, and not unusual to expect of Nolan, a technical marvel. From the incredible skyjack opening sequence to the city beneath Gotham to the hellish decimation of the city to the desolation that follows and pretty much every frame of the third act, it's all incredible to watch and breath-taking to behold. The action to this film is also far more visceral than anything that the Batman films have presented in the past. In the two major confrontations of the film between Batman and Bane, every blow is felt (some much more so than others), and the fight choreography is more of a street brawl rather than a MATRIX-esque gravity-defiant martial arts melee, but there is one scene with Batman and Catwoman taking on a gang of thugs that is much more graceful in its choreography. The effects work is particularly effective on the practical side of things. Very few moments feel like they needed to be CG'd, but the moments of the destruction of the football field and surrounding areas, and all the sequences involving The Bat, an airborne version of the Tumbler, are pure gold.<br /><br />But there are problems too. The first significant problem is us as the audience and Nolan as the director of a Batman film post-THE DARK KNIGHT, which I firmly believe is the best film of the last decade. I saw the entire marathon showing at a local theater and found how amazingly simple it was to sit through THE DARK KNIGHT after seeing it a few times in the theater before and countless times on Blu-Ray and TV. We have the expectation of seeing something better than THE DARK KNIGHT and it simply isn't going to happen. Just as we hoped each subsequent film in every popular trilogy or series of films would improve (of which there are several examples in genre filmmaking), it rarely ever happens. You will never get another Heath Ledger as The Joker. We expect more than we get, and that's on us too. Another problem is that there is a LOT of story here. You have several different tales being told with several different characters and several different themes, and certain sacrifices are made in order to tell those stories, usually at the cost of character and honest dialogue. There are times where it does feel that there's almost too much story for just one film...<br /><br />...but I can't truly fault a film for being TOO ambitious when there are so many films out there that are just floating along with just the ambition to make good money. Nolan fills the screen to a point that is evocative of a film of the silent era. There very rarely even needs to be dialogue; you can tell so easily what's going on just by looking and watching and that's a huge testament to Nolan's abilities as a storyteller and the actors and how superbly they play their roles. But if this were a silent film, you might miss out on the dangerously percussive score by Hans Zimmer, who is sadly without his former Bat-film musical collaborator James Newton-Howard, but there's still everything you need from this films' score and more. It's not nearly as quiet and unnerving as the score for THE DARK KNIGHT, but this is a film of a much grander scale. And that brings us to the word for this film: EPIC. The Dark Knight Trilogy has been an epic of storytelling; It gives us the beginning, middle, and end (?) of the tale of The Batman, and all of the films reflect the character at moments in his life that are natural in this cinematic universe Nolan has created. And as with any three-act structured story, it's only logical that the third act be the climax of the tale, and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is that climax. It's bigger than either of the previous films, it has a wider scope on screen and in storytelling, it's more exciting and there's much more at stake here. This is a finale of a trilogy, and anything goes. Lives will be very possibly be lost. Even the hero of our trilogy isn't safe, and that makes the stakes higher than the previous films; Nolan is a smart enough filmmaker to make you afraid of the ending.<br /><br />And yes, the final act of this film more closely resembles something out of a Batman comic book than just about any moment of any of the previous films. It is no-holds-barred. Nuclear annihilation is imminient. The entirety of Gotham is trapped on its island. Only a few stand between Bane and the total obliteration of Gotham City. Who will live? Who will die? And most importantly, will I as an audience member leave the theater satisfied that this epic has come to a conclusion?<br /><br />Now be warned: This is not THE AVENGERS. The levels of sheer glee that you may have felt during that film will not be omnipresent in this film, but there will be moments that you will want to stand up and cheer. And there will be moments that will devastate you.<br /><br />After waxing linguistical about this film, these three points are ultimately all you need to know:<br /><br />A: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is very much a Christopher Nolan Batman film.<br /><br />B: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is THE finale to Christopher Nolan's Batman films.<br /><br />C: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the perhaps greatest final chapter in a trilogy of films ever.Batman as a failure, but he loves Bruce too much to let him continue on with that life.

The Dark Knight Trilogy has been an epic of storytelling; It gives us the beginning, middle, and end (?) of the tale of The Batman, and all of the films reflect the character at moments in his life that are natural in this cinematic universe Nolan has created. And as with any three-act structured story, it's only logical that the third act be the climax of the tale, and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is that climax. It's bigger than either of the previous films, it has a wider scope on screen and in storytelling, it's more exciting and there's much more at stake here. This is a finale of a trilogy, and anything goes. Lives will be very possibly be lost. Even the hero of our trilogy isn't safe, and that makes the stakes higher than the previous films; Nolan is a smart enough filmmaker to make you afraid of the ending.<br /><br />And yes, the final act of this film more closely resembles something out of a Batman comic book than just about any moment of any of the previous films. It is no-holds-barred. Nuclear annihilation is imminient. The entirety of Gotham is trapped on its island. Only a few stand between Bane and the total obliteration of Gotham City. Who will live? Who will die? And most importantly, will I as an audience member leave the theater satisfied that this epic has come to a conclusion?<br /><br />Now be warned: This is not THE AVENGERS. The levels of sheer glee that you may have felt during that film will not be omnipresent in this film, but there will be moments that you will want to stand up and cheer. And there will be moments that will devastate you.<br /><br />After waxing linguistical about this film, these three points are ultimately all you need to know:<br /><br />A: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is very much a Christopher Nolan Batman film.<br /><br />B: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is THE finale to Christopher Nolan's Batman films.<br /><br />C: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is the perhaps greatest final chapter in a trilogy of films ever.
0689815816|5.0|I had never read this book before I saw the reviews on Amazon.  It had such good reviews that I decided to purchase it to read to my son when he got a little older (he's currently 6 months old).  A few weeks ago I decided to try and read it to him to see if it would hold his interest.  I had my doubts given that the book was pretty long for a baby and that half the drawings were done in black and white.<br /><br />Was I surprised to find that he LOVED it.  He waves his arms and kicks his legs during the \\"we're going on a bear hunt\\" chant pages and also gets super excited at the end when they enter the bear cave and hurry back home.  This book is written in such a way that even a young baby can understand the emotion and excitement.<br /><br />This is one of the books that I enjoy reading to him as well.  I'm sure that we will be reading this book for many years to come.

0345535421|4.0|A Clash of Kings begins right where the previous novel, the enthralling Game of Thrones, leaves off. New characters are introduced from the island of Dragonstone, where the late King Robert's younger brother, Stannis Baratheon, rules. He lays claim to the throne of Westeros by rites and charges Robert's primary heir, son Joffrey, as illegitimate. The youngest Baratheon brother, Renly, also seeks the throne from his stronghold in the south. Newly crowned King Robb Stark rules in the north and is challenged by Tywin Lannister on the battlefield and Balon Greyjoy at sea. So many minor characters are brought into play that it's not a bad idea to keep a few notes while reading.<br /><br />This second installment from A Song of Ice and Fire definitely works best as a transitional setup for the larger, seven-volume story that George R. R. Martin is telling. The first half moves slowly as key players are put in position, and the second half delivers a handful of climactic punches. Don't expect many story arcs to be resolved by the book's end.
B007YDX3GY|3.0|I really liked the old Nikita a lot. This one isn't half bad. I like Maggie Q and she has some better performances then this show but not bad. Will watch again someday...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got this book because of the #1 best seller and recent hype about it; knowing little about what the storyline is.  My first impression after the main character (Ana) meets her dream guy (Christian) was: Is this author trying to ride on the Twilight wave?  Ana is constantly a damsel in distress, poorly coordinated, stammers, and of course, \\"blushes\\" whenever she sees Christian.  Christian possesses \\"Greek god\\" good looks, excels at just about everything from French to piano, and has (gosh) tussled bronze hair.  Hm.... I wonder if there's going to be a Jacob-like character later in the series?  Not that I plan to find out; one book is enough.  The only difference from Twilight is Ana quickly fulfills her sexual \\"goddess\\" in the most unnatural ways.  I say this is \\"x-rated\\" not because of the sex scenes, but because of the repetitive nature and porn-level moaning/f******/coming -- I can almost hear it.<br /><br />The characters are so underdeveloped and the story repetitive that I can pretty much guess what's happening next by reading the first few lines.  The pages went flying by not because the content is so engrossing, but because I can skip 5 pages every time Ana sees Christian and her breathing stops, or he smolders her with his intense grey eyes.<br /><br />If you're looking for romance or a good read, don't bother with this book.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|If i had to choose from the 1000+ sci-fi/fantasy books I've read for the number one slot. It would be this book. There are so many elements that attract me to this book. It is a coming of age story done right. Full of characters that jump off the page and leave lasting impressions. The depth and mysteries of the story are fascinating. The life and livelihood of these characters is amazingly developed and full of cleverness and subtlety. This book explores the whole range of emotions and leave you salivating for more and you will not be disappointed with its sequel.
B000ZELISO|4.0|Harry Potter has always been a favorite of mine. I grew up with the HP books and the movies throughout the years. This movie was great but is not the extended edition, if that is what you are looking for. I like the cover art and the darker side of the movie series highlighted in the cover.<br /><br />The cinematic atmosphere through the movie is dark and erie, like you would imagine in the book. This movie is not a direct copy of the book (which movie actually does that?!?) and has its own spin on things. This movies has a large amount of adventure and action, but also has a flare of drama.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is the second book in the Kingkiller chronicles starring musician, arcanist, hero, mercenary, and lover boy, Kvothe! *applause*<br /><br />If you've read the first story you know how much life the characters Mr. Rothfuss has developed. His world is so clearly painted with cold truth and naive hopes woven together with secrets and mysteries and cleverness. I've read both books twice now and I'm salivating over the thought of the third book. This is definitely my favorite fantasy series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am half way through Catching Fire & I am absolutely enthralled with these books. I love that Amazon has made it so easy for me to get on my Kindle Fire. Love the books & love Amazon. Thanks so much for all.
0985081821|5.0|It's simple about this book. If you like vampires, paranormal creatures (as much as I do) you'll love this book. You'll be surprised with a whole new level of difference between vampires. Before I started reading paranormal books I thought OK vampires are vampires and that's it, but in some books (like this one) I discovered the whole new structure of paranormal world.  It's impressive to me. I mean you have to be creative to accomplish that and I like creative stuff. Here I especially liked the whole elements story (air, water, earth, fire and spirit).<br /><br />When it comes to the story you'll meet young girl Sophia. She is 22, luckily not 16-year-old high school girl, because it's easier to relate with somebody who is closer to your age. She is strong character and she knows how to deal with some things on her own. Although, later she will hesitate about some things but you can't blame her  after everything that happens. On the other side we have one guy, he is Charles and he is THE guy (If you know what I mean *wink*). After meeting Charles she will find answers on some of her questions and also discover the whole new world. One more thing I really like is connection in this book, between past and present and between two completely different worlds.<br /><br />Now I can't wait to read the next book in this series, which will be out in June. So all in all, if you like paranormal books with action in it then this book is for you.
1603420398|4.0|The projects in the book are great! This is my third book for this author. The only thing I had trouble with are some instructions, the written vs the diagram, didn't quite match but it was easy to figure out. Plus the author does make it clear it is a guideline for others to grow upon. I will purchase more books from this author, because there is no consensus on \\"Crochet language\\" I do tend to have to re-read in order to understand some terminology, but that has not kept me from loving her books and ideas on crochet.  Thank you so much for making the effort to create this book.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Few months ago I've had a chance to read The Forever Girl, first book in this series. In the meantime I learned how the whole structure of this series would look like. There will be three books that will talk about Sophia and also three novels that will talk about some characters in the whole trilogy. Now this is the first novel and it's about Ophelia.<br /><br />Storyline. For those of you who had read The Forever Girl you should remember Ophelia from the end of the book. There was short story about her. (don't want to put spoilers because of those who haven't read the book jet). Here we meet Ophelia and actually witness the whole story. Ophelia lived normal life as a maid until one day when mark appeared on her neck causing her pain. Soon after that she was kidnapped by mysterious man called Ethan. He was sent to help her complete her task. She has to join dark, spernatural world and protect someone from the future. Her past is also chasing her and she must decide what she is going to do.<br /><br />Characters. Ophelia is really interesting character. She is not too strong nor too weak. You can easily relate with her and her doubts are something that most of us would have. Ethan is at the other hand really mysterious and even though the author doesn't give you the detail description you can imagine his tall and strong body in dark cloths, and his dark hair on his shoulders and his dark eyes. Maybe my imagination is talking through me, but that's how I imagine him. Now you say that you aren't interested! Like you would. There is one also interesting character but I won't talk about that cause, like I've already said, I don't want to put spoilers in this review.<br /><br />Love-story. This is something that in opinion happened to quickly. But then again this is a novel so I guess the author couldn't develop more. I'm not saying that the love story isn't nice but I wish it had been a little bit longer. Everything beside that was great.<br /><br />Conclusion. At the end I must say that now I understand this idea about writing novels in between the books and I really like it. This novel helped me to remember The Forever Girl and also gave me better idea about Ophelia and also Sophia's task. The author also reminded us of elements and the whole story behind that. Now I'm really looking forward reading Come, the Dark. I got the feeling that this is not all about Ophelia and that we're going to see her in the books to come.<br /><br />I was thinking about giving it four stars because the love story could have been deeper, but considering that this is a novel and that the love story isn't in focus in this book I changed my mind.

B0086700CM|5.0|why all the hate i mean so what it has some lag and a few bugs its a fun game over all<br /><br />that is all
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First review ever.  I totally enjoyed this series!  I don't know that you have to be very much into science fiction or post apocalyptic fiction to enjoy this series, you just have to enjoy a good story.  You will get pulled into this story.  I feel like I've been in the Silo with these characters.  I can see this story unfolding over many, many more books.  Hugh Howey - keep up the excellent work!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the game its alright<br />i think people would like like<br />I thought it would be bad but its not and I think u people would like it
B008COII1Y|4.0|This movie is excellent. It felt more like a drama with a zombie backdrop. I became very involved with the characters and felt bad when one would meet their demise. Very good acting as well. I was very drawn into the story. This movie may define a new genera. Drama/Zombie...Drambie....Zomrama maybe? Definitely worth the rental or purchase.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|strike romance and re catorgerize as a comedy. frst of i would just like to say. wow i WISH i could orgasm as many times and with as miniscule effort as ana! it would be a happy day if i could! secondly dont bother with the purchase. the fact that this made it to the best seller list is clearly some kind of joke. i dont feel the author had a very large grasp of the english language and im pretty sure she is a virgin because i have never heard nor experienced sex like that. this book is more like a teenage girls fantasy and some cheap knock off of twilight minus the sexy wolves and sparkly vamires. i also believe the author lacks geographical knowledge and should do a little more research before subjecting her comical work on the world. the best part of this book was the witty reviews that i read...after my purchase ( silly me falling into the best seller hype.) this book was poorly written had lack luster two dimensional characters zero plot and frankly slightly disturbing thougts. the idea was certainly unique but the follow through was unsufficant. do yourself a favor. stick with the review they are far moe entertaining and worth the read not to mention free!!

B00845PRDS|5.0|The movie was great!  I've heard complaints about the Seals not being very good actors. Well, that might have something to do with the fact that they aren't, they're real war fighters.  Having said that I really don't think they were that bad at all. Certainly they're no Al Pacino, but so what, the story is good and the action is amazing. In the end I think the guys did a damn fine acting job, especially considering they aren't actors.
0596805527|4.0|This review is only for section 1 of the book, the \\"Core\\" JavaScript chapters. After I am finished reading the entire book I will make an attempt to update the review for that portion.<br /><br />The good:<br />This book has 22 chapters, broken into 2 different sections, chock full of very detailed information and examples. There are 2 appendixes at the end of the book that can be used as references for Core JavaScript methods which would pertain to the language itself and an appendix devoted to client-side JavaScript which is what beginning and novice programmers would need to know to write JavaScript for client-side scripts in web browsers. If you are going to write simple JavaScript might be able to get away with reading just the section of chapters devoted to client-side JavaScript. These are chapters 13-22. If you want to get bogged down in writing your own JavaScript APIs and understanding every nuance of the JavaScript language itself then you could read chapters 1-12 but the Core JavaScript section also explains some of the more fundamental concepts that one must know if you have no prior programming experience in languages such as C++ and C#.<br /><br />The bad:<br />My first gripe the most notable and glaring negative aspect of this book(in my personal opinion) is the overly complex examples the author uses when introducing new programming theory and idiomatic patterns to use when incorporating the new concepts using JavaScript.<br /><br />At times, I feel like the author is more concerned about showing the reader how smart he is instead of making sure we understand the newly introduced concepts. I think it's really cool that you can write a single statement of JavaScript that does multiple things in one statement that would have been written over 5 statements by a novice programmer. It's shows the reader how smart you are and how adept you are at using the language. But it just makes me wanna give up trying to understand the concepts because I can't evenunderstand the examples that are being used let alone understanding the new concepts. Yes, most computer programmers have a major/minor in mathematics as well. But not \\"everybody\\" who has an interest in programming has a degree in mathematics. Quit showing off so much and just teach. That's why people buy books. To learn, not be in awe of your programming skills. If you wanna show off your programming prowess put it in an advanced section or chapter at the end of the book and call it the \\"bonus\\" chapter.<br /><br />Chapters 8 and 9 of the book, have got to be some of the most difficult concepts to understand. The section on higher-order functions in chapter 8 had me in complete bewilderment. I probably looked like I just had seen a ghost after reading that section.<br /><br />I have read almost every word in this book in spite of the fact that I felt completely lost at times. In spite of feeling a sense of hopelessness in trying to understand new concepts. I have a vague understanding of 'closure' as it relates to function declarations and local variables. I have no idea what memoization is or how to implement after having read the material.<br /><br />If you are already an expert in JavaScript and you want this book at your side, you might want to purchase it for that reason. 'Iron sharpens iron' as they say so you might gain a little in that sense. If you have never done any computer programming in your life you definitely want to stay away from this book.<br /><br />I have a strong hope that the last half of the book will be much more rewarding and practical than the first 12 chapters of the book were. Keeping my fingers crossed.<br /><br />Update: I finally finished reading the last 12 chapters of the book and they are much more practical in terms of learning JavaScript for actual client-side scripting. I find the last 12 chapters much more enjoyable than the first. A very good thorough book but not without its faults. It's like a really good movie with some badparts. Overall, I would recommend buying this book. There is probably more good than bad.
B0000073NC|4.0|This was the second hard rock scorpions release. the first is the more psyh rock flavored 'lonesome crow'.  This one is more accessible and has the classic song 'speedys coming'. The rest are more hendrix inspired and the band had yet to get it's true bearings. The next release would see that change into a fully modern metal style that was the scorpions own. Gone would be the long psych rockers like 'fly to the rainbow' and instead the hot guitar driven sounds of what would really be modern metal would come to the fore. This is still good early metal though and a must for any scorps fan. Casual fans who are not psych rock fans might enjoy the groups catalog after this one though.  But if you give it a chance you will find a great cd of well crafted and sung songs in the early metal / early 1970's style of hard rock.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Series 2 equals and even betters series 1 in many ways. If you're an avid fan of the show then I think you'll like the Blu-ray set.  All the episodes, even \\"The Christmas episode,\\" are included in this set and appear in completion.  It is a region free set so it plays in US Blu-ray players.  The sound and picture quality are comparable to other Blu-ray movies and shows I own, and enhances the viewing of the show as the scenery is practically it's own character.  This is a worthwhile buy for Downton fans eagerly awaiting the next series to begin airing in the US.
B0002XNT0I|4.0|Product arrived as described in Amazon listing.  Played flawlessly in my (old) DVD player.  Movie was as moving / powerful as I first remembered it many years ago ... ironically, the content is still relevant in the 21st century!  Seller packaged everything well ... no damage to product.  My only disappointment was the product did not have a paper insert with artwork / pictures ... however, at this price point, I can't really argue.  Would recommend buying this product from this seller.
B000W93CHC|4.0|The plot is very good, some questionable twists and turns, but definitely believable.<br />I question the need for so many sex scenes; in my opinion not necesary to keep the attention of the reader since the story is so good otherwise.

If you're not a Directioner but you like beautiful British men, buy this book. aaaaaaaah i am giving up on punctation ad properness while i fangirl and dance and scream and then die!!!!!! its true im dying. I look at one picture of Mr. Payne and im DEAD. im alive...but im DEAD. one direction infection is getting worse....im just silent. ....voice is numb...i try to scream out my love and it makes this harder! and the tears stream down my face-- Okay, sorry for that seisure-like outburst and singalong. Its 1D Infection at its worst. So buy this book and at least you'll die happy.

B0081L37Z0|4.0|I had low expectations for \\"21 Jump Street\\" and wondered to myself why you would make a 1980s Fox drama into a movie, as the television series was something of a stretch to begin with.  There've been so many terrible remakes/reworkings of old TV shows that I wondered why you'd bother, but \\"21 Jump Street\\" does take some liberties with the original and toys with the formula a bit.  It's the combination of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum that drives the movie as the two really click and do so masterfully right from the start and maintain it throughout.  The script is also hilarious with many in-jokes that poke fun at the obviously ridiculous premise of these two twenty-somethings trying to pass themselves off as high school students.  The choice of Ice Cube to play Captain Dickson was similarly brilliant as he brings a manic intensity to the role.  Hill and Tatum are transferred to Jump Street to try and infiltrate a high school drug ring and what unfolds is often hilarious and never dull, with a lively mix of humor and action.  There's no ridiculous overuse of CGI here, just Hill and Tatum going through a series of false starts, mishaps, and mistakes.  I won't give away how the movie concludes, but there's a wonderful homage to the original cast in a cameo that was a mix of gruesome and hilarious.  There wasn't a second of this movie that dragged and it was probably one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen all year.  I can only hope that the team that put this together decides to leave well enough alone as far as sequels go as you'd be hard pressed to do better than this!
145210655X|5.0|After hearing about this book, I put it on hold at the library, thinking it would be a good surprise for my SW-loving husband.  As it turns out, he happened to be at the library with me when I picked up the book, so we leafed through it together.  Some of the pictures were really great; others were just okay.  My husband liked that there were some of the original movie quotes in there.  And we both agreed that the humor implied in the book is even funnier now that we're parents, since we can better relate to Vader's perspective as the dad.  This book is no longer a surprise for my husband (it's more of a fun, one-time read), but we've gone ahead and purchased a copy from Amazon for my husband to give to *his* dad, who's also into Star Wars.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|I had pretty low expectations for \\"Rock of Ages\\" as it's based on a fairly insipid jukebox Broadway musical that I similarly found to be a waste of time.  The hair band rock of the 1980s is so easy to mock and ridicule that almost everyone has taken a shot at it; what more can you add?  The answer is not much.  The premise of \\"Rock of Ages\\" is as bland and predictable mix of sex, drugs, and rock n roll as well as hopes and dreams.  Sherrie Christian (Sister Christian anyone?) hails from Tulsa and hopes to break into the Hollywood music scene.  In a predictable and contrived scene barback Drew Boley tries to thwart a robber from stealing Sherrie's belongings and suddenly the two are together.  It almost sounds like a musical...oh wait...it is!  And it doesn't get better from there.  From there an endless array of characters are introduced which only serves to muddle things and at the same time plays into the whole predictability.  Club owners trying desperately to save their club, if only people could embrace rock, but curses, they need something new and innovative.  A famous rocker agrees to a performance to help wipe out his debts.  The complications and plot lines multiply from there and despite a fairly all-star cast they aren't given much to do and most seem to be either on autopilot or ridiculously overdoing it.  Oddly enough, the only person capable of reining in the crazy is Tom Cruise in the role of rocker Stacee Jaxx, who plays the role with aplomb yet keeps it from going over the top.  Clearly Cruise is trying to rehabilitate his box office poison image and goes a long ways towards that here, but even he can't help salvage this dud.  I'm not even going to both with the plot and how the movie unfolds except to say it defines by-the-numbers predictability right up to the finale which you could pretty much have guessed in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Even if you like 1980s hair band metal this movie is going to bore you as no one wants to pay to see actors essentially doing upscale karaoke, and bad karaoke at that.  Change the music and you could have had \\"Golddiggers of 1933\\" \\"Singing in the Rain\\" or \\"A Chorus Line\\".  I was bored stiff at the 30 minute mark and honestly, it didn't get better from there.  There is absolutely nothing about \\"Rock of Ages\\" I can recommend or which redeems it.  I should have taken the words of Dee Synder and said \\"We're Not Gonna Take It!\\"ors essentially doing upscale karaoke, and bad karaoke at that.

B0058BI896|5.0|I never watched this show originally when it first came on television, because I'm not much of a TV watcher. Recently, it's been tough finding good programs on cable that last for any length of time. Just when I get into a show, I find they cancel it, and it seems my tastes and the programmer's tastes never match. Sitcoms that have been on forever, I can't stand and ones I love get cancelled after the first season. So when The Big Bang Theory first came out, I didn't watch it. But Ryan loved it, and my little brother loved it and my best friend giggled about it behind my back...LOL So I sat down one day and started watching some reruns of it on a marathon on one of the cable stations, and I was hooked.<br /><br />Sheldon is so much like Ryan it's funny, but he's a lot like my nephew too (who has Asperger's), so it's sort of neat to see someone with some of his struggles, but in a humorous light and also shows how intelligent he is too. Sheldon is functional, but he's surely not socially adept, and his confusion about social interaction is hilarious.<br /><br />Johnny Galecki is funny, and if you've ever seen him in interviews and such, you can see what a great actor he is, because he's really not a lot like his character on the show. Yet, Leonard is awesome on the show. He's the go-between, not quite a complete nerd/geek, but definitely not in the 'normal' realm either.<br /><br />By this season, they actors have really come into their roles well, and I'm enjoying the series quite a bit. It has definite laugh-out-loud humor moments.
B004M5HKIY|2.0|The publisher would do much better offering a pure scan of the original. The eBook format does NOTHING but duplicate the text and images into a jumbled mess.<br /><br />I would have given it 1 star, except for the fact that we love the original material.<br /><br />Shame on Houghton Mifflin for destroying a classic. More evidence that less publisher and more author is just better.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|If you want my advice, listen to the first four songs of the album, and skip the rest. What starts off as a fantastic musical journey to the deepest depths of a very creative mind, turns into compilation of utter absurdity and overall crap. Don't get me wrong, \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" and \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" are nothing short of amazing, and \\"Easy Way Out\\" sounds as if It's coming straight out of a 1960's Pirate Radio station, but nearly EVERYTHING else is just annoying (\\"State of the Art\\" being possibly the most outrageously irritating). People like Gotye because he is doing things that many people have never heard before, and a few songs on this album deserve the airplay they have been getting, but there is a fine line between being unique, and being ridiculous. Unfortunately, over half of this album falls into the latter category.<br /><br />The best thing to do, is buy \\"Making Mirrors\\" (solely for the purpose of starting out great), \\"Easy Way Out\\", \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\", and \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" off of iTunes for $1.29 a piece. You'll get what's worth hearing for half the price of an overall disappointing album.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Thoughtful and good conclusion to the trilogy. Not as engaging as the second. The Joker is a tough act to follow. But lots of talent. The best cat, most believable, ever. An ending worthy of the series. A must see, a little less than hoped.

1590710037|4.0|International bestselling author, Steven Pressfield, says what keeps writers from their craft is Resistance. Resistance, as he describes, is invisible, internal, insidious, implacable, impersonal, infallible and its aim is to destroy, like a demonic entity looming over us, waiting for a way inside our creative world.<br /><br />Much of this information has been talked about before, but Pressfield adds his own brand of freshness that, at times, is tinged with humor. The chapters are short, making it easy for readers to bite off small pieces of information. Great if you enjoy reading a little and then meditating a little.<br /><br />For the most part, I enjoyed the book and walked away with a bit more insight than before; however, not all of the book's content was a perfect fit. Here's an example. On page 68, the \\"How To Be Miserable\\" section, Pressfield states, \\"The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell, whether he knows it or not.\\" He sets the stage by using marines as an example to live by. \\"Marines love to be miserable. Marines derive a perverse satisfaction in having colder chow, crappier equipment, and higher casualty rates than any outfit of dogfaces, swab jockeys, or flyboys, all of whom they despise. Why? Because these candy-asses don't know how to be miserable.\\"<br /><br />In the last paragraph of this segment, Pressfield concludes, \\"The artist must be like that Marine. He has to know how to be miserable. He has to love being miserable.\\"<br /><br />Really? Why? Maybe it's an age thing or the fact I've come a too close to how short life can be. Either way, I can't see purposely being miserable as an answer to anything. There's already too much negative in the world. No need to set out the welcome mat or invite it over for tea.<br /><br />Some, not all of the book's content has this hardcore edge and some people might find this attitude therapeutic. I'm not one, but like I mentioned before, I walked away with more knowledge than before and isn't that a good thing?ore and isn't that a good thing?
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|Moneyball is one of the best movies I've seen this year. It has a great story, acting is very good as well (Brad Pitt did a good job). Highly recommend even if you are not a big baseball fan (like myself).

LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|While I enjoyed the whole trilogy, I think the first one is the most fascinating as it introduces you to the world and the magic system. You follow along with Vin as she learns about her powers and the powers of those around her. This series has such an interesting and well thought out magic system with believable limits, not too weak, not too powerful. The world seems so real, the characters are all well written.<br /><br />The payoffs as the author answers some of the mysteries about this world are great, but often he just gives you more questions to be answered later. Just when you think you have things figured out and you know how it's all going to end, it turns a complete 180. Although the ending was fairly satisfying, the book was so good I immediately had to get the other two and was not disappointed with how he ties everything together at the end of book 3.

B0012Q732O|3.0|10,000 BC is a prehistoric fantasy. To me, it has a flavor of Dances With Wolves meets Jurassic Park with just a touch of Mad Max's Beyond Thunderdome. The movie has numerous scenes of stunning beauty such as majestic snow covered peaks, golden sand dunes, and a sea filled with boats that have massive, vivid red sails to name a few.<br /><br />The story is okay. At the beginning of the movie, a narrator tells the legend of how a beautiful blue eyed girl, the lone survivor of her people, came to live with the tribe and the prophecy associated with her. I liked that the movie didn't have crude or foul language. I think that aspect created an appropriate ambiance for the simple lifestyle of the prehistoric tribe.<br /><br />One of the earlier scenes with the woolly mammoths reminds me of the old elephant jokes. In tribute to them I'd like to say: When the wild herd of stampeding mammoths came running across the terrain the ancient tribe recognized them immediately because they weren't wearing sunglasses.

B00005JKDQ|5.0|Welcome to the Himalayas! Snow cone? The comedic flair of Monsters Inc. with Billy Crystal and John Goodman is sure to tickle your funny bone. Cycloptic Mike is so Crystal and I love it when he is so excited about being in a commercial and on the cover of a magazine that when his image is blocked, his enthusiasm remains. The bloopers at the end are funny too. The movie is fun for children and humorous for adults as well.
0385344228|5.0|Andy Barber has been assistant district attorney for more than twenty years and has a reputation for being respected in his community, formidable in the courtroom, and has a beautiful family with his wife, Laurie, and son, Jacob. But when a classmate of Jacob's is killed in a local park the shocking crime shatters their New England town when Andy discovers his fourteen-year-old son is charged with the murder.  Laurie and Andy try to protect their son but a dark secret from Andy's past threatens the core of their family and may even jeopardize Jacob's case before the trial begins. As the trial progresses Laurie has doubts about her son's innocence and has to come to terms with the fact that her son might be a killer after all. The shocking conclusion will leave you thinking about this book long after you finish it and it would make a SUPERB movie on the big screen. Definitely a well worth it read and I would try other books by this author.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Cars has a good message and little boys will especially like the characters on wheels. When shiny Lightning McQueen takes a detour from the highway to Route 66 he learns that speed isn't everything. This movie is a keeper with Paul Newman as Doc Hudson. The cast of characters is excellent and Mater's comments are funny.
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|I liked that they worked on making a female based action movie (La Femme Nikita being the excellence marker).  I thought most of the main character's moves were believable, if EXTREMELY slow...especially the parkour moves. I was amazed at the number of heavy hitter actors playing in this movie, but did find it interesting that they all changed their line delivery to match hers. This added to the slow feel to the film. I might have given it four stars for plot, but they never did wrap up dad's story line. Was he the real deal or just an author???  What dad let's his little girl run off and fight the bad guys without tagging along or at least throwing a punch??  Just saying...<br /><br />Not an impress the date movie, but worth spending an evening telling the screen how you would have done it different!!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

B0059XTUB8|3.0|I bought this movie for a girl but I still thought that it was extremely overrated. I never really thought I was watching Mariyn. I felt like I was watching Dawson Creek. She got nominated for this role. I don't understand how. I would call it a dump on a plate.
0345803485|5.0|I am a fan of the Twilight books and enjoyed the story between the characters.  Because these books were based on them, I could see many similarities between the characters' relationship.  And yes, I can give credit to the point that many others have made that the story's wording can be repetitive, and there are some obvious errors (i.e., if the characters are Americans in Seattle, why do they use British terminology?)  If you're looking for a book to read that was well written by an author who has really mastered their craft and has the most expansive vocabulary, then I'm sorry.  This book is NOT for you. (Please also keep in mind that the author started writing stories online and one day decided to develop her stories into these books.  She was an average person just writing for pure enjoyment.  If YOU wrote a book out of the blue, do you think your work would be perfect either?)<br /><br />If, however, you're looking for a book about a complicated but engaging love story, with the occasional descriptive love scene, then this series may be for you.  Especially if you are like me, an adult that loved the Twilight books, then you may really get a kick out of these books.  However frustrated I may have gotten at the author's ability to write, that in no way hindered me from enjoying the plot of these books.  I laughed, cried, and had to take cold showers, because however bad the writing may be, the story was very enjoyable, addicting, and provided me with a delightful escape from reality. I love these books and can't wait to read them again!

B004LWZWGK|4.0|The level of anticipation and hope surrounding this movie has been beyond the pale. Already, backlash against negative reviews from fans who haven't even seen it has caused major changes over at Rotten Tomatoes, and by now everyone's heard of the horrific events at Colorado. Even in Seoul, I witnessed yelling fights, crying, and at least one person telling his friends, in all seriousness, that he didn't want to hear anymore joking about the film since \\"this was something they should take seriously.\\"<br /><br />The story of Batman is one that lends itself to grimness, that much is true, and this latest installment is no exception. In fact, it is arguably the darkest of the trilogy, all of Batman's \\"rising\\" notwithstanding. The film picks up eight years after the second. Batman hasn't been seen since the death of Harvey Dent, both Bruce Wayne and his businesses are noticeably crippled, and although Gotham City seems to be experiencing a (relatively) strong era of peace, it is based on a lie that Commissioner Gordon can barely bring himself to tell over and over again at public functions.<br /><br />Enter: Bane, a beefed up anarchist with an intelligence that's probably on par with his max bench press. Bane's troubling influence begins causing serious challenges that Bruce Wayne feels compelled to rise to meet, and along the way he encounters some of the same old faces (Fox and Alfred), as well as a few new ones (a brash young cop named Blake, an equally brash & young cat burglar named Selina, and a beautiful energy investor named Miranda). Our hero doesn't rise as smoothly as one might hope, though. His corporate enterprise is on the verge of collapse, and he must contend not only with Bane but also with a public that has long-since scapegoated him. He's beset on all sides, and the clashes -- emotional, spiritual, financial, and physical -- begin to overlap in a slapdash, nearly exhausting way. Viewers hoping that the movie will provide a sort of moral rifle scope will be disappointed, and why not? When a building collapses, it is impossible to trace the path of every crack that appears in its foundation, and when the movie hits its grim, second act finale, the only thing that's really clear is that things are about as bad as they can possibly get.<br /><br />There's no sense in giving away where things go from there, although I will say that the movie starts to hone back in on what really gives the Batman ethos most of its juice: the conflict you get when revenge pretends to be justice, when a would-be-noble-savior finds his greatest motivation out of hate and fear, and whether or not a world is worth saving when it seems perfectly willing to sacrifice itself for a present and momentary safety. In spite of the film's sprawling script and wild-n-wooly plotting, the end result is crisp, clever, and satisfying (without succumbing too much to the Traditional Happy Ending).<br /><br />It's too bad, however, that so much is lost in translation. Give the film a good post-viewing musing (or watch it a second and third time), and serious flaws can be seen in quite a few places, most notably Bane and his story arc. I've since had Batman-philes tell me that all of these supposed plot holes are ably explained by the comic books, but people have got to start realizing that adaptations of books are not supplements to those books. They are (or should be) self-contained. If I have to go read a book just to understand that book's movie, then the movie has failed. Likewise, there are some serious fudges in a few of the film's timelines (let's just say that, on more than one occasion, the film pretends like some things -- even small things, like landing/boarding/taking off in a plane -- take far less time than they really do).<br /><br />Ultimately, the film suffers (if not mildly) from a common Third Movie Flaw, which is the attempt to spread the audience's sympathies over far too many characters. Instead of providing rich and compelling conclusions to the tales of two or three people, we are asked to empathize with something like over half a dozen completely different people. There's just not enough butter for the size of the bread that this film holds out, and as a result, the movie lingers on people you don't care about (Modine's Police Chief Foley) and gives unforgivably short shrift to major names (Bane's story is dismissed so cavalierly that it plays like visual whiplash).<br /><br />Overall, I would call it a satisfying film, but its own pomp is meant to inflate too much more than it should (this is even evident in the Hans Zimmer score, which is so over-the-top in places that it seems to be mocking the emotions that it is meant to impel). No doubt many will find it a bit sloppy and hard to follow, and others might feel like, in spite of its 150 minute run time, the movie is oddly insubstantial. Then again, maybe Nolan was just trying to put as much in as he could for his coup de grace, and I don't fault him for that. The end result is certainly worthy of its placement in the Nolan/Batman oeuvre, even if it feels like Batman only rises long enough to have time to wave goodbye.ions to the tales of two or three people, we are asked to empathize with something like over half a dozen completely different people.

B00170GXQ2|5.0|The book was shocking in its day and I feel that is the only thing that kept the book alive 100 years later. If not for movies like this to make the book more interesting to today's culture and society, then the book itself could possibly become irrelevant and lost within the sea of better written literature.<br /><br />Movies like this give old, dead Dracula new life.<br /><br />Excellent cast, well acted characters, visually stunning, and it fascinated me. I am actually a book person all the way and I rarely, rarely prefer a movie over a book. In this case, I was glued to the TV and each pause in the movie and commercial, since I was watching it on my Roku box for free on Crackle, left me wanting to watch it without interruptions so that I purchased a digital copy so I could watch it again and again even though I watched it for free (with commercials) on Roku.<br /><br />If you love the book and want to watch a movie that follows the book to a T, this isn't for you. The story is broadly interpreted and really the main similarities are the names of the characters only.<br /><br />But if you want to see a visually stunning horror  for the sake of the film itself, I think this is excellent. Finally, if you haven't read the book it really doesn't matter--you could still enjoy the movie. If you watch the movie and then read the book, you will say wow, this is totally different than the book.<br /><br />I usually watch movies once and that's it. This one I loved so much that I know I'll watch it again and again.<br /><br />Easily grade A from me.
0307592731|3.0|The following interview was taken from my blog, the Singing in the Wood.<br /><br />I've been reading more and more books lately outside my \\"comfort zone,\\" but I began reading this book by Cheryl Strayed thinking it would be a work I could really enjoy.  My interest was really piqued by the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) reference.  I've hiked off and on over the years (more off than on lately, but I am getting back to it), and that includes the PCT around and about Mt. Rainier in Washington State.  I enjoy books on nature as well as spiritual journeys, so I imagined this book to be right up my alley; I was wrong.<br /><br />Initially, I was deeply taken by the book.  In particular, I found its writing to have an unusually strong and unique narrative voice.  (Early on in the reading, I even made an attempt or two to contact its author who lives just an hour north of us.)  The love affair with the book wasn't to last long, however.  Some important issues got into the way: namely the author's lifestyle and the way in which she glorified it in her writing.<br /><br />Lost is really more like an autobiographical snapshot than anything else, and it's the non-fiction classification which presents one of the few writing quality criticisms.  Non-fiction would seem to imply a book is without fiction, but I am profoundly skeptical that Cheryl Strayed truly recorded the order and nature of her wandering mind with such meticulous care while engaged in such a difficult physical endeavor.  The level of details, as well as seamless weaving of the flashbacks into the account, all read more like a work of fiction than non-fiction.<br /><br />It takes a great deal of effort to record experiences accurately along the trail.  Even on a day hike, this can be a challenge to do well.  There is little mention of her taking notes or journaling daily.  There is also little  reference to her efforts to photograph her surroundings--which might have helped explain the rich level of recollection and the details.<br /><br />While I am skeptical of the factual accuracy of her account at times, many reading this likely couldn't care less.  Does embellishment in non-fiction matter?  As an author, I believe it does.  Yes, there is probably a certain degree of creative exposition in much of the non-fiction market.  The good non-fiction author, however, usually will identify it as such--Eric Metaxas' Bonhoeffer, Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy is a case-in-point.<br /><br />Similar to my criticism of Tracie McMillan's recent book, my problem with Cheryl Strayed's approach to non-fiction is that it seems to be hard to pick out what's true and what is likely an embellishment. When important dimensions of the novel are placed in question, the rest of the work also is cast into a different light.  Strangely, a related problem with the work is a little harder to articulate.  In simple terms, \\"a sense of place\\" seems to be conveyed infrequently. This may seem contradictory because of the above comments on the level of details...but sense of place goes beyond the factual details present in a work.  My problem, I think, rests on the author's narcissistic and constant inward gaze into herself.  This myopic view tends to create an inconsistent sense of place for the reader.<br /><br />This introspective and bare honest narrative seems almost confessional at first.  Perhaps as a Catholic, that's why I initially found it somewhat appealing.  The problem, though, is that it's confession for the sake of confession and not for the sake of forgiveness or redemption.  When confession is divorced from seeking forgiveness or embracing positive change, then it's nothing more than tell-all sensationalism.  It's indeed hard to believe this misguided author enjoys reading Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor; perhaps she is a follower of the Church Without Christ.<br /><br />I suppose it's that tell all approach that really is troubling.  Let's just say there is too much information (TMI!) here.From her menstrual and masturbation observations to shooting up heroin and lewd sexual behavior on a public beach at Brookings, Oregon during daylight hours, she details a life in serious need of repair.  In fact, let's talk about that beach item a bit more, because the lack of shame in this author's account reveals a particularly deplorable character.<br /><br />You see the photo to the left?  This photo was taken years ago as we as a family enjoyed the public beach on the south end of the town of Brookings, situated on the southern Oregon coast.  Based on Cheryl Strayed's descriptions, this could be the same beach--the same rock--on which she and her companion engaged in lewd public behavior.  Why is this sort of behavior praised by other book reviewers and promoters--like Oprah?  Is this behavior that we find acceptable as parents and concerned citizens?<br /><br />In short, Lost's author details a journey that could spark redemption and change in her life's direction; perhaps it has had a positive effect in the end.  As a reader, though, all that she seems interested in is sensationalizing her escapades in the guise of a confession--but without a meaningful expression of guilt or desire to change at her core.  It's an account that ultimately seems devoid of true depth of character, and it mistakes physical strength for inner strength.  It embraces the culture of me at the expense of real truth and spiritual answers.<br /><br />Moral relativism may be popular with the culture at large--and apparently to the Oprah crowd--but serious readers recognize that it is a lie.  Abortion, drug abuse, sexual immorality, and anger at the past people in her life are an abyss that this traveler doesn't seem to confront so much as try to wish away.  It makes the reader hope for the best for her...but be all to grateful to let the book itself become lost.From her menstrual and masturbation observations to shooting up heroin and lewd sexual behavior on a public beach at Brookings, Oregon during daylight hours, she details a life in serious need of repair.

B002Z8LPZ4|4.0|I'm no fan of Kate Beckinsale by any stretch, but this film was on my queue of films that got bad reviews but had a premise that interested me.  So with no expectations at all I started watching 'Whiteout' and was thoroughly entertained by it's characters and deliberate old school thriller pacing.  I don't know who said it, but this film is essentially a western, and looking at it in that light it has alot of strength.  Beckinsale plats US Marshall Carrie Stetko, posted at a US research camp in Anatarctica.  The story concerns a series of murders relating to the mysterious cargo of a crashed Russian plane from the 1950s. Like a western, the main focus of the film is the examination of the character and morals of it's protagonist, who is haunted by the guilt of a murder in self defense she committed. Otherwsie 'Whiteout' is a Mcguffin story, and if you're only interested in \\"what's in the box\\", you're not going to enjoy this film.  'Whiteout' is about character and setting.  The film had some pleasant surprises for this viewer, in that it was nice to see (for a change) the extreme weather of Antarctica rendered fairly realistically... 100 mph winds, -50 F temps have a visceral, scary, believability.  I was happy there was no throwaway nudity or sex scene, it makes Beckinsale's character stronger.  At one point an escape scene used a bit of realworld hardware that I wasn't expecting.  Most important the climax of the film was not violent, which I think is probably where alot of reviewers got disenchanted with the film, but I found it refreshing that the writer chose to keep the established character relationships intact at the end, rather than throw in some gratuitously sour betrayal scene. This alone made the film special to me, but especially in the context that the film is a WESTERN. I think Beckinsale and the rest of the cast did a great job in their roles. I think if you enjoyed 'Copland' with Sylvester Stallone, you should give this film a look.

0345803485|1.0|...I decided to read this book to see what all the hype was about, and well-I must say that it most certainly is a very easy read.  The book starts off fun, and a bit enjoyable at first, but then the writing takes a turn for the worst (right after the first few chapters).  Mostly, I found that this book started to have repetitive theme.  Most of the dialogue started to become repetitive, as were most of the sex scenes.  I didn't find myself connecting to the main character, and I found that Mr. Christian Grey is a bit too fantasy-like.  In all, the book had a very adolescent appeal to it.  I'm sorry, but I'm a woman in my mid thirties, and I've spoken to other women between the ages of 30 and 40 years of age,and some had very mixed reviews.  Some say this book really made them hot and heavy and that they thought it was the most exciting thing that they ever read, others didn't share the sentiment.  I didn't find this book arousing or exciting.  I found myself mostly laughing aloud, at the cheesy dialog that this book oozed, and rolling my eyes, and telling myself (sometimes aloud) \\"oh, please,\\" and \\"really?\\"--This book is definitely not the best erotic novel that I've ever read. Basically, I forced myself to get through the book,in hopes that it would get better at some point and time. It never did. I found that this type of book is misleading to the younger generation of woman who are just starting to find themselves (where sexual relationships are concerned).  I don't think the character of Anastasia is someone to idolize, or look up to.  She doesn't seem to be able to make the best responsible decisions for herself.  In fact, throughout most of the book, she isn't thinking clearly, most of her thoughts come across as whiny, and she ends up submitting to Mr. Grey's ideas of a courtship. The character is seriously confused, and weak. I think I will go back to real authors worth reading like Dan Brown, James Patterson, Dean Koontz, and my favorite author of mystery,supernatural, and yes even erotica... the lovely Anne Rice.  Now Ms. Rice knows how to get someone hot and heavy, as she playfully masters the art of foreplay in her writing works, and engages you in real stories(whether they are fantasy or supernatural, or historically linked), that are worth reading.

B006RUJST6|5.0|\\"An incredible breath of fresh air with characters I will forever be inspired by!\\"<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's debut novel \\"Slammed\\" was referred to me by several authors I have come to know through my reviews.  I decided to give it a try and was incredibly surprised!  If any of you know how I feel about Flat-Out Love by Jessica Park (my all-time favorite and most inspirational book I've read to date), you will be shocked to know that \\"Slammed\\" CLOSELY rivals FOL in my opinion.<br /><br />When an author can grab my attention in the first few lines of their novel, I am intrigued.  When they can continue to keep me vested in not only the plot line but also the characters and their development, I am shocked.  When they can put it all together to create a book that inspires me, I am head-over-heels in love with the author!  Colleen Hoover....I adore you!!!<br /><br />\\"Slammed\\" is a story about fate-plain and simple.  If you ever doubted whether or not fate exists, read this book.  After facing incredible personal tragedies, both main characters (Will and Layken) find their lives fatefully entwined in ways they cannot deny nor ignore.  I was immediately shocked with the ethical dilemma they are faced with and even more so when it turns into a very intricate moral dilemma.  The main characters are so well defined and have such incredible backstories, it shouldn't seem believable...yet it does.  So much so, you just lose yourself in the story and forget everything around you.<br /><br />The supporting characters have their own backstories which make them equally intriguing and help add to the plotline and its' development.  As the book progresses, every character is faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges; yet they all continue on their road of development and their experiences contribute to the story in such amazing ways.<br /><br />You will feel each and every emotion the characters are feeling.  You will cry, laugh, furrow your brow in worry and sometimes just smile shyly to yourself at the sweetness.  Don't get me wrong...this is NOT all romance here.  While the underlying story is a romance, there is so much more to the story I really hesitate to even label it a romance.  This is a drama through and through with a romance thrown in to balance out the emotional impact it makes on you.<br /><br />When I found out that Ms. Hoover wrote this book in only a month, I was shocked to say the least.  This story is so well thought out and each character so lovingly molded, I have no idea how she accomplished this in so little time.  When an author is good, their debut novels are usually pretty good.  You can still see room for growth and experience, but overall you can see a successful author in the making.  With Ms. Hoover, it's like she was dropped down on earth an already well accomplished author.  Her writing style and techniques will keep you glued to the book.  You simply: Can. Not. Put. It. Down.<br /><br />Within 5 minutes of finishing the debut, I was reading the sequel as I couldn't stand ONE moment away from these characters.<br /><br />This book is simply fantastic.  From the first page to the last page, the story is utter perfection and instilled so many emotions and inspiration in me.  I will carry this story with me forever.  Incredible debut novel Ms. Hoover!  I also now have several Avett Brothers songs on my iPod!<br /><br />-Just My Opinion  books.mommysopinion.com  FB: JustmyopinionNH  @JustmyopinionNHile shyly to yourself at the sweetness.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|\\"Witty, Energetic and Refreshing!  I wanted to BE Rose Gardner when reading this!  First item on MY list is to read the next novel in the series as SOON as it's released!\\"<br /><br />This novel is an incredibly intelligent mix of mystery, romance and suspense.  With \\"Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes\\", Denise Grover Swank weaves a tail of intrigue and suspense and doesn't forget to throw in a little murder and romance just for fun.  She has created characters with such depth you are drawn in immediately and keep turning pages until it's over.  I really enjoyed this book!<br /><br />The character development is amazing with regards to the main character, Rose.  From the very beginning pages, she is determined to make some major life changes-even if her hand is mysteriously forced.  As the book progresses, we get to see her character change in such dramatic ways that she goes from the straight and narrow to a suspect with the police!  Her whole existence is now based around improving and LIVING her life-and it's so much fun to watch her achieve her goals.<br /><br />Did I mention the hottie living next door to Rose?  He's very mysterious and always in the right place at the right time for Rose.  There is lots of intrigue surrounding his character and while some of it is semi-predictable, it doesn't detract from the story at all and you hardly notice you've already figured small aspects of his character out.  Trust me on this, there are some larger parts you will be very surprised by when they are revealed.<br />The balance between the characters, the mystery and the romance is just perfect.  Ms. Swank didn't bore you to tears or give too much information when it came to describing scenes, yet you will feel each place Rose goes and every emotion she experiences.  Secrets are unburied and the reveals leave you feeling raw and vulnerable, yet immediately soothed by romance.  One of the things I loved about this book is how much you truly sense what Rose is going through.  She makes you laugh out loud, get all teary-eyed and then feel fiery and independent.<br /><br />This novel is a TRUE \\"Coming of Age\\" story and Rose is a much more independent and stronger person than she gives herself credit for right from the very beginning.  It will be interesting to see how much more her character grows in the novels to follow.  I'm really looking forward to them..... I can't WAIT for more Rose!<br /><br />-Just My Opinion  books.mommysopinion.com  FB: JustmyopinionNH  @JustmyopinionNHhe makes you laugh out loud, get all teary-eyed and then feel fiery and independent.<br /><br />This novel is a TRUE \\"Coming of Age\\" story and Rose is a much more independent and stronger person than she gives herself credit for right from the very beginning.

B006LSZECO|3.0|It kept me interested but was less than what I expected after reading reviews.  I like a book with twist and turns but feel the way the author did this in the 1st half was misleading. I feel the writers adjectives were a little over the top, like a college student trying too hard to be a \\"writer\\".  Good books take outlandish stories and make them close to believable, or they are such a clever read, the reader may provide the writer with some slack.  I did not beleive the events as they occur (or the characters) were close to realistic and did not feel generous with providing this leeway.  Although not necesary, I tend to enjoy a book where I like or respect at least some (even one)character(s).  Perhaps I'm too idealistic, but it is good to cheer for someone.  There were no characters in this book that I cheered for, that I liked, or respected.  I had no one to cheer on.  That makes the ending somewhat anticlimactic, unfinished, and unrealistic (not believable).  It is OK to have a bad ending where the good person dies or loses, it is obviously great  when they win.  Whatever the ending (good or bad), a dramatic, thought provoking, emotional, or suprising end is useful.  But this book(?)... Did not get any of the above - no real emotion at the end.  It just ended.

B007XNAOS0|2.0|Am I just not getting it?  Everyone is so far up this albums ass but I just can't get into it... Baroness has stripped it down and gone for a more straight forward approach. I'm fine with being straight forward and understand that they just don't want to repeat themselves and progress but what made Baroness special is that they were a unique band that merged technical music and made it flow which was awesome!! Now they are just another ok rock band.  The vocals are also mixed blisteringly loud that cool guitar parts are berried in the mix and the overall music just sound quiet.  While John B's voice is pretty good it's not so great that it can carry a whole album.  Big disappointment :(

B0068AWO00|4.0|Colin Farrell! Really??? Colin Farrell!?!?! Yes! Colin @#$%ing Farrell!<br /><br />Man.... Am I sick of remakes. Arthur, The Thing, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Conan the Barbarian (With NO Arnold)!!! So please forgive me when I wasn't that thrilled to see a remake of yet another 80's classic this time starring McLovin. The problem though was that this remake was actually a blast from beginning to end. Both Colin Farrell and McLovin were great! I couldn't believe I made it through the movie let alone enjoyed it. So get ready for some entertaining cinema.<br /><br />So to begin, the architecture remains the same from the original Fright Night. But has been updated with some newer special effects, story and more relevant comedy. Some characters were also tweaked a bit for a more 2010ish vibe. None of these changes are bad or annoying and some actually improve certain parts. It had a great blend of the right amounts of comedy and horror and didn't really go overboard with either. Not going to bother going into the plot as I'm hoping by now most of you have seen the original. So this isn't your usual remake that has been coming down the pike. A four to five star remake in my opinion (marked it  four, but really close to giving five as well). So give it a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S. And before I get a comment about it. Yes, I know that the 1980's \\"The Thing\\" was a remake, but come on....
B004EPYZXK|1.0|and just as interesting as watching actual space footage. NASA did some Apollo missions to the moon, most notably Apollo 11 and 13, others were canceled due to budget reasons and the last official Apollo mission was 17 done in 1972. According to this film though there was a secret mission in 1974 where a couple of astronauts went up to the moon thanks to the U.S. Dept. of Defense's money and they go to the south side of the moon.<br /><br />Of course according to the makers this is actual NASA footage uncovered in 2011 and shows the reason we've never gone back to the crater filled moon over our planet. After landing they goof around a bit on the surface then weird things start to happen, like scary noises, odd shadows and shapes appearing out of the corner of their eye and the typical horror cliches as both guys freak out as they are by themselves against an unknown terror.<br /><br />This movie is not what I would call an artistic success, due to the PG-13 rating there's a lot of cuts from anything reasonably scary, most of the time the camera goes all static or blank when something terrifying is supposed to be occuring. The acting is pretty blah and there's not much of note worth mentioning, so I would avoid it like the plague. * out of 4 stars.
B0067QPVD2|2.0|As a pre-quel to the 1958 and 1982 films \\"The Thing\\" has a bunch of people in a remote lab in Antartica where a paleontologist named Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead \\"Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World\\") along with said group find some incredible discovery that is of course something that can change the fate of the world. This discovery turns out to be an alien being that has been encased in ice for years upon years and once its thawed it begins to turn everyone against one another as this being can mimic anyone it touches so who can you really trust?<br /><br />If you've seen the previous films you know what to expect here, the usual build-up with the eventual creature attacks and the face/off between the remaining characters as they fight to survive. The initial scenes with the exploration and discovery are decent, once the creature comes to life (which doesn't take long mind you) it becomes a typical horror flick. Its kind of a goofy looking monster but isn't nearly as bad as many other sci-fi/horror movie monsters have been.<br /><br />Personally this is one remake/pre-quel they could've done without, it really doesn't tell much more that we didn't already know. Sure there's a little tension, a few jolts and the acting is ok for this type of flick, Mary does shine as she's one of the breakout stars in Hollywood in my opinion. It doesn't involve much thought as its fairly straight foward and to the point. As stated in other reviews, the last few scenes do tie into the beginning of the 1982 film which I guess was a decent touch. However its really kinda boring as most of the characters are throw away and one dimensional. *1/2 out of 4 stars.

0345803485|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey, what can I say? You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this one out. Mostly about childish behavior and erotic sex. If this turns into a movie, there is no justice. My brother, Joe Porrazzo, wrote a wonderful mystery novel that is head and shoulders above Fifty Shades. It's called Solemnly Swear and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend giving Solemnly Swear a chance and not waste your time with Fifty Shades. I wish I didn't waste my time and money.  Logon to [...] for more info! You will be glad you did! Joe's book would make an EXCELLENT movie!!!!

I read an interview with the Director who was adament about how many times they edited the elements of all the dialogue simply to ensure all that was said had a purpose - to make you cringe, jump, laugh, etc. - and it is so apparent and makes this movie an absolute gem.  Watch it and have fun!

B008E374T0|5.0|This album is near flawless! No track needs to be skipped. A way better album then \\"American Slang\\". \\"Slang\\" , felt like a forced follow up to \\"59 Sound\\", with a few great tracks, but still didn't feel as fluent as the former. With \\"Handwritten\\", nothing feels forced, every track is catchy as hell, and the lyrics go way deeper. This time around it feels less like Brian is telling stories of his own and less based on fictional characters. Not once is, Virginia, Mary or any other woman mentioned. It feels like he's letting his guard down a bit and allowing himself to be more vulnerable in his lyrics. It makes for a better album. You will enjoy this record. Roll the windows down, and turn it up LOUD!

1451683405|1.0|Current neuroscience appears to presuppose that everything occurring in human mind could be explained based on the physicochemical laws, which are basically the law of cause and effect at least in any macroscopic phenomena in the human brain.<br />(1)The essence of the author's view on Free Will:<br />A section on pp. 7 - 14, which carries a title, The Unconscious Origin of the Will, the author refers to the modern neurophysiological experiments (using EEG, fMRI, &c), which have been initially stimulated by Benjamin Libet's experiments in the 1960s to 1980s. The author writes: \\"These findings are difficult to reconcile with the sense that we are the conscious authors of our actions. One fact now seems indisputable: Some moments before you are aware of what you will do next -- a time in which you subjectively appear to have complete freedom to behave however you please -- your brain has already determined what you will do. You then become conscious of this \\"decision\\" and believe that you are in the process of making it (p. 9).\\" Hence, the author concludes that Free Will is an utter illusion! Probably, the author summarizes his scientific basis for this conclusion in these 8 pages. In these the author tries to persuade the readers to discard the illusion of Free Will on the basis of cause-and-effect relationship, which is the law of nature, at least for the macroscopic phenomena in the physical human brain: \\"The brain is a physical system, entirely beholden to the laws of nature (p. 11).\\"<br /><br />What is the definition of \\"the unconscious\\" (in the section title) the author intends to tell the readers? Probably, the answer is written on p. 23: \\"At this moment, you are making countless unconscious \\"decisions\\" with organs other than your brain -- but these are not events for which you feel responsible. Are you producing blood cells and digestive enzymes at this moment? Your body is doing these things, of course, but if it is \\"decided\\" to do otherwise, you would be thevictim of these changes, rather than their cause.\\"<br />Also on pp. 38 - 39, the author writes: \\"This is certainly an ability [to do what, upon reflection, we believe we should do] that people possess, to a greater or lesser degree, and which other animals appear to lack, but it is nevertheless a capacity of our minds that has unconscious roots.\\" Hence, if I correctly understand the author, the unconscious [of the author's definition] does the role of your mind as well as the role of the body consciousness [defined in (2) below].<br />All the rest written in the book are, from my view, rhetorical arguments to persuade the readers (including the US Supreme Court Judges) that Free Will is an illusion in any situations in your life experience, but no need of worry about it because, after all, we have been living in this world for more than 2000 years without knowing the record of brain fMRI. For example, on p. 41, the author writes: \\"You did not pick your parents or the time and place of your birth. You didn't choose your gender or most of your life experiences.\\" Very probably, you agree with the author except the last one [i.e., most of your life experiences]. Why not to say \\"any of your life experiences\\" if Free Will is an utter illusion! The author's rhetorical arguments, produced by his \\"unconsciousness\\" (of his definition), successfully persuade most of the readers of this book to give 4 or 5 stars to him.<br /><br />(2)My view on Free Will:<br />In my view, the rationality of the author's concluding the illusionary Free Will originates from the limited definition of the \\"unconscious.\\" Surely, our physical body is making countless \\"unconscious\\" decisions (in my view, we had better say that the countless \\"unconscious\\" decisions are made by the \\"body consciousness\\" in other terms: see Note [1] below). But we human has another kind of the \\"unconscious,\\" which have been discovered in the study of dynamic psychiatry; this has been extensively reviewed by Henri F. Ellenberger in his book, The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970). The term, the unconscious, invented by conscious-ego psychologists, is very much unfortunate. Probably, from the view point of the \\"unconscious self,\\" the conscious ego is not conscious enough to realize its own origin! It should be better to note that the so-called subconscious self is the shallowest part of the unconscious self and closely connected to the conscious ego.<br />Now, I would like to save the Free Will by postulating that your \\"mind,\\" which originates from the unconscious self (not from the unconscious of this author's definition), controls your brain to determine what to do next, and the awareness of the decision by the conscious ego is expressed by using the brain.<br /><br />Very probably, the author rejects such idea of the \\"self\\" because modern neuroscience has no supporting facts to accept the idea. And the idea is \\"dualism,\\" which was discarded a long time ago because (a) there is no established idea for the interaction between the mind and the brain, (b) if, however, any interaction is supposed, then the law of conservation of energy is violated, as the author's friend Daniel Dennett writes in his book, Consciousness Explained (1991), &c.<br />I need to respond to (a) & (b):<br />(a)We know many modern dualists with their own reasoning based on experimental data to subscribe to the idea, though they have no mathematical equation for the interaction. As I stated above, the interpretation of the Libet-type experiments differs from each other, depending upon his/her being a materialist or a dualist (or a mental monist). From my view, there are many circumstantial evidences to support dualistic view; for example, the idea of \\"reincarnation\\" by the late Ian Stevenson based on their huge field data, if not definitive. Other examples are included in (b) below. By the way, according to the field data on probable \\"reincarnation\\" compiled by Ian Stevenson et al., we could say, contrary to theauthor's statement above, that \\"You did pick your parents and the time and place of your birth. You could have chosen your gender. Of course, under the conditions you encounter at rebirth.\\" The author is sure to say that the idea of reincarnation is not an established reality. I agree with the author; it could never be established as long as scientists confine themselves in a closed understanding of the physical dimensions, that is to say, they remain to be a diehard materialist. But the existence of Stevenson's data means that the author, if he really is an impartial scientist, should not neglect the facts when he makes the above-mentioned negative statements, which are very much rhetorical to make his argument appear persuasive to the readers.<br />(b)There is a 105-year-old \\"weighing the soul\\" experiment by Duncan MacDougall, in which he showed a probable violation of the law of conservation of energy (LCE) in life-to-death transition of human. You may say that the experiment was scientifically too sloppy to accept the result. Is it really so? Please take a look at the paper published in 2010: Rebuttal to clamed refutations of Duncan MacDougall's experiment on human weight change at the moment of death, Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 5 - 39, 2010. In this paper, probable violation of the LCE in several well-known psychological transition events (i.e., life-to-death, trance channeling, OBE, & alternating personality in MPD patients) of human is suggested based on circumstantial evidences. These \\"psychological\\" transition events are a blind spot for physicists. If violations of the LCE in (some of) these transition events are verified, these events would also support the idea of dualism, and would undermine the materialism, at least.<br /><br />The trouble with the materialistic science, including neuroscience, is that most mainstream scientists are advancing on their own track, putting on the shelf all those unexplained cases, which are reported in (a) the legitimate psychical research, (b) the Kirlian photography of human body (in Dr. Thelma Moss' The Probability of the Impossible [1974] & The body Electric [1979]), (c) human energy fields (in Dr. Shafica Karagulla's Breakthrough to Creativity [1967] & [with Dora Kunz] The Chakras and Human Energy Fields [1989]), and (d) possible soul of inanimate things (in Geologist William Denton's The soul of Things: or Psychometric Researches and Discoveries [1888]). How can an impartial scientist, neuroscientist in particular, be sure that he/she is advancing on a right track, putting all these relevant unexplained cases of human consciousness on the shelf!?<br /><br />My conclusions after reading this little book are: (1) If the author really were an impartial scientist, he would not have published this book, and (2) The author reveals himself being a diehard materialist. Please forget about the 1 star I have given this book; to buy a copy of this book or not is all up to your Free Will!<br /><br />Note [1]:<br />(Probably, Geologist William Denton and his collaborating psychometers who performed psychometry for him would have loved the following idea.)<br />A certain psychical knowledge [Ref. 1] tells us to the effect that we, one self, have three parts: the inner self or inner ego [that is the \\"unconscious self\\" in the unfortunate term, which does not directly belong in the physical dimension], the body consciousness, and the ego consciousness. To one extent or another, these three systems of consciousness operate in one way or another in all of the species, and in all particles, in the physical universe. In our terms, this means that the proportions of the three systems might vary, but they are always in operation, whether we are speaking of a man or a woman, a rock or a fly, a star or an atom. The inner self [who disconnects its ties with the physical dimension upon death] represents our prime identity, the self we really are.

B000I5XOVE|5.0|This is a great movie and pretty good transfer. One of the strongest films in the series and one of the best sequels of all time. Much better than the third installment where the film really drops the ball. I highly recommend this movie that is still a great roller coaster ride even compared to todays films.

075640407X|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has a unique and refreshing outlook on fantasy.  The way he tells the story of Kvothe is something that takes me by surprise and leaves me delighted.  The character voices are so clearly characterized and the descriptions give you just enough detail that you can clearly picture the whole story.  From the archaic magic system to the rich culture of the troupers and varying cities, this first book leaves you eager to pick up the second.  I enjoyed Kvothe's infernal cleverness and wide range of emotions and reactions.  Everything had a clear motivation and the character interactions never left you thinking they were out of place.  To be honest, there wasn't a single part of the book I disliked.  I pine for the 'older' Kvothe who is relating the story, and I want to cheer on the 'younger' Kvothe in his adventures.  Even the side characters leave me curious- each one feels like they have their own whole story, just waiting to be learned.<br /><br />I was delighted with Name of the Wind, and I can't wait to read the second book in the series.

B008IBPTFE|5.0|I just finished Downton Abbey Season 2. I watched the first episode on my Kindle Fire, then switched to my TV via my Blu-Ray player. It took a few minutes to get the registration process complete, then a few more minutes to figure out how to search for the show. Scrolling through the TV programs available was NOT the way to go. Once I got it going, it was great! I look forward to finding other TV series' to watch via Amazon Prime! Better yet, I hope they quickly release Season 3.
0345803485|1.0|I'm glad I got this book from the library because I would be angry if I'd paid for it. I am not a snob; I read romances regularly and while I didn't expect this to be great literature, I hoped it might work well as a guilty pleasure. The plot doesn't bother me--Timid Virgin Meets Cold Alpha Male is a traditional, if hackneyed, romance plot and can be entertaining if handled well. If Harlequin had issued this, they would have titled it \\"The Billionaire Tycoon's Love Slave\\" and edited it down to a 40,000-word novella. The BDSM doesn't bother me, or the fact that this is (allegedly) erotica.<br /><br />I AM bothered by the fact that the book reads like unedited fanfiction.<br /><br />The contract he wants her to sign is repeated, verbatim, three times in the book. Then there are the endless, boring emails between the two. And what must be 3,000 sex scenes. And the nonstop references to his godly looks, her lip-biting, her blushing and what have you.<br /><br />I finished reading it--if you count flipping quickly through the last third of the book as reading--because his character was just interesting enough to keep me from tossing the book down. (Her character isn't at all developed.) I won't bother with books 2 and 3.<br /><br />It's also not genuine erotica, unless you think one clinical sex scene after another after another after another is erotica. I have read plenty of mainstream romances that are far hotter than this. Even BDSM is no longer edgy these days; Harlequin's Carina Press has a whole line devoted to it.<br /><br />The cynic in me tells me the publisher didn't edit this so they could stretch it into three books. It might have worked for fanfiction. For a novel, it sucks. I do like the covers, though. Kudos to the designer.

0307352145|5.0|Have you ever wondered into which category your personality may fall. When I hear talk about personality traits considering introverts and extroverts it just seems so final, I feel there has to be more to this. In fact when I have come across stereo-types used to describe introverts, many times I have thought well this is not correct. Being an introvert myself, I just know that I am not anti-social, what extroverts commonly label introverts to be. Like everyone else I love a good conversation, with someone new even, however it must have meaning. That is where the line between an introvert and an extrovert  begins to blur. We are also not lonely people or loners in fact we love to be alone, we are our own best friend. When I came across \\"Quiet\\" I immediately felt I had to read this book. What could Susan Cain have written to clarify or educate others on this topic?<br /><br />I myself have always felt misunderstood for the very reason that I hate large gatherings and small talk and Cain talks about this many times in her book. If you are an introvert who has felt like you are living on the wrong planet I highly sympathize with you and you should really read this book. In \\"Quiet\\" you will learn that introverts are more common than many think because many extroverts pretend to be introverts to fit in social situations.<br /><br />Extroverts, more so introverts who act like extroverts, will also be enlightened by this book, so much so that it can actually help them with their health. Imagine acting out of character for a prolonged period of time, years even, of suppressing emotions just in the act of trying to fit in when you are really an introvert. Susan talks about how acting out of character can compromise your immune system,  lead to illness and these emotions can later leak out at the wrong place and time. I have seen this all my life in very close friends and relatives and it actually makes me sad, because these people try to be who they are not.<br /><br />Over the years I have wondered why when I gave in to being around large groups of people for extended periods, or when attending school I would be totally exhausted when I came home, even needing a nap. Susan explains how introverts recharge by being away from others, and alone, while extroverts relax by being around others and needing that connection to feel charged.<br /><br />I myself have been told that I come off as a snob or someone who thinks that I am better than others. Those who are not educated on the personality of the introvert or how a true introvert tics, for some reason can feel this way. I say true introvert because throughout my life I have never really been affected by what others thought of me when it came to my personality. I have always refused to play what I call \\"the fake extrovert.\\" But for those who take the chance to get to know me realize I love to talk, have a great personality and get along with just about anyone.<br /><br />Coming from a long line of introverts, as every one of my siblings are introverts,  including extended family, uncles cousins etc. We have always been labeled as quiet by those friends who have connected to my family, including in-laws and so forth, and I have been ok with that.  Yet I have watched family,  some fairly close to me in age, who  I went to school with and I personally know the are introverts, play this fake extrovert to acquire friends or feel like they fit in. To this I say to each his own. I would rather be myself and lead a healthy long life, sit on the sidelines and keep my conversation within a couple of people when it comes to parties and social gatherings. As like all true introverts I bore easily from small talk and need someone just like me with a highly stimulating topic to keep me energized. The only time I tolerate  social gatherings are with close family and I always end up with a migraine at the end of the event, especially if a large group of people are present.<br /><br />I learned a lot from Susan about why I feel the way I do. and I also learned some things about extroverts. I say some things, because being an introvert, when it comes to extroverts most of what Susan talks about I already know from personal experience. I can truly say I have one-up on the extrovert when it comes to how they tic. Considering we introverts spend 99% of our time being watchers this does not surprise me at all.m Susan about why I feel the way I do. and I also learned some things about extroverts.

0345803493|5.0|Ana is taking life one day at a time, ever since she walked out on Christian Grey, three days ago, after the horrific episode with the belt, returning everything he ever gave her. She tries to focus on her new job with SIP, but it's not easy. The apartment seems too empty, what with Kate in the Barbados. And she misses Christian more than she can say. Imagine her surprise when she receives an email at work... from Christian... asking her if she wants a ride to Jose's exhibition the next day. Holy cow, she forgot all about it!<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />The idea of seeing Christian again is both torture and heaven. What else can she do but say yes? The next day at the office drags, and her boss, Jack, seems unusually attentive. When Christian arrives to pick her up, he takes an instant dislike to Jack. He notices immediately, to his displeasure,  that Ana has lost weight, just in the few days they've been apart, and presses to know when she last ate. He flies them in Charlie Tango to the exhibition, and Jose is dismayed to see him there. Ana is surprised that so many people know who she is, but the reason becomes apparent when she sees the seven large photographs of herself that Jose has put on display. And which Christian promptly buys.<br /><br />Leaving the exhibition, Christian takes Ana out to eat. It's obvious how much they've missed one another and how much they want to be together. He has a proposition for her, of a different kind. He wants a relationship with her--a vanilla relationship without any kinky f***ery. As in forget the contract, start all over again. She protests that she likes some of that kinky f***ery, and he smiles.<br /><br />Slowly but surely, Christian and Ana begin to mend their relationship. This is new territory for both of them. Christian tells her no more playroom--he couldn't bear to lose her again. Since she's been gone, the nightmares have come back. Ana thinks not everything in the playroom was bad. The biggest problem is thatshe didn't use the safe word. Why? Because she forgot. But that isn't good enough for Christian, and he won't risk losing her again.<br /><br />Ana had almost forgotten a creepy incident at work, involving a strange woman who bore an eerie resemblance to her that asked her what Ana has that she doesn't until she learns that Christian has a loony ex on the loose by the name of Leila, and apparently that was her! What does Leila want with Ana? She's not sure she wants to know.<br /><br />When Ana insists she needs a haircut, Christian takes her to a chic salon called Esclava, and they wait for the hairdresser to be free. Suddenly a very pretty and stylish blonde appears and Christian goes to her and suddenly Ana just knows who she is--Mrs. Robinson herself! What the hell?<br /><br />Crazy exes, dangerous and horny bosses, publishing wheeling and dealing, and layers of secret are not exactly conducive to Christian and Ana finding their way back to one another. Do they have what it takes? And are they each willing to put forth the effort that's required to deal with one another?<br /><br />Will love keep them together? Who's determined to split them apart?<br /><br />Commentary:<br /><br />I liked Fifty Shades Darker every bit as much as Fifty Shades of Grey, perhaps even more so, because we know the characters better now, and have gotten closer to them. I can't help but root for this young couple, and want them to be together. I think they are the perfect match, and their love is strong enough to conquer anything.<br /><br />We learn a lot more about Christian and his background in this book, and why he is fifty shades of f****ed-up. It's amazing he's as functional as he is. Interestingly, he has something in common with Dexter Morgan, but I won't say what, that would be spoiling. We also learn more about just what he does, besides owning a beauty salon and a publishing company, he is seriously into helping developing nations, both in terms of food and technology, andis working on a mobile phone that does not require either electricity or battery--a solar powered mobile phone!<br /><br />We get to see Mrs. Robinson too, and it's not a pretty picture. I think that the term is used incorrectly, to be honest, as Ana sees her as a pedophile, and the original Mrs. Robinson, of The Graduate, was not that--Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) was in college when they began their affair, whereas in Fifty Shades, Christian was only 15. Be that as it may, it gets the point across. Christian tries to excuse what happened by saying that it saved him, but I have to believe you can save a teenager without having sex with him and teaching him the finer points of bdsm. Just my opinion, of course.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in this second volume of the trilogy and I loved it, and can't wait to read more. This is ultimately a romance, not a bdsm book. The bdsm was more a part of the first book, but it wasn't the focus, simply a means to an end. The bottom line is this is a romance about two people in love and should not be compared to other bdsm books. Haters, back off.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a long book. It IS Stephen King.<br />There's an element of time travel that you have to wrap your head around. (similar to Time Traveler's Wife) You simply have to pretend that time travel IS actually possible.<br />Then you also have American History - in particular JF Kennedy era. If you're not familiar with this, or are not a fan of the subject matter, it is so well woven into the novel, that you'll enjoy the story and not be deterred from all the history blah blah...<br />And last but not least, the love story makes it all worth reading. The ending is great<br />I do have to forwarn that the story/concept does take a while to get rollin'. Just keep pushing through, you won't regret it.<br />Fabulous read.

But, with those smooth harmonies and timeless tunes - the surviving original BBs have still got it. The title track and Shelter are my favorites. Brian Wilson is still the genious behind many of these new songs (as well as MANY of the classics). Buy this CD,<br />and it you get a chance, go see them in concert! They are TERRIFIC and it's moving to see some of the video montages that are shown in the concert where they harmonize with \\"Dennis and Carl\\" (both deceased) thru the magic of modern technology. In concert, the guys do bring a few back-up singers to help fill in for some of the limitations in Brian's singing, as well as the others. But this doesn't take away from the overall experience of this classy act... the Boys can still rock and bring us joy with the \\"Warmth of the Sun\\"...
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This was an easy read. It sometimes left me wondering what was really wrong with this kid lol. He seemed to have some kind of mental disorder but the book never went into full detail about that. I didn't realize how short the book was until after I bought it. I downloaded it on my iPad before a trip to NYC and I read it going and coming back home from NYC and finished it. It was that short. Overall, it was okay. It wasn't a book that I would rant and rave about though.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Let me start out by saying that if I had not purchased the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy from Amazon, I would have stopped reading this awful trilogy before page 100 of book one.  I hate to waste money, so I have managed some how to read all 3 books.  These books are boring, very poorly written, and certainly not worth the \\"best seller\\" status and hype they are receiving.  As other reviewers have mentioned too, I got irritated with Ana \\"biting her lip\\", clambering out of bed and other places, unrealistic sexual escapades, a man 20-something gorgeous man who is a billionare and tosses money around like there is an endless supply, etc...  I mean, really, who uses the word \\"clambering\\" these days?  I found myself skipping over lots of pages just to get to the end of the chapter and book.  Books 2 and 3 of the triolgy are no better, although, the last half of book 3 was a little more interesting.  If you are looking for some good erotica to read, then don't waste your money on these books.<br /><br />btw...I didn't get the Kindle edition, I bought the paperback books.

0345803485|1.0|Ok...I've tried to write this review 3 times now, and each time I cannot come up with the words to describe this book accurately. I'll make this short and to the point. It's an awful book with repetition, repetition, repetition. The same words are used over and over, the same actions are used over and over. If you want to save yourself some agony, read something else. I enjoy books of all types, I have never put one down, no matter how bad, until this one. After reaching Chapter 8, I cannot stand to read another \\"oh my\\" or \\"jeez\\" or read about her biting her lip one sentence longer. Save yourself the agony and read something else. Oh my, I think I said that already. Jeez! I'm blushing! Yeah, its that bad.<br /><br />Kudos to you E.L. James for attempting to reach your dreams, but you epically failed on your journey.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|People clapped after every fight scene when i watched this in the movie theater that's when i knew this was a great movie.
B007UW9VWO|5.0|There's something very special about this movie. I never thought a movie about sushi would be that interesting, but watching Jiro made me feel so excited and full of joy. I hope you feel the same.
B000NDIAWO|2.0|Disk one track 3 should be track 5 and 4 should move up to 3 and 5 up to four.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As a Nerdfighter, I would probablyapprove of just about anything John Green wrote (like the wildly popular Zombicorns), but The Fault In Our Stars is truly incredible. When I got it I literally could not put it down and I ended up reading the entire book after school one day, knowing full well that I would be staying up past 4 AM trying to finish all of my homework because of it. No regrets. John Green made me feel completely immersed in the story and has the rare ability to make you burst out laughingin the middle of crying like a baby then turn you around and choke off your laughter with a sudden bout of tears. The book is an emotional rollercoaster, but that shouldn't deter anyone from reading it. John certainly didn't sugarcoat Hazel's experiences, but he didn't go with the typical &#34;let's take the most dramatic and tear-jerking plotline possible,&#34; approach of most cancer books either. He tells it like it is and makes you laugh and cry while making you rethink your view of the world. This is without a doubt the best book I've read in a very very long time. If you are reading this review and haven't read the book yet, buy the book. Right now. You won't regret it.<br /><br />DFTBA!
B007P6VLRS|4.0|Oceania is a great addition to the evolution of the Smashing Pumpkins. It's clear that Billy is doing what he wants, being very experimental and \\"playing around\\" almost, and I love that all the songs are not predictable. Unfortunately it's obvious that he doesn't have the same high/enthusiastic energy level in his voice as he did even just ten years ago ... but he's still the emotional genius we all expect and love from him. Kudos...
0439023513|5.0|I ordered this product a little while back and once I received it forgot to write a review for it...so here it is. I received this product ahead of estimated delivery, it was packaged very well, and was in brand new condition. I am very happy with it. Thank you.
0446556750|4.0|I think this is my first Michael Connelly book.  My neighbor got it from her sister-in-law. The story regards seeking a reversal of an earlier trial decision as well as a role reversal for the main character. Not having read other novels by the author I didn't have a preconception of the characters.  I liked the way the story built up.  I think the ending was rather simplistic and would have enjoyed seeing the trial through to a verdict.  It held my attention.  I was also sure the daughters of the main characters were somehow going to get involved with the Killer. Enjoyed the read.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I thought I would hate this, but I didn't. Frame rate drops when I you have a lot of water on the screen.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Trying other Kindle  versions of this book, I've found this to be the best. The illustrations are fantastic and I have yet to come across any critical errors.
B001BANK32|5.0|If you loved the movie then you will love the book even more. King creates characters that you instantly fall in love with and care about, no matter what they do. For example, in the movie you do not get to fully understand the love he has for his wife and son. In the book you get to fully experience his life before and after the hotel, and it makes for a much better story.<br />King also creates amazing scenes where you do get scared, and that cannot be found in many books these days, and anyone who loves King books knows what I'm talking about.<br /><br />If your looking for a good story or your a constant reader you need to read this book.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|Seemed like a great counting app with some pre-math- but it is not. 3.5 year old played through all levels and got bored rapidly. It is more about identifying objects (1year old ability) than it is about counting. If not for the classic Carle graphics it would not have anything going for it. Definitely not worth paying for when playing this is like asking my child to brush her teeth.
1451608659|5.0|Dominique Moceanu won an Olympic gold medal along with her Magnificent 7 teammates at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. She was only 14 years old, tiny (4 feet 4 inches tall!), cute and charismatic.<br /><br />Her life on and off the gym floor has been difficult. She had complicated relationships with her family and with Bela and Marta Karolyi, her official coaches during her champion years. Her parents were Romanian immigrants, although Dominique and her sister were born in the United States. While she loved her mother and sister, her relationship with her father was fraught with complications. He was domineering and abusive.<br /><br />The book opens when Dominique is an adult, and receives the biggest surprise of her life. Her parents had kept a secret from her and her sister for many years.<br /><br />Dominique is bitter about many things but she also gives praise where it is due. She actually adored her first coaches, but when it became apparent by the age of 10 that Dominique was exceptionally talented - Olympic material - her father whisked her away to the Karolyi ranch in Texas. She was not at all prepared for the transition. She was shy and was used to a positive environment in the gym, but in Texas she was hopelessly confused and upset with what went on. For example, her favorite coach at the gym simply disappeared (he was fired) and no one ever mentioned him again.<br /><br />Much has been made of the fact that she was miserable with the Karolyis. Actually, in this book she seems to be more mystified by their actions. After the Olympics they seemed to want to have nothing to do with her. Even though she won a gold medal, she didn't win any individual medals and apparently that was considered a failure. Even her parents were discouraged from praising her too much.<br /><br />Moceanu's body changed rapidly after Atlanta but she still kept pursuing gymnastics - because she loved it.<br /><br />She had made quite a lot of money from touring in gymnastics shows afterthe Olympics, which her father had put into building a huge gymnasium. Moceanu famously ran away from home as a teenager and tried to get her legal emancipation from her family. What happened after that is riveting reading.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I was surprised by this book. If you read enough gymnastics message boards as I do, you would think that Dominique Moceanu was the devil, or is at the very least lying in the gutter with a needle in her arm. Many people find her hopelessly bitter because she has voiced her unhappiness in how she was treated many times. Perhaps because she was so cute and spunky while performing, some gym fans just refuse to accept how difficult her life really was?<br /><br />Even before her book was released it was being compared to Jen Sey's notorious gymnastics memoir, \\"Chalked Up,\\" about that author's bitter experiences in gymnastics. But Moceanu's book is well-written by her \\"co-authors\\" Paul and Teri Williams. The book was far more detailed than I expected, although it does slide over some of the things that happened in her career after 1996, spending more time on the events that happened in Moceanu's personal life.<br /><br />Moceanu is currently happy and productive, married to a gymnast-turned-physician, and they have two young children. Her children are involved with gymnastics, since she always loved the sport, but not the outside pressures of being involved with elite gymnastics.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This is the best of the apes series. The story is very moving and thought provoking at the same time. You could actually feel sympathetic towards the apes. The live motion capture using human actors to mimic the apes is the first of its kind in the world thus lending the movie a uniqueness that is astonishing as it is outstanding with sterling (ape) performance by Andy Serkis. HAIL CAESAR!<br /><br />Picture quality 5/5, audio 4/5
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I lobe this game works good on kindle and its free it comes with like 6games then by earning points you can by more
B008JGSM6G|5.0|at first I thought I this would be too easy and a waste of a download and I was more than wrong. this game is very addicting and challenging and has plenty enough of puzzles to challenge yourself!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Love this app.  Have it on my Kindle so sometimes the grids are small for my old eyes but other than that nt a all is great!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very pleased with this game...even though it does have a zen-like quality to it, my heart rate did rise when I had a hard time cracking one of the more advanced levels. Definitely a game that will keep my interest now and well into the future!
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|This book seemed to be popping up everywhere.  I started reading a sample of this book and was not caught by the writing or story.  I saw it at my local bookstore and paged through, finally decided to buy it.  This is a strange book.  It seems like it was written by two people.  One writer focuses on corny and unbelievable descriptions of characters and \\"intimate\\" scenes--I mean they come across as stupid  and cliche.  The other writer has an interesting storyline and lots of interesting historical detail, and that is when the writing is passionate and genuine.  Unfortunately, this aspect of the book becomes less prevalent as it goes.<br /><br />There are also huge inconsistencies in the text.  For example a character leaves the room, but in the next paragraph that absent character responds to the dialog happening in that room without reentering.  Things like a vampire cant be around someone because they desire the blood so much, and then this issue magically goes away.  And is the main character supposed to be competent or not?  It appears the main character is trying to be a wilting violet and a powerful person at the same time.  This isn't different aspects of the  character, it's waffling.  Near the end she is constantly fainting or passing out.  Well she does live on toast & eggs.<br />The other featured character,  big & strong, a warrior (sadly not female), doesn't defend himself at all when attacked.<br /><br />All in all a frustrating experience.  I don't think I can tolerate reading the next book in the series.  It may be different tor you; I want to read good writing WITH a good consistent story (good writing).
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I purchased this CD for the two mega-hits I recognized.  I had no idea what a great addition this was going to be.  I play it over and over and just can't get enough.<br />Adele's voice has such a richness to it and many of the songs seem to be based on a Native American type of drum beat.  I love to listen to it while working in the kitchen and find myself dancing around and getting exercise while I'm creating or cleaning.  Can't say enough good about this particular CD.  The slow songs tug at your soul and the faster ones move your feet.  A best bet.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I've read the entire series through this book and enjoyed much of it.  The characterizations are fantastic.  In fact, much of what I love about the book has come back to haunt me.  Let me get to my point..***********MAJOR spoiler alert for the whole series *************<br /><br />When he killed Eddard in the 1st or 2nd book (I forget exactly), I expected it  It was good.  But then he started killing off everybody to the point of annoyance.  I wanted Joffrey to die a vengeful death and his killing was pathetic.  Arya was setup to be a young girl warrior.  She never became the character she was setup for.  I keep waiting for her to break out in a epic sword battle.  Was it really necessary to kill Robb stark and never show retribution against the Frey's.  What's going on with Bran?  How any books till he \\"flies\\".  Why was Robbs message to \\"de-bastardize\\" Jon never sent and acknowledged by Jon?  And seriously, did he have to off Jon in this book?<br />Will I read the next book?  Probably.  But expect to be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|seriously where's the challenge? is it for 2 year olds or what?? waaaaaayyy too easy!!!!!! its boring how easy it is.
B007USWD0U|4.0|In \\"Le Havre\\", the latest in a long line of deadpan character studies from Aki Kaurismaki, the Finnish director weaves a deceptively simple tale about an elderly French author named Marcel (Andre Wilms) who is taking a hiatus from writing, opting to make a less-than-modest living shining shoes in the picturesque port town of Le Havre. In a dryly amusing opening sequence, Marcel and his fellow shoe-shiner Chang (Quoc Dung Nguyen) stand by impassively at a busy metro station, wistfully tracking the parade of shoes worn by the passers-by, not unlike a dog who sits by the dinner table with infinite patience, fixing a Mesmer stare on your fork as if willing a morsel to fall its way.<br /><br />Hell of a way to make a living, but it seems to suit Marcel just fine. He revels in the easygoing camaraderie amongst the inhabitants of his Utopian neighborhood, and is perfectly happy to come home to his wife Arletty (Kati Outinen) and his dog Laika (played by the director's own pooch) to drink a little wine and enjoy a simple meal. One day, as he is lunching down by a pier, he is startled by a commotion of police, who seem to be looking for somebody. Marcel spots a young boy (Blondin Miguel), half-submerged under the pier and obviously frightened out of his wits. Marcel quickly puts two and two together, but keeps a poker face until the police have left the area. He offers the boy food, and, as they say in the movies, it's the start of a beautiful friendship. The remainder of the narrative deals with Marcel's efforts to reunite the boy (a Senegalese refugee who was smuggled into Le Havre in a shipping container) with his mother, an illegal immigrant living in London. As he keeps one eye on a suspicious police inspector (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) and the other on the local snitch (Truffaut alumnus Jean-Pierre Leaud) Marcel is aided by more sympathetic fellow villagers.<br /><br />Although the story is set in contemporary times, the film reminded me of Jean-Pierre Melville's  \\"Armyof Shadows\\" . There are shared themes of loyalty, selflessness and a sense of collective idealism that feels (sadly) relegated to a bygone era. Stylistically, however, Kaurismaki and Melville are quite different. To say that Kaurismaki populates his films with quirky characters is an understatement. I'd love to know where he dug up Roberto Piazza, who plays \\"Little Bob\\", a \\"legendary\\" musician who Marcel recruits to perform a makeshift benefit concert. To look at this odd little gentleman, you'd never dream that he could rock out the way he does once he's onstage (it's like the first time you saw Andy Kaufman \\"become\\" Elvis). Little Bob also gets the best line in the film (\\"She's like the road manager for my soul.\\").<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Kaurismaki's oeuvre, this might not be your best introduction (for that, I would direct you to his wonderful 2002 film, \\"The Man Without a Past\\"). Jim Jarmusch absolutely worships Kaurismaki; they definitely share the same sense of humor, as well as the same sense of, er, pacing...if that helps. You're not going to see a lot of car chases, okay? And if you can settle in with this tale's unhurried rhythms, you might just catch the compassion and humanity at its core. Think of it as a shoeshine...for your soul.
8820311003|5.0|This such an excellent reference book.  No waste space. Page after page of graphic examples.  The Italian language commentary is no problem, if  you are working in Latin, the Italian is close enough.  Happily it is published in its entirety on the web for free at  [...]  It would be very handy to have a copy on my desk though.  A new paperback edition at say $10 would be perfect.  Hugh Tornabene
B008N1V11U|3.0|I bought it but I have practicly repeated every thing on my kindlefire but it still wont downloud. What should I do?
0345803485|5.0|I suspect all the bad reviews are by folks who didn't stick with the story and read all 3 books. I thought the underlying love story throughout the books was brilliant, and kept me hooked until the very end. Very pride & prejudice, with a 'noughtie' edge keeping it uptodate. A book trilogy that really will leave you feeling all fuzzy inside, which sometimes is just what you need! Waiting with baited breath for the films, and really hope the author gets the recognition she deserves for writing such a different, edgy love story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is so easy to use..haven't had any problems at all using..games are &quot;fun&quot; and can be challenging ..a must for game players!!

B007R41E8O|5.0|I love this game and the fact it was only. 99. took forever to download. but worth the wait. I will definitely look for more of these games.

B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I loved it!!! It had all the songs from the movie.I have listened to it so many times already. If you like 80's metal bands you will want to get this CD.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|Just love this CD.  Adam has done it once again.  He has an incredible voice and as they said on American Idol, he can sing the phone book!!!
0385534639|3.0|A magical adventure that begins strong. Early on I was pulled into the magic and intrigue. Sadly, as the chapters went on, the characters became thin; little development or growth.  The book ends in a weak pathetic climax, like a string snapping on a guitar.
B007XNAOS0|2.0|Let me preface my review by saying I loved Baroness's Blue record.  I was extremely disappointed by this album, both sides (which sound pretty much the same IMO).  I am also disappointed in all the professional reviews of this album, because none of them mention how remarkably similar Baroness's \\"evolved sound\\" sounds almost exactly like Nickleback.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Excellent and educational. I love this series and learn much more every time I watch them. Would highly recommend to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Good app to have if you want to read the Bible. great navigation and settings choices. would definitely recommend to others.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DVD.  What a wonderful way to to learn about life and how it affects how we live. I highly recommend this DVD
B000JML7EC|4.0|I had always wanted to read this book but had never done it.  Mostly because, believe it or not, such a classic is hard to find in libraries.  So when I saw the free edition on kindle I took the opportunity to finally read it.  What a great read.  Get your head around the language and engage in a well written tale of adventure and intrigue.
B0000047CX|2.0|This digital remix from the original analog multi-track tapes is a disaster.  Why do today's engineers insist on second guessing the marvelous work of previous generations?  On Ipanema, the new modified balance between Getz and Astrud is terrible.  Getz's sax utterly overpowers her delicate voice.  And the new widened soundstage has Astrud so far off to the right that she sounds like she's in another room.<br /><br />I'm listening to this remixed CD using a top-end audiophile CD player and the warmth of the original mix is very much lacking.  So is the crystalline clarity of the vocals, which is now lost to the overemphasized highs.  I'm comparing directly with the original release of the song \\"...Ipanema\\", found on the 2xCD set titled \\"Stan Getz: The Best of the Verve Years, Vol. 1\\".  There, the song sounds fabulous; just like on the lovely LP.  This new remixed Getz/Gilberto CD is a stinker, as are so many remixed classics.  Look for this album on vinyl or original mix CD.
B0085783Q8|5.0|Really, what can you say about House?  This is the final show of the series (wiping tears) and, actually, I'd already seen it.  I just wanted to watch it one more time before I moved on to attachment with another series - I think it will be the Big Bang Theory, but I'm going to miss House and I may come back to see him on Amazon.com - where the movie selection is better than anyone else, not to mention the fact that you make your annual fee back if you save enough on shipping.  Also, figuring that a major competitor charges $8.00 a month, Amazon Prime is not only less expensive, but all the free shipping it brings, as well as the movies, makes it a deal I couldn't pass up - and I'm glad I didn't!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Number two game on my Note. Lots of levels. Challenging but not too much so. Perfect for wasting your time.
B00002DE0S|1.0|I would have expected better interpretations from this pianist. This is not Chopin, but Mr.  Zimmerman's ego trip abusing two wonderful pieces. The excessive tempo variations are tasteless, mannered and painful to listen to.  Best among the many recordings is Argerich with Dutoit. Zimmerman probably could not find a conductor to go along with his exaggerated straining after effect, excessiveve rubatos and diminuendos.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I was in doubt before purchasing due to the cost and being wireless, but the sound quality is amazing, the construction is solid and better yet, no cables to get tangled under my chair, which is the cause of death of over 5 pairs of headphones I've already killed.<br /><br />The signal is pretty much as advertized, I find it a bit annoying on skype when the surround is on, and sound from games can be a bit overbearing, but nothing a bit of fiddling doesn't fix.<br /><br />The lack of a quick change for default playback device is a bit annoying for me since I also use speakers, but you can find third party programs and set one of the G keys to be the hotkey to change between sound devices quickly.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with this product, in fact, my wife is pushing me to buy her a set of her own.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Apps like this are addictive. Flow is challenging, fun and a great exercise for your brain. We play it all the time.
0099579936|1.0|This book was truly awful. The plot-line was non-existent and the irritating characters & repetition made reading this absolutely unbearable. Sex scenes were meh.
B008C2GYO4|5.0|Slipknot has proven themselves to be one of the defining rock acts of my generation, and this album, track by tack, explains why. Unlike many greatest hits compilations that are haphazardly manufactured by record companies in order to make a quick buck, this one feels like it reaches out to the maggots who have stuck with the band from the very beginning. While all the radio favorites are obviously included, the mix also features trademark Slipknot songs from their shows, in addition to rare gems like \\"Purity\\" that casual fans of the band may have missed. I opted to buy the clean version because I already have all these songs uncensored, and I wanted to have a collection of Slipknot material I could play while in mixed company. Although I don't necessarily approve of the disturbingly violent artwork and having the devil on the cover, I'm extremely happy with this album. Even if you've never bought a Slipknot cd in your life, this is a great introduction to the band.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great puzzle game for any kind of person! You will not be disappointed.  Worth the price-- hours of fun!
B007XNAOS0|5.0|I must admit, I didn't really care for Baroness that much in the past. I bought their albums, but wasn't moved by them.<br /><br />Then, I listened to this new one, almost on accident, through Spotify. I was playing in background, but after about 30 minutes it dawned on me that this is a fabulous album.<br /><br />It isn't rocking hard, but super well done. This is soulful music.<br /><br />I just ordered the double CD after listening only one day.<br /><br />Great music.
B000YABYLA|1.0|Juno is a movie about a hip teen that gets pregnant. After a half-hearted attempt to go to an abortion clinic, Juno realizes she wants to keep it. She finds an adoptive family that wants to take her child. That's way before the nine months are up though, and the film is a story about how she deals with the situation as well as the reactions of those around her.<br /><br />A story like this should be ready to evolve and undergo immense changes simply because of everything involved with getting pregnant and delivering a baby. But the whole thing is static. Juno simply visits the adoptive family and what starts off as an awkward acquaintanceship becomes a strong friendship. That's all you hear about it until the baby is ready to be born. Juno just stays friends with the baby's father, Paulie Bleeker played by Michael Cera, as she was before, and despite some Prom jealousy because of her bulging stomach, they remain close friends. Nothing more. Some women comment on how painful it must be for Juno to handle her raging hormones and the baby's kicking, but until she hits labor, she's perfectly fine. Kids at school stare and she doesn't look them back in the eye. Her parents seem relatively okay with her being pregnant, stating that sometimes these awkward things happen. She's going to give the baby up so it won't screw up her life at such a young age and the parents are all too happy about not being called grandparents anytime soon. From beginning to end.<br /><br />Juno is an insufferable twit who must be afflicted with ADD, post-traumatic stress disorder, or some personality disorder common to serial killers. Her whole point is shooting off as many pseudo-witty one liners as she can, seemingly oblivious to the few statements of discomfort and outright signs of dysfunction that she encounters. The adoptive family involves the wife Vanessa putting all the personal items of the husband Mark such as guitars and other memorabilia into another room, including gloating over the poor whipped sucker. Nope, it's just another thing that she sees, treating it with the tact of a curious little kid who is so crazy about hard rock, for realz yo, and she starts playing one of the guy's guitars while randomly listing off band names to seem hip. This is the entirety of their interactions until it's time for the baby. The excessively nonsensical crap out of Juno's mouth is written as affection or humor when it's really annoying. Case in point: She describes her relationship with someone as, \\"The cheese to my macaroni.\\" A normal, sane person would say in response, \\"So you really like him, huh?\\" and then laugh while probably asking, \\"What do you do together?\\" Cue the next point: She has a wretched argument with a friend. To patch things up, she writes an obnoxious message on the porch the next morning and stuffs the mailbox with a lot of crap that causes a mess. If Juno wasn't so prone to making absurd statements to indicate agreement with people, anyone would think she did it to piss him off, but nope, it's a sign of affection. There are numerous insights into her vapid skull showing this is not only the way she acts but the way she thinks. She can't go through with an abortion because she hears each individual motion of arm scratching, gum chewing, and coughing from the people at the clinic, the sounds played up on the speakers to a ridiculous level for some attempt at comedy.<br /><br />By contrast, all the other characters are boring as sheetrock. The very few moments characters are shown on their own, they're deathly boring. The adoptive couple Mark and Vanessa have such exciting interactions as deciding on a paint color while they stare at the wall like slack jawed idiots, a scene lasting barely a minute. The characters aren't even pieces in a plot, instead they're as memorable as furniture, purely existing to be wowed by Juno's wittiness.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, twee banal indie rock soundtracks and that stupid youth culture pencil andchalk lettering is stamped like a noxious perfume. Juno's best friend, a cheerleader, is just another girl, dressing in punk skirts and torn up leggings. The baby's father being a track star, is as bony and wimpy as you'd expect Michael Cera to be, not like a real athlete. Juno is vapid wish fulfillment that blinds people with its supposed charm from anything resembling reality. Maybe that would have worked if the filmmakers realized that teenagers aren't level-headed, they're pus filled hormonal psychotic meltdowns waiting to happen. A movie about a pregnant pseudo-witty teenager, and she doesn't even get shoved into a locker or groped by knuckle dragging perverts? The only person who ever gets remotely hysterical is Juno, and it's just a standard sad scene required for romantic comedies. I want to see the movie twenty years from now where Juno is in therapy for alienating everyone she ever loved after enduring her selfishness with more patience than a saint could muster.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works well consistently and I like the hourly break down. the logo is easy to spot in my list of apps too so its easy to access.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I have so much fun with this but I have to wait til the kids go to sleep so it can have my full attention. I admit though I have to put it down after 10 or 15 minutes because I dont think its flimsyness could take even a gentle wall smashing!
B00000DATR|4.0|THe music is beautiful.  However the CD gets 4 stars due to Warner Brothers copy protection scheme on the disc that renders the disc unplayable in computers and some compact disc players.  Yes that is right, the music industry wants you to buy a CD that you may not be able to play and which copy protection violates the origial CD standard set up in the 80s thereby possibly damaging your equipment.  Nice one RIAA.  Now for the legal notice part.  Bypassing DRM (digital rights management) is a violation of the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act).  However, under the fair use clause, consumers are allowed one back up copy of their purchased materials.  There are plenty of programs out there that will bust the copy protection on the CD and create for you the files necessary to burn a back up cd (that will be free of copy protection, sorry RIAA and congress) for you to enjoy and play freely as originally intended by Sony and Phillips who originally set up the Compact Disc standard back in the 80s, and as as an added bonus, won't run the risk of damaging your CD equipment!.<br /><br />A word to the wise.  Only cds that carry the \\"compact disc digital audio logo\\" on it are compliant with the original compact disc standard that DID NOT carry any digital rights management nonsense in the standard. Back then, the world was a lot more sane.<br /><br />Otherwise, the music is quite unique and beautiful.  It carrys some more eastern overtones to the tracks other than Mr. Oldfield's earlier works.  There are 11 tracks in total, with the final two tracks being released as singles (and they are really good ones I will tell you that).  The cd itself is quite enjoyable to listen to and is thankfully readable in my stereo equipment and did not damage it.<br /><br />I would recommend trying to find a copy of this disc that does not have copy protection on it.  I do not know if \\"The Complete Tubular Bells\\" which contains all three tubular bells recordings and a bonus dvd carries copy protection on it.  As a fan of Mr. Oldfield and Tubular bells I am looking at purchasing it anyway.

I didn't buy the game.If there's a free &quot;where's my water, &quot; then there should be a free &quot;where's my Perry .&quot; I was sad when it cost money because I watch Disney channel and I've been waiting for it to come out on Kindle Fire.It was a big let -down and a huge disappointment.
B007SGM084|5.0|These three books were so good, they give you a feel of romance, laughter, sadness and suspense all in one. Have read them four times already can't put it down.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in two days, it was great! It kept my attention the whole time with all the twists and turns! Loved it!
B0083EM24C|3.0|It's quite funny how living in the second decade of the 21st century can alter your perspective about the art you consume. I feel like I'm constantly inundated with hyped reviews about music I'd be foolish to ignore and when the music itself is so easily accessible, I inevitably click play on that shiny button that spells out stream. This is a good thing in many ways, as more choice means more power to the consumer, so if you decide to actually pay for an album after you've already listened to it on a site like spotify or NPR, you know you're definitely going to enjoy it.<br /><br />There are those occasions where a band can fall folly to misinterpretation by our new culture of instant gratification though, where you might enjoy an album after a first play but still neglect to shell out for it. This is something that i'm shamefully guilty of with Passion Pit's debut album Manners, I thought it was an intriguing happy go lucky pop album with a few excellent singles when i streamed it. But if I'd actually bought the album I wouldn''t be blithely throwing adjectives like happy at Michael Angelakos and co. as there's some really dark undertones on there that only a cursory listen could lead me to miss.<br /><br />With the recent article in Pitchfork coming out a couple of days ago highlighting the problems with mental health and depression that Manners latently hinted the frontman might be experiencing, I went into this record with a whole new outlook hoping to appreciate all it's potent lyricism and indefatigable pop prowess. Unfortunately I feel I've invested my undivided attention into the wrong Passion Pit album. Manners although sugary and larger than life, rarely felt overblown in the same way Gossamer does. The lyrics whilst revelatory and quite touching, can at times feel impenetrable with Angelakos prone to making one too many grand and contradictory statements, that sometimes feel a little too much like adolescent diary entries.<br /><br />The music suffers from the same excess to, with every song on here aiming for cathartic euphoria you almost become inured to all the emotional bombast long before they end. I was hoping for Passion Pit to build on their impressive debut by scaling back some of the noisier elements for Gossamer, maturing into a band that's capable of introspection opposed to endless explosions. There are moments where their hyperactivity works fantastically however, like \\"I'll be alright\\" where Michael Angelakos bravely acknowledges his destructiveness may be harming the very person he loves the most, so he's giving them permission to walk away.<br /><br />The music on this song feels genuinely heart-warming, with the energetic instrumentation helping to reinforce Michael's tender sentiments. \\"Constant Conversations\\" is another success story that marries College dropout's soul to Dirty Projectors harmonising, creating one of best R&B songs this year. I don't wish to mar the judgements of anybody who was really looking forward to picking this up, as I should mention the production is immaculate and there are other notable highlights on Gossamer to. I just feel as though the band could've produced an outstanding album here if they just showed a little more self-restraint when they were putting a lot of these songs together, to borrow the cliche sometimes less is more.

B0085LGL5E|5.0|The Hives have been honing their craft since the beginning and this is the fruit of their labor. Nice,tight punk pop rock songs. High energy, as always, with more emphasis on rock,in my opinion, than previous releases. Similar to how they put a heavy pop touch on The Black and White album. They are simply awesome and the fact that there are only a handful of reviews of this release is dissapointing. The Hives are a treasure and any fan has to be impressed with their path and growth from the beginning. Few really, truly take a fresh approach each time and come out with what the fan wants. The Hives are that band. Melting punk, pop and rock seamlessly is not as easy as it would seem. Nevermind a review of each song, they are all good.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|wish it loaded my pics easier.  doesn't always load them.  also I wish the app had more options for the stickers and fonts and frames.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I Have met so many people that say this movie sucks, and i always say have you seen the movie? and most of the time they haven't seen the movie they just assume that because Kristin stewert is in it its going to be a terrible love story like twilight, and the movie has extremly small amounts of romance in them, that if thats all you will focus on you went into the movie wanting to hate it, and if you do that you will hate it no matter what movie you see if you have your heart set on hating something you will hate it. but this is a good movie great acting yes even from stewart and theron really steals the show she was great. but this is a good movie its not great and its not bad but it is above average.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Couldn't put this down but it's not for the lighthearted.  Cheesy perhaps some might say, but it's a great read if you need a distraction or distress.  Everyone is talking about it.
0345803485|4.0|To start off, I have read the whole trilogy at this point but I figured I would review each book as its own.<br /><br />- The basis of the book, although a bit far fetched, does get you curious enough to venture further. A bit of a dark fairy tale what with Christians ever so mentioned attractiveness and money and Anastasia who is the girl next door that catches the eye of the billionaire. The descriptions of the characters are enough that you can picture them in your head although I did have a bit trouble picturing Anastasia throughout the book. Some of the story lines seem rushed as if so much had to be crammed into a small book or the author didn't know how to fill in time gaps and hurried along with the story.<br />- The book is repetitive to say the least, the same lines, emotions, physical reactions, etc. play over time and time again (Spoiler alert* this does not change throughout the trilogy lol). I don't want to ruin it for anyone but there just could have been more variations throughout the entire series.<br /><br />To keep my review short, as my title says, it was a decent book if you don't think too harshly on the writing style and capability of the author. If you have never read an \\"erotic\\" novel before I think it'll do but there are probably more out there to choose from, this isn't the end all be all. Instead of this being mommy porn I'd more so consider it as a random interesting book for a girl in her 20's, a step up from the teeny bopper books about high school love.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting!!! I got this for my Samsung Vibrant and my Kindle Fire and I can't put it down. Highly recommend!!! :)
B0058YPG1G|5.0|As many critics have said before, Breaking Bad is one of the best series ever made. Season 4 was tremendous in every way: the writing, the directing, and the amazing cast. All of the Emmy nominations are well deserved. The final episode, Face Off, might be the best episode of any series that I've ever seen.  I've seen it a million times, and it never gets old.

B008CLI4N4|1.0|80% plodding waste of time.  I can see why Peter Dinklage is so well-reviewed, but there are few characters with any spark.  After a few episodes you start to see a predictable rotation of \\"It's about time we had a beheading/sex scene/visit from Neanderthals.\\"

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! It starts out easy and gets very challenging. I got it free but definitely worth buying

B005ZOCF5E|5.0|It's strange to think of a story spanning the solar system to be intimate, but in many ways that's how this felt.  Its primary focus is on a family mystery, grandchildren trying to unravel the legacy and mystery of their grandmother's life.  There are eventually implications for the entire system, but primarily their objectives and motivations are personal.<br />Reynolds develops a wonderful sense of the push & pull of life.  Our protagonists, Geoffrey and Sunday, try to pull away from their family, yet are bound inextricably to it.  Similarly there is the sense that as humanity leaves the Earth to explore and to live humanity is still attracted to its home planet.<br />If you are looking for space battles or lots of thrilling action sequences, this is not the book you are looking for.  If you want a response to the recent plethora of future dystopias, then the world of BRE will give you a vibrant vision a future full of possibility and wonder.
B007Y1JGOY|3.0|I'm not going to review every song here.  I really love this album but it's definitely not better than Lucidity and April Rain.  What I really love about those albums are lacking on this new one but it's still worth owning.  I know that nothing can ever replace Lucidity as their best but I still highly recommend this new album.  It's not as symphonic and gothic but I'm sure you'll really like it.  I really hope they will not completely abandon what made me love them so much from Lucidity and April Rain like many other bands have done.<br /><br />EDIT:  after listening to this several more times, I have to say that I'm even more disappointed with it.  Like I said above, what I love about Lucidity and April Rain is lacking on this one.  This is a huge understatement.  The male vocals on those albums were awesome as were the symphonic and gothic sounds.  Many of these new songs sound alike.  I'm not saying to not get this new album but it's certainly at the very bottom of the list.  I just had to update this because I was very disappointed after hearing it more times and then hearing their first two albums again.  The first two albums have much more variety as well.
034580404X|5.0|An erotic tasteful story, a hard to put down page turner,would read the whole trilogy again, unlike a movie I don't have to pay to read it again, I own it! YEA!
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|First of all, don't go into this album with expectations. I feel like too many people anticipating new albums from bands they like set standards for how the new album will sound and are disappointed when it doesn't sound they way they thought it would. Gossamer sounds absolutely NOTHING like Manners. You might find little pieces and parts of the music that point back to Manners or Chunk of Change, but other than that there are a lot of new sounds that not even I would have expected to come out of Passion Pit.<br /><br />I did have to listen to this album 3 or 4 times before I finally realized how in love with this album I am, and I suggest everyone give it more than one listen yourself. This album is beautiful, but also pretty dark at the same time. Michael really covered some of the deep personal content of his lyrics such as depression, drinking, failed relationships, money, dissociative mental disorders, etc, with happy, upbeat, uplifting, and beautiful music. If you go over to Passion Pit's website or Pitchfork there are a couple articles about the making of this album and Michael Angelako's messed up life that will put this album in kind of a different perspective. Knowing what inspired some of these songs which at first seem kind of strange made me realize how emotional some of these songs really are. Especially the last song of the album, \\"Where We Belong\\"; I was in tears when I listened to it after learning what the song was actually about.<br /><br />I think that Gossamer is just absolutely fantastic. It's not the same kind of cymbal-crashing dance party that Manners was, but this was not supposed to be. It's supposed to be more of a catharsis- letting go of all the mistakes and bad feelings of the past and moving on for hopefully a better life. It's just beautiful.<br /><br />I would give a list of some of the key tracks, but I'm having a hard time thinking of which ones I like more than others. I can just say that the worst song on the album is definitely\\"Take a Walk\\", but even that is a great song so you know this has to be a good album.<br /><br />Actually, if I had to choose favorites, they would be: \\"Hideaway\\", \\"It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy\\", and \\"Where We Belong\\"; the rest are still just amazing tracks anyways.
0345803485|5.0|I will start out with a few small caveats. First I am not a reader, so the capability this book held was to quickly trap me in and I was able to follow along with a lot of ease. Which I liked. To some of you seasoned readers this may be your turn off? I can tell where this is apparent in the books. Secondly, I was not expecting the direction this book took in the first book, I knew there was raunchy activities involved but I was not expecting him to come out with the masochistic stuff. I was completely turned off and was thinking \\"if\\" I made it through the end of this book there is NO WAY I could or even would want to resume to a second book. Though I can see where there is a minimal form of vocabulary on the author's part and sometimes it was like really, flushing, swooning, again? ENOUGH already. I did like how this innocent girl enjoyed provoking someone who she thought she was afraid of. She pushed buttons she knew she should or maybe in retrospect should not be pushing or was she really suppose to? If it were not for the ending of the first book, I would have never picked up the second book to continue reading. I was happy that she finally became brazen enough to make an action past her lustful emotions, that is what left me hopeful for a real story in the second book. I am glad I continued as the story only got better. By the time I was done with the second book, I swore that was my favorite, that is until I read the third! Now that I had finished I restarted the first all over again. Mind you, I am trying to stay vague as to not give anything away, but rereading the first book has me remembering what an intriguing start it was to the rest of their story. You really don't have to be too snooty to read past the easy vocabulary and quickly appreciate the story line that quickly develops in the second and third book of this trilogy. In all honesty though these 3 books should have been in one book in and of itself, but seeing how they can charge people for 3 books, why not? I would purchase the trilogy all over again if I had to. This book has made me believe that there may be a reader lurking in me after all? Though loving this one as much as I have I am not ready to start a new journey, I want to experience this journey again.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I instantly fell in love with this easy to read book. I have never heard of the author so based on the reviews I thought \\"why not?\\" I read the Fifty Shades books, Billionaire Series and thought this book would be similar. It's actually not as R rated as those other books but just as good. You can't help but fall in love with each of the characters. I have purchased the sequel and can't wait to read it! I might just lose some sleep again over a book.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is so much fun. Not your everyday crime drama. My only wish would be more episodes per season... and another kiss.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was great, for the first few chapters.  However, by the end, I couldn't wait for it to be over.  The writing seems like it came from a second-grader.  The same stuff happens, over and over and over and over again.  Yuck!  It needs more realistic character development, and a better voice throughout the book.  It was difficult at times, to be interested in what would happen next, especially when they do the same damn things all the time! I mean, honestly, how often can a young lady bite their lip? And how often can a man frown?  I understand that these are their motifs, however, mix it up a little, or add other dynamic habits throughout the story, please! I hope the second book gets better...
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|How do you mix comedy and crime drama?  You mix Nathan Fillion with a straight wo(man) like Stana Katic.  It only got better as the season went on.  The only problem would be that it was a half season show so there are only 10 episodes.
B005QMOZOO|2.0|If you are looking for a PD James for the holidays, it's OK - a strange, unexplained death, lots of thinking and internal dialogue by the key characters, James' hallmark style solidly in place. However, its not one of her best - the plot has weaknesses, and the book feels rushed.<br /><br />From the Austin point of view, the opening paragraphs have great fun taking off Austin's literary style. But then it gets too modern - this book is set in the pre Conan Doyle era so Sherlock Holmes /CSI clue hunting had not even been invented - yet there's D'Arcy worrying about moving the body before it has been gone over for clues.<br /><br />In another scene we have D'Arcy sitting in the back of the room during a hearing - had D'Arcy ever existed, and attended any sort of official review, he would have automatically moved to the front of the room, where one of his staff would have already taken the best seats, having booted other people out if necessary. And EVERYONE would have been OK with that, including the bootees. Because that is just how life was back then.<br /><br />So, as an ode to Austin - no. As a PD James, you would do better with another Dalgliesh.
B00884GR0W|1.0|paid for this game because I liked minecraft. hate this game because its a copy and paste with a bucket of bugs thrown in
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Another reviewer advised (wisely) that one shouldn't start this book on a Sunday night. Well that is exactly what I did, and I've been half-asleep during the day at work all week as a result. This author does a great job creating a believable universe and developing his characters. I've only started reading books in this genre (fantasy?) this year and have found the quality of writing to be hit and miss, but \\"Blood Song\\" has been a joy and pleasure. I would put it in the same league as the works of other fantasy authors such as Patrick Rothfuss and Michael Sullivan. The story starts out vaguely similar to the chapters in the \\"Game of Thrones\\" by Martin where it focuses on a character's journey to join the \\"Night's Watch\\", but \\"Blood Song\\" fleshes out that experience and spends a lot of time developing the relationships between the boys.<br /><br />I look forward to the next book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app for on the go or just to help u remember to read. I think it is a really good app and deserves 5 stars.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Amazing book.  So much more than teen romance.  Insight into family, love, life, and loss.  Definitely keep the tissues close at hand.
B005IZLPME|3.0|I expected this to be pure comic book and computer generated graphic violence.  But  it had neat period automobiles and costumes, and good actors who appeared only slightly embarrassed to be in it. The 3D was not so intrusive and the sound only a little too loud.  I would rather have some of the classic 3D movies from the 50s and 60s released, but these new kiddy-komics movies are okay for pure escape.
B005C0EH5W|5.0|I won't go into a song by song review of this album.  All I am going to say is that if you liked any of their previous albums, you'll more than likely love this one.  I think it is a bit heavier than previous efforts, which is something I am a big fan of.  Others may feel that the power chords and more complex drum work may move the group toward being classified as progressive metal.  Buy this album!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I used to dread potluck events.  I mean, sure, I'd make a dish, but I never really enjoyed it.  It took a long time, and even though I made fruit salad, it would still take me a couple of painstaking hours with my hands inside a melon.<br /><br />Thanks to Fruit Ninja, I can now make a fruit salad in a fraction of the time.  Rather than scooping the innards out of a watermelon, I've learned to just slash at it frantically with a machete.  It's a little messy, but a real timesaver.  I would never have thought of it on my own, which is why I'm indebted to this app.

B007SGM084|3.0|I ordered the \\"trilogy' as a download to my Kindle of Fifty Shades of Grey but it was kind of boring.  No real plot and lots of sex scenes which I skipped after the first one!  I would not recommend this book for anyone unless they have a boring sex life!

0395389496|5.0|This is such a fun story. The pictures are great and the cd makes this book a nice collector for the holiday.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game is kind of like \\"Where's Waldo\\".  They show you the shapes of items, and you have to find them in a living room for example.  I like the \\"hide and seek\\" games, which keep my interest for a little while.  Fun game to play when you have a few spare minutes to kill.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my son and I love this game.<br /> we have it and on both the kindle fire and on my samsung galaxy.
B0085YNML2|3.0|I am not a huge fan of this game, but figured I would give it a shot since it was free on Amazon.  I can't see paying any money for this game, even if it was only $.99.  It is a very slow paced game.  This little moster has to latch his tounge on a flower and swing to collect coins.

B002HMHROQ|5.0|This is a very high quality recording by Lou Reed. The songs are consistently strong, and probably the best set since \\"Berlin\\", top to bottom, though none are as stunningly brilliant as the 'Waltzing Matilda/Street Hassle/Slip Away/' suite from \\"Street Hassle\\" (but that's a very rarefied brilliance). 'Underneath the Bottle', 'The Gun', 'The Day John Kennedy Died', 'My House' & the title track are the best tracks, imo.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Amazing DVD - a great historical story. Well cast and enjoyable to watch - the minutes/hours flew by.<br />Any historical 'buff' would love it.

B005LAII1C|2.0|Some Reviews Listed Ted as one of the funniest movies that's ever been produced in a long time. How true that statement is? It all comes down to your sense of humor I guess. Humor is subjective much like everything else but it does have some universal rules that gives it an objective view. So, if the masses thought that a specific film is funny then it should be. Unfortunately that wasn't the case with Ted or at least from my experience.<br /><br />I won't come here and say somethings like: \\"this is the most terrible movie that I've ever seen, Just stay away from it.Oh My, the amount of racist, sexual inappropriate jokes is a turn off and everyone be as far as possible from this indecent and corrupted piece of disgusting photography that has a general outline also called as a movie for moral's sake and good old PG films\\"<br /><br />Actually the sense of humor unlike many others who didn't enjoy this film is probably not the main reason I didn't like it. I'm used to Family Guy I won't say it's the best show on earth because I personally don't find it hilarious but it's watchable and sometimes though rarely funny. The so called Shocking content wasn't also why I give this film a 2 star I'm not a Prude by any means! Actually the more shocking and inappropriate the better. The Cast was good, the premise has been done before but not in a R rated form so that was kinda new. So What went wrong? I don't know I just think this movie is somehow lacking.<br /><br />I personally was hoping to laugh like there's no tomorrow, however that didn't happen some jokes were funny but the majority of the film wasn't which is somehow skipping the point of this story, I mean it is supposed to entertain and humor you through out right? versus a couple of scenes.<br /><br />It was really hard to feel sorry or sympathetic for Ted *the main character* because he wasn't likable at all. Not mainly because he smoke pot and bullsh*t a lot. But because he just wasn't. He was obnoxious, unbearable and totally without an agenda for the future, he was just like a Paris Hilton bear version those people who do nothing all day, and just party all long and then do it all again, while the rest of the population is working their heads off for financial security. How can anyone like these people seriously?<br /><br />I think the character of Ted is quite two dimensional which is bad, because it had the opportunity to be much more. It could've at least had some redeeming qualities like a bear wisdom for example? So, yeah wasted potential.<br /><br />All in all, this movie tries so hard to be different from your average Rom/Com, mainly because it's R rated and it's about a teddy bear who can not only speak but smoke pot, drink bud lights, party, mess around, have random sex and date hookers. But that's about as different as it's going to get from a Rom/Com. A more intelligent sense of humor and witty dialogue would've really helped this movie stand out but the writing was totally ignored I guess. Because who wouldn't wanna watch an R rated movie of a Bear named Ted? It's like the producers said Oh, the premise alone should attracted audiences and makes it a good movie so why bother with anything else.<br /><br />I can only imagine Ted appealing to a more younger audience, an audience of 13-16 year olds and occasionally men. Because the sense of humor is don't ask why funny for that age category for some reason. Mainly because those kids believe that the likes of Family Guy will make them look cool, Hey I'm watching a potty filled humor tv show that my parents will kill me if they ever find out. I know everything about sex references and racist jokes now and they think am all innocent and sweet how special am I! I can visualize two 14 years old stealing this movie after it came out on dvd and their parents were watching it with a couple of adult friends while on weekend get together spent drinking beer, and just laughing their heads off at every single boring joke this film has to offer.<br /><br />I've outgrown this sense of humor, really it's no longer funny or shocking. It takes a lot for anything to be shocking and disturbing nowadays.<br /><br />You're the judge watch it and see, but wait till it comes out on Netflix or you can rent it on your tv for a lesser price.ilm has to offer.<br /><br />I've outgrown this sense of humor, really it's no longer funny or shocking.

0141439475|1.0|The book \\"Frankenstein\\" by Mary Shelley is a steaming pile of crap. on so many levels!<br />It's a complete cop out to pass time in the book by having your main character faint and go into a 3 month long fevered coma MULTIPLE times! just because they're upset?? More like they've got some sort of tumor that needs looking into!<br />Also, how can you write a THIRTY page intro to your book, explaining that it was an attempt to match the spooky campfire ghost stories you heard on vacation... and then create a monster who's demeanor and diction put shakespear to shame!<br />Call me old fashioned by I'll take my Frankenstein monster with a side of Grandpa Munster!
0439023491|5.0|What can I say that everyone has said for this book? It was amazing!!!<br /><br />Brilliant continuation for Hunger Games. Best sequel so far that I've read. Everyone from teen to adult will love this book. This time the hype has hit it right!! Suzanne Collins has a great writing style that keeps so hooked and in aah all through the book.

Although I don't think all the points are accurate for all types of businesses, I still think this is worth your while. fun, educating and thought-provoking.

B005LAIHHC|5.0|The work of Sacha Baron Cohen is astronomical.  This is his best MOVIE of all time, Borat is technically a documentary, which still holds it's 1st place spot in my book.<br /><br />He takes the idea of a dictator and makes it hysterical.  I hadn't a dull moment as I watched this film.  I felt like watching Borat, only without the documentary portion, a proper storyline in substitute.  It has a good amount of political bashing, favoritism, and even fake murders in the film.  Great job, Sacha, you really blew me away on this one.  The fact that an Englishman can act such a film as he did in any of his films is outstanding.
034580404X|5.0|What do you know, women do come with an instruction guide.  Men today could learn a thing or two from Mr Grey.  This trilogy has consumed my life for the last week.  So eager to know the next detail of this fairytail romance I was unable to eat or sleep.  This story was jam packed with fun exciting characters, steamy sex and a suprise around every corner.  I instanly fell in love with the personalities of each and every character.  James has an amazing ability to place you so close to the kinky sex you can feel Christians flock touch your skin.  While being so consumed by the romance brewing you were unable to anticipate the many suprises.  Who knows maybe stories like this will encourage women to unlock hidden desires  and men will start reading Shades Of Grey.  I know all good things must come to an end but I will be anxiously awaiting the next shade.

While it might not be the best movie I've seen, I certainly can't argue with the result. If nothing else, you'll be reasonably entertained for the movie.

0425263908|4.0|I'm sure you've heard a million times before, if you liked 50 Shades, then this book is another one to read.  Young, hot, billionaire with issues will be found in this story as well.  BUT, it's no 50... not yet anyway.<br /><br />This is a good book, but I feel like the 2nd one will be much better.  I felt this one covered just a small fraction of the story.  (smart author...)<br /><br />The only negative:  the frequency in which Eva gets mad is a bit excessive to me... for her to be the main female character I'd like for her to be a bit more logical and understanding.  She is young, so maybe her maturity will grow with the 2nd book?<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the 2nd book that comes out in October.  I've preordered already. :)

B004LWZWGA|5.0|I went to see the midnight showing that had the longest line for a film I've ever seen, and The Dark Knight Rises was beyond well worth the time I waited in line which was nearly three hours. The Dark Knight Rises is an achievement of film that hasn't been done in well in film in years and you will be reminded of great films like back to films like Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and Seven Samurai in their story, message, grandeur and scope. It's a rarity to see a film attempt it now days let alone be successful, and The Dark Knight Rises it that kind of film that everyone should see. The film is more than an event film or summer movie. The Dark Knight Rises is simply one of the best movies of all time.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of DC comics never really getting into or finding a connection with their characters, but Batman was the exception. I loved the dark tone of the comic and the villains along with the more adult story lines it became one of my favorite comics outside of Spiderman, and the X-Men. Since Batman's conception in 1939 Batman has become one of the oldest comic book characters and one of the most popular, and there have been many TV and film adaptations, and most of them I've seen have been surprisingly good. From Adam West's fun but campy late 1960's version to Super Friends, to the best television Batman in Batman: The Animated Series, to Batman and Batman Begins and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. There have been many different takes on Batman, but Christopher Nolan's is the best surpassing my favorite Batman film Mask of the Phantasm. What Nolan has achieved here with the Dark Knight Rises and his trilogy of films is truly something special, but I get to that and the director later.<br /><br />As for The Dark Knight Rises let me get to what I like first, which was everything. I'll address some of the issues some of the critics had later. The story I can't go into too much detail, because it will give away some plot points and there are a fewbrilliant twists in the movie including the amazing and satisfying ending. The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after the end of The Dark Knight. The crime in Gotham has gone way done, because of the Dent Act, which gave more power to the police. Bruce Wayne has disappeared from the public eye hiding in his mansion as a recluse living in his self-pity. He's brought out of his hiding by Selina Kyle and a mysterious Bane who brings death and destruction everywhere he goes. There really isn't much mention to The Dark Knight in the plot of the film or the Joker, and you won't notice that. The Dark Knight Rises does have many connections to Batman begins as Batman's story comes full circle. I'll stop here before I give anything away. I will say that the plot written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan is well written in story, pace and tone.<br /><br />Michael Caine is truly a superb actor and he truly wait he had better get a supporting Oscar for this film and he should win it. He is superb as Alfred and has been in the previous two films. Bring such emotion and humor as Bruce's butler, father figure and friend. He wants the best for Bruce just like any parent wants the best for their children. Another old timer who steals many of the scenes of the film is the great Gary Oldman as James Gordon. I again think he should at very least be nominated for supporting actor. Christian Bale again does great job as Bruce Wayne and a good job as Batman. Unlike the other actors who've taken on the role I think he's done the best job getting into the mind of Bruce Wayne and totally embodying the character. There are many new comers to the film. I like I think many people were a little worried about Bain played by Tom Hardy. Tom did a great job. I know people want to compare Bane to the Joker and Heath Ledger, so I will. Tom Hardy made a more vicious bad guy, but is less charismatic, which Ledger embodied in the Joker. They are two different types of villains. I wasn't as upset like most after seeing the Catwoman suit months ago. I was more upset that Anne Hathaway was cast for the part. I thought she was an overrated actress, plus I was honestly hoping for a hotter actress. My doubts were alleviated as the film drew closer and I saw that she could fill out a cat suit. Out of all the new comers to this film series I think she might have done the best job. She brought sexiness and emotion to the character and to be honest I thought she's a better Catwoman then Michelle Pheiffer. Next is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake. It honestly took a while to get used to the character who is important to the plot, but Joseph does a really good job. Finally we have Miranda Tate played by Marion Cotillard who I thought was the weakest addition to the film even though she plays an important role. Still she isn't perfect but Marion does a good job with the character and time on screen. The only real problems I had with the cast were the supporting cast. Matthew Modine was I thought miscast in the role of Deputy Commissioner Foley. He just never seemed to get into the role or do it justice. Nestor Carbonell the mayor of Gotham who I loved from his days on LOST is barely in the film. I wish they had given him a little more screen time.<br /><br />I know people may think that at nearly three hours long that it will be boring, but Nolan doesn't let the pace slow down for too long before it quickly picks up again. The special effects and action is spectacular. I like that Nolan tries to avoid using effects unless he has to instead using live actors and vehicles instead of digital renderings. It adds for realism to the action especially the climax in the streets of Gotham. The score done by Hans Zimmer was the best of his job on the series.<br /><br />To be honest I had never heard of Christopher Nolan until Batman Begins. I had heard of, but had never seen Memento or Insomnia and I question how he got the job for director of Batman Begins. He proved me wrong with the film, and I'll never doubt him again until he forces me to. After Batman Begins I've seen every film of his, and he hasn't made a bad film yet. Insomnia was the worst and it is still a pretty good film. Nolan does a masterful job of bringing his visions to life creating captivating stories and memorable characters. Through his eight feature length films Nolan truly has become a master film maker. The best in the last decade and if he continues the excellent work will go down as truly one of the greatest. What he achieved with The Dark Knight Rises and his Batman trilogy is truly something special. He's created the best comic book film trilogy and the best trilogy every. Yes even better than the Lord of the Rings. I know people would like Nolan to come back, but I don't think he should. Nolan had a vision he admitted to thinking of years ago and brought it to an end with The Dark Knight Rises. Sure he could go on, but like George from Seinfeld said always leave on a high note, and there is no higher note for Nolan then The Dark Knight Rises. Sure he continues making Batman films, but I honestly don't think he could surpass what he's done with The Dark Knight and this film. It's best to leave people wanting more, and I'm sure everyone will. Let Nolan go he's created and done something special with these films. It's time for him to create his own vision, which I'm sure he will in a few years.<br /><br />Now as I said earlier I was going to address some of the criticism critics have of the film. First some people are saying the films to dark that it's not comic booky enough. First Batman has always been dark. If you don't think so you haven't read the comics or seen the cartoons. The only Batman adaptation was Adam West versions. Even the bad Batman and Robin was a dark film. It was only funny because of how bad the film was, and now as to the general dark tone of the film. Hello almost all of the best films of all time are dark films. The Seven Samurai, TheBridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, A Clockwork Orange, Das Boot, All Quiet on the Western Front and Jaws. I could go on, but I won't. All of these films had a dark theme to their films, and these are truly great films. Dark themed films make some of the best films, because the feature adult stories with flawed and damaged characters trying to survive in a chaotic world as the seek peace and redemption. They don't always win or survive nor do they always get their redemption. That's what makes them great characters, which makes great films. The next criticism I read that the story was incoherent or hard to follow. I had no problem following what was going on. Maybe the people complaining should go see the film again and this time pay attention. Sure there is a lot going on, but the story isn't hard to follow.<br /><br />Why do people keep wanting to compare The Dark Knight Rises to The Avengers? Is it a better film? Will it make more money? Fine I will answer those questions for you. Is the Dark Knight Rises a better film? Without question The Dark Knight Rises is a better film. The Avengers is a true summer film. With lots of glitz and glamor, and explosions, but if isn't rememberable outside of it being cool to see all the hero's in one film. If you dig deeper into the film there isn't much there. The Avengers could have with Hawkeye becoming free of Loki. I know these are tuff men, but they could have delved deeper. The same could be said for Coulson's death. I thought it was good, but they could have done more. As for the money I don't think The Dark Knight Rises will make more money. The Avengers had a few advantages. First is 3D. Then there is the running time, which I think is about twenty minutes shorter than The Dark Knight Rises, which means it can be shown more often. Then there is the tone and themes of The Avengers, which is more lighthearted. That attracted the tween kids and the parents who will likely allow the children to see the film. TheDark Knight Rises has darker tones and themes along with more violence. That will keep away parents with kids who might be wanting to see the film, which in all honesty I think, is a good thing it's too dark and violent for the tween crowd, or at least that is in my opinion. Finally there are the Olympics, which start next week. That will hurt The Dark Knight a little. All of that combined will keep The Dark Knight Rises from beating The Avengers. I think it might have a chance if the word of mouth gets out about how great the film is and people keep going weeks and months from now, along with people going to see the film multiple times. Though no matter what The Dark Knight Rises is going to make a ton of money.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises is Nolan's Batman trilogy, and his best film in the series along with being one of the best films of all time with a special story, great acting, and amazing action and special effects. Everyone needs to go see the best filmmaker at the moment in his culmination of his work with Batman. It will leave you amazed and satisfied. The ending to the series the film, which I won't give away, is truly something special. Go see The Dark Knight Rises. I will be seeing it multiple times.

I quickly found myself addicted to the crazy relationship between Maddox and Abby.  Yes they're relationship is unconventional, crazy and down right not what the norm would go for, but their undeniable passion makes you see past all the craziness that surrounds them.

B00846REIS|5.0|I started reading this book and couldn't help but notice how similar it was to 50 Shades.  I enjoyed reading 50 Shades but was annoyed with the typos and lack of character development.  However, with Bared to You that is not the case.  It is written much better and the characters in the book are much more developed.  I only hope that book 2 lives up to the first one!!

B008LIRDU8|1.0|The cover displayed online for the Kindle Version is the same as the cover for the Vintage International translation by Matthew Ward (which is one of my favorites).  The Kindle version is not that book.<br /><br />I started reading the digital version and the first lines are \\"Mother died today. Or maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure\\" versus the Ward translation \\"Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know\\".  After realizing that it's not the same book as my physical copy I skimmed the rest of it - just skimming it i see that this version has lost almost all of the intensity as the original.  I skipped to the ending and found that that too is totally butchered.<br /><br />This is a huge disappointment.  I would highly advise not to order this copy.
0375869026|5.0|This is by far the most beautiful book I've ever read. It is perfect for young readers going through preteen/adolescent stages in life, but it is also a great read for any adults as well. It is a heartwarming coming-of-age story of a young boy named August \\"Auggie\\" Pullman who has a craniofacial anomaly. He has been home schooled his whole life and is finally going to a mainstream private middle school for the first time. People are generally scared of him because his face is so \\"deformed\\". The story is told mostly by Auggie himself, but it is also told from his older sister Via's perspective along with a few other supporting characters. The story gives an insightful glimpse on what school-life is like for children today, with the strong influence of classmates and social hierarchy. Overall, how Auggie learns to cope with his new life and how everyone around him learns to deal with changes shape this book in a thought-provoking, tear-jerking way. Very admirable themes and very well-written!

0061692042|4.0|I read this book in less than two days. It was so well written and the characters were so well developed.  I felt like I knew the protagonist, Dell, yet some things were just not explained. For example, why did he only see his twin three times in fifty years? There was no explanation of this by the author. Also, the title Canada does not adequately describe the book. The second half of the book takes place in Canada. Is that enough to make it the title? Also, the title does let the reader know what the book was about.  Overall, I loved the content between the covers. I should add that being a fraternal twin might have made me favor the book a little more.

B008KTA64S|5.0|I very rarely bother to write reviews, on music or otherwise.  And I can't remember the last time I played a new album over and over again without tiring of it quickly.  However, this album is so moving and overall outstanding that I've had it on non-stop repeat all day, and had to write something.  I've been a huge fan of the Gaslight Anthem for a few years ever since a friend gave me a copy of American Slang, and it didn't take me long to buy the entire discography.  I'm getting older and not much music has the power to affect me deeply these days, but these guys do it consistently.  The lyrics, the music - just so damn great, and the perfect blend of various styles.  This is a terrific collection of songs and an instant classic, and it gets better with every listen.<br /><br />Thanks again to Brian and crew for yet another incredible album.  (Now, if you guys would please someday play anywhere near Pittsburgh, i could die happy...)<br /><br />Buy this.  Support this band.  You will be glad you did.
0345803485|5.0|I cannot wait to read the rest of these series! I absolutely love the characters, and the story line. This is a book you cannot put down. Yeah, the author could have been more descriptive with her vocabulary, but the book was still amazing. All of these people complaining about the editing, find something better to do. This book is GREAT!!!!!

0307888908|5.0|This is the career book we've been waiting for! Hoffman and Casnocha respect the original career \\"Parachute\\" book - the one that started the whole career counseling movement. We have to give credit to that book, because a whole generation discovered they could take control of their careers.<br /><br />But as the authors say, this model no longer fits. (See especially pages 50-51). The world isn't static anymore. Passion alone isn't enough to create a career.<br /><br />More important, we no longer have linear careers that go from A to B to C. We have what the authors all ABZ careers. Plan A is happening now; B is the backup; and Z is where we'd like to be.<br /><br />We usually get there by a roundabout pattern, often with a component of serendipity. As the authors explain (p 151) serendipity can be proactive; it's about motion.<br /><br />We also need to stop thinking of networking as strategic transactional interactions. It's about creating genuine relationships, helping and allowing oneself to be helped.<br /><br />People on my opt-in list are probably saying, \\"Cathy's been saying this for ages.\\" They'd be right. I'm just happy that someone with the social power of these authors finally got around to putting these ideas into a book. They even recommend some of my favorite career books, including Herminia Ibarra's Working Identity.<br /><br />And now I finally have a brand-new book that I can recommend enthusiastically to my clients and friends.
B001I207M0|5.0|Whilst not being my favorite, the discovery of Janus' lab was a good addition to the series as, no doubt, the question had probably been raised by someone. Also, an additional part to the Azgard race is plausible as the Ancients went around to different places for a long time, making it logical that another technologically advanced race could do the same. Also, the long-lost Azgard brothers of the Azgard in SG-1 probably, might have, split in their efforts to stop the genetic deterioration that ended the Azgard race, known well, in SG-1. Whatever the reason, as I don't have one, the split is possible. If there was an explanation of why I don't remember what it was at the moment so if you have it you can tell me.<br />Getting back, these two episodes, this one and the last one, were very good. I understand a possibility of why the Azgard ship slipped through the Atlantian shields. It was probably because the Azgard were allies with the Atlantians and thus their technology may have been allowed entry through their shielding technology.<br />The whole premise of an Azgard race going into hiding, due to the Wraith is very plausible. Also, the instinct to stay alive, combined with the \\"Ends justify the means\\" idealism, does make the whole scenario of non-caring Azgard plausible. To establish my point, the example of their genetic experiments on humans to help with the genetic deterioration is proof that they will throw away morals in exchange for life for themselves.<br />Anyways, this was a good two episodes. Not my favorite, but it was nice to see Daniel again. He looks a little different to me. No doubt, being around Rodney, he misses Jack, Teal'c, or Sam. Some of Rodney's humor during the episode did catch my attention as possibly similar to Jack, making me wonder if Daniel would make a relation. However, Jack had a unique sense of humor.<br />Alright, good two episodes.

I am not an audiofile by any stretch,but even I can tell how muffled the sound is on the entire recording.It reminds me of the recent Black Sabbath remasters,and the Sony Legacy remasters..neither of them are remastered at all,just re packaged...and thats what this is too,I am SO disappointed by this.I just dont know what else to say.Im tempted to find the last re-release of this cd and see if it sounds any better.,

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am very excited about this series.  I love the characters and the variety of mystical creatures described in this book.

B0051UAIZG|3.0|\\"Innerspeaker\\" surely is fantastic. Tame Impala is one of the very few rock bands making good original music out there today. Since I already own the first edition of \\"Innerspeaker\\" I decided to give this Limited Edition a try. The first 4 tracks of Disc 2 are really good, specially \\"Sundown Syndrome\\", which is a super fresh cut. My disappointment started with the so called remixes on Disc 2. They sound a little bit off, not to mention they are completely useless on this album. Erol Alkan's rework for \\"Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind\\" is really embarrassing. This remix totally ruined the original version of the song. \\"41 Mojitos\\" dub mix is good, but I don't know, Tame Impala music is not supposed to sound like it's being played in some nightclub, lounge or whatever. \\"41 Mosquitoes Flying in Formation\\" from \\"Antares, Mira, Sun\\" is much better than this version. I would rather hear some alternate takes of the remixed songs or maybe some live versions. That would be much more interesting. \\"Canyons Sunrise\\" is a pleasant surprise with a charming eastern feel about it. Overall, Disc 2 is OK but I could live without the second half of it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The app is really great. I like the fact that you wont get board with 1 game. Each game is interesting to.
0345803485|2.0|I started reading this because I couldn't get away from all the hype I thought this was an Erotic Thriller. Something along the lines of Jagged Edge or Fatal Attraction<br /><br />I kept reading through the lip bitting and Inner Goddess asking \\"Where is this going?\\" Someone die all ready<br /><br />I got half way through and got too frustrated to continue I read the reviews here and decided I just cant waste my time on this back and forth constant \\"He's so hot. I love him but why does he have to hurt me\\" BS<br /><br />Some will love it others will hate it.  I just hope Impressionable girls dont try this lifestyle hoping to find \\"their Christian\\"<br /><br />It will will be interesting to see how the movie will come together Maybe this will be a rare case where the movie is better then the book!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not a bad app considering it is free. Gives me something to do when I am bored. I would recommend it.
B001AI6ZGO|5.0|An incredible album, the first by Agitation Free I believe. Definitely a middle eastern feel (as the cover suggests) with tastefully blended shots of noise, out of sync echo, etc., as you'd expect from the band -- just delightful. A more open, wild feel than their following albums. The live bonus track, \\"Music Factory Live,\\" is easily worth the price of the album by itself. Highly recommended.

I kept hoping it would get better, but by Chapter 46, I gave up.  The detailed, gruesome deaths of the animals was disturbing to me.

I am a proud grandma of two darling little boys and with this I can turn my Kindle Fire into Grandma's Brag book.  It saves printing the pictures and the quality is better.  This only possible improvement would be if it came in a zip close bag for easy storage.

0142000655|5.0|I love reading, but I'll admit I sometimes have to convince myself to read the classics. Maybe it's because they're dense, maybe it's because of all the hype I've heard, but either way it takes a push for me to dive into one.<br /><br />This book required no push at all. I loved it from page one and wondered why I hadn't read it earlier. This novel has so many layers to it that it is fascinating as a once-through read but also allows you to delve deeper into the symbolism on subsequent reads. The writing style is beautiful and the story is compelling.<br /><br />I can absolutely see why this is a classic. One of my favorite books ever.
B005LAIH54|4.0|This film is a sequel to the recent remake of Clash of the Titans.  As the Greek Gods are in decline, an outside being named Chronos threatens all existence.  Perseus, played by Sam Worthington, must return and save everyone using the combined weapons of Zeus' thunderbolt, Poseidon's trident, and Hades' pitchfork. Perseus isn't interested in a life of adventure any longer, but is dragged in immediately by fantastic monsters and the Gods.  Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes return in their roles as Zeus and Hades respectively.<br /><br />The action and adventure is spectacular in the movie.  The creatures are great, and the action is phenomenal.  In this area I would say the sequel even surpasses the original.<br /><br />However, the sequel does fall a little short in the story department.  There are so many effects and action scenes in the movie, there is little time for story.  The first movie was stronger here due to the basis on the original Greek myths, while this film just seems to have an excuse for incredible fights and flame.  Evidence in lack of story development can be found in the short length of this film (under 1 hour and 40 minutes, including credits).<br /><br />That being said, the movie is a fun spectacle, especially for fans of special effects, action, and fantasy genres.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|I love the pace of this series... No loud music, no cursing, just the way movies used to be made when movies were actually movies and not just for teenagers.  Selleck makes the perfect Jesse Stone
0439023521|5.0|I am 67 yrs old and this book and the trilogy was my best read in 40 years! The author is a master story teller and this is a creative masterpiece, sure to be a classic. War is hell, wouldn't is be wonderful if the world would depose of all dictators and live in peace.

B007O8VJBU|4.0|Music: 4 stars; compilation: 3.5 stars; bang for the buck: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Kaiser Chiefs stormed onto the music scene back in 2004-5 with their outstanding debut album \\"Employment\\" and the correlating monster hit \\"I Predict a Riot\\" (are you humming it on your head right now?). I recently read somewhere that singer-songwriter Ricky Wilson nows admits that Kaiser Chiefs really is a singles band, much more than they ever were an album band. How right he is. Eight years into the band's career, now comes this collection.<br /><br />\\"Souvenir: Singles 2004-1012\\" (16 tracks; 58 min.) brings all 15 of the band's singles in this 8 year period, plus one new track (\\"Listen To Your Head\\"). Even though the band's albums have slowly but steadily gone downhill since \\"Employment\\" (leading up to that bizarre UK/US split release of \\"The Future Is Medieval\\"/\\"Start the Revolution Without Me\\"), each album did have several great-to-outstanding singles. But isn't it telling that \\"Employment\\" produced no less than 5 singles (Oh My God; I Predict A riot; Every Day I Love You Less and Less; Modern Way; You Can Have It All), more than the other 3 albums (\\"Yours Truly Angry Bob\\", \\"Off With Their Heads\\" and \\"Future Is Medieval/Start the Revolution\\"). My biggest gripe is that regretfully this collection is not sequenced chronologically, and hence we go all over the place, for example from the new track which appears in the middle of the album for no particular reason, straight into \\"Every Day I Love You Less and Less\\" from the first album, and from there then into \\"Little Shocks\\" from the last album. Wow, it just makes for a dizzying listen at times.<br /><br />But let's be clear that this compilation contains a LOT of great music, and with 16 tracks, this is a generous serving of pretty much the very best that Kaiser Chiefs have to offer. I have seen these guys in concert several times over the years, including on the \\"Angry Mob\\" tour when they played Coachella in 2007, and they never fail to put on an energetic and entertaining set. I hope this compilation does not signal the end of the band. Meanwhile, \\"Souvenir\\" is highly recommended for anyone who is looking for having the best and most memorable Kaiser Chiefs songs in one place.to put on an energetic and entertaining set.

B0083EM24C|4.0|What does a band do for a follow-up to an immensly popular and acclaimed (both criticaly and commercially, albeit on the indie scene) album? Passion Pit's 2009 \\"Manners\\" album seemingly came out of nowhere and was just about perfect (it was my No. 2 album of the year). After tireless touring and some time off, now comes the one-man band of Passiont Pit (a/k/a Michael Angelakos) with its second full-length studio album.<br /><br />\\"Gossamer\\" (12 tracks; 48 min.) starts off with a triple of no-miss tracks, first comes \\"Take A Walk\\", an irresitable dance-along/sing-along. \\"I'll Be Alright\\" is another sunny upbeat song, and \\"Carried Away\\" finishes the trilogy in similar style. Just beautiful. At this point, the message is clear: if the formula worked before, why change it? And indeed, why. After the pensive/slower \\"Constant Conversation\\", we are back to what we love about Passion Pit, great uptempo tracks like \\"Mirrored Sea\\", and later in the album \\"Hideaway\\". Somewhat apart from everything else, track 7 \\"On My Way\\" reminds me like a Beach Boy track, with the beautiful melody and vocals (even if multiple times dubbed) harmonies. Towards the end of the album, \\"It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy\\" is another hard charging track. The 5 min. closer \\"Where We Belong\\" is a reflective tune, and not really necessary for me.<br /><br />In all, this is a very enjoyable follow-up to \\"Manners\\", almost a Manners 2 in a way, and hence lacking the element of surprise but I'm not gonna argue with it. Passion Pit avoided the dreaded sophomore slump, and that's an understatement. I've seen these guys in concert before and they were supposed to play at the Bunbury music festival here in Cincinnati earlier this month but, alas, an \\"illness in the band\\" canceled their appearance (and the rest of the tour). Can't wait to see them again at some point. Meanwhile, \\"Gossamer\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />*UPDATE* (November, '12) I finally saw Passion Pit again on their tour in support of the \\"Gossamer\\" album recently in Cincinnati, and what a show it was! Bringing a mix of the \\"Manners\\" classics and new tunes, most of them sing-alongs for the audience, just a fantastic evening!amer\\" album recently in Cincinnati, and what a show it was!

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|This movie had everything,special effects were great, a lot of money was spent on it but it lacked something.  so I only gave it three stars I guess having everything and no plot and not very good actors means a fair movie
B008H4GH9O|1.0|The publisher did a terrible job transferring this book to Kindle. Pages appear out of order. Page numbers and headers show up mid text. And odd code-like characters everywhere. Have you ever tried to copy and paste a whole page from PDF? It's that jumbled. I gave up reading this book a few pages in.<br /><br />Update 24 July 2012: to their credit, Amazon issued a refund quickly.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Good movie I would have given it five stars instead of four but I did not like the way it ended
B003O7I6L6|5.0|If you're ready to be silly.  And not only suspend your intelligence, but hang it from the rearview mirror of your car.  Then this film is for you.  It's fun.  Lots of fun.  And that's all.  There is no mythologizing.  No fable.  No deep, complex meaning.  If you read between the lines, all you will find is white space.  This is just an interesting fantasy with full, rich believable characters played by excellent actors, beginning with my favorite living actor, Kurt Russell.  And that's the highest recommendation I can give any film.  It's been a long time since I bought a movie ticket and had fun.  Today's superhero pictures are hard work.  Hollywood has turned Batman into Wittgenstein and Superman into Schopenhauer.  It's one thing to try to make imaginary characters more than one dimensional.  But today's directors have made a mess of yesterday's superheroes.  Batman mumbles to himself and Superman thinks Lois is his mother.  The supervillians are the only ones that know what they are doing in the picture.  This film is such a pleasure simply because everyone in it is either good or bad.  And it's loads of fun watching the good be so good and the bad be so bad.  If I want complex characters in complex stories with complex meanings then I'll read the Bible.  At least it makes me sleepy.
B00338QENI|4.0|I had to keep reminding myself that this is non-fiction. The author did such a great job of telling Henreitta's story. Henreitta has touched almost every persons life in one way or another and I believe everyone should know about her and her family. A must read.
B008COII1Y|4.0|I think I watch every Zombie movie I can find. Good Zombie movies are few and far between - Dead Berlin was pretty good - Zombieland was fun - the short film Zombie in a Penguin Suit was awesome...<br /><br />So where does this movie stand?<br /><br />It has a decent plot - it doesn't let low budget get in the way of telling the story. It's a unique Zombie time period setting and hey it even tells you how the zombies came into being without the use of space dust or fitness pills! YAY! :)<br /><br />Worth a watch if you enjoy Zombie movies.

0345803485|1.0|Forced myself to finish this book. There were a couple of sexy scenes, but those did not justify the poorly written soap opera in between. This is worse than the Twilight saga.
0345505387|5.0|Well, the book is great in itself and i received it right on time. I hope to have more good experiences like this one in the future.
0345803485|3.0|This is one of those novels that you need a dictionary to read. The author chose the most awkward words and dialogue for the characters. Though the lead character is a journalism graduate, I find it hard to believe that a real person would use the words the characters use in this book. WINCE and BEMUSED were used literally thousands of times in this book.<br /><br />Anyway, I chose this book from the audible site. I knew I didn't want to read it but was willing to listen to it in the car and at the gym. It is 19 hours and it has been a long hard process listening to this book. The lead character, Anastacia, is in \\"like\\" with a guy that ties her up and whips her with horse whips. She gets punished if she disagrees or dare has an independent thought outside of the guy.<br /><br />I found the sex scenes uninspiring. Harlequin romance books have much better sex scenes than this book. After a sex scene, I often would have to stop listening to the audio out of pure disgust. Whipping somebody on the butt with a crop before having sex with them is not entertaining to me. Looking at someone threateningly because they go out to lunch with a friend (Jose') is not entertainment to me. Tying someone to the pole while you f********k them is not entertaining to me.<br /><br />If you are a person who likes a woman to be controlled, abused, and beaten and then sexed then this is the book for you. As for the audio, Christian sounded like a 40 or 50 year old man based upon \\"his\\" voice on the audio. Audio book producers need a MALE to read the male parts. For this book, if Christian is 27 and hot, why did his voice sound old and NOT hot?<br /><br />Edited to add: I finished the book and it sounds like like a domestic abuse relationship.  People rooting for a lady to hook up with her abuser is just not my thing.

030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is the ultimate beach/long flight book. The writing is riveting, compelling, and the characters deeply developed. The reader will in turn shiver, laugh, gape,and shake their head in reaction to these diabolical chararacters. Readers will also enjoy the roller coaster ride guessing and changing their minds as to figuring out the real story, and at times guiltily rooting for the victim-whoever the perceived victim is at any given time in this story! Enjoy the ride!
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Not all mysteries/police thrillers fall into the category of 'literature' for me, but this one does. In fact, it was a pleasant surprise at several different levels.<br /><br />First of all, the writing is tight while still allowing us to feel the environment - a difficult line to tread. For those of us who love the 'old' American West, this novel delivers the sensations and views that we crave.<br /><br />Normally, I dread overt magical realism. (So much so that I sometimes want to slap Isabel Allende upside the head, the poor woman.) However, while this novel definitely incorporates the technique,  it works beautifully for me. It fits into the slightly mythical feel of the characters and situations - which are a pleasure to read.<br /><br />I am a long-time fan of Robert B Parker's novels, and a number of indifferent to bad novels have since compared to his. I don't want to compare Mr. Johnson to Mr. Parker (it seems unfair to two such hard-working authors), but both have managed to create very likable and interesting characters, exciting and interesting plots, and delicious prose and dialog.<br /><br />So, I do recommend this book highly. The writing was so enjoyable to read that I didn't want the book to end. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I would rarely give top ratings to anything.

B007XNAQL0|5.0|This has been on my personal hi-def wishlist since HD was invented. Overall I'm very happy with the presentation, and relieved not to be disappointed after the long wait. I'll break my specific observations down by category:<br /><br />Performance: In short, if you've even heard of Peter Gabriel, you don't need me telling you this is him at his peak. Not that I don't love the more recent work, and see the artistic merit, but he has the fire here, and it's blazing up strong. He assembled an amazing cast of musicians for these shows, and Paula Cole in particular is gorgeous and gives as good as she gets vocally all the way through playing against Gabriel (a true achievment for any singer). It just doesn't get better than this...<br /><br />Video: A lot of work was apparently invested in cleaning and digitizing the original 16mm film. There is not a scratch or speck of dirt to be seen. Overall it looks great. There's a little image softness especially in longer shots, but it's largely due to the hazy auditorium environment as much as the small image size of the base film stock. A small amount of grain is noticable now and again but that's to be expected with the 16mm original. Colors are vibrant and beautifully saturated.<br /><br />Audio: There are two audio tracks, an LPCM stereo track and a DTS-HD surround track. Neither is a bad choice for listening. The LPCM track is clean and smooth. The DTS-HD adds some very restrained ambience effects, but nothing that becomes distracting. Personally I slightly prefer the stereo track, but it's a close call.<br /><br />Overall I consider this BD a bargain at the price, and am thrilled to finally have a superior version in my concert library.<br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />Come Talk to Me<br />Steam<br />Across the River<br />Slow Marimbas<br />Shaking the Tree<br />Blood of Eden<br />San Jacinto<br />Kiss That Frog<br />Washing of the Water<br />Solsbury Hill<br />Digging in the Dirt<br />Sledgehammer<br />Secret World<br/>Don't Give Up<br />In You Eyes<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br />Red Rain<br />Steam (remixed \\"quiet\\" version paired with tour photo montage)<br />The Rhythm of the Heat (New Blood Live performance)<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Behind the Scenes documentary<br />Time Lapse film of stage setup
B007D2XSW0|4.0|First of all, I got this app when it was featured as a free app on the amazon app store, so I would not have purchased it otherwise. I am writing this review as someone who did not pay for this app. Overall, I love the easy to use functionality of the app. The icons are large and the pinch to zoom feature is very user friendly. I have not used many other photo editing apps, so I cannot provide that point of view, but for someone looking for a quick, easy way to edit your photos, this is a lovely app for that. The features I use most often are the brightness/contrast, crop/rotate and filters, of which there are many to choose from (makes it a little more fun). Hope this helps!
6305428042|5.0|I first watched Hocus Pocus on the Disney Channel in the early 90's (shortly after it's theatrical release) and remember asking myself \\"Why haven't I heard of this movie?\\". It has been vastly underrated and I can't understand why. It has everything you could possibly ask for in a family-oriented Halloween movie and I love the fact it's so down-to-earth. No cheesy, overblown, do-gooder messages like you see in most family movies these days. Instead, it's a bus load of fun!<br /> The acting is superb and you won't find a Halloween movie with a better Halloween \\"feel\\" to it, from colorful autumn leaves all around town to the warm glow of Jack-O-Lanterns sitting on inviting porches, and of course the songs \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" and \\"Come Little Children\\" are 100% captivating (in more ways than one - no spoiler).<br /> No matter what age you are (I'm in my forties), you'll have a blast watching this. Of course, I recommend it most for October viewing with popcorn in hand and no light in your house except maybe a Jack-O-Lantern candle and of course the TV screen. I guarentee this movie will put you in the Halloween spirit like no other movie can.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is great game.if I have a few minutes of time I have to get on this game.l love it.
0316098329|5.0|This was one of the most affecting books I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of a five-year old boy who has lived his entire life in one room.  His mother was kidnapped as a college student and has been living in a shed, a room, for 7 years.<br /><br />The creativity of the writing, of the total innocent perspective of a child in such a horrific situation was unnerving and the entire story was a mystery.  Since we, as the reader, see everything through a child's eyes, we know something is not right but it takes a long time to put together the pieces.  The writer unveils the story as slowly as the rings of an onion peeling away, with each slice more painful and heart-wrenching.  The second part of the book was more tragic but also exhilarating and suspenseful.<br /><br />So, when I said earlier that it was an affecting book, that's really the best way to describe it.  The book made me feel all the way through.  It was a subtle, invisible tug on my emotions--hope, despair, anger, excitement, dread, horror and, strangely, hilarity in parts.  By the end, I was an emotional wreck--exhausted.  Emma Donoghue knows just which buttons to push.  Thank you, Ms. D., I loved it and come back to it time and again in my mind without realizing it.  It is a book that will stay with you for a long time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is my favorite game I've found for my kindle fire.  I have spent countless hours playing and have my brothers hooked too!
B0058FOB2K|4.0|First of all if you didn't buy the Deluxe album, unfortunately, you missed out on some of the best songs. I got caught out there that way before with Beyonce albums and ended up having to buy both \\"Flaws and All\\" and \\"Ego\\" separately so I no longer buy them when they first come out and instead wait for the Deluxe version and I recommend every other Bey fan do the same.<br /><br />I love all the songs on Disc 2 especially when I mentally disconnect \\"Dance for You\\" and \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" from their horrible videos.<br /><br />The only songs I don't care for are \\"Rather Die Young\\" an insipid and irresponsible song and \\"I Care\\" which is simply boring filler material. I could take or leave \\"I Miss You\\" too. The rest of the songs were fun, will make you want to jump up and dance or think erotic thoughts about your significant other or blaze a path in the world by doing something great to leave a legacy (\\"I Was Here\\").<br /><br />I now forgive Beyonce for that I Am Sasha Fierce crap which was solely kept afloat by videos because the material (okay I liked \\"Ego\\") was mundane and formulaic at best and was unable to stand alone. I recommend \\"4\\" and I have it on heavy rotation in my car and at work. After hearing me playing these songs other folks who were unfamiliar with them got hooked and bought the cd(s)too. So if you're thinking about it, get it and enjoy :-)

B0030V0PEW|2.0|Shame on me for not reading the summary more carefully. Instead, I committed the sin of judging a book by its cover (or, more properly, by its title).<br /><br />The subtitle \\"How To Get Things Right\\" implies that there is something practicable in this book. There isn't. It's chock full of anecdotes that show the benefits of checklists but some of that information could have been relayed far more effectively as tables and/or charts. Instead, we get story after story after story. I finally began skimming because there was no discernible meat. No tables, no charts, no sample checklists (although, to be fair, there are discussions of specific checklists).<br /><br />My expectation was that there would be discussions on how to build effective checklists, how to roll those checklists out, how to validate the efficacy of those checklists. There was nothing to be taken away except that you should add \\"uses checklists\\" as a criterion for selecting a hospital.<br /><br />Gawande is an engaging writer, so you may enjoy the book. Just don't expect to walk away with new tools for your toolbox.<br /><br />I would submit that a more appropriate subtitle would be \\"How Others Have Gotten Things Right.\\"

B0086QS7N2|5.0|I want to like this album, I really do. I've been listening to it, getting ready for tour that starts 9/7 in Manchester, NH. Here's the thing: I really like half the album, and really hate the other half. When I say \\"hate\\" I mean from a Rush purist perspective.<br /><br />I've been with the band since the early days. Somebody turned me on to Fly By Night, and then soon I was digging on everything. I've embraced the band's shifting change in music.. LOVED the transition to the third leg of the Rush movement. (CounterParts, Presto, RTB, S&A).<br /><br />I felt the mix was muddled. THe baseline is great, but Alex really doesn't come through well on the album. I also feel the whole \\"concept\\" thing that this album speaks to was lost in the arrangements.<br /><br />clockwork angles, caravan, bu2b, the wrecker, wish them well - all thumbs up. Everything else, thumbs down. I said to my friend - longer term - this will be a dust collector in my rush collection.

0007189958|5.0|Yes, it's been mentioned before, but I feel it is important to stress it: this book is also sold as 'Love, Rosie' and 'Rosie Dunne' - it's all the same book, people! So don't buy it more than once. (Even though I did, because I own it on Kindle, and I owned it in paperback, but it started falling apart after the millionth time I read it - only a slight exaggeration, I assure you - so I bought a hardcover copy too!).<br /><br />I have read this book too many times to count. It's the story of Rosie Dunne and Alex Stewart, who have been best friends since childhood. You can tell from the very start that it's a love story, and that Rosie and Alex are meant to be together, but they never quite seem to manage it, and go through all the hurdles life throws at them (including children, and several failed marriages) together. It's the story of the strongest kind of friendship, and is full of moments that still make me cry from laughing so hard, even after all the times I've read it. It's also got some beautifully written words in one of the characters confessions, and the whole story is written in notes, letters, emails, chats, etc. which makes it great to read.<br /><br />Basically, this book will make you laugh, cry, and get so frustrated with the characters apparent inability to work things out that it will drive you insane - but you'll love every page, I guarantee it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked this up due to its high rating and low price.  I was extremely pleasantly surprised by the quality of Wool Omnibus. The author has a knack for making likeable and unique characters that carry the story and setting.  The story itself is good, not groundbreaking in terms of the idea, but execution is very good.<br /><br />If you're looking for a high action packed book, this isn't for you.  But if you like character development, slowly unfolding mysteries and conspiracies, this is a book for you.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Just finished reading David Baldacci's latest book and it did not disappoint.  It was interesting to see how his relationship with the other characters well known in his earlier books started.  The character of the 14 year old was a bit unrealistic.  I cannot imagine any child that young could be so strong and street-wise but I guess I grew up in a different world.  I enjoyed the book and it was a fast read.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|The picture quality was great. FYI, When the 3 of them pull on to an area of road in NM named Cactus Jack.  You can find that the area has been modernised but it still exists, (check out the hills in the distance). Google map  [...]    I personally believe it is the same area, across the road, that Sarah visited at the end of T1.  You can come to your own conclusion on that.  I bought this disc to see how many times Blythe Dyson appeared in it.  Once actually, so they had to cut out Tarissa Dyson sitting by their swimming pool, as she twice mentions 'our kids'.  [...]  Warning, I was unable to hack my new blu-ray player to make it multi region, so I had to buy another multi region player for this region 1 disc.  It's worth checking the net for your player, there might be a hack code available.  That being said if you have a blu-ray player on your desk or laptop, you can change it through control panel, dvd properties.
B00785P2QC|5.0|A great game tht keeps you coming back. My only negative is the rate of Invest Points income... Money can be gained relatively easily, but so many things cost Invest Points and they seem hard 2 come by. But the game is still very fun!
0345803493|3.0|I liked the first book better, but book 2 was pretty decent as well. A lot more of the same from book 1, but still entertaining eye candy. If you've read book 1, just buy the last two. It's basically a guilty pleasure on so many levels. :-)
0688152023|2.0|I was very dissapointed by this book - looking beautiful on the outside.<br /><br />In the inside, however, my expectations crushed.<br /><br />There are few nice pictures. Few portraits of NCB dancers. Few photos of dancers in rehearsals. Some text on the company. Shortly, dancers talk about fitness - some of the stories contain valuable information about how to combine indoor workout with swimming or quick walking in the nature (i.e. outdoors). Information on diet is as usual vague - I am writing as usual because I do not understand why there is always a problem with the diet recommendations or even the truth about it when it comes to dancers (I actually know one former professional ballerina and one aquabella, they never were on special diet ever). All you can read is the word ,,healthy\\" and ,,salad\\".<br /><br />Exercises are very common: stretching, abs, legs, etc. - common. I just wonder: ballet workout would interest people who like ballet, like dance, used to do ballet or dance, or are taking classes etc. Then, my question is: why there is no real exercise for these group of people? Why I can see common exercises which I used to practise in the elementary school as a part of common education?!<br /><br />This is mediocre workout with few ballet exercises - again: common (plie, releve, flexed tendu ?).<br /><br />From book having such strong dancing company in its title I would expect very specific:<br /><br />- information on the body types<br />- tips for different body types<br />- exercises to tone and some cardio tips<br />- tips on nutrition - real one - not only ,,healthy salad\\"<br />- tips on flexibility, one's limits and other specific information<br />- also aesthetics could be much on the upper level: I do not want to look on dancers in gym-like outfits and heavy sneakers<br />- tips on bodycare: joints etc.<br /><br />I would apprecciate real ballet workout with some real floor work, real barre work, real cardio with useful tips for common user on how to modify certain exercises for his/her own limitation (turnout range etc.), even foot work would be very welcomed.how to modify certain exercises for his/her own limitation (turnout range etc.), even foot work would be very welcomed.

B004V4Y4P8|2.0|I ordered a book that was labeled new. I paid full price for this book plus shipping and handling. When I received the book I noticed a black ink blemish stamped on the outside of the pages at the top of the book. However, the book is otherwise in good condition. I'm very disappointed I paid full price for a book with an ink blemish on the outside pages at the top of my book.
0061122416|5.0|Hear me people of the world. This book speaks the language of the soul. If you read it with your whole heart, soul, mind open to receive you will receive what you need to fulfill your personal legend. If you read it and truth does not reveal itself, you are not ready for the truth. All should read it anew each year because each year our ears and eyes and mind and soul become more  acute as we exercise them. So the next year when you pick up the book to read it will reveal more and more and more of who you are. May our journey's be our joy without an unhealthy attachment to where we end up.
B000KGGIQO|5.0|I found \\"Walk the Line\\" in the bargain bins at a nearby Wal-Mart. I snatched it up in an instant. \\"Walk the Line\\" was an acclaimed movie, the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I particularly remembered Johnny Cash from his rise in the earliest days of what later became Rock 'n' Roll. He, along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and several others were the star recording artists on the legendary Sun Records roster under the direction of Sam Phillips. This DVD will automatically become an important part of my music collection.<br /><br />It's an excellent movie! I can't emphasize this enough. Joaquin Phoenix and  Reese Witherspoon were outstanding in their depictions of Johnny and June, and they did their own singing! The music was quite good, perhaps not quite up to the original masters, but it was close. All of the other musical performers were outstanding. The movie was a period piece, of course, and the depiction of the 50s and 60s was very well done. I particularly liked the 50s. Everything looked absolutely authentic. The streets were lined with magnificently restored 50s and earlier cars, some of which I haven't seen for decades. Where did they get them all?<br /><br />The story was captivating. It recorded Johnny Cash's spectacular rise from being a failing door-to-door salesman, to a recording artist and up to a super-star in a very short period of time. Naturally, there's booze, drugs and women, not necessarily in that order, and there's the fall. It's a common story for rock 'n' rollers, but it's exceptionally well done here. And the story really got a good grip on the heart. This movie was magnificently entertaining, and if you liked the music, it's just heavenly. Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This game is very fun!!! But It takes a long time just to send a picture. I was right next to my dad and it takes  a couple minutes:( But other than that it is very fun!!!
0345803507|5.0|[[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]I was under the impression that these books were only about sex.  I bought the first book only to find out that it was a love story that was so touching and complicated that I couldn't put it down. I was so wrapped up in the story that when I finished the first book I immediately ordered the next two books. I highly recommend these books.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|This is a great film!! 100% more interesting than \\"The Blair Witch Project\\".

030758836X|4.0|I was really impressed by the first half of the dark suspense novel GONE GIRL and it kept me quickly turning the pages to see what was going to happen next. Author Gillian Flynn does a great job of giving the reader the background of Amy the beautiful young woman that goes missing. Amy seemed so perfect her psychologist parents even became rich writing best selling children's novels about her. Amy's husband Nick a handsome young writer who lost his job as a Manhattan magazine writer before returning with Amy to his small Missouri hometown to tend to his ailing parents is also portrayed in a full and sympathetic light in the book's beginning. Yet about halfway through GONE GIRL there is a surprising twist and unfortunately the novel never returns to the strong storyline and believable character development with which it started. I found the ending particularly unsatisfying. Gillian Flynn is a promising American author in the suspense category and I enjoyed her previous novels DARK PLACES and SHARP OBJECTS and I hope her best works are still to come.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've looking for this game for the longest on my android phone but could never find it. Now that I have it on my kindle I don't even need the game on my phone. The game is really fun and addicting. You start off as a guy and then you can work your way up to other interesting runners. My favorite is the Asian girl. But one thing that can be a bit annoying with the game is when you swipe one way to jump for example and end up sliding. But other than that the game's wonderful. You should really play it! ^&bull;^

B000286RKW|1.0|I purchased a Two-Disc Special Edition of \\"GoodFellas\\".  When it arrived, it was a single disc (contrary to the picture and description).  The \\"Special Features\\" were those of olden-time DVDs where a book worth of dialogue pops up.  What is most disturbing is that the jewel case cover for this DVD is correct adornments on the cover claiming to be the \\"Two-Disc Special Edition\\" and descriptions of the special features on the back.  There was only one disc included and none of the special features described were present.  0 for 2 isn't a great score in my book.<br /><br />When I presented this information to the seller, he claimed that this was the correct edition as with \\"Warner it is normal for their two disk released with disk one as side A and Disk two as side B.\\"  I am old enough to remember the early days of DVDs so this seemed fair to say, but what he said next was \\"It is the only way the two disk version exists of this title.\\"  This is clearly untrue.  My brother owns the same edition which has two discs and even the picture that the seller shows as the item description picture shows a version with two discs.<br /><br />He then tried to get me to send it back to him \\"at [my] own expense\\" and he would issue a refund when it arrived.  Not wanting to spend money on TESG's mistake, I e-mailed him back telling him again, that I received the wrong edition of the film and I expected to be compensated without needing to spend my own money in the process.  His reply is as follows...<br /><br />\\"I am confused with the fact that you ordered an item, got exactly what you ordered, refuse to return the item for a refund, and file a claim to keep the item wanting both the item and a refund.  Again, I shall issue a refund once the item is returned and until the item is returned I can not take any action on this matter.\\"<br /><br />You will notice that he still claims I got what I ordered.  He claims that I wanted the DVD, which is untrue.  And his \\"confusion\\" is clearly a veiled method for implying that my claim was fraudulent.<br /><br />By this time, Amazon had already stepped in and refunded my money so thank God for that.  This company was giving me a headache.  All negative reviews of this seller say basically the same thing and if we are saying these things independently then there is little doubt to their validity.<br /><br />If you buy from this seller, I guess you'd better hope really hard that you get what you purchased because any dissatisfaction with your purchase will be met with rude and accusatory dissent.

030758836X|5.0|Once I got going in this book, I couldn't put it down and read the bulk of it in two days.  I love Harlan Coben books as well and Gillian Flynn seems to love adding tons of plot twists like he does.  The characters were so well written, you feel like you are really inside their heads.  She writes just as well from the male perspective as she does from the female perspective.  I would highly recommend this book.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I was in my 20's when rush released their first LP.No CD's back then.So I have been a big fan for many years,<br />way before all the keyboard stuff.While I believe a keyboard can make a positive contribution,,,some times it's over used/done.I feel that's the case here.Way too much keyboard.Sometimes it's hard to even hear what's being played by the guitar,,or what the song even sounds like because the keys are so over bearing.Rush began as a 3 piece rock band,,and IMO that was when they were at their best.I feel there is too much orchestration going on here.I really wanted to hear them ROCK like they used to.<br />I do like this CD,,,but for me it's just okay,,,NOT GREAT.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Yesterday I asked my daughter if she had heard of this book and she said \\"yes, the teen girls are reading it\\". Well, I was shocked as a 60 year old woman and wondered why I read it in the first place. Please .... it is demented and not a love story. It is wicked and not something a young mind should be introduced to. I would not recommend it for anyone. YUCK! Very sad.
B000BIQKXM|3.0|I found these guys about 3 years ago I was wondering why I never heard of them before they are my fav group and always will be. They are big well known all over the world, they never preformed in the U.S.. At the time we had the Back Street Boys the rest of the world had Westlife. Don't get me wrong some people liked the Back Street Boys but Westlife is so much better. West Life has some original songs but mostly they do covers, normally I don't like people doing covers but Westlife does the covers better then the original performers.

030758836X|5.0|*Note: No outright spoilers but there are vague references to the book's outcome that could be deciphered. My suggestion if you want to be completely surprised, read this review after finishing the book.<br /><br />Thank God it happened! My faith in the common novel has finally been restored after reading a string of bad to mediocre disappointments. Gillian Flynn has written a novel that kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat. I literally devoured this book in a few sittings. Gone Girl is definitely hype worthy.<br /><br />Nick Dunne wakes up on his 5-year anniversary to his beautiful wife Amy making him a celebratory breakfast. Soon after, Amy goes missing. As the clues are racked up, the world is left to wonder, did Nick kill his wife and if so, why? The motives for murder are introduced rapidly. It's apparent that Nick had plenty of reasons to want Amy dead. Still, with no recovered body, it is impossible to know one hundred percent. As sympathy for Nick with the media as well as those closest to him waxes and wanes depending on the spin dejour, he embarks on an all out quest to clear his name and prove to all that he did not kill his wife in spite of all the evidence mounting against him.<br /><br />Flynn delves deep into the psyche of this particularly troubled yet relatively short marriage. The book is divided into three distinct parts and we learn in the first that both Amy and Nick have lost their trendy NYC writing jobs. Amy, who had a substantial trust courtesy of her parents collaborative and very successful children's book series based on their only daughter, is essentially broke by the time she and Nick move back to his childhood home of Missouri to care for his terminally ill mother and oversee care for his Alzheimer's inflicted father. Things between Nick and Amy begin to unravel pretty quickly from this point. Alternating back and forth chapters between Nick and Amy, with Amy being revealed through a hidden diary she has been writing for several years, the story paces quickly with page turning revelations.<br /><br />One of the things that make this story so engaging is Flynn's attention to detail. She leaves no stone unturned which can be extremely difficult to pull off. There were in the end no \\"what about\\", questions that came up, at least not for me. This made for a very satisfying book which is tantamount to the reading experience.<br /><br />Also, there is plenty of food for thought after the story ends. The subject matter of relationships, particularly the marital relationship is scrutinized in such a uniquely deliberate way. There is layer upon layer to peel away which is half the fun. All the fears and insecurities that two people bring to their relationship; many of them unseen up front are put under the microscope and brought blaringly to life. The snowball effect and those points in which the principal characters are no longer in control of the outcome exists in stark juxtaposition to the meticulous and calculating aspects of the story even as those characters fight to regain that control. How quickly it all goes from one extreme to the next is a marvel.<br /><br />Flynn's writing is finely honed and her prose is a joy to read. Consider this delightful line on pg. 180 (HC), \\"A plant on the mantel promptly lost five pretty purple leaves.\\" This line worked so well within the context it was written and what I loved most is that any triteness was relieved by the use of the word \\"leaves\\" instead of say \\"petals\\". This is what I loved so much about Flynn's writing, the ability to create the right tone through prose while skating negative connotations.<br /><br />Finally, a word about the ending, a number of the reviews I read had a problem with the way the story ended. It wasn't climatic enough, didn't produce a big enough bang, and seemed to drop off into nothing. These were just some of the things I read regarding the book's ending. I feel strongly that it is a mistake to read any review before reading the book, especially if you are the kind of person who would actually let someone's negative review keep you from reading in the first place. If you do however find yourself perusing what people had to say beforehand, please know that not everyone felt cheated by the ending. I liked it, a lot. It was completely appropriate to the story and brilliantly summed up the characters personalities. It added another layer of depth and authentic dimension. In other words, it was nearly perfect. It was a succinct summary of all we should have learned about these characters as well as the lessons we ought to be taking away from the story, lessons aplenty. Let us not forget that getting to know someone is really much harder than it seems however Amy and Nick managed to get to know each other in a short time under extreme conditions of their own creation.<br /><br />In the end, Flynn boils the most salient points down to their most simple level and reminds us of what is truly at the core of a real marriage, one that exists in real time, day in and day out, with only two people really having knowledge of its crucial dynamics. In a nutshell, this book is so much more than the sum of its parts.ng the book, especially if you are the kind of person who would actually let someone's negative review keep you from reading in the first place.

B007MU85D0|3.0|I blame myself really.  I read the many accolades and emotional swellings about this album and bought it blindly.  Ugghh...never again will I succumb to lovely reviews without first streaming the album. The snippets of sound that Amazon allows are pathetic. How can one decide to buy it without getting more than 5 seconds of a song?<br /><br />Comparisons of this album to Mumford and the Cranberries are frankly insulting...give me a break, DOESN'T come close! I want to shout \\"How dare you!\\" at them, How freaking dare you compare my beloved artists to this! Sweet poppy songs without any depth or anything really said are just forgettable; bring on the insulin. I listened to it four times and just count myself lucky that I only wasted 5 bucks on the download.<br /><br />Save your money for something like 'Alabama Shakes' if you are looking for a good new album. It is interesting, it is diverse, there are authentic voices with raw talent and heart.  That is all that I am looking for.<br /><br />I feel like I need to add that 'Dirty Paws' is an awesome song and I listen to it all the time.  The rest of the album just fell flat for me.

B004XD03RK|5.0|A progression from straight up Brutal Death Metal into the realms of  Progressive Death Metal Fusion... Death (the band) were becoming closer to the realms of Oppressor, Gorguts, later period Atheist, Cryptopsy, Burning Inside (with later Death drummer Richard Christy) ... etc;. Clearly the first 3 albums \\"Scream Bloody Gore\\", \\"Leprosy\\" & \\"Spiritual Healing\\" ... were all more \\"death-like\\" a Cro-Magnon versus a Homo sapian; both have distinctive advantages. Of course the comparison is not that either is a better Human(s) (no pun intended)  but the musical direction of the band, clearly can be heard from screaming Zombie's to surrealistic variants of the cosmos.<br /><br />I personally found the work of Paul Masvidal (guitar) & Sean Reinert (drums) in Cynic ; maybe going way over my head ... Progressive Death Metal Fusion??? Something like that. I still am trying to comprehend some stuff from Cynic and other strange bands like Confessor. I do admit I liked to sing along to old Death classics like \\"Pull The Plug\\" ... which thankfully were a mainstay of Death's concerts.<br /><br />The album starts out in true Death Metal fashion, the chug-chug-chugging guitars and completely insane double bass beats! \\"Flattening Of Emotions\\" questions both sanity and insanity and I Presume wondering \\"what if?\\". Human\\" is best listened to very thoroughly ... listen to the first 30 seconds of \\"Lack Of Comprehension\\" the mellow spaciousness of an ethereal flow ... Steve DiGiorgio's fretless bass can be exemplified here, while all is \\"quiet\\". Steve of course well known of Sadus fame, and plays both here on \\"Human\\" and later \\"Individual Thought Patterns\\" (not to mention his latter work with Control Denied. \\"Cosmic Sea\\" once again shows off the highly progressive sound and the Cynic references can easily be heard at around the 2 minute mark with all the \\"space odyssey\\" type sounds. I had heard that Scott Carino replaced Steve DiGiorgio on bass when he left after the recording of the album and supposedly laid down one of the bass lines for \\"Cosmic Sea\\". If that is the case - very similar styles. Anyway, after this mellow break and when Chuck starts to sing you later hear a few bars of a few repeating guitar melody licks which remind me of the Swedish band Agony (whom I dig).<br /><br />Since \\"Human\\" is a rather tough album to review in words all the above references needed to mentioned to put them in the ballpark of things. Someone like Sean Reinert must have some kind of extraterrestrial stamina to play drums like this - throughout the album! Only a Gene Hoglan (of Dark Angel fame) & Richard Christy (Burning Inside, Iced Earth, Control Denied ...) could be on par for the last 3 Death albums.<br /><br />Sean himself is breaking into 16th notes?!  He has talked about this: \\"I play with my hi hat on the inside of my double pedal as opposed the outside. I lead with my left foot when I play double bass which allows me to hit both my bass drum pedals and the hi hat pedal at the same time (with the left foot). When I play 16th notes on the kick drums the hi hat would be playing 8th notes. If I'm playing 16th note triplets with the kick drum the hat would be keeping the 8th note triplets etc. This can be cool for freeing up the hands to play phrases on the toms or cymbals while still keeping the time going with the feet. So, the double pedal has more options for placement.\\"<br /><br />So, no boring simple plodding bom-bap-boom stuff. Much harder to comprehend technical stuff at first, but after hearing the album over and over ... new nuisances can be heard (especially with a real stereo and real headphones ... none of that MP3 stuff for me!). MP3s  have serious deficiencies in both data and the lower spectrum of the soundstage, 24-Bit digital is the way to go if one is to jump from analog to digital.<br /><br />Lyrically I was very interested in the Dr. Kevorkian inspired 2nd track \\"Suicide Machine\\". Let me tell you after seeing people linger in slow deterioration and later have them in a nursing home whom decides to withhold ALL food and water until one's loved \\"passes\\" (in my case a grandmother who was tortured for 5 days!!!!) Is the crime not Dr. Kevorkian. They guy didn't go around abducting and killing people he assisted those with a diagnosed terminal disease and asked them what quality of life they wanted? Jack Kevorkian never solely lead anyone astray, he required independent outside verification with other doctors. Chuck and Death aren't afraid to look at these often denied situations. Last time I checked medical doctors are human beings - true some are indeed \\"Cro-Magnon\\" ... but believe me, many of them most certainly would never want to be treated as THEY have treated many of their patients. Chuck says it best:<br /><br />When it comes to living, no one seems to care<br />But when it comes to wanting out<br />Those with power, will be there<br />Prolong the pain<br />How long will it last?<br />Suicide machine<br />A request to die with dignity<br />Is that too much to ask?<br />Suicide machine<br />How easy it is to deny the pain<br />Of someone else's suffering<br /><br />\\"Human\\" has an incredible amount of \\"data\\" on it .... 34 minutes of incredibly dense musicianship going on. Dense as in compacted into a small space ... not dense as in \\"stupid\\" as some people label things they themselves don't understand. Yes, of course many are more familiar with the Golden Oldies like ... \\"Denial Of Life\\", \\"Born Dead\\" or \\"Spiritual Healing\\" but don't fret many classics are presented on various live CDs and DVDs. And the \\"classic\\" line up has 4 massive Death Metal Hits Of The Day on \\"The Ultimate Revenge 2\\" VHS tape of old. Yes, I believe the tape has been bootlegged to DVD-R ... for those too young to own \\"The Ultimate Revenge 2\\" Century Media included all four (plus a bonus live track) tracks on the 2008 reissue of \\"Leprosy\\":<br /><br />2008 Century Media Records \\"Leprosy\\" (Tracks 1 - 8) Digipak reissue bonus tracks:<br /><br />09.

0887431453|5.0|My 3.5 year old daughter loves this book.  Her tracing is getting better and she loves to work on her writing.  It is nice because you can jump to different topics and skills so that you don't burn your kid out.  My daughter loves to pick what thing we are going to do next so she feels like she is in charge of her learning and enjoys it even more<br /><br />It does require you to sit and work with your child since they can't read, but it makes it fun to learn along with your kiddo.  My daughter has gone to a few hours of preschool a week for a year and we aren't going to be able to do that anymore so this will be our main school resource for her to learn from home.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|So far, this app has been amazing! My old kindle fire stopped working because of battery issues. Now, monitering my battery is a lot easier! I highly reccomend this app.<br />-Pros: Easy way to moniter battery level<br />  You can personalize your battery<br />  This app tells you how long you can do things on your device until the battery is too low<br />  This app tells you how you devided your battery power on your kindle<br /><br />-Cons: None so far<br /><br />(Note: I usually only write reviews if it is really bad or really good. As you can tell, I think this app is really good and useful.....It is no wonder that is on the highest rated!!)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|First of all, let me say that I am by no means a great writer.....but I read a lot and recognize when something is well written.  Fifty Shades is not.  If I saw the phrases \\"she murmered, he murmured\\" a hundred times, I saw them 200 times.  Seriously, there are things called Thesauruses that can give an author other options.  And isn't a murmur barely audible??  Anyway, besides the poor writing, it was simply repetitive and superficial.  By the third book (yes, I am embarassed to say I kept reading to see if it finished any better?), I was skipping through sex scenes, and other stupid conversations, and then finally the ending was just \\"blah\\".  A man who can't get off unless he inflicts mild torture and pain on someone, can now live with his former virgin and be a wonderful father and forget all his shit from the past.  OK....seriously, like I said, I am even embarrassed that I got wrapped up in the hype and bought them.  Read it for entertainment, but don't expect anything great from these books. And if they are sexually exciting to you, perhaps you need to get out more, or read more interesting books about sex.  Jeesh!<br /><br />On the other hand, when I was finished this trilogy, finally, I was looking for something way more real and captivating.  I read Anderson Coopers \\"Dispatches from the Edge\\" and it was great. [[ASIN:B000GCFX9K Dispatches from the Edge] Easy read, written from his heart and soul, and filled with thought provoking material.  I appreciated it even more after the Fifty Shades trash.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is ok but its not my fav game.  in the world and I have seen way better games and the only reason I am rating this is to get the points Lol!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for passing time. have not played a lot of games yet but the ones I have played are very addicting
0425221806|5.0|Another great story by Dean. Full of action and suspense this book is a must read for all of his fans.
B00723NWJE|5.0|This music is flawless from beginning to end.  I didn't care for her musical style before.  The low ratings must be from people who can't take change.  Now I may find her older stuff more enjoyable.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have always preferred this dictionary to other ones and if I can remember to turn my Kindle Fire on before picking up my old copy of The Merriam-Webster Dictionary paperback version, I will use it more, especially when playing Words with Friends.
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's oneness with the spiritual realm during her near death experience wakes us up to 'what it's all about'; how we should be living our lives; and the peace,love and confidence inherent in all of us if only we open our hearts.
B001U88814|4.0|My husband loves Crocs and he had been trying to get me to get a pair for quite some time. Finally he talked me into it. I hadn't really wanted to try them because I have a narrow foot and these run wide. Well, I finally broke down and here is my opinion of Crocs.<br /><br />This is one of Crocs furry lined shoes. Here's the catch with these types of shoes. When you first get them they will be tight. Why? Because of all the furry lining in them. However, do not think that it will stay that way forever. As you wear these shoes, that fur, like any fur, will flatten down and not be so fluffy anymore. What happens when the fur flattens? It creates more space.<br /><br />So here is your decision. Do you want your feet to feel a little snug for a month or so and then fit the shoe the way it's supposed to? Or, do you want the shoe to fit the right way as soon as you get it and then have it a size too big once all the fur flattens down after a month or so? The choice is yours: Buy the right size now and endure it being a little tight vs. Buy big now and endure too big the rest of the time you have it.<br /><br />As for the fur: let me tell you...it is soooo soft and squishy. I loved the way it felt on my feet. It was like walking on cloud puffs (not that I would know what that feels like, but it sounds soft!) Once the fur flattens, it's not quite as soft but it's still soft.<br /><br />The shoe is wide and if you have a narrow foot, this might bug you. We still have this pair of Crocs, but I have since passed them on down to my son. He loves them and likes the feel of them. He's not complaining!<br /><br />We use these as indoor house slippers. They really work well because they keep your feet warm and you don't break your toes if you accidentally kick a piece of furniture or something. I can't tell you how many bones I've saved!<br /><br />Hope this review helped you!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was very addictive,  but that was because of the s*x...after finishing it I realized how truly poorly written it was. For what it's worth though,it was entertaining and definitely erotic!
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|This game is absolutely awful. The lego pieces that come with the game are nice and you get a nice amount, but the things you are supposed to make with them are RIDICULOUS. For example - on your turn - you may have to make a garbage truck, a fishing rod with a fish, a guitar, a volcano, a gas station, the statue of liberty, an ice cream truck. HOW are you supposed to design these things with basic legos??? Not one person that has played this game with us can even begin to guess one of the creations after it is made. For the amount of money we paid for this - its a complete rip off. We have just added the legos to our lego collection and threw out all the cards. If the cards had more reasonable items on them to create - it may have been a good game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought this book was suppose to be a Best Seller. Was NOT<br />worth reading, wasted money. Wont be buying the other two books in this trilogy.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun game with easy controls. I do find it a little frustrating because of it's rapid pace and sense that you start over rather than progress.
B0086700CM|5.0|i had seen everyone who has ipods play this game and was so jelly that amazon didnt hav the game yet. but when amazon did have it avaliable to purchase i imediately bought it and ended up playing it all night. all in all great game!
B001EO2UJK|3.0|I'm loving the music of Genesis and especially of the period with Peter Gabriel. So when I discovered I did not hesitate buy this Box. Actually the sound of the discs is much higher than their original versions, and what about their DVD versions 5.1! really wonderful. Sure, the first four albums, because for The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway ever since I was never hear. In its place is the Nursery Crime DVD is already on the disc of the same name. OK, an error in the assembly of the Box is permissible. Then Amazon sent me a second box and surprise Oh! the same defect with the same disc, can it be? Yes folks can be and in fact happened. Rhino Records should have at least some control of their products before releasing them for sale. In short, I have in my possession a \\"almost excellent collection\\" of Genesis era Gabriel and all thanks to the carelessness of someone not wanting to put up the box and, even worse, was not monitored. So, I appeal to those who own two disc DVD 5.1 The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and they lack the Nursery Crime corresponding to an exchange. Big mistake from Rhino Records.
1931559317|5.0|It's the one I use at the eyepiece.  Without an atlas of the night sky, you will be lost in space, and soon despondent, and back in the house.<br />The book has a nice compact size, good quality spiral binding, lies flat.  Thoughtful layout of the charts; you just have to learn their logic, then it makes sense.<br />Like other reviewers, I appreciate the user-friendly scale of the maps, the convenience of the telrad ring and degree scales, and the bright legible maps printed on smooth durable paper. The atlas is very well indexed, adding enormously to its utility.  This atlas will keep the average amateur observer busy for many years :)
B004NSVF7C|4.0|This book tells the story of John Gilkey, who has stolen hundreds of rare books.  The author herself becomes an interesting character as she finds it impossible to remain an external observer and becomes drawn into Gilkey's story herself.  Her frequent moral dilemmas add another layer of meaning to this book.  I wished there had been a bit more excitement, but that's probably a result of reading several books about art theft/forgery just before reading this book.  Because those frequently involved dramatic undercover stories and high-stakes recoveries, I think my desire for more excitement is probably a result of that, rather than a fair criticism of this book on its own.  Regardless, I enjoyed the book a great deal, just not enough to give it five stars.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|The movie got here very fast! Everything about the movie is in great condition no dents or scratches! I would defiantly buy from this seller again!! I am very pleased with the product!!<br />Thank You, Corinne
B004LWZWGK|5.0|In 2005, filmmaker Christopher Nolan gave the Batman film franchise, which had stagnated with the dreadful \\"Batman & Robin,\\" a powerful rejuvenation with \\"Batman Begins,\\" a darker, more psychological take on the character that delved into how Bruce Wayne, the son of a slain billionaire and his wife, becomes a fearsome, cloaked hero known as the Batman. Thanks to Nolan's powerful direction, a brilliant script from Nolan and David S. Goyer, and terrific performances from a cast that included Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman, \\"Batman Begins\\" restored faith in the franchise. This was followed in 2008 by \\"The Dark Knight,\\" which pits Batman against the Joker and his plans to bring anarchy to Gotham City. This film became a box office phenomenon, and won a posthumous Oscar for Heath Ledger for his brilliant, and downright creepy performance as the Joker. With these successes behind them, Nolan and the team decided that, instead of dragging the franchise out indefinitely, they would close their version of the Batman story down with \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\" With high expectations set from two brilliant films, Nolan and his brother Jonathan came up with a brilliant, epic, and emotional story to bring their version of Batman and Gotham City to a powerful conclusion.<br /><br />Like \\"The Dark Knight\\" before it, the film actually defies the expectations of the viewer, but in a brilliant way. When watching the film, one expects that our hero, with help from others, would successfully end the plans of the villain to take over Gotham, preventing any destruction to the city. Instead, Nolan decided to go against the more traditional route. Here, we see Bane, the main villain of the piece, severely injure our hero, and take him to a prison deemed escape-proof on the other side of the globe to rot, allowing Bane and his army of mercenaries to succeed in the plans to take over Gotham City, and create a \\"police state\\" with martial law, where the villains control everything, and it is up to a band of \\"resistance fighters\\" to figure out how to stop Bane. Wayne realizes he must overcome his injuries and fears to escape from the prison, and return to Gotham to stop Bane and his plans to wipe out the city with a Hydrogen Bomb. Wayne also realizes that he might have to give his own life to save his city.<br /><br />At 165 minutes, the film's first hour is somewhat slow, but picks up when Wayne, having been in self-exile for eight years after taking the rap for Harvey Dent's crimes, once again dons the Batman suit to face his toughest enemy. Here, the story kicks into high gear, and leaves viewers on the edge of their seats for the remaining 105-or-so minutes of the film. Nolan's vision to bring grandeur back to the cinemas is clearly evident, as he has crafted a truly epic film, but never forgets the heart of the story, as we see the story of the Dark Knight come full circle, as he faces his greatest test, and must overcome tremendous odds to defeat the enemy. Christian Bale proves once and for all that he owns the dual role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, giving everything he has to make his final performance in the role truly memorable. Tom Hardy is very good as Bane, despite a tendency to be incomprehensible due to his mask (Which I think was a deliberate choice by Nolan, which makes him more menacing by not knowing what he is saying all the time). Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman also shine in their final performances as Alfred, Commissioner Gordon and Lucius Fox. Newcomers, such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anne Hathaway, and Marion Cotillard also give inspired, solid performances. A welcomed cameo by Liam Neeson as Ra's Al Ghul is also great.<br /><br />Once again, Nolan shows his strong craftsman as a filmmaker, crafting a film that mixes the Comic Book film, war epic and tragedy together in an intense, action-packed film that will leave fans of the trilogy pleased with the outcome. It's not quite as good as the previous film, and it doesn't top \\"The Avengers\\" as the greatest comic-book film of 2012 (or ever, for that matter), but it definitely ranks with \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" as one of the best trilogy-cappers of all time. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" comes with my highest recommendation to Batman fans, and those who love great films!<br /><br />Grade: A+ous film, and it doesn't top \\"The Avengers\\" as the greatest comic-book film of 2012 (or ever, for that matter), but it definitely ranks with \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" as one of the best trilogy-cappers of all time. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" comes with my highest recommendation to Batman fans, and those who love great films!<br /><br />Grade: A+

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is utter rubbish. I was so relieved to see that I wasnt the only person that hated it. I thought that maybe I had a problem, but now I see that the author has. Drivel and utter trash.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've used arctic past in many builds throughout the years, and wouldn't trust builds to anything else. I recently had a need to a larger CPU cooler on a server, and ended up buying this for mounting the cooler, even though the cooler came with a tube of \\"other stuff\\". Wouldn't trust my builds to anything but Arctic.
B004ZWKWQQ|4.0|It is cool and fun to build, but it has a lot of pieces and that is why I gave it four stars.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I would like to say this is an amazing cooler for the price. Cut 20 degrees off my CPU temp.<br /><br />To start with, I'm running an Asus Crosshair IV motherboard, Phenom X4 black, inside a thermaltake full tower case.<br /><br />I recently started to run a media server (Plex) off my machine, in an effort to \\"cut the cord\\" and get rid of cable. As it transcodes video real-time, it chews up a lot of CPU, especially when streaming HD content to multiple TVs in the house (through Rokus). As my box was consistently running at 100% CPU for hours on end, I needed a better cooling solution than a stock cooler (which was between 60-65 degrees under full load).<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br />Not reading the reviews close enough, I didn't realize this cooler has a universal plate, requiring that you remove your motherboard to install. Not a big deal... A good idea... but kind of annoying...  Another thing is the size of this cooler. Even with the Crosshair IV (which is a well-spaced board) and the thermaltake armor, space turned out to be an issue. The cooler covered 2 of my RAM slots, forcing me down to 2 sticks of RAM (not a big deal in my case, but may be in others). Also, the unit is so tall, it presses against the case fan on the side of my case. The cover still fits, but it does put a little pressure on the cooler.<br /><br />The good/great:<br />Under full load, I an now sitting between 40-45 degrees. Not too shabby for a $30 cooler (combined with some arctic silver). I didn't use the supplied thermal paste, so I cannot attest to it's quality.<br />Also, this unit is very quiet. I typically run about 2k RPM, and can't even hear it over my PSU and case fan.<br />The construction of this unit feels pretty solid. The \\"snaps\\" holding on the fan seem a little brittle, but they send extras (to attach another fan if desired) if they happen to break.<br /><br />Overall, I'd definitely recommend this as a decent cooler, as long as you have the room for it. It takes up quitea bit more room than one would think, but pending you can find a way to make it fit, it works very well.
0307269752|5.0|The beginning of the book was a little slow for me while Keeland introduced and established background on some of the main characters. If you hang in there, about halfway through the book the story takes off! If you love stories that keep you guessing then you will love this book. I can't wait to see what Larsson has in store for Lisbeth Salander in The Girl Who Played With Fire!
0385737955|3.0|Ever since reading the Hunger Games I have been searching for something with a similar flavour. Most books I've read so far have not been very good (The Uglies' trilogy, which is passable at best, Divergent, which is terrible, the House of Stairs, which isn't bad at all) and reading this book gave me the closest thing to the same rush I've felt when reading the HG. However- this is only the first book of the trilogy and you have to read the others to get all the answers. So not only the story doesn't finish- your curiosity as a reader isn't appeased either, which I found a bit of a cheat. The questions that nag you for the whole book are still there at the end, forcing you to carry on reading. The plot swings from predictable to completely unexpected (and sometimes, pointless). All in all, it's not a bad read, and it's a good page turner.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Delightful and addictive and thoroughly enjoyable. I found that I could not put it down, and so went on to read the whole triligy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I felt that these books were an easy captivating read. An easy beach read perfect for summer vacay!! I have told all my friends about this series and the feedback is all the same. AWESOME!

B00001OH7U|5.0|This is one of the greatest Bowie albums. And yes, he was on drugs, making this album all the more remarkable. A hard rock funk creation that bridged Bowie's glam era with his new age art rock period, Station to Station grinds into the rock pantheon. The soaring, epic title track, the still-popular \\"Golden Years\\", awesome \\"Stay\\", every track on this album is a gem to behold. The two ballads, in particular, showcase the extent of Bowie's vocal talents.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|Great movie! The DVD came in good shape as well! Like how we could get the BlueRay, DVD, and Digital Copy all in one.

B003SR3392|3.0|The first season of Cougar Town is nearly half good. The very first few episodes are quite entertaining, but then the show just only gets worse and worse. I have the impression that the writers did not have a clear idea of a direction to take. They had this potential idea of cougars but did not develop it. I too think it is not an easy thing to get this idea going. I mean, how long could they run a show about cougar activities? It would seem that at one point it would have gotten too boring. Or, they might have thought that the show would have taken the same form as Sex and the City. Regrettably, the show turned into a caricature of Friends.<br />In any event, they could have exploited the idea of Jules being a single cougar for at least another season. Unfortunately, they decide that by the end of season 1, Jules would fall in love and have a relationship with Grayson. So, once everybody is married or engaged, there no longer is a show.<br />The show also shoots itself in the foot when they devise such (trite) expedients as the penny can. The actors also are to blame for the mediocrity of the show. Cox is no genius. The actor who plays Grayson is not too bad. However, Christa Miller is just plain boring. Her character is fruitlessly obnoxious.  She is in the show, I think, only because she is married to the producer.  Busy Philipps is somehow amusing at first, but after a few episodes her jokes and attitude becomes contrived to a point that is not funny anymore.<br />Brian Van Holt as Bobby Cobb, as Jules' ex husband is perfect in (again) the first few episodes. We immediately learn why his marriage did not work out: he is not the family type. He successfully portrays the archetypical white American douche bag, but a very likable douche bag.  But then, he becomes a very good father and a wise man. It is clear that the writers here were struggling trying to pin down a precise character, but failed. Also, he is the ex husband and yet he is always around. That is notbelievable. And not only is he always in Jules' house, but he also has occasional sex with her, though only once.<br />Jules' son Dan Byrd soon graduates from high school and is supposed to go to college. But he will never leave, as one learns in season 2. However, his character does not bring anything interesting to the table. He is dull.<br />The writers of this show clearly had some issues deciding which direction to take and how to develop the characters. The result therefore is what it is: a good starting idea ruined by undecided writers and mediocre actors, and a show that is dead before the end of season 1.
B0002NRQTS|4.0|Presto is an album that marked a change in Rush's sound from the keyboard-rich releases (Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire) to a harder-edged sound that fans were yearning for. This album sort of meets half way; it has robust guitars, but still retains an early to mid-eighties feel. Rush went about this album in hybrid fashion, which appeals to the fans of their 80's stuff as well as fans of their 70's material. Besides SHOW DON'T TELL, many people like the title track as well as THE PASS. Neil's lyrics have never been better than on this album, but the music isn't even close to their best. Still, this was an important release that closed the 80's and transitioned them into a harder sound for the 90's and beyond. This album also features some great acoustic guitar.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ugh.. no.. just, no.  I am pushing myself to finish the book.  This is a huge piece of crap.  I thought the author had to be a man when I started reading the sex scenes.  Really? Where can I get all those zillion orgasms a night? Ana is such a weak woman character.  I would slap her upside the head and tell her to get a backbone.  Christian... wow, he's just too perfect, isn't he?  Well, except for the BDSM thing I guess which, by the way, is written very poorly.<br /><br />I am eagerly waiting to finish this piece of trash so I can move on to something better written and more enjoyable to read.
0062082353|5.0|This book is riveting and very interesting. What I enjoyed the most is how the author seems to be speaking to you directly, while he recounts his experiences. Highly recommended.
B0074Y2YZ4|4.0|Whether you'll like Roxette's latest effort can be boiled down to how you liked 2009's \\"Charm School.\\" Like 1992's \\"Tourism,\\" \\"Travelling\\" is a collection of newer tunes, alternate takes, and reworkings or live performances of past cuts. As before, the bulk of the album's retreads come from the albums that came out right before it: in this case, Charm School; in Tourism's case, the classic \\"Joyride\\" and \\"Look Sharp!\\" LPs. So, if you enjoyed Charm School, you'll like this album. If Charm School wasn't to your taste, you'll probably keep your credit card in your wallet.<br /><br />But Tourism isn't entirely without merit. The new material -- and there's enough here to fill a vinyl LP from the early 1990s -- is, overall, a step above most of the duo's previous album. Perhaps it's because once the \\"comeback\\" was out of the way, Per Gessle and Marie Frederiksson had time to simply enjoy themselves. They're in a much more optimistic mood here, as evidenced by bouncy numbers like \\"Lover Lover Lover\\" and \\"Me and You and Terry and Julie,\\" two 1970s-influenced tributes to Electric Light Orchestra and Per's own classic retro album \\"The World According to Gessle\\" from 1998. You can almost see Lawrence Welk smiling...<br /><br />Roxette also wasn't afraid to rely on its past: See if you can listen to a standout track like \\"Touched by the Hand of God\\" and not be reminded of \\"Sleeping in my Car\\" from \\"Crash! Boom! Bang!\\" or \\"How Do You Do\\" from Tourism. \\"Touched\\" was originally going to be the title cut for the album that became Charm School, but the song was dropped out of concern that launching a new album with a religious-sounding theme might not be the best idea. Charm School's loss, Travelling's huge gain -- easily the best tune they've released in the past 15 years.<br /><br />Speaking of stuff from (almost) 15 years ago, you'll find a nice rework of \\"Stars,\\" their surprise hit from 1999's \\"Have a Nice Day.\\" Also taking you down memory lane: \\"Turn of the Tide,\\" which is another version of \\"Wish I Could Fly\\" (also from \\"Nice Day\\"), and a lyrically improved \\"It's Possible [version 2],\\" a kinder, gentler version of \\"Fool\\" from 2001's \\"Room Service.\\"<br /><br />\\"Angel Passing,\\" one of the more \\"original\\" tunes, maintains the accoustic bend that Per has been on for the past decade or so, to good effect. Reminiscent of \\"Handle With Care\\" from The Travelling Wilburys, this tender number will never make the radio, but it's a cut above filler.<br /><br />Among the misfires: a 2012 update of \\"It Must Have Been Love,\\" which sounds like an Olympic anthem; \\"Excuse Me Sir, Do You Want Me to Check on Your Wife?\\", a slice-of-life rambling that is as odd as the title sounds; and the album's first single, \\"It's Possible [version 1],\\" which seems incomplete, as if it was recorded while Per was still writing it. Roxette historically has been more about the beat and less about how a song delivered its message, but lines like \\"I just wanna oh oh oh\\" are pushing it.<br /><br />The live stuff -- which made up about one-third of Tourism -- was restricted to a solid rendition of \\"She's Got Nothing On [But the Radio],\\" the comeback hit from Charm School. It's marred only by the feeling that the audience didn't know the song all that well, and therefore wasn't really into it.<br /><br />Which brings us to the problem with this latest emergence of Roxette. They still like performing, they're still producing quality stuff (albeit a bit repetitive -- expected when you've been in the business more than 25 years). But does anyone care? Europe seems to say yes; that question can't be answered until they get an actual American distributor. Until then, thank the stars for YouTube and the Internet, without which Roxette would be travelling on by all of us over here in the States.

B0073XV2W2|3.0|After reading Suarez's first two books, I was really looking forward to this one, and overall I was not disappointed. I liked his first novel, Daemon, and wasn't too impressed with the second, Freedom. This third book is his second best, in my opinion better than Freedom and better than most action thriller books I have recently read.<br /><br />Suarez's first two novels were a lot more expansive in scope and thought provoking, trying to imagine the future through the lens of multiple technological trends. Kill Decision is a lot more focused on the near future and on military action and technology. This is why it reminded me of Tom Clancy - there is plenty of political conspiracy and intrigue, combined with special ops units and gallons of military jargon and abbreviations. This novel is thought provoking too, asking just how pervasive surveillance and drone attacks could be, and answering the question by introducing technologies currently believed to be cutting edge. In that sense, the style is also similar to Michael Crichton. There is also a good discussion of role of traditional and social media.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars? The plot and the ending were weak. Without giving away too much of a spoiler, it remains unclear who is behind the drone attacks. It is far from clear that the team of good guys has accomplished anything at the end besides giving us a fun and educational ride around the world (for which they get three stars). Also, there is bizarre emphasis on small \\"dumb\\" drones with ant-like swarming behavior (almost exclusively in the second half of the book) instead of the bigger and smarter (or human controlled) drones which appear at the beginning. In fact, this also signifies a disconnect between the research of the Stanford AI scientists early on in the book and the ant professor who occupies most of the rest, to the point that I wonder what the Stanford guys had to do with the plot at all, besides perhaps to tick off one more technology mention off the list. Another reviewer mentioned that in this book, the repetitive and annoying killer motorcycles of the earlier novels have been replaced by equally persistent killer drones, and I tend to agree. I wonder if this book was somehow rushed to print to capitalize on drones being a big topic du jour - it is clear that the plot lines and characters could have been a bit more elaborate like in the earlier novels. As it is, this book is more reminiscent of Ian Fleming's fun but relatively shallow action novels (which is also a compliment).<br /><br />Speaking of high tech gadgets, there are plenty. All sorts of brands and models of gear. Which brings me to two tiny annoyances. What's up with the special ops guys using Maglites? Who uses Maglites anymore? I would have expected them to at least have nice Surefire LED lights. And occasionally the good guys brandish a \\".45 tactical pistol\\" or a \\"killing knife\\" - what is that? Everything else has a brand or model number or at least a description, except their most basic tool?<br /><br />All in all, a fun read. It may even make you want to go and build your own little drone :)

0061714402|5.0|I was shocked. I thought it would be a list of how Dave hated Metallica, how he was always the victim of drugs and addictions. However, Dave really did a great job with this book. It goes through all the details of the early years with Metallica. All the situations they all got into. It covers the drug abuse, the drinking, the women, and the metal! Overall this is on my shelf of favorite books. Ive read it three times now and it makes you think more when you listen to Megadeth and the lyrics. In fact, yesterday I let a friend read it and he said he was shocked and amazed. If you are a metal head then check this amazing piece of literature out. If you are a Megadeth fan then you have to own this book.
0812993292|4.0|There are times in the lives of most people when we wish for a \\"do-over\\" or that some magical bargaining will change the course of things. Harold Fry, a retiree stuck in a life which he never really anticipated, slips into this belief after receiving a letter from Queenie, a former work colleague, who is in hospice. A chance encounter while walking to the mailbox to mail his reply keeps him walking as he heads from Kingsbridge to Berwick-upon-Tweed, believing that as long as he keeps walking Queenie will stay alive.<br /><br />The journey turns out to be more than 600 miles, for it takes Harold back through his life, remembering, ruminating, and reconnecting with various bits.  It also peels away much of his protective shell (as it peels away his poor feet, for he set out on the journey in the clothes he was wearing to post the letter, no phone, and no map) through his encounters with the various individuals he meets.<br /><br />The story captivated me, both Harold's and that of his wife Maureen. I wondered what could have possibly happened to turn the love that was so evident in Harold's memories into the estranged couple who happened to occupy the same home.  Their history unfolds gently, then regroups, and reforms, carrying the reader along.  I found myself rooting for Harold, step by step, as his journey sparks, flounders, and pushes on; rooting for Maureen, as she braves up and faces the things in her life that have made her stolid and grumpy; rooting for Queenie as well. Plus, there were some utterly delicious expressions in the writing, some that just delighted me and others that made me think \\"Yes! I know that feeling! Exactly!\\"<br /><br />This is a love story, but not the one you might think, hearing of a man rushing off to walk to the bedside of a dying woman he once knew.  It's an unlikely one, which results from the unlikely pilgrimage of Harold Fry.<br /><br />Thanks to Library Thing Early Reviewers and Random House for the chance to read this AR copy of the book. I really think this book is a 4.5, but not a 5, so hence the 4 star rating.f the book. I really think this book is a 4.5, but not a 5, so hence the 4 star rating.

030758836X|5.0|I have never read Gillian Flynn, and don't have a lot of interest in the mystery or psychological thriller genre, so when I first heard about this book, I didn't think it was for me. But after 3 different people mentioned it to me in a week - each with very different reading tastes - I decided I should give it a try, and I was glad. It was hard to put down, and kept me guessing throughout. I did anticipate some of the plot developments, but never was positive before they occurred, so it was far from predictable. I found myself wondering what was going to happen next each time I couldn't read for a few hours, so that's the sure sign of an engaging read. I don't want to say too much re: the plot because this is definitely a book you will best enjoy knowing little going in, but thematically it really plays with themes of marriage, whether you can really ever know someone, and the relationship between the media and reality in our modern lives. It's not heady though - this is a page-turner as I said - so these themes are covered through the story, not navel-gazing.<br /><br />As for complaints in negative reviews, it's true the main characters - Nick and Amy, a married couple - each have many unlikable traits, but they are also very intriguing (boring would be the worst quality in a main character I think, not dislikability.) And I think complaints about the ending are overly cranky - I read several 1-star reviews where the reviewer says he/she loved the book until the end. Why rate it a 1 -star if you liked 90% of it? Reading a book is a journey, and if you like most of the journey, you like most of the book!! There were only a handful of ways this could have ended, and in many ways, this was the most surprising, so I think it was a fine choice (although I also wondered how else I might have ended it, but I consider that kind of wondering the sign of an engaging book, not a failure.)<br /><br />So I think it's worthy of the hype. Give it a try!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is as hot as advertised.  Anastasia Steele meets Christian Grey while she is still in college and doing a favor for her roommate Kate.  He is in his late 20's, rich beyond belief and very much a control freak.  Anastasia continues to have dealings with him as he is involved in her college graduation ceremony.  Christian is very fascinated in Anastasia in a Dominant/Submissive manner.  He goes into her workplace and wants to find out more about her.<br /><br />Upon graduation, Anastasia moves to Seattle to find work in the publishing field.  Simultaneously, she is pursued by Christian who wants her to sign the contract as Submissive to his Dominant.  There is a bit of negotiation time as she researches the terms of the contract.  Since she is inexperienced, there is much she does not know about yet.  Christian is showering her with gifts at this time, such as a car, computers, cell phones, etc.<br /><br />When they finally consumate this relationship, these scenes are very descriptive.  She is immediately savvy in doing certain sex acts, despite being a virgin. I found that to be unrealistic.  He continues to tutor her in what acts are interesting to him.  She is always on fire from the jump when she is with him and has no problem expressing her sexual side from the start.  Again, a bit unrealistic in my opinion.<br /><br />She has to deal with his darker side as she has dealings with those in his past.  When he does some extreme physical activity, she finds that she is at her limit and questions her relationship with him.
B005LAII12|5.0|Ill admit ive seen thd trailers on and offline before i saw this and im a die hard family guy fan. I went to see this 2 days after it came out with 4 friends.  OHH MY GODDDD its so hillarious. Im trying not to cuss but dang its one of the funniest r rated movies in many years. After 10 minutes of getting through the story of how it started it gets into the comedy and blow by blow you fall over laughing. At points me and 3 friend were caughing in how much we laughed. Its one of those movies that hits every few minute sand when it does dont hesitate to laugh till u cant anymore. Its that damm good.  Ill just say its a must own if your a fan of either offensive comedy or family guy,american dad,the cleaveland show or seth mcfarlane as a comic.<br /><br />It was worth every bit of the $11 i poaid to see it and it will be MOREEEEE then worth it to own the dvd
0143034901|4.0|I enjoyed the descriptive language used in the book. It made it easy to imagine how simple--and depending on the circumstances--cruel life could be in 1940's Barcelona. The characters were intriguing and the story had enough mystery to keep me turning pages deep into the night. The reveal between Julian and Pen&eacute;lope was a surprise. A great read even though some back-stories meandered a bit at times.

0756405890|4.0|Hard to believe this is a debut novel as Patrick Rothfuss can WRITE. Kvothe is a splendid creation and is totally credible as a character, as is the setting Rothfuss places him in. Although the work is totally original it has echoes of Middle Earth, Earthsea, and other longstanding respected fantasy worlds and would rightly find its place among high fantasy's best novels.<br /><br />It's also noting that the top-ranked most helpful review is written by Robin Hobb, herself an extremely gifted writer (who has also written as Megan Lindholm and penned the heartbreaking \\"Wizard of the Pigeons.\\") When a skilled writer praises a new writer, that speaks volumes.<br /><br />I won't go into the tale as others have done so far more skillfully than I could. Just be aware that there is great writing in this book. This is not your David Eddings/Anne McCaffrey/Terry Brooks tale full of bouncy energy and fantasy tropes. Rothfuss is a literary writer who breathes life into his characters. By the end of this book, you will \\"know\\" Kvothe in a way that rarely happens in fantasy -- a genre so often dependent on storytelling that its practitioners frequently ignore character development to their peril.<br /><br />This is a keeper and a purchase you won't regret.

B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is deceiving.  It looks like a show made for high schoolers, but it's actually a lot more than that.  I'd like to mention that Rob Thomas (the creator) first wanted to take Veronica Mars to HBO because of how dark it was.  However, UPN got ahold of him first, and wanted it as long as they made it a little bit \\"lighter.\\"  My point is that Veronica Mars isn't just a little feel good teeny bopper show.  It's an intricate, exciting, mystery series with believable twists and turns at every corner.<br /><br />I first watched this show at 16 and loved it.  I re-watched it again to make sure I didn't love it from just being a teen, and I still love it!  I heavily pressured my boyfriend in his late 30s to watch it, and he very reluctantly agreed.  After the second episode he was totally hooked and just kept saying, \\"play the next episode!\\"  The characters are likable, relatable, interesting, and everything is woven together so perfectly.  It really is a masterpiece!  Even Stephen King loves this, and he's an old man!<br /><br />If you love mystery/noir type shows, you MUST watch this, whether you're 15 or 50!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|If you want to start your authentic life, this book can move you confidently in the direction of your goal. Thought provoking!!

B00005B5L4|5.0|If you are buying the DVD Audio version of Rumours, then you are already a fan of this album.  I already own this album on CD & MP3 formats, but I wanted the higher quality audio offered on the DVD audio format.  There is really a noticable difference in the sound quality.  Much less compressed and the vocals and instrumentation are much clearer.<br />I would say that when the 5.1 surround was mixed, it was done so in good taste.  By that I mean, they didn't just throw random tracks in the rear channels just to give it a surround sound experience.  I notice a lot of the background vocals shine through from the rear, but in a subtle way.<br />I am listening to this in my vehicle, which has DVD-A capabilities.  It is a very nice system, but listening to this on a very high end home theatre may give the listener a different experience.  Just thought I would call that out.<br />Overall, as a fan of this album, I am VERY pleased with how great this DVD-A is.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|i've had no problems with this game shutting down on me at all. i have completed 3 of the 4 levels and it hasnt shut down once.  I'm looking for another version to buy since I've almost completed this one!

B0085YNML2|4.0|its fun....good sound.its like cut the rope.so I think u will like its good for playing it on a plane.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|All you have to do is read the reviews to learn these games are a scam. 'free' is NOT free when IAP's are involved. I have talked to Amazon, sent emails to them, and left many, many reviews (along with many other unhappy people)  concerning this issue but they just don't seem to be concerned.<br /><br />The other problem I have is the listed file size of the game. A LOT of games advertise a small file size, only to find out AFTER you buy it that you have to download another 200 to 500 MB's or more to get the complete game. I've tried to get Amazon to list the ENTIRE game size, not just the initial file size in their game descriptions, but they won't do that either. If this is the way Amazon was planning on doing business, they should have put a removable memory slot in these Kindle Fire devices.
B007MG360G|4.0|It's good but Doodle God is still THE BEST! Although I will say it's. cool that you can have expert or casual mode.And probably only worth 50 or 25 cents. Not the best from joy bits.

B004T2QZL8|5.0|Doodle God was by far*the best app (paid / free) EVER!*<br />DEFINATELY worth the .99 cents. For adults and kids- go to options,hit kids safe mode off,make up a password, and viola! BUY IT!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|its kinda the same as every other game they give you ridiculous missions you pretty much have no freedom to do what you want you buy what they tell you to you befriend who they tell you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|all of the reviewed say that you cant get out of the game. that is not the you have to go to the stuff opition  and then the home bar pops up. I don't get how adults cant figure this out because I am only 10 all adults that made a bad review about that should have shame on them selves!!!!! I really recommend this game its adicting but if you don't play for a while you will get un adicted. best game ever but after awhile it starts to make the quests to get you to pay money

B008JH5CVS|2.0|2 Things.<br /><br />First, the movie's ridiculous video game physics during the initial motorcycle chase pretty much ruined the whole movie for me. My disbelief in how sucky movie special effects can be in 2012 was not suspended.<br /><br />Second, I noticed after I rented it there was an unrated version. I really think I should be either 1) alerted to the fact there is another version of the same movie I'm about to rent and be given a choice, or 2) allowed to preconfigure my desire to see the most raunchy, censor-needing version of anything. Guaranteed, if it is going to make someone feel awkward because it messes with their morality or limited world-view that's the version I want to see.

0062060554|3.0|nitial Thoughts:<br />This came up on my recommendations on Goodreads, and I can't say no to a good psychological thriller.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />Holy cow. This book was INTENSE.<br /><br />Poor Christine. I felt so bad for her throughout the whole book. Can you imagine waking up and not remembering so much of your life?<br /><br />The revelations throughout the book kept you guessing.<br /><br />The surprise ending was so crazy I could barely wrap my head around it.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />The ending was a bit far fetched.<br /><br />It reminded me of the movie 50 First Dates, which was a comedy, which is probably not what I was supposed to be thinking about while reading. I kept thinking about the penguin from the movie.<br /><br />Parts of this book were so slow moving that I debated putting it down, but I trucked on because I knew that in a few pages something else would be revealed.<br /><br />I didn't like the story line about her son. It seemed so cruel, but really everything else in her life was just as cruel, but that part really stood out to me.<br /><br />The Wrap Up:<br />A pretty decent thriller. It definitely gave me the creeps, but didn't leave a lasting impression in my mind.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"With him everything is a test, affection is measured, that given weighed against that which has been recieved, and the balance, more often than not, disappointing him.\\"
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is similar to the game pictionary. Play with friends or another random gamer! At first on my Kindle Fire it would crash and require a re-install but it seems like they fixed this problem.

0425263908|3.0|I picked up Bared To You in a whim after reading a favorable review of it on one of the blogs that I follow. It wasn't until after I had gotten it that I learned that it was being compared to Fifty Shades of Grey. I am one of the few people who hasn't read Fifty Shades yet and I am not likely to. I've been able to read a few excerpts from it here and there that have convinced me that I will not enjoy it. So I can't really make any comparisons to Fifty Shades, which is probably a good thing, as this book should stand on its own.<br /><br />Bared To You begins when NYC transplant Eva Trammell starts a new job and runs into possibly the most handsome and compelling man she's ever met. Gideon Cross is a force to be reckoned with, a billionaire businessman who owns properties all over NYC who also happens to be drop dead gorgeous (seriously where are all these hot men in my office building?). The chemistry between Eva and Gideon is immediate and Gideon wastes no time in letting Eva know exactly what he wants from her.<br /><br />This is the story of two extremely damaged people trying their best to be in a relationship. On one hand, I think that their pasts make Eva and Gideon perfect for each other. Both understand the kinds of things that the other has gone through and are willing to work on their issues. But on the other hand, you have two really messed up people together who don't always deal with things in a healthy way. Eva, for one, runs away when things get tough or uncomfortable. But it's something that she admits to and is trying to overcome.<br /><br />Gideon seems like the more put together of the two, but he has his own dark demons. The author doesn't really get into too much detail with Gideon's past, which I think we need to understand him more. I also had some issues with Gideon's stalker tendencies. I enjoy a little possessiveness in my male protagonists but I felt like Gideon was stepping over the line at times. Making copies of her keys, following her, looking into her cell phone - these are all things that I think are really not cool. He justifies his actions in many ways and Eva accepts his excuses, making them seem sweet instead of creepy. Given Eva's character and her past, I just don't think she should have accepted his excuses so easily.<br /><br />Despite some of the issues I had with it, I did enjoy reading this. Gideon and Eva are both very compelling characters. They are both very flawed but are working to overcome their issues. Day does a good job of showing how their intense physical attraction evolves into something more.<br /><br />I am not sure how Gideon and Eva's relationship is going to translate into three books. That seems like a really long time to follow these two so I can only imagine that there is going to be a lot of drama in the next book. Hopefully we'll learn more about Gideon's past and I'd also love to see more of Eva's best friend Cary. Day's definitely piqued my interest with this one and I look forward to seeing where she takes these two.<br /><br />*I received this book free of charge from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

B0068RHSCW|5.0|This is a well-made movie that has interesting, even touching, characters and lots of plot twists.<br /><br />Will Atenton quits his high-profile publishing job (with GPH publishing) to live in remote surburbs with his wife and two young daughters, 5 and 8.  His wife refurbishes the delipidated house while he writes.<br /><br />But strange, shocking things begin to happen.  The girls see a man spying in windows and roaming the grounds.  A posse of goth teenagers takes up residence in the basement and enacts death rituals--because, they tell Atenton, everybody who lived in the house was murdered.  The police refuse to disclose details, and refuse to help when the prowler shows up again.<br /><br />Is it a ghost?  Is it a kidnapper?  Is it a serial killer?<br /><br />Attenton fially finds out--to his shock--when he goes to GPH mental hospital to ask about the previous occupant.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is superb as Attenton: open, empathetic, kindly, distraught, downcast.  Rachel Weisz is also great as his wife--ironically, the down-to-earth practical one, who always has sensible explanations for the horrors.  The kids are charming and believable.  Naomi Watts is terrific in an almost silent role as the neighbor going through a ferocious divorce.  Even the bit players are wonderful.  Rachel Fox, Naomi Watts's teen daughter, practically steals the show in a tiny part.  Michael Czokas and Elias Koteas are wonderful as the bitter husband and his (apparently dyslexic) employee.<br /><br />The setting is also superb.  The subtle symbolism of the melting snow parallels Atenton's melting confusion and coming-to-new-life.<br /><br />Even the makeup is good.  Craig moves almost imperceptibly from a floppy-haired gangly happy husband to a gaunt, hair-slicked-back bruised taciturn survivor.<br /><br />Excellent throughout.
B000059GEI|3.0|Don't be deceived by the cover.  Marilyn Monroe, while amply represented in the movie as Vicky Carter (an upwardly mobile showtunes dreamer who ends up finding wild success), does not dominate or overshadow the film.  The film is actually filled out by several actors, most whom play as The Donahue family (with Ethel Merman as the matriarchal Donahue), a family beating down the train stations and airports as a musical traveling family in the waning days of vaudeville.  This is a musical and there is a lot of singing, including the pathos portions, as well as just noise, noise, noise.  Sure, it shows a side of life some are familiar with but the movie was just noisy.  As the Donahue's children begin to go their own ways a family crisis occurs when son Tim (played by a snappy and obviously talented Donald O'Connor) drinks a bit too much and absconds to whereabouts unknown after a rueful, semantic fisticuff with father.  The family is united in their concern over son/ brother and all is not-so-neatly tied up in the end when he comes back to the fold.  The well-known show-stopper \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" is belted out just like you're familiar with by Ethel Merman who shows talent for more than just singing throughout the film.  Still, the middling and sufferable plot and the music numbers placed just to show you that people can sing and dance in an almost haphazard way, hold this movie back from being one of the great musicals.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|its an okay game but the free version is way to shot.  I'm not spending $5 on the longer cause I feel like they suckered me in...
030758836X|3.0|Didn't really care for this book. Very slow and boring over halfway thru book. Ending was not very good either. Guess it was left for a 2nd book? Will not buy 2nd book. Normally Gillian Flynn is a good read...not to me this time. Sorry.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|awesome. great game only $.99 is fun... Shark Dash make my borring day. i recommended! !! Have a great fun game day
B00846REIS|5.0|I just finished this book. It was comparable to Fify Shades....just not an Dom/Sub relationship. A good read and looking forward to 2nd book in October.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This last book of the trilogy greatly met my expectations.<br />Some parts of it were slow, like for example, the beginning. A lot of the details could be cut, but even so, I'd still prefer if it was there. It just shows how the lifestyle of District Thirteen was for Katniss. In my opionion, I needed to know a bit more about Katniss's opionion because I didn't get her feelings or emotions as much as I would have liked.<br />I don't want to sound selfish, but I wanted a lot more Peeta in this book. He didn't even show up until the very end of the book. He kept the life of the story, and he was the one who made Katniss appear strong and tough. But since he was not there, Katniss was as weak as ever. I understood what trauma she went through, but she was supposed to have the courage to move on. And despite that, I just loved Peeta's character in general. He was the life of the book, the only character I truly favored(and also Finnick, but he's not too important)<br />I loved the analogy that was used. All of the districts were playing their last Hunger Games with the Capital. That was something that helped me out a great deal.<br />Some things could've been explained a bit more vividly, like the pods for example. I was confused about their functions, but was forced to move on. I just got the general idea that they were pretty harmful if activated.<br />Then there's the ending. It was very tragic and surprising, and yet a bit fast and slow at the same time. When she was to kill Snow, but instead shoots at Coin, I felt the whole incident was a bit too quick for my liking. Then it becomes slow when she just sits and awaits her (supposed) death. It was also a bit slow when she was taken back to District Twelve.<br />I also expected something bigger with her and Gale. I knew she felt wrong for being with someone who's plan killed her sister, but he was her closest friend. I felt like there needed to be more to explain for that. And after she goes to her district, Gale was never mentioned of again. I thought there should have been more Gale because he was an important character, in my opinion.<br />But despite all of this, I enjoyed the book very much. It was a thriller that will always be engraved at the back of my head. This shows war and violence, and the simple nature of human beings. So I recommend this series to any young adults. The well-written structure of the book will grab your attention and keep you thrilled until the end.

B005LAIGF0|5.0|I highly recommend the movie \\"Margaret\\" directed by Kenneth Lonergan.<br /><br />It's the second film Lonergan has both written and directed. You may remember his first film \\"You Can Count On Me\\" (2000).<br /><br />Lonergan shot \\"Margaret\\" back in 2005 but it was never widely released due to a series of investor/producer legal squabbles and a contentious editing process where even Martin Scorsese was involved. Lonergan's own theatrical cut was finally released this month (July 2012) on DVD.<br /><br />It's a gem of a movie and if you love New York and the performing arts it's an additional plus. The film is beautifully shot, the music is captivating and the acting is top notch. It has an amazing cast including Anna Paquin, Matt Damon, Mark Ruffalo, Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, J. Smith-Cameron, Allison Janney, Josh Hamilton and an amazing performance by Jeannie Berlin.<br /><br />It's an imperfect masterpiece conveying the messiness of life and I loved it.

B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I have only had this cover a short time and noticed that the protective coating is wearing off of it.  I ordered it in white so it is quite apparent what is happening.  It's past the 30 day return policy so I'm stuck with it.  It certainly isn't worth the $$'s it cost to purchase it.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|There's not much recap needed for this book, by this time I suspect the entire English-speaking world knows about these books. Mousy Ana Steele meets &uuml;ber rich but oh-so-emotionally disturbed Christian Grey. In this book, Ana settles into her new job at a Seattle publishing house and life without Christian (hah - you know that won't last long). Our pair of *lovebirds* continue to deal with Christian's dark past, one of his former subs in his games of BDSM, and the woman who made him what he is today (Mrs. Robinson Ana calls her). Will Ana and Christian be able to break through his tortured soul and heal him? Or will they just continue for another 400 or so pages of horizontal hurdy gurdy? Does anyone really care?<br /><br />Not me, I was just too curious to see what all the hoopla was about and hate to say it, but I still don't get it. While the writing and storyline is somewhat improved in book two, the repetitiveness still reigns supreme. I am very weary of smirks, rolling eyes, flushing, blushing and inner goddesses (kill her, please). I am so shell-shocked from the constant sex that any other book is going to be tame by comparison (you don't want to hear about the butt drawer). By my tally, they've not only done it in the bedroom, but in the elevator, on the pool table, on the grand piano, on the table in the foyer along with a round of digital pleasuring in a crowded elevator in the Columbia Tower. Gah, less is more.<br /><br />Then we come once again to the Seattle setting, a setting that isn't always based on reality. You would think that once you've got the contract from the big publishing house you could afford an editor, but no...<br /><br />This review is getting long enough so this Seattle native will just name a few pet peeves.<br /><br />\\"Seattle and my stomach drop away from us, and there's so much to see. \\"We've chased the dawn, Anastasia, now the dusk...\\"<br /><br />The time setting is early to mid June. Christian has picked her up around 5:45 PM for a 7:30 PM show in Portland. The sun sets around 9PM at this time of year, but we get this when they land in Portland,<br /><br />\\"It's a clear, crisp evening, and the lights of Portland twinkle and wink...\\"<br /><br />Kind of hard to see lights twinkling when it is broad daylight and all.<br /><br />\\"Placing his hands snugly over mine, he continues to steer our course out of the marina, and within a few minutes we are out on the open sea, the cold blue waters of Puget Sound. Away from the shelter of the marina's protective wall, the wind is stronger, and the sea pitches and rolls beneath us.\\"<br /><br />This is the Puget Sound. This is not the open sea. And don't get me started on taking an entire afternoon to sail to Bainbridge Island and back. Even with a long stop for another round of hot sex, it doesn't take that long. The ferry would have been faster :/<br /><br />\\"I've always wanted to live on the coast. I sail up and down the Sound coveting these houses.\\"<br /><br />Read my lips. The Puget Sound is not the coast. And would someone please tell me who in the USA thinks of mac and cheese as \\"nursery food?\\" Honestly, I don't know why the author just didn't take her version of Twilight and stick them in London or somewhere closer to home.<br /><br />I guess if you like a thin plot, mixed signals (is beating a woman with a ruler good or bad?), repetitive writing, sex at the drop of a hat with no romance, these books might suit - but I'm still scratching my head trying to understand why they're so popular. I am going to tackle book three, and thank goodness the first of it is set in Europe. If James messes that up, I'll never know, although there was a huge gaffe over what airport they used to board the private jet in Seattle :DPM for a 7:30 PM show in Portland.

B000MNP2K8|5.0|I don't want to give away anything about this movie, so I'll try to keep it short and sweet. Definately a must see. Definately a must see twice, no perhaps 3 times. I LOVE this movie. Now I am an action packed movie lover, and this movie was just right for me. And, my goodness, was Daniel Craig an fabulous actor, The best James Bond actor to me. I would highly suggest you purchase this movie. It is worth every dime you'll pay. Trust me. I promise, you will fall in love with this movie....and quite possibly, Daniel Craig...just like I did.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Fantastic guitar work.  Reminds me of the vintage rock that came from the great rock bands of the 60's and 70's.  One of my friends claims that the best rock has already been written.  This album tells me that this type of talent isn't totally lost, just hibernating.

B00005JPO1|4.0|People seem to fall into two camps concerning this movie: those who love it, and those who hate it. I hope to present a more balanced view.<br /><br />This is a fun movie full of action, humor, surprises, interesting characters, and intrigue - everything you could hope for in an Indiana Jones film. But since fans had to wait so long for it, and the anticipation was built up beyond normal proportions, expectations were too high for many to fully enjoy it. They were expected to get blown out of the water, much like audiences were when they saw the first Indy movie in 1981.<br /><br />While this movie has much going for it, a few things keep it from being the great film it could have been. Like many, the alien-related plotline didn't really do it for me. I understand they were trying to emulate 50's alien B-movies, much like the previous films emulated 30's adventure serials, but it doesn't quite work in an Indiana Jones movie. The MacGuffin (what they call the treasure being sought in each film) needs to be believable, and an alien skull just isn't believable enough to work. Plus, it's revealed much too soon in the movie. In the previous films, there was much build-up and anticipation to each of the MacGuffins which added to the mystique.<br /><br />Also, too much CGI is used for the special effects. One of the great things about the previous Indy films is that relying solely on stunt work gave it an air of believability. In this film, you can tell where CGI is used and where it's not used. Spielberg should have kept to his original plan of not using any or very little CGI, especially during action sequences like the jungle chase.<br /><br />What the film does well is showing what Indy is like in his later years. Harrison Ford is still in great shape in his mid-60's, and he looks pretty much like he did in Last Crusade except with more gray hair and wrinkles. The film gives us some interesting backstory on what Indy has been doing since the last film, including a stint in the U.S. military during WWII and participation in the Roswell crash of '47. I wish they had done an earlier movie about his time in WWII, but it's a bit late now.<br /><br />With all that said, I hope they follow through on completing the fifth film (as of now it's being written). Why you ask? Think about it: all the odd Indy movies are great (Raiders, Last Crusade). Plus, this will give the filmmakers the chance to do a film with a bit more gravitas, much like Raiders and Last Crusade. Of course, whether that will happen is yet to be seen.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of GREAT!!!<br />I cannot tell you how tired I was of hearing about this book.  It seemed to be stalking me.  No matter where I went someone was reading this book, talking about this book or looking to buy this book.  It was crazy.  So, because I love my sister oh so much I purchased it for her as a Kindle gift and told her to read it first and to let me know what she thought.  Three weeks later she still had not started the darn book.  Frustrated and tired of all of the gibber about the book I purchased it.  I have to admit that I can always tell within the first five pages if I am going to like a book or hate it, but I cannot leave a book unfinished not matter how bad I think it is.  I fell in love with the story. Something drew me in and held me captive. I got so excited that I became part of the FIFTY SHADES STALKER club.  I kept at my sister until she started reading the book. Once she started she finished it before I did and had moved on to the next one.  No book is perfect, so if I had to tell you something that I didn't like about the book it would have to be the choice of words at any given time and from any of the characters.  I believe that Ms. James is British and therefore some of the words or phrases used don't really fit with an American dialect.  I found this annoying at some points, but I got over it quickly and kept right on reading.  Most people like the book for the \\"content\\", but if you are fully aware of this type of existence the story is what becomes intriguing.  I am off to the Fifty Shades Darker and so far I have not been disappointed.  What am I going to read once I finish Fifty Shades Freed?  I understand that there is a movie in the works.  I thought about who could play the different parts:<br />Anastasia-Ann Hathaway, Haley Atwell, Kristen Stewart<br />Christian-Christian Bale (may be too old) Michael C. Hall, Ryan Phillippe, Henry Cavill<br />Kate-Emma Stone<br />Taylor-Michael Clark Duncan<br />Elliott-Kenny Wormald<br />Jose-Jesse Williams<br />I love the book and think that it is worth the read./>Jose-Jesse Williams<br />I love the book and think that it is worth the read.

B0046VRR5A|3.0|The Glenn Gould, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Arthur Rubinstein, Fritz Reiner, Jascha Heifetz, Bruno Walter and George Szell performances can rightfully be called \\"definitive\\".  The rest range from mediocre (Bernstein, Horowitz & Ozawa) to pretty good (Stern & Munch).  If you're a beginner (or want to upgrade from worn old LPs)  This set's worth the price.
0596805888|3.0|When I purchased this book, I was under the impression that it would be directed at people like myself: nerdy and with no cooking ability. I was hoping to get some beginner tips and maybe some comedic references to Klingon Gagh or something. While this is a pretty well-written book and will please some people in it's intended demographic, I do not feel I am one of those people.<br /><br />Before I start, let me make this clear: I am a terrible cook. I have never made anything from a recipe, and I have ruined everything I've tried to make, from frozen pizza to pasta. And when I say pasta, I don't mean sauce, I mean that I literally ruined putting pasta in boiling water and cooking it for a few minutes. Now, this is not for lack of interest. In the early 2000s, I started reading and watching Anthony Bourdain, and through his influence, have widened my culinary outlook and have recently become interested in learning to cook for myself, as I am tired of takeout and pre-cooked meals. So I bought this book.<br /><br />Now, I did not hate this book. It is well written, the author is a nerd who seems to take a great deal of pleasure in cooking and teaching others to cook. My problem was not with the book as much as it was the title. Geek/nerd culture encompasses a wide variety of interests, and while most nerds/geeks have some similar, shared experiences and likes, we are also by no means identical in our likes and references. The author of this book has a background in computer programming, and as such, the large majority of his references are computer/programming based. I, on the other hand, tend to be more of a English/comic book/literature nerd, and while I love computers and science, I could not tell you the difference between a C+ Basic and a something something compiler. Because of this, a lot of the references the author makes fly right over my head, and the confusion I felt in the kitchen was compounded with the confusion I felt at programming references I did not understand.<br /><br />Again, I would like to say: this is not a bad book. I do not blame the author for writing the book the way it is. It is filled with a lot of useful information if you have the ability to understand it, and even I was entertained by certain parts, like the interviews with Adam Savage and Xeni Jardin. If you are a computer nerd and want to learn more about cooking, then this is definitely the book for you and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />However, if you are like me and your knowledge of computer programming and science comes mostly from playing an engineer class in Mass Effect, then I would at least suggest that you see if you can flip through it at your local library or a friend's house before purchasing.understand.<br /><br />Again, I would like to say: this is not a bad book.

B005OCFGTO|1.0|I was extremely excited to purchase this product, however; when it arrived the case was cracked.  Okay, that's not really a big deal, but as I watched the movies I noticed that there were scenes missing from them.  As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was extremely disappointed.  By the time you get to movies 6 through 8, there is either no sound, the sound skips, the picture lags & freezes, the screen goes blank...  These are only a few of the problems with these.  Don't buy these unless you enjoy being scammed and wasting your money.

1612130283|1.0|I read everything: fiction, biographies, history, sci-fi, short stories, erotica, westerns, so I felt that with the rave reviews, this book would be very good. Not so it seems. I struggled to get through the first few pages, appalled at the juvenile writing. I thought Twilight was bad! (didn't finish the first book of that either). It must be that people have not read erotica before who really like this. You do not feel anything for the characters-they are flat and seem to spring from the pages of something equally shallow, such as the glossy pages of a Cosmopolitan. To read a that a college age girl majoring in Literature who's verbal repertoire includes \\"crap\\" & \\"double crap\\"; and Mr. Grey, who is running his hands through his hair every other page, well, it's highly disappointing this was even published.

B007P6PLDI|3.0|As a longtime fan of The Smashing Pumpkins, I was looking forward to this reissue nearly as much as I did the 'Siamese Dream' reissue, as 'Pisces Iscariot' has always held a special place in my heart. While not the flawless masterpiece that 'Siamese Dream' is, it really showcased the band's wide range of styles, much more so than their two studio albums, and with more of a raw, \\"live\\" sound overall. It could be argued that these outtakes and B-Sides are better than most of their alt-rock peers' grade-A material. I couldn't wait to hear these songs with cleaned-up sound, not to mention all the bonus material--the outtakes of the outtakes, if you will.<br /><br />Within seconds of popping in the remastered first disc and playing \\"Plume,\\" I thought maybe I had grabbed the bonus disc by mistake, as the vocals are entirely different from the original, sung in a lower register by Billy, with slightly different lyrics in spots. Nowhere in the liner notes does it mention the use of a different vocal take, so I'm wondering if this was accidental. Or did Billy not care for the original take, so he swapped it with another? Either way, I think this version should have been saved for the bonus disc, instead of going all George Lucas and altering things that were fine to begin with, but I didn't let this kill my buzz. However, during the next song I listened to, \\"Frail and Bedazzled,\\" something didn't sound right to me again, but I couldn't quite figure it out, even after listening to the original version to compare. Eventually I decided to play both at the same time on separate players, and within 15 seconds they were out of sync with each other. The new one, while the same as far as the vocal and instrumental tracks, is actually slower, hence lower in pitch. While the original ends at 3:16, the new one ends at 3:21. Not a big deal, and maybe this was intended, but it does give it a \\"lower\\" sound.<br /><br />Then I stopped obsessing over these things and just enjoyed it for whatit is, 14 stellar songs by one of my favorite bands during (arguably) their peak years. The sound quality seemed about the same to me at first, though slightly louder, and with less noticable hiss on certain songs. Fortunately there's no clipping, at least on the first disc, an all too common side effect of the current \\"loudness wars.\\" However, the next day, while listening on headphones, I noticed quite a few instances of digital noise and crackles in various songs,  notably the beginning of \\"Pissant\\" and the end of \\"Blue.\\" These glitches are not in the originals. While they aren't jarring, I was expecting better quality, especially considering the great job Corgan and Ludwig did with the 'Gish' and 'Siamese Dream' remasters.<br /><br />Those issues didn't affect my enjoyment as much as the bonus disc's issues, and there are many. These songs were brickwalled (i.e. made louder, basically) to the point of digital clipping and distortion in many of the songs. At first I thought, \\"Well, these are outtakes and demos, so I shouldn't be too harsh, since the sound quality probably wasn't great to begin with.\\" But, being a hardcore fan, I already own bootlegs of many of these songs and, while overall the sound quality here is clearer, there's less dynamic range, and there was no clipping in the bootleg versions. A large number of the songs contain digital noise as well, and the transition between \\"French Movie Theme\\" and \\"Purr Snickety\\" is off. The first few seconds of \\"Purr Snickety\\" are at the end of \\"French Movie Theme,\\" so if you want to hear all of \\"Purr Snickety' you have to rewind to the end of the previous song. And when I ripped this disc to iTunes, a couple songs were not labeled properly, causing the tracks to be out of order. Again, not a huge deal, but considering the cost of this set, I expected more care to be put into it.<br /><br />Fortunately the live DVD makes it all worth it in the end, as it's awesome to have these early performances from when SP weremore of a Cure-esque goth/new wave band, as opposed to the psychedelic hard rock powerhouse they would become in the next couple years (as evidenced later in the DVD). The sound quality's good for a 1988 public access broadcast, and Jimmy's mullet is rocking the jam session as well, which is always a plus. Unfortunately, I no longer have a cassette player, so I haven't listened to the 1988 demo tape yet, though I do have a bootleg, and it's definitely worth hearing for those of you who haven't. It, along with the DVD, will give you a whole new perspective on the evolution of this great band, showing just how thoroughly they reinvented themselves in a few short years with 'Gish.'<br /><br />So, despite all the problems, the set is still definitely worth getting for the hardcore fan, but you might want to wait and see if these glitches are fixed, as I've noticed other SP fans online complaining, wanting refunds, etc. Maybe this will cause Billy and co. to reissue the reissue, but I don't see that happening, at least for a while. Hopefully the upcoming 'Mellon Collie' remaster is handled with the same care as 'Gish' and 'Siamese Dream' were, as I have a feeling the complaints will be much louder than they are now if similar defects are noticed in that. Here's hoping...

For the price, I thought she should do something else that would give her a more \\"lasting joy\\", but I guess the heart wants what the heart wants, no matter what.  She is pleased enough with this Barbie, it isn't made great (as is becoming the case with all Barbie doll stuff). This won't be an heirloom for generations to come (thank goodness!).

B0086700CM|3.0|It is a fun game for a while. It keeps you your toes the entire time that you are playing. On the contrary, it becomes boring once you have bought every character and fully upgraded every special power and downloaded every wallpaper. Also, when you have achieved every obstacle such as double ressurection, the sect six, etc, the game seems almost pointless to continue to play; it becomes boring. I would suggest purchase Temple Run, and enjoy it while it is fun.
B000QUUD60|4.0|While there is NO doubt this is the Elvis that all the fans have been waiting to see in high quality audio and video (both are insanely good) I felt that leaving out JUST CAN'T HELP BELIEVIN', SWEET CAROLINE, I'VE LOST YOU, BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER, and the version of SUSPICIOUS MINDS that were all used on the original movie was a mistake that could only be made by someone who had no clue about what Elvis fans really wanted to see and hear.  I did appreciate them editing out all of the odd-ball fans that were shown in the original, however, I would have liked to have seen the part where the overseas fans fans were watching Elvis imitators and then the scene cut to Elvis doing TIGER MAN with a flashing spotlight hitting him.<br />It seems strange to me that those who own the rights to the masters of these classic Vegas concerts wouldn't want to make the money they could off of their releases.  Who can we contact to urge those be released? Does anyone know?
1401230423|5.0|There are several things Gaiman does well, and among them, is the weaving of mythologies into a single beautifully cohesive thread. In \\"Season of Mists,\\" Lucifer decides that he's tired of ruling hell. He shuts it down and hands Morpheus (Dream) the key to hell. Soon, the representatives of various pantheons show up to make a case for why Morpheus should give the key to them.<br /><br />The story blossoms into fantastic integration of mythology into mainstream Christianity. I'll confess that I was concerned that Gaiman would challenge my world view of God and Christianity, but in fact, he places the \\"Creator\\" solidly at the top of the totem pole, and weaves his story around that central theme. Despite the seeming randomness of life, despite the rebellions that seem to lead people astray, there is an inevitable sense of purpose, an unshakeable feeling of control that the \\"Creator\\" appears to have over creation. I find that consoling, somehow.<br /><br />I enjoyed Gaiman's depiction of Lucifer--the weary administrator of Hell. One of my favorite quotes in this novel comes from Lucifer: \\"Why do they (humans) blame me for all their little failings? They use my name as if I spend my entire day sitting on their shoulders, forcing them to commit acts they would otherwise find repulsive. 'The devil made me do it.' I have never made one of them do anything. Never. They live their own tiny lives. I do not live their lives for them. And then they die, and they come here (having transgressed against what they believed to be right), and expect us to fulfill their desire for pain and retribution. I don't make them come here. They talk of me going around and buying souls, like a fishwife come market day, never stopping to ask themselves why. I need no souls. And how can anyone own a soul? No. They belong to themselves. They just hate to have to face up to it.\\"
B0076NAWWA|5.0|I really liked this album when I first heard it, but thought it wasn't quite as hard-edged as I'd expected. Yet I haven't stopped playing it! The licks and grooves stick in your head and it sounds better every time you play it. Has it got a religious message? Apparently yes, but as with a lot of Neil Morse's stuff the great music overwhelms any \\"message\\" and you hardly hear it (something NM might be concerned about or not). So highly recommended.
B0051RP4DA|5.0|Yet another side of Eddie that I really enjoy!  I appreciate is versatility going from hard rock/grunge with Pearl Jam back in the day to a more relaxed laid back approach with Ukulele Songs and Into the Wild.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|My review covers E.L. James' \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy, which includes \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" and the third book, \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\". I'll be the first to admit that I made fun of those reading the Fifty Shades trilogy and couldn't understand how something like that could be so popular. Then, I caved in and downloaded the first book, expecting it to be a dull but quick read. I was wrong. I apologize to all who I looked down on and criticized for succumbing to today's latest trashy romance hit because I GET IT! I read all three books within a week and when I wasn't reading it, I was wishing I was home reading it. Is E.L. James going to be up for a Pulitzer? No, but she won me over with her scandalizing sex scenes and surprisingly depth of a storyline. Yes, there is sex, sex and more tenacious sex, which I can't say I disliked but it also deals with why the antagonist Christian Grey prefers the S&M culture, where he's positioned himself as a dominant, who has complete control and pleasure over his precisely picked submissive.<br /><br />The protagonist of \\"Fifty Shades\\" is Anastasia Steele, who's fresh out of college, looking to begin her career in publishing. Ana meets Christian when she fills in for her roommate to interview Christian for the school newspaper. From there, Christian is immediately enticed by this Miss Steele and uses his money and power to seduce her. With his handsome looks, sculpt physique, money money money and charisma, Ana tries to resist Christian but no luck. Soon she loses her virginity to Christian and begins exploring the world of S&M, one small whip at a time.<br /><br />Throughout the books, you see Ana and Christian's relationship develop from dominant to submissive (doesn't last long) to a couple and well so on from there (don't want to give away all the spoilers).<br /><br />I wanted to detest this book but failed. It's a fun, engaging read and a book that would keep you up till 2am on a weeknight because you can't put it down. It's not Hemingway or Dickens but it's the best of the best when it comes to guilty pleasure.t put it down. It's not Hemingway or Dickens but it's the best of the best when it comes to guilty pleasure.

B003157DTM|5.0|I had a couple of mini Monchhichis when I was little in the 80s.  A couple of years ago, I got a few of the newer ones that were out in Target, as Easter gifts.  A couple of girls with single ponytails on top of their heads, and a boy.  I love them.  They are so cute and soft.  I got on a Monchhichi kick and bought two large ones and a couple of keychains as well.  I found this little pigtails girl while browsing them online and wanted her for some time, but could never find one at a reasonable price.  I took a chance and ordered one here and it came in perfect condition.  It is a bit pricey, especially with the shipping, for small dolls, but this one has been hard for me to find anywhere else.  So it was worth it.  I'm really glad I got her.  She is adorable.  I love the pink bows in her hair and her pink and white bib.  Like the others, she has a little pacifier in her hand that sticks in her mouth.  She has pink blush and little freckles on her face.  Very cute.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Reviewers saying this movie is the worst movie they have ever seen must be very miserable people and don't know how to enjoy a good comedy movie. This movie was exactly what I expected from the creator of family guy: Witty jokes, stupidly funny sense of humor, joke references from tv and movies, and random racist remarks that somehow are not offenses. I thought the cast was brillant and it even had a soft side to it. I made my husband see this because we both love family guy; he so did not want to see it, he fought about it for 2 hours...well we see it and he was cracking up the entire them. He did not wipe the smile off his face through the entire moive. I will for sure be adding this to my movie collection, anyone who loves family guy will instantly love this movie! It is exactly the same sense of humor that got everyone addicted to family guy, seth did it again, well done sir!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I hadn't read Gillian Flynn's previous book so I thought it was really refreshing how the book started with Nick's point of view as he discovers his wife is missing and alternates it with Amy's journal chronicling her relationship with Nick starting from the first time they meet.  I initially thought Flynn chose to tell the story this way to illustrate how a person's perspective can cloud how they see a relationship.  I have to admit I had no idea where the second half of the book was going and really enjoyed it.

6304233639|5.0|I love the 2 offsetting personalities played by Will Smith & Jeff Bloomberg. The hot shot fighter pilot & the nerdy scientist . At the end they both loosen up a bit & do things that they wouldn't have done earlier. I did feel that a couple of scenes were over acted, especially the part where the president gives his speech & the reaction afterwards. On the other hand I loved the scenes where Will Smiths girl friend organizes a group of survivors, finds the presidents wife,who is dying & takes them basically cross country to find help. A very fun sci-fi movie.

B004EPYZP8|4.0|Based on a Michael Connelly bestselling novel, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" follows the story of Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey), the \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" of the title, who defends a wealthy family's son Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), accused of beating up a prostitute Reggie Campo (Margarita Levieva). As the story unfolds, however, Mickey realizes - maybe too late - that the case is not what it at first appears to be.<br /><br />Admittedly, the central mystery of the legal thriller is not as engaging as the character McConaughey plays, a criminal defense lawyer whose \\"office\\" is the backseat of a Lincoln continental. Clever and witty, Mickey is a capable lawyer, always knows what he is doing, and though he is not infallible (just like any of us), he knows what he should do, having his own code of ethics.<br /><br />The script is overlong (sometimes it feels like watching a pilot episode for a TV series), but is populated with interesting characters played by the talented cast including Frances Fisher, Bob Gunton, John Leguizamo, William H. Macy, Michael Peña and Marisa Tomei. Josh Lucas also appears as a state prosecutor, who gives a nice contrast to McConaughey's character.<br /><br />The courtroom drama in the film's second half will keep you interested with some surprises, though you know that this hardly happens in real life. Directed by Brad Furman (his second feature), the well-paced film is also notable for the effective use of on-location shots of Los Angeles. \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is a solid and entertaining legal thriller with memorable characters.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Okay, the acting itself wasn't perfect.  But how real the action was!  My husband and I are both Army veterans and have friends in Special Forces.  Unbelievably realistic!  We loved it, as did our 15-year-old daughter.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the game. It gets frustrating when I can't solve it on the first or second try. The jumbo pack os the biggest challenge. Well worth the tome pit into the intricate puzzles.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|As was in doubt before buying the book and reviews helped me so, I have to say:<br />This book is awesome!<br />A great introductory part (3 chapters) with all physiological terms, nutrition ingredients and substances we hear about and don't know exactly what they are or how they are connected with our body.<br />Great workout routine and nutrition tips and explains why some workouts does not give expected results.<br />A way way more than a simple workout routine.<br />I'm following tips/routine and feeling great!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Graphics are beautiful, game plays very nicely on the Kindle Fire, and gets my pulse racing. If you like games that call for quick reactions and are challenging you will like Treasures of Montezuma 3!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a great and addictive game. its very agrivating when you try a billion times to beat the required points. but its very fun for the bord person with nothing else to do
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I dont understand the negative reviews, its simple, follow the instructions and install it correctly and your have a much better expierence with your Kinect. Its made for small rooms, like living rooms in apartments or bedrooms, etc. If you are having trouble with Kinect, then get Zoom.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I don't think there are as many bad reviews for this book as there are the first book because fewer people were able to stomach reading more.  I kept reading because I borrowed the books, I never would pay to be repulsed with this subject matter.  Having said that, on one level I did enjoy reading the books because I became invested in the characters.  I gave the first book 3 stars because I liked the characters and the general premise for the book, but I wasn't as invested by the end of the series.  I wanted Ana to fix Christian, not for him to pollute her even more.  ( *spoiler* Flogging a pregnant woman goes waaaaay too far.)<br />I also thought the ending went on way too long. I didn't feel it added to the story, but rather took away from it.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to a friend? No, unless they've already read the first one and wanted closure, but I would warn them to stop reading before the book ended.<br /><br />Would I read more from this author?  I don't think so now... The writing was repetitive and didn't hold my interest anymore.  I think her character development was good, and general story line was good, but a good editor would have helped a great deal.
B00005NWLO|5.0|I always say there are two really spectacular live albums in rock history ... The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\" and Jimi Hendrix's \\"Band of Gypsys.\\"  After hearing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"One More From The Road,\\" I'm adding it to the list.  This is a pure, energetic, enthusiastic, classic and just plain rocking performance.  Lynyrd Skynyrd really knows how to work a crowd.  Their performances of \\"Travelin' Man,\\" \\"Free Bird,\\" and \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" alone are proof of that.<br /><br />There are a lot of live recordings out there, by many artists.  Especially nowadays, every time an artist tours it is always followed up by a live CD (and possibly DVD) release.  After a while it becomes meaningless and just routine.  But this show (and others like it from the vaults) is special.  It captures the raw energy of a classic band in their heyday.  It's presents a historical document that deserves a place in any classic rock collection.
B00136JQMI|5.0|Isn't the internet wonderful? you hear a piece on NPR and minutes later, an MP3<br />version of what you heard is available on your phone or other device.<br />wish i had access to this my whole life. Ah! youth is wasted on the young. lol
030758836X|3.0|The first part of the book was interesting. It definitely kept my interest peeked and then the middle of the book unraveled and I was completely engrossed. I couldn't put the book down. Twist turns; I kept thinking \\"Oh where is this going next?\\" \\"How will they get the culprit\\". Then I read the last page. I actually started reading the acknowledgements because it COULDN'T BE OVER!!! This had to be part of the book. I was utterly disappointed. The ending is TERRIBLE!!!!! Interesting, but completely unsatisfying.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it it is the best app ever and once you start the game you cant stop you have to try no matter what.
B000PC6A3E|3.0|I was pretty psyched to see \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" so I decided to upgrade to BluRay for a screening of the first two Batman movies.  The image quality on this disc was substantially weaker than that of \\"The Dark Knight\\".  Obviously the IMAX footage is going to look better, but even the letterboxed images had much better blacks on the 2nd movie.  $10 is not a hug deal, but even so, I expect a flawless image from any BluRay, otherwise, what's the point?  The movie more than holds up, by the way.
0345803485|1.0|The reviews of this literary joke are by far wittier and better written than the book itself. I gave it a 1 star rating only because Amazon wouldn't accept 0 stars.<br /><br />The fact that this trash made the #1 spot on the NYT Best Seller list is a blatant testimony to the dumbing down of American minds. I want my money back.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Was everything I wished for.Two bands that complement each other so well. Glad I finally found this DVD at last.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. I love playing it. My children love playing it. I would highly recomend this game to all my friends and family.
0345803485|3.0|The first one of the trilogy is not the best in my opinion, but it was good enough to get me completely hooked. The story line is essentially a kinky version of Cinderella unfolding in the 21st century. You replace the castle by a penthouse, the white horse by an Audi R8, a private jet and a helicopter, and there you have it. So, it's a revised classic, nothing Earth shattering.<br /><br />The sex, page after page, gets a little old but let's face it, it's one of the reasons why we can't book the book down. I am just trying to decide if the author has a very prolific imagination or if she is inspired by personal experience, because - wow, this book, is... educational.<br /><br />I have to agree with other reviews - the grammar and the writing in general are very poor. I am not a native speaker and yet I was appalled. Don't publishers have proofreaders? The entire trilogy comes across as being very sloppy in that regard.<br /><br />I am not proud of saying that I devoured all three books in 2 days, but yes, I couldn't put those books down.
034580404X|5.0|Reading this book you won't to put it down not even to use the bathroom.  A must have in ever book collection.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|I was so utterly disappointed in this \\"sequel\\". I had high expectations for it, considering Andrew Lloyd Webber's name was on it. The Phantom of the Opera brought chills to my bones and the music stayed in my head even when I went to sleep. The character depth was so astounding. At the end of it, despite the Phantom's madness, I was rooting for him. Which is the reason I was so excited for this sequel.<br /><br />\\"Love Never Dies\\" didn't start off too good, which left me a little uneasy with how the movie was going to progress. I didn't like how it was basically just a stage production. The music was kind of tacky, especially with the scenes with her son Gustave and her husband Raoul. The only good piece of music that I actually enjoyed was \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\", and that basically summed up the Phantom and Christine's relationship. IT was catchy and the music was fantastic, so I will give credit for that.<br /><br />I watched the movie with my grandmother. She regretted buying the disc. We were tempted to just stop watching entirely, but decided to see if it got any better. It didn't.<br /><br />I think my expectations were far too high for this movie and the reviews were misleading. I did not enjoy this one bit. *SPOILER ALERT:* At the end, I basically wanted to break the disc in half because Christine DIES. If I were Andrew Lloyd Webber, I would've been embarrassed to have allowed this to be sold, especially after such a great success.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This incredibly amazing story will inspire greatness, help you realize your dreams and make you understand what you are capable of. Read it. All of it. Now.
0345803507|4.0|It took me a little bit longer to read this book (maybe because I knew it was the last one and I was pacing myself), it was also the one I enjoyed the most - I think. Less unrealistic sex, a slightly deeper story line, and less childish dialog. The poor grammar and redundancies throughout the trilogy have been frankly annoying, but I wasn't able to to put the books down for 2 days straight so I am not going to be a hypocrite and pretend that I didn't enjoy this series. Sometimes overboard, unrealistic and predictable, but it was a good distraction overall.
B006OB3K56|5.0|Addiction.  Addiction is a problem that takes on many faces, some of which we all too often ignore or consider overblown.  Sexual addiction.  For those who do not have that problem they may joke that they wish they did.  What is the problem with having a lot of sex?  Why would anyone complain about that?  How could that possibly ruin someone's life?  To those of us who may at one time or another balked at the notion that `sex addicts have it rough' may want to reconsider our perspective, and for that rude awakening we have been handed Steve McQueen's sophomore film, `Shame'.<br /><br />The premise of `Shame' is rather simple.  We have Brandon, a business man who lives alone and has a lot of sex with random strangers he meets in random places.  His sister, Sissy, comes over unannounced and gets permission to sleep on the couch for a while.  Both Sissy and Brandon have deep rooted emotional issues, that obviously stem from a childhood they never discuss, and so they clash like oil and water.  Brandon is seemingly introverted yet blunt and suave, allowing him to take his potential lovers by surprise and sweep them into his bed for a romp.  Sissy is overtly friendly, using her loud personality to omit a confident sexuality that one detects she uses to replace the self-esteem she lost along the way.  Both people are broken fragments of a former self.  McQueen uses this simple premise to exploit the pain welled up inside of these people and uses their addictions as a way to make a profound statement about the powerful hold our own insecurities can have on us.<br /><br />Yes, this is very explicit and yet never once becomes something titillating because the sorrowful overlay completely consumes the film.<br /><br />Much has been made of Michael Fassbender's performance here.  He won the Vulpi Cup (at the Venice Film Festival) early in the year and then steamrolled through critics' awards (with few wins but many mentions) and then was disgustingly snubbed an Oscar nomination.  All that has been said was deserved.  The way that Michael molds the pain and inner demons into the very fabric of Brandon's person is outstanding.  Matching him every step, and maybe even surpassing him a step or two, is the amazing Carey Mulligan (god, how I love this woman).  She embodies Sissy with so much human suffering yet never skips a beat in her sputtering naivety.  Her rendition of `New York, New York' is haunting, but there is so much more to her performance than a mere song.  You can strip the layers from her and find a woman masking so much pain with a song and a dance.  These are two of the bravest performances in recent years.<br /><br />McQueen found a way to make this addiction feel real to the audience, and in doing so he helped open our eyes to the fact that life is much deeper than it may seem.  Brandon's spiral to self-destruction is rendered with such detail that one is touched deeply by it.  Watching him struggle to make a real connection with someone (his failure to perform says so much about the hold the addiction has on him and the root cause of that addiction) or watching Sissy plead for love with tearful desperation is hard to stomach at times but expertly used to address the themes at hand.<br /><br />Yes, I understand that some have balked at the depiction of the gay-club and the fact that it is depicted as a mortal sin of sorts, but I think that taken into context it makes sense in a way, considering that the addiction has brought Brandon to a place he never expected it to.<br /><br />Regardless of any small quibbles (which I have none), there is no denying the power behind each and every frame.n.

B007Q476KU|1.0|When somebody asks me if I've ever seen a BAD Spielberg movie I can now say that yes, yes I have! The best metaphor I can think of to describe this movie is as a \\"candy-coated children's fantasy.\\" One should not go into this movie with the expectation of any kind of realism in terms of human nature, war, or the intelligence of horses. Since the protagonist of this story is the horse itself, this movie is more akin to lighthearted animal tales such as \\"Babe,\\" or \\"Racing Stripes.\\"<br /><br />If you are able to suspend belief enough to accept that a horse is gifted with abnormal intelligence, that farm laborers in rural 1914 England displayed deep and meaningful relationships with their working farm animals (as opposed to the historically cruel treatment of animals during that period), and if you are okay with actually seeing the squibs (fire crackers) popping off in the mud and cannon barrels  in order to simulate gunfire (these effects were really badly done; you'll literally see little squibs going off and only afterwards realize that they were meant to be \\"gunfire\\") then by all means watch this movie. The fact that the Germans and French all speak perfect English in this movie and that the horse is apparently bulletproof will probably not phase you then.<br /><br />However, if you are an adult who knows anything at all about history, war, horses, or anything to do with reality at all, then this movie will most likely seem ridiculous. Within fifteen minutes of watching it I was sure it should have rather been a straight to DVD title.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is entertaining! great for playing when bored! I would recommend this app to anyone! by the way I'm 10 !
B006BDHAX0|4.0|this game has some fun boards and is challenging.  It has some unique boards that can be quite tough.  Overall it is worth the price.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I found the movie entertaining, certainly not a \\"Star Wars\\" but certainly not overall bad movie.<br />Hard to have empathy for John Carter- not a hero type at all.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the graphics on this game. Kind of additive. It is glitchy at times but I hope the bugs get worked out.
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|I don't think there's a duff track on the entire album. One of my Dylan favorites. As you might expect, the lyrics remain pertinent and up-to-date many years after they were penned. (some are a bit goofball,  but - hey -  Its BOB - what else would you expect?)<br /><br />Editing to add: a great group of back-up musicians (Mark Knopfler, Mick Taylor, Aynsley Dunbar)

1591396190|1.0|This book was a severe disappointment. It's a well-known strategy book with an catchy title and reasonably compelling reputation. This was my second time reading it, after throwing it away in frustration a few years ago. Opening up vast blue oceans of opportunity - who wouldn't want that? Unfortunately, it falls far short of the hype. Another reviewer described it as \\"fluff\\" - they are correct. The book is full of vague theorizing, with little in the way of an actual framework to think about strategy. Nor are there significant insights from successful thinkers, which would have been valuable in lieu of a framework. If you have even a basic amount of business knowledge and some experience to match, this book offers very little. Stay away - your time and money are better spent elsewhere.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Why did I buy all three books? I started with high expectations - surely something that had sold so well,would be a rip roaring read..... how disapointed was I??!! The writing is appalling - plot was non existant, and the same phrases kept appearing over and over....and over. If I read 'holy crap' 'inner goddess' or 'the way his pants hung from his hips' one more time,the kindle was going out the window!! I really wanted to like it...having wasted my money on all three...but couldnt get passed the first quater....nothing was happening apart from repeated phrases, slow moving plot(is there one) and the submission dominance thing.....the contract.... how did this load of become such a huge sensation? Am I missing something...the only consolation is I can press DELETE!!

1401923127|1.0|As I read this book I established a love-hate relationship with the author.  I agree with the author wholeheartedly that the fields of epigenetics and quantum physics can and will significantly change the way we treat illness.  His discussion of the placebo effect with respect to antidepressants was fascinating.  However, I became annoyed by his many jabs at \\"the establishment\\" and his insistence that his \\"New Science\\" and \\"New Biology\\" would lead to his condemnation like a modern day Galileo.  His sudden leap from \\"the environment has an effect on gene expression\\" to \\"mystical energy and the subconscious mind control everything\\" is alarming and not well explained or reasoned.<br /><br />Everything falls apart completely with his Addendum.  In the Addendum we learn that a lifetime of subconscious programming can be reversed in just MINUTES through the revolutionary practice of PSYCH-K (TM) starting at $350!  The author reduces his entire book to an infomercial for an unscientific and unexplained product.<br /><br />If you choose to read this book, do so with a grain of salt.  The author's valid criticism of our drug-focused treatment of illness does not legitimize his mystical beliefs.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I didn't want a book that was deep.  I was looking for a nice beach read.  I bought it to take on my vacation but started reading one night and finished it in a couple of days!  It was so much more than I expected.  You can picture the characters and feel as though you are actually in San Francisco.  It is amazing how many families are not traditional families anymore.  You see beautiful people who care for each other and form a non-traditional family.  The flowers and meanings were interesting as well.  Get this book.  You won't regret it
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After all my girlfriends raved about the book I decided to get the first book and give it a try. I found it to be a very easy read and read it in 1 day. The book is very repetitive, and honestly has too much of the same sex scenes.  I found that I skipped over many pages due to this, especially the 2nd book. The 2nd book, however, was better than the first although I think she could have kept us in more suspence. I Just purchased the 3rd book but I doubt I'll read another book by her.

B008JOPYG4|1.0|Any understanding of this collection of hits requires a better understanding of what manufactured pop artists are and Jennifer Lopez is the epitome of one. The problem with all her songs is that there is no longevity in them and were forced and repeated over and over on public radio. They were made hits because of many reasons, two primary reasons because: 1) Sony BMG was engaging in the illegal practices of radio payola and 2) Tommy Mottola initially fashioning her into a \\"diva\\" while stealing concepts and music samples from ex-wife Mariah Carey. It came as no surprise that once the payola stopped, J-Lo's albums kept flopping on the charts 2005-2011. None of these songs have stood the test of time, perhaps her nicest songs were the obscure tracks on a few select albums that were never released properly as singles, which would have sounded nicer if her nasal-sounding voice were substituted with another artists genuine vocals.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Most people who are reading this review know how awesome \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is, so I won't review the film, but rather I'll limit the review to the 60th Anniversary Blue-ray disc. I watched this on a 70\\" Sharp Aquos HDTV. What an experience! In a darkened room, with a giant bucket of coronary-inducing self-popped (not microwave) buttered popcorn (with real butter, thank you) and an enhanced sound system, I was transferred to a time that I hadn't experienced since I was a little kid. The blue-ray transfer is breathtaking with the brillant color, clarity, and sound. It was like watching a brand new film. This is how audiences originally saw the film 60 years ago. The commentary track was very informative, though it was recorded a few years ago, since some of the contributers are now deceased. The added features are excellent. I like the 'jukebox' feature, which allows you to watch just the musical numbers of your choice. If you only have a little time, but you need a quick uplifting shot of \\"Good Mornin'\\" or \\"Moses Suposes\\" you can do that. Also the added feature of interviews with some of today's dancers, choreographers, and musical film directors is fun. It's good to see the respect and admiration that they have for Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, et al. I suggest whatever home theater equipment you have, set yourself up as close to a theater setting as possible and get swept away. Experience how magical a movie experience can be.

Yes, I realize he came back from near death - but his voice (and writing skills) haven't quite recovered yet.  I've been a fan of his from the very beginning.<br /><br />The song isn't horrible, but it doesn't sound like him and the writing ... well, it kind of sounds like he's making it up as he's singing it.<br /><br />C'mon George. We still love you.  But you can do better.

It includes many of the basic features plus some badly needed updates and changes.<br /><br />Wizards of the Coast REALLY bombed when they dropped Rev 3.5 in favor of their new D&D 4.0.  We tried this for a year or 2 and while it was somewhat interested and fun it was NOT D&D and soon members of our group either switched to another game system or just stopped playing all together.  Pathfinder is what those of us who are still playing switched to.

A real waste of time and money.  I thought amazon checks the apps but I guess they are not good checkers.  Amazon refund my money or get the app fixed.
0061122416|5.0|I had to read this for a class and the whole book is boring until the end. but it's worth it!
159562015X|5.0|I got the books for each of the employees that work for me.  It has been a benefit both for them and for me to see what their strengths are.  Highly recommended!
B00006LJ6X|5.0|This album does not sound like Chicago I and II at all. It's songs are at times catchy, at other times deep and moving, at other times, rock-and-rolling (in a lighter way than \\"I'm A Man\\", \\"Make Me Smile\\", and \\"Free\\" of their earlier albums). Terry Kath was the lead guitarist on VII, and plays tremenously, but the songs he writes on this are great but not the gutsy rock he put out earlier. The first 4 songs are instrumentals, and a bit dull and repetitive to me. Robert Lamm sings a bit on \\"Hanky Panky\\", but the song doesn't hold up to CHicago standards (imho). \\"Byblos\\" is full of life even though it's relatively softer. (The extra version of Byblos included on the Rhino version is an energetic, no-brass rendition of the song which maybe should have been the one put on the album back in 1975.)<br />  The strong song on VII are (I've Been) Searchin' So Long, Wishing You Were Here , Call on Me and Women Don't Want to Love Me. The first two songs are ballads,both full of emotion and very moving. The last two are not hard rock, but uptempo, energetic numbers which will get your heart beating.<br />  A sure qualty of great musicians and songwriters is their ability to grow and deepen in their feel for musical taste and style. Chicago certainly have done that in their careers. If you buy this album, you will surely enjoy a lot of it, if not all of it.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|The story of a \\"special\\" boy who loses his endearing father (played by Tom Hanks in flashbacks) to 911 and he and his grieving mother (Sandra Bullock) try to recover. There's some subtle and not so subtle archetypes being used in this tale which almost remind me of a subdued fairy tale minus \\"the happy happy people\\". It's a bit slow but picks up once we flashback to the last few calls from the father and later on when a mysterious elderly man ends up being his partner in solving the mystery.<br /><br />Hard role to play by a kid (Thomas Horn) who seemed borderline autistic. I was also very impressed with the elderly man (whose character could \\"not\\" speak) role played by Max von Sydow who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the Academy Awards. John Goodman has a small role in this picture as Stan the Doorman.<br /><br />Based on a novel of a similar title by by Jonathan Safran Foer. It was also nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. Strangely, the Golden Globes didn't nominate it for anything.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $40M and it made a bit over $47M at the Box Office.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; 911 FOCUSES: B to B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; WHEN WATCHED: May 2012;<br />OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.<br /><br />BEST DIALOGUE (SPOILERS): Oskar Schell: If the sun were to explode, you wouldn't even know about it for 8 minutes because thats how long it takes for light to travel to us. Oskar Schell: For eight minutes the world would still be bright and it would still feel warm. Oskar Schell: It was a year since my dad died and I could feel my eight minutes with him... were running out.  /// Oskar Schell: I had to tell someone. I couldn't keep it a secret anymore. Oskar Schell: Can I tell you my story? The Renter: [the renter shows his hand that says 'yes' on it]  Oskar Schell: My father died at 9-11. After he died I wouldn't go into his room for a year because it was too hard and it made me want to cry. But one day, I put on heavy boots and went in his room anyway. I miss doing taekwondo with him because it always made me laugh. When I went into his closet, where his clothes and stuff were, I reached up to get his old camera. It spun around and dropped about a hundred stairs, and I broke a blue vase! Inside was a key in an envelope with black written on it and I knew that dad left something somewhere for me that the key opened and I had to find. So I take it to Walt, the locksmith. I give it to Stan, the doorman, who tells me keys can open anything. He gave me the phone book for all the five boroughs. I count there are 472 people with the last name black. There are 216 addresses. Some of the blacks live together, obviously. I calculated that if I go to 2 every Saturday plus holidays, minus my hamlet school plays, my minerals, coins, and comic convention, it's going to take me 3 years to go through all of them. But that's what I'm going to do! Go to every single person named black and find out what the key fits and see what dad needed me to find. I made the very best possible plan but using the last four digits of each phone number, I divide the people by zones. I had to tell my mother another lie, because she wouldn't understand how I need to go out and find what the key fits and help me make sense of things that don't even make sense like him being killed in the building by people that didn't even know him at all! And I see some people who don't speak English, who are hiding, one black said that she spoke to God. If she spoke to god how come she didn't tell him not to kill her son or not to let people fly planes into buildings and maybe she spoke to a different god than them! And I met a man who was a woman who a man who was a woman all at the same time and he didn't want to get hurt because he/she was scared that she/he was so different. And I still wonder if she/he ever beat up himself, but what does it matter?  Thomas Schell: What would this place be if everyone had the same haircut?  Oskar Schell: And I see Mr. Black who hasn't heard a sound in 24 years which I can understand because I miss dad's voice that much. Like when he would say, \\"are you up yet?\\" or...  Thomas Schell: Let's go do something.  Oskar Schell: And I see the twin brothers who paint together and there's a shed that has to be clue, but it's just a shed! Another black drew the same drawing of the same person over and over and over again! Forest black, the doorman, was a school teacher in Russia but now says his brain is dying! Seamus black who has a coin collection, but doesn't have enough money to eat everyday! You see olive black was a gate guard but didn't have the key to it which makes him feel like he's looking at a brick wall. And I feel like I'm looking at a brick wall because I tried the key in 148 different places, but the key didn't fit. And open anything it hasn't that dad needed me to find so I know that without him everything is going to be alright.  Thomas Schell: Let's leave it there then.  Oskar Schell: And I still feel scared every time I go into a strange place. I'm so scared I have to hold myself around my waist or I think I'll just break all apart! But I never forget what I heard him tell mom about the sixth borough. That if things were easy to find...  Thomas Schell: ...they wouldn't be worth finding.  Oskar Schell: And I'm so scared every time I leave home. Every time I hear a door open. And I don't know a single thing that I didn't know when I started! It's these times I miss my dad more than ever even if this whole thing is to stop missing him at all! It hurts too much. Sometimes I'm afraid I'll do something very bad. ///Linda Schell: It's never gonna make sense because it doesn't!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is very entertaining and a lot fun to play. The puzzles are both challenging yet easy and surprisingly addicting
B002N5N5QQ|3.0|Unfortunately, the last disc in the case was scratched and unable to play on either of my DVD players. A bit disappointing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of the best games on the Kindle Fire.  Download this app....what do you have to lose?  It's free and incredibly fun.  The challenge keeps you hooked to the game...try it!
B006LSZECO|1.0|There was so much hype about this book I could not wait to read it! However, I was very disappointed. I found the story full of implausibilities which makes it difficult to enjoy on any level. I rushed through the end of the book just to get it over with. Don't waste your money on this one!
B000NQRE0K|5.0|I understand that this movie may not be 100% accurate, but it is 100% entertaining. for those complaining about how accurate it is.. for goodness sake William Walace has a modern day high dollar film telling a entertaining version of his deeds... thats a big deal in my eyes..  So back to the movie most already know the story so i wont go there, i will say that ive almost worn out my DVD copy and just recieved my blueray copy, i havent opened it up yet but im looking forward to spending a evening re-visiting this tale in blue ray high deff !

B007MJSSCY|4.0|LOVED this movie. It was charming, sweet, sad and so very, very British.<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates children's literature.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|The action was great. The movie was not boring at all. Each character played very well.<br />The story is different from the original one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Down loading the books were so easy.  The fact that it was so easy to navigate and it would save the pages when I left rhe book was the best feature of all.  I am goin on a search for another series.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book kept my attention and motivated me to keep trudging toward my own personal goals. The young woman in the book had some personal demons to tackle and managed to do that during her time on the trail. It is well written.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|I love Keane's music, and this album is another great lineup. He manages to maintain his distinctive upbeat style without becoming repetitive or monotonous. If you enjoyed his previous albums, you won't be dissappointed with Strangeland, either. The lyrics hit home with anyone who has looked back on life and was amazed at the strange and unexpected paths he travelled. Keane blends bittersweet memories together with optimism and contentment. You'll be singing along with these songs for years to come.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|I absolutely love Katy Perry. This album has quite a few really good songs. My favorites are Firework and Peacock. I can't wait to see the Katy Perry movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I had just bought this app because I wanted to try something, I hadn't expected to love it this much!

0345803485|5.0|I am very pleased with this book and the price I paid for it was very reasonable, I am enjoying the book very much, thank you.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|I really wasn't interested in watching this movie, but accidentally purchased it for rental. In a way it is better than the previous American Pie movies, but it is still just an 'okay' movie. I would not purchase it, and I probably wouldn't rent it again, but it was good for a few laughs.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Im so glad I bought this book. I almost didn't after reading negative reviews. I loved Abby, I loved Travis. Lol I know this might sound strange, but my favorite parts of the book was how awesome Travis is fighting other guys.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Yes , you can hear Pink Floyd but you will also appreciate Mr. Gilmours slight differences as well . This is a great listen , over and over so I would recomend it to anyone.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I think it's pretty safe to say I am a teensy bit, somewhat, okay...a LOT behind on reading this book. And darned if I know why because I truly enjoyed it. It is very different. Very fast paced and emotional.<br /><br />That said, honestly,  I didn't feel an immediate connection with Clary to begin with. She seemed distant, a little unemotional to me, and more than a little naive. For one, I felt she was entirely too hard on her mother. But...she DID grow on me. Hence, the reason I still gave the book five stars. If there had been no emotional and maturity growth for Clary,  I would not have enjoyed it as much as I did. she did grow, and along the way, she even starts to see her own weaknesses and realizes her own naivety. It made me feel more for her and made me pull for her.<br /><br />At first,  these shadowhunters seem like kids playing at being warriors and maybe that's exactly what they are to begin with. I mean,  they have all lost alot. Many of them enough to feel like they have nothing more to lose. They have a lot to explore about themselves. Their sexuality, love, and loss. Even lies and gain. THIS is what made me like the book. The growth. The turmoil in the midst of fast paced action. And yet,  despite the fast pace, the relationships and emotions are allowed to grow rather than being rushed.<br /><br />I loved Jace's character from the beginning. He is cocky as hell with an attitude and sarcasm to boot but it makes you want to try harder to understand him, to break down his barriers, to get to know him. In the long run, there is just something incredibly endearing and even sad about him.<br /><br />I don't really feel as connected yet with the rest of the supporting characters though they are all great. I do love Luke as a father figure for Clary.<br /><br />But the biggest thing about this book is the somewhat disturbing twist at the end. OMG! If the author wanted to hook me, she did simply because I hope what is revealed simply is NOT true!!!! So yes,  this girl will be hurriedly buying the next book.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I am SO upset!  I bought this case last month after my husband kept telling me all the time I needed a waterproof case.  Well actually I needed a case that WAS ACTUALLY Shockproof.  I dropped my phone completely flat on the floor inside a store and it shattered the glass screen.  I had an Otterbox for 7 months and never got so much as a scratch or crack from dropping it.  What a flimsy case.  Luckily I think I can still return it to best buy and get my $79.99 back and put that to repairs it will now cost to fix the phone that was suppose to be Lifeproof.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|The movie arrived in perfect condition.  This movie is fantastic, and the price was more than a bargain!  I would recommend this to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is one of those games you will have a hard time putting down! There are different levels so it makes it more challenging throughout the game. I really like this game....glad I got it!
B002VWNID6|3.0|This DVD needs to be turned over in the middle of the movie.  I don't understand why they couldn't fit it all on one side since much longer movies don't have to be flipped, but they apparently couldn't.  For those who love the theme song, the original VHS version includes the Bryan Adams video at the end of the film.  The DVD doesn't have that.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|Can't find a single program to use this with and have it work they way I need it.  I do metal detecting and wanted to record my finds locations so I can keep a log of the \\"context\\" of the artifact in case the area ever turns out to be significant.  Was hoping to use it with my netbook and just pop up a program, have it load a map, Garmin-style, and record the lat/long and take notes of surroundings but I tried may programs to no avail.<br /><br />Any suggestions?
B003G4W49C|5.0|Any fan of writing in general should read this book. The plot/characters/writing are all superb; I generally avoid science fiction but this story and the characters involved are so captivating that I found myself reading the follow up books as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is easy to play on my kindle fire. Was an easy app to download. Good game to have.....I like it!
6305609705|5.0|this is the original theater version as shown back in 1979 [not REDUX] the picture quality was excellent! I prefer this version much better than the Redux one<br /><br />only took 2 days to receive my DVD from MA to CA , thats fast service

B00881VLCE|3.0|freezes occasionally but I like the rotate option. it would be nice to have the ability to change the background to help the pieces stand out
030758836X|5.0|The perfect summer read. I started reading it on a plane and the nine hour ride was over before I knew it.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game. I love playing solitaire and really enjoy playing this version. I'm sure you will enjoy it too. Happy solitaire!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|just as addicting, even harder for me because of the touch screen.  I kept dropping the cards.  My first few games had pretty high scores and that just made me mad and I tried even harder!  For free you can't go wrong!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love love love this game!!!:) this is so worth a dollar!!!&hearts; I love how the uptates are free!!!:) I play it all the time
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book will definately keep you wondering, just one of those you can't put down.  This book is very easy to read as well, the way it was written is great.  OK that's what I had written in my first review.  Not feeling the same way ( like the fact that we can alter these reviews ).  So tired of hearing Lip Biting, Subconscious Dancing, and the one I can't stand is Later's Baby.  I saw reviews for the second one and they were much better, maybe you have to read this one to really know what's going on.  The feeling of it being easy to read and suspenseful may still be true but I really could put it down towards the end, I was just tired, lol.  Happy reading ;)
B000092Q4U|5.0|This album has the raw energy of New American Gospel, the underground production found on Burn The Priest, and the songwriting maturity found on each of their later albums.  There isn't a weak track on this entire album.  Not to mention each song has its own distinct style and sound.  If you like Lamb of God once they cleaned their playing up a little bit and vocalist Randy Blythe starting singing so you could understand him, but still love the raw and chaotic energy from their underground releases, this album is the perfect middle ground to highlight all of L.o.G's strengths in superb fashion.  One of my favorite metal albums of all time!
B0018OAOQC|5.0|Volbeat is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands. I only recently became aware of there  existence, but better late than never! I am not really one to put a label on music or the band's that create it, however I would put them somewhere between hard rock and metal for those of you who do.<br />Now to the album. If you are like me, and just started to discover this awesome band, you can't go wrong with this album. I have yet to find a song I don't like, so skip buying individual songs and just get the whole thing! You won't be disappointed!  My favorite song is a moment forever.. it has every ingredient of the band that I like.. melody, strong vocals, and awesome guitar riffs with pounding drums.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I bought it for my I Phone and it was just a crappy version of where's my water. Don't spend your money!!! BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!
185326895X|5.0|The book I purchased meets my expectations. It is complete, in a good condition... and the price is very good...

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Of all three books the second book is the best. The first book was a little slow the juicy stuff don't pick up until you get to the seventh chapter.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Very poor movie plot and acting.  Glad I only wasted money to rent and not purchase.  I could only make it about 1/3 through the movie and I gave up.
B002XUBDVK|5.0|The sound and picture of this blu ray are absolutely excellent! On my system there is a particular upgrade in the picture quality when watching blu-rays as opposed to DVD's. I'm gald I didn't experience any of the faulty versions of the incredible movie. I watched it for the second time over the last three days and it is simply stunning! One last thing, I don't really care if it's historically accurate at all, \\"the Butcher\\" in this movie is one of the all time great evil roles! I'm not sure I can think of any worth comparisons. A must have for any blu-ray collection!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Was shipped in the time range it said it was supposed to get to me. Its a great new copy of the season for a good price
B0086700CM|4.0|love this game just having occasional lag problems on my kindle fire...they aren't bad just bad enough to be annoying.
B007URCTOG|5.0|It is a great movie to watch with your girl or wife.  They will love it and be happy to watch it with you.  The plot was very good and prbably will buy now.
B005FIO3PU|5.0|Needed a light for night use on our family room computer station located in an unlighted, dark corner and specifically for the keyboard. AC outlets are all used, so upon searching for USB powered units, I came across this little beauty. It sits atop our computer tower case shining down on the keyboard. Actually, the only negative would be that it can be too bright causing some glare. However, with some adjusting, this can be remedied. The push button on/off switch works great. Can't beat it for the price!
B0055PMJMW|4.0|Michael Connelly is always good. These three stories did not disappoint. They were a very fast read and very enjoyable. The only disappointment was they were too short. His main character Harry Bosch works in LA and I always enjoy stories that take place in areas that I live or have visited. It helps to put identify with the story more. If you have never read a Michael Connelly you will have a new author that you will want to read all his books.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Apparently no one applied the Mary Sue Litmus Test to either of the main characters, Diana Bishop and Matthew Clairmont of \\"A Discovery of Witches\\". If they had, this book might never have seen the light of day.  Diana is of course, the most incredible Witch of the most incredible lineage in all of Creation. She has amazing powers that no one else in the world can have more than just a few of.  For over 900 pages, we are treated to the incredible Sue-ness that is Diana Bishop and her one true love, 1700 year old vampire, Matthew. He isn't just any vampire, of course. Matthew is French. Apparently, if one is a vampire, being French tends to make you far more cultured and fascinating than any of the ones coming out of the Carpathain Mountains or the sparkly ones out of Seattle.<br /><br />This book has some beautiful writing in it at the beginning by way of description.  However, if four out of five scenes in any given novel can be deleted and the reader won't miss them in terms of the plot, then by all means, it might be a good idea to cut them out. If the author had cut out half of its length in terms of very unnecessary and redundant scenes. Just how many pots of tea and bottles of wine can one witch and one vampire consume in a single novel?  A few scenes of both of these activities would have sufficed, but I was left feeling as if this was the only true basis of Diana and Matthew's relationship. Their \\"courtship\\" was far too long and belaboured.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about this book are the supporting characters; namely Matthew's vampire mother, Ysebeau. In fact, she and Matthew's dead father, Phillipe (killed by witches and Nazis) are far more interesting than Diana and Matthew could ever be. I wanted to read about them and I found myself searching for any mention of Ysebeau and Phillipe, bypassing any mention of the two central charcters, who are incredibly vapid, self-obsesssed and just plain boring.<br /><br />While the author does try to get history and especially alchemical and science bits right, it falls woefully flat.  It is less of a fictional account of witches, witchcraft, magic and alchemy as it is a poorly-executed romance novel with bits of mystical magical trappings thrown in.  This is a book that undoubtedly is attempting to cash in on the current wizard / witch and vampire craze that has continued to spill over from Harry Potter, the Twilight fandom and the TV series,  \\"True Blood\\".<br /><br />While reading it, I felt as if I were trapped in an elevator in a high rise building that stopped on every single floor while being forced to listen to very bad Musak before I got to my final destination. In such a situation, you have an uncontrollable urge to get out of there, but you want and need to get to the final destination, so you continue to endure it the slow motion madness.  I wanted to like this book but was very sorely disappointed.  I may try to read the second book, but if it is the same sort of tethering and teasing of the reader as this first book, I think I will give it a pass.history and especially alchemical and science bits right, it falls woefully flat.

B004LWZWGA|4.0|\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" presents a bruised and fatigued Batman trying to find inspiration, which is gradually pushed upon him by the realisation that the wellbeing of Gotham City and those he is close to need him to be revitalised.<br /><br />The film begins quite dramatically and the viewer's attention is regularly stimulated by various shifts in the narrative.<br /><br />There are many subtle and overt undertones to the story, which includes: a changing social order that advocates wealth collectivism, clean energy production advocacy, and helping the socially disadvantaged.<br /><br />As a superhero movie it surprisingly delves quite deeply into mainstream social issues, and asserts wealth collectivism as unsustainable revolutionary anarchy.<br /><br />Batman's own struggles in the film are emblematic of a society that needs to re-evaluate its priorities, but not at the expense of the beliefs and attitudes which are central to its identity.<br /><br />Therefore, Batman's own journey of forced self-rediscovery is a representation of finding greater purpose and self-meaning for the betterment of Gotham City.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B00846REIS|5.0|it was an excellent read. i couldnt put it down.  cant wait for the sequil.  was good as fifty shades of grey.
0307913147|5.0|i loved this book for the great fun it was.  Will Wheaton does a great job reading the audio version as well.  recommended for sci-fi, fantasy and game nerds!
B004HWKWL4|5.0|So much of my Christian beliefs are definitely cemented in the afterlife of Heaven and all that it contains. And I need to thank a beloved spiritual family mentor who has guided me with spiritual awareness as I would ask for it during different times in my life. And with that said I find it genuinely as important for me to include her in this Review, for all the intense spiritual  knowledge I have asked her for, only to have her unknowingly grace me with answers prior to reading this book.  But most importantly as a Reviewer, I want to share with you that this extraordinary Catholic Missionary woman has given me (toe to toe)a vast amount of the same information which Betty Eadie encountered during her lengthy, flat-lined experience. Hence, the velocity of what was written by this woman's experience did put my magic marker (highlighter) to the test in this book time and time again, because I had been given the same answers to questions that Jesus gave to this author. (Incredible!)<br />My curiosity of the book did not peek to it's fullest potential until CHAPTER--MY DEATH. I was astonished to read the same materials this woman experienced because as I said, countless sentences, paragraphs then ultimately chapters --I had the answers to from my mentor--a well educated woman from the glory of her own studies, feelings, and her fully committed lifestyle as a Catholic Missionary, having been in the service of our Lord and Father for over the past 60 years.  So please understand how I felt when reading all I had been taught prior to this book, then that of adulation learning of Betty Eadie's spirit leaving her body beyond the white light as her soul soared straight into the hands of Savior Jesus Christ.<br />I can only hope this book embraces your attention to all that Jesus showed her.  The elements of Christianity which we humans just touch on, were clearly identified to be the truth of that in our spiritual teachings.  Those elements include deities of Heaven's angels, our own personal angels, our spirit guides, even the paths we live our lives on, virtually making no sense at all some times.  We've all read books that people write telling us that they did not want to come back to their bodies once they were in the white light; but this individual woman's death experience gave us so much more of the actual depths to which our souls will one day encounter.  The book is not long winded but rather to the point. It is spiritually educational and rather poetic in the sense that you may believe angels, spirits, demons and deities are all part of a fairytale...but they are real.

We've all read books that people write telling us that they did not want to come back to their bodies once they were in the white light; but this individual woman's death experience gave us so much more of the actual depths to which our souls will one day encounter.  The book is not long winded but rather to the point. It is spiritually educational and rather poetic in the sense that you may believe angels, spirits, demons and deities are all part of a fairytale...but they are real.

0061537969|3.0|The bottom line for me with The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein was that I felt much happier after finishing the book than I did before.  I chose it initially as a \\"pick me up\\" book after reading ones with more difficult subject matter, but I put it down three quarters of the way through in disgust.<br /><br />I expected to love it, as I love books told from an animals perspective as Spencer Quinn's Chet and Bernie series.  While I love Chet's doggie voice, I was not so entranced with Enzo's.  He seemed a little too human to me throughout. I didn't sense the dogginess.  In fact it seemed to me that Stein was using Enzo to give the reader his perspective on life.  I felt as if I was being preached to by a dog.<br /><br />All the humans in the book either were stupid or made stupid choices.  I wondered why Enzo would want to come back as a human when this was what he had to look up to.<br /><br />The story should be enchanting and I will admit many readers have found it to be so.  Sadly, I was not one of them, but in the end the book did lift my spirits.

B005GK6QAM|5.0|This album conveys what rock music lacks these days. Joe Lynn Turner turns up the heat with this great album. Front to back it rocks and before you know it you're singing every hook. Joe is a rock/heavy metal icon and he once again shows the listener how he can deliver great albums/music consistently. I was also shocked to see that the great Micheal Bolton himself co-wrote 3 of the tracks. Hard to believe that an album like this was released in 2012. Pick this one up, you wont regret it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is challenging and its really fun it makes me think and I just love it. that's all ive got to say.
0380730405|3.0|I don't do well with novels where the women are portrayed as subservient femme fatales. There is also a lot of internal dialogue where the main character is talking to herself for several pages at a time.  Not a fan of that either.  That being said, I respect how well written the book was, and enjoyed the story itself.
034580404X|5.0|e l james is one of the best writers! regardless of the theme of this book, the way she writes is great, she is not repetitive like some authors in their series. talking to most of my friends and family about this book, a lot were not very interested due to the theme. but thankfully i have encouraged them all to open their minds to this world and they have not been disappointed. i read this trilogy in a weekend time and was very captivated by the story she tells. as a fellow writer she has inspired me. i can not wait for the movie(s! i hope they don't let us down!

0920236162|4.0|Let's get one thing straight here.  When it comes to children's books, there is sometimes a definite difference between parents perception and how a kid will respond.  This was one book I've been planning on reading to my daughter for ages.  When it came up in the Kindle charts a few weeks ago, I had to pick it up for the Kindle Fire.  The story is great--a lovely princess is engaged to a handsome princess when a dragon destroys the castle (and her clothes) and carries off the prince.  The princess finds a paper bag and hauls off to rescue the prince.  I thought it was a great little story--the ultimate opposite of the floofy princess book.  Bea (who doesn't particularly care for floofy princess either) would have said \\"Meh\\" if it was in her vocabulary.<br /><br />All in all--beautiful story and illustrations, great tap to zoom on the Kindle Fire and (right now at least) a great price.  But, you never know what will resonate with a particular kid.
B000002H6C|5.0|Regardless of where one travels on this planet, someone will know of this album as sure as they know Coca-Cola or soccer. It brings cultures together, traversing impossible divides among the Generation-X'ers throughout the world, from Sweden to Saudi Arabia. Thanks be to the music of this album.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I liked this at the movies when I saw it so when I saw it for this price I couldn't pass it up.  Very Funny.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I waited to review this movie. I have now seen it twice on DVD- giving it a good 4 weeks before watching it again.  And I have the perspective of having read at least 5 of the Barsoom books when I was a kid. And that is where I would like to start. Movies can never contain everything that was in a book- it is absolutely necessary to strip away the non-essential detail in order to preserve the spirit of the story- and sometimes details must adjust to fit what works in the movies.  The question becomes this: does the movie capture the spirit of the original story?  And the answer here is: Absolutely- in fact I have never seen it done better. I have seldom seen it done as well.  The critics were wrong- the script was very well done, the special effects excellent and the casting was superb.<br />Lynn Collins was absolutely a perfect Dejah Thoris- I remember even when I first saw her in the movie \\"They got this exactly right\\".<br /><br />So why did this movie not do better? Some blame bad marketting, others just say that it was an anachronism- we no longer really relate to a story that was published almost a century ago. That we have changed too much.  I am going to suggest that the second group are closer to the mark than the first.  I would like to suggest that there is a natural ebb and flow in the things which we treasure.  Right now the ideals and images in The Princess of Mars (John Carter of Mars) do not appeal to most of us.  10 years from now we may very well feel very differently. In fact, 10 years from now we may be berating Disney for not having made more of the Barsoom stories into films.<br /><br />Not every great treasured classic was a box office smash- take Jimmy Stewart's \\"Its a Wonderful Life\\" for instance.

B003LD9P4K|4.0|The best song on here is, Lucky Man, I agree with another review on here that said it would have been nice if Emerson played more of the Moog sound we all loved on Tarkus but overall you also need to consider how old it is. These guys are probably close to 70 now! The quality is quite good and so is the sound but I did not give it 5 stars since the performance didn't seem to excite me much.

1881273156|5.0|I left a similar review on another book I bought when my marriage was heading down the toilet.  This helped me realize what kind of a cow my ex-wife was.  Her love language was food and this book helped me see that. What kind of a person lies to their spouse about Big Macs so they can get more of them?  I mean, honestly....???  Anyway, this is a great book and it helps you really see what language your significant other is really speaking.

0061655554|5.0|The great American corporation, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, was created in the late 1800s by a farm boy turned speculator. The Virginian moved to Winston-Salem and built state-of the art tobacco mills that minted money and made the bucolic town rich. The company's factory buildings were the largest buildings in Winston-Salem, with new technologies such as steam power and electric lights. After the 1911 breakup of the tobacco trust, RJ began force-feeding Reynolds stock to employees and Winston-Salem came to be known as `the city of reluctant millionaires.' Burrough and Helyar describe RJR Tobacco Company's existence in Winston Salem as a happy marriage between hard working Moravians and a family company. Contributing to the marital bliss was the fact that in 1960, 58 percent of all men and 36 percent of all women smoked.<br /><br />Unfortunate for the happy marriage was the apotheosis of Ross Johnson to the helm of RJR Nabisco as well as the growing national sentiment that Tobacco companies were cancer merchants.  R. J. Reynolds Industries merged with Nabisco Brands in 1985, and the name changed to RJR Nabisco in August 1986. In 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms to acquire RJR Nabisco. The transaction created an infamous moment when a ridiculous amount of money ($22 billion) was up for grabs. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar detail the free-for-all as anyone who was anyone on Wall Street fought to get a piece of the action. In layman's terms, they detail the events of the hostile take-over by KKR. In short, Wall Street produced two new ways to make lots of money; leverage buy-outs and junk bonds. Both products came to full fruition to create the perfect storm for the RJR Nabisco deal. As Helyar recalled during an interview with Marketwatch, he and Burrough ultimately created a \\"part-comic, part-dramatic operetta\\" that reflected \\"the human comedy\\" of Wall Street at the time. They had close access to the deal's major players and compiled their immense research into one of the best-ever books about the drama of Wall Street investing.research into one of the best-ever books about the drama of Wall Street investing.

B007PKSN6Q|5.0|It has always been a tough to get an actor to sing well, but based on a lot of hours of voice training for the actors in this movie it has REALLY paid off. I have created a playlist of the originals followed by the soundtrack versions. And although it sounds sacriledgeous, quite a few remake numbers sound as good as or better than the original. I really do suggest that you give a side by side listen. Both Catherine Zeta and Tom Cruise are amazing, Julianne Hough on the other hand could use a few more lessons. Great fun.
1597801585|3.0|It's clear that the author spent a lot of time constructing a complex future, which I will not call a \\"dystopia\\" because that word should be illegal.<br /><br />I was at times enchanted by his descriptions, especially at the beginning.  But then the book devolved into a good guys v. bad guys romp.  That might have been all right if the author had made me care about any of the characters before he put them in danger.  As it was, the only character I found at all three-dimensional was the windup girl herself.<br /><br />I hope the author's next book will tell me much more about windups of all kinds.  I don't care about Bangkok, now or in the future.  I don't care about political power struggles, now or in the future.  I care about a truly new type of character, and that is the windup.<br /><br />On the bright side, there were very few typos in this book.  That's refreshing.
B005HEXQN2|3.0|As a series I give Voyager a 3.5 out of 5, I attribute that mostly to the outstanding 6th and 7th season. Season 1-5 was a mixed bag of quality some terrible and some amazing.<br /><br />As for the finale I was hoping for actual character and story resolution...I was expecting too much I think<br /><br />Here's what I got from the finale *spoilers*<br />1.) Janeway decides she is God and that she controls the outcome of everyone's lives to suit her selfish needs (AKA she wants 7 of 9 back BADDD!!)<br />2.) She decides to erase 26 years of history, 26 years of Tom and B'Elanna's daughter growing up, 26 years of EVERYONE'S LIFE<br />3.) She risks giving the Borg futuristic technology that could give them such an advantage they could DECIMATE EVERYTHING IN SECONDS<br />4.) the Borg wormhole opens up right in Earth's backyard.....1 of 6 gates....in the...entire...universe.....opens.....RIGHT....AT....EARTH!?<br />5.) Why didn't she just go back to before she destroyed the caretaker array? or better yet before she even went to find the Maquis ship? -- oh that's right because those 7 years in the Delta Quadrant; all those crewmen that died, were worth getting her favorite new friends like Neelix, 7 of 9, Kes, blah, blah, etc<br />6.) How did Admiral Janeway know about the Borg gate in the Nebula? When she arrived Voyager had already left it behind and had no idea what was there....I was joking at first but I think Janeway might actually be God, she knows EVERYTHING.<br />7) they finally get back home after 7 years and all they have to say *in monotone voices* is \\"Oh we did it\\"<br /><br />This is me being critical, but I should know by now Voyager is the Star Trek with the least continuity and care for logic. In a way that's what made it fun to watch; in fact, I really think Voyager is good Trek and good sci-fi. The characters are memorable and well written, and it had some of the best episodes of the whole ST franchise. It's just weird for me how it ended...I feel like it needed some lead-in to give the writers time to explore their life after returning to Earth and get some closure to the characters. Unlike most stories or series....there is no Epilogue here.needed some lead-in to give the writers time to explore their life after returning to Earth and get some closure to the characters.

0345803485|3.0|2.5 stars: I can sum up this story in four words: \\"Stop biting your lip!\\" (Sorry--other readers of this book will get the reference...you will literally read that line more than fifty times throughout the book!). I will say this for the much-hyped Fifty Shades: while it was one of the most poorly-written books I've ever read, I did find myself unable to pull away from its pages. The basic story is the following: Anastasia Steele is about to graduate from college and is completely insecure (though strangely enough, totally alluring to every man she meets). When she stumbles into self-made 27-year-old billionaire Christian Grey one day, their sexual chemistry is instant. But will Ana allow herself to become a part of Christian's world and fully submit to him?<br /><br />I will liken reading Fifty Shades to watching terribly trashy television--you know it's so bad and doing absolutely nothing to enhance your intellect, but you just cannot look away! I wanted to read this for myself, since it's received so much media attention and people have vastly different takes on it. For those who haven't read it yet, this book is not for the faint of heart in terms of sexuality--there are many adult scenes, pretty pornographic in nature. Do not read this book if you are looking for a well-written story--very weak writing and absolutely awful character development. I gave it 2.5 stars because it did hold my attention despite its flaws, and I am entertaining the idea of reading the second book in the trilogy! If you're looking for a definite 'guilty pleasure' sort of book, read on!
B005HEX6ZK|3.0|There were so many ridiculous moments in this episode...including many of which break rules about the EMH that were used as plot devices and excuses earlier in the series. If you can see past those you will most likely thoroughly enjoy this episode.<br /><br />As a lead in to the season finale it just fails for me...at this point in TNG or DS9 the show was EPIC! I mean edge of my seat intergalactic space battles spanning multiple races and sectors, story-lines were approaching their climax....I couldn't wait to see the finales. Here on Voyager it's just this strange stand-alone episode with a conclusion that made no sense; the Doc didn't even get punished for betraying his crew AGAIN? At least take away his Emergency Command Hologram crap so he can't almost kills you all again...Jesus Christ....<br /><br />I've really enjoyed all of season 7, I just hope this episode isn't indicative of the finale.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very well written book, I enjoyed it very much. My wife and daughters enjoyed this book as well.

1439102813|4.0|As the son of an early-onset Alzheimer's sufferer, I found Still Alice frighteningly and comfortingly real. My reactions of tears, laughter and everything between reminded me of my own similar experiences enduring this disease's progression in my mother. I applaud Genova for dealing with the feelings that AD sufferers go through as they observe the disease worsening inside themselves, although helpless to remedy it. My favorite part was the speech Alice gave at the Alzheimer's conference: brilliantly crafted, authentically real, and penetratingly important. A brave venture to write this book.

B001O1O71C|4.0|I read this a month or so ago and still find myself recalling the story and the characters. Particularly the unexpected ending. In many ways it's a contrived tale that doesn't quite ring true. Especially if you've read many histories and memoirs of death camps like Auschwitz and the way they were operated. But the story's viewpoint, from a nine-year-old's observations and emotions as he innocently confronts his father and his largely-misunderstood employment, is what makes it so memorable. Read it. You won't be sorry you did.

B0087YYHZU|5.0|There is a number near the beginning of this film where O'Connor and Kelly play fiddles and dance around each other. They then appear to glide and finally float around each other. This is a tip off to the type of film this really is: for years mis-categorised as a musical, it is actually a religious epic. Only a higher power looks to Chicago, Pittsburg, and Texas and then transports three people to Los Angeles at precisly the right time to do something, the rehearsal of which, would have killed anyone else. You will smile and laugh, unabated, for 103 minutes. And that, dear reader, is supernatural!

091581112X|5.0|I have been on the New Age spiritual path for a long time, six or seven years.  During that time, I have amassed an incredible amount of spiritual literature:  Esther & Jerry Hicks (Abraham), Sylvia Browne, Doreen Virtue, Wayne Dyer, Summer McStravick<br />(Flowdreaming), The Secret (and books by the various individual 'Secret' teachers), Sonia Choquette, etc. etc.<br /><br />I feel like \\"Spiritual Growth\\" by Sanaya Roman has taken me back to the fundamentals of my spiritual journey.  I understand that modern spiritual teachers are merely trying to emphasize that acquiring material abundance is not a negative thing, and that one need not be poor or suffer to be spiritually enlightened.  That said, I'm not in any way talking down about those teachers when I say that I feel like I have been caught up in the whole \\"manifesting\\" whirlwind to the point where I have \\"lost the plot.\\"  While New Age spirituality has expanded in popularity, it has also been commercialized and watered down a bit for easy consumption.  There are probably millions of people on the manifestation bandwagon who have no real interest in expanding spiritually; they just want the ideal car.  Even myself, who has been on the spiritual path for a while now, is guilty of manifesting just for manifesting's sake.  At times, I have become so focused on the ideal job, mate, car, etc. that I have forgotten at times why I'm doing this.  \\"Spiritual Growth,\\" published in 1989 - long before most of the New Age literature on my bookshelves - addresses everything most of the modern books do, in a very condensed yet specific and outlined way.<br /><br />\\"Spiritual Growth\\" keeps the emphasis of why we are manifesting firmly centered on life purpose and life goal, sans catchy bylines and other major selling points - case in point, \\"The Secret.\\"  I'm not insulting The Secret at all, I love it.  But it is not lost on me what catchy packaging it is.  The title alone is pretty brilliant.  We all want to be in on secrets,don't we?  ;-)  I don't think a Law of Attraction movie entitled \\"Law of Attraction for Spiritual Growth\\" would have caught on as well, somehow.<br /><br />While I still love every piece of modern New Age literature I own, and AGAIN am not in any way discrediting any of it, I thank Sanaya and Orin for clearing my spiritual cache and helping me get back to the simplicity of life purpose.  I think this can only help me become a better and more heartfelt manifestor/co-creator with God.
B008BM9L72|3.0|After hearing all the hype about the books I decided to download the sample to my Kindle to give it a try.  From the sample, it didn't have enough to hold my interest so I didn't purchase the books.  I actually had someone recommend Claiming Sleeping Beauty(A.N. Roquelaure aka Anne Rice) at the same time so I went that route. (I do not recommend that trilogy for the faint of heart.)  Now, talk about OMG-shift-in-your-seat-uncomfortable-while-reading then check that out.  But all of my friends, have read or started reading the FST and talked endlessly so I wondered if maybe I just didn't read far enough so I gave it another go and borrowed them from a friend.<br /><br />This is not typically the genre I read but from time to time I do find a \\"romance\\" novel that I do enjoy.  The story line isn't bad although it is very predictable from the get-go. Once the sexual encounters started I did become somewhat annoyed at their frequency and repetitiveness.  I honestly feel with a little better editing this trilogy could have been one novel from beginning to end.  I did find myself skimming past the encounters because of their frequency so I could get back to the story line.  What kept me reading is who doesn't a love a fantasy where you are completely taken care of (in every way possible), showered with gifts and admiration and rescued by a knight in shining (or grey) armor.  The knight does have issues, but that also makes him a little more palpable.  It did give me a dream world to step into to escape the daily grind.  And who doesn't love that in a book, right?<br /><br />I found the character, Anastasia, to be immature, insecure and quite irritating at times.  I had to keep reminding myself that she is 21 and that is probably spot on for someone her age and not my age(40).  More often than not I was thinking, \\"Jeesh, here we go again.\\"  As for Christian being the total package......almost.  I thoroughly enjoyed his character but there were moments when I didn't feel hischaracter would truly say or do the things that were written. He came off as smooth and suave then these few instances I felt the instant cheeseball factor.  ('Laters, baby', still just didn't feel his character saying this).  But possibly in my mind I imagined him a little bit older than what E.L. James wrote.  I will contain my complaints feeling they should be saved for a book club I need to start discussing the characters and flow the Fifty Shades Trilogy so that I can get these issues off my chest! ;)<br /><br />As for pricing-if you enjoy the books-it will be worth every penny to you regardless if in print or via Kindle.  If you don't, then of course you will be angry at the price after you're done.  I have read several books that I borrowed then purchased for my own library AFTER I had already completed them.  They were worth every penny.<br /><br />I feel the trilogy does have a lot to offer.  It depends on what you are looking for in a book.  The whole reason we read is to engage in a world different than our own where we can become the characters and live through their experiences.  If you are looking for a love story, its there.  If you enjoy erotica, its there.  If you long for characters who learn to trust, find strength in themselves and each other, its there.  You may have to sift through a few pages depending on your expectations.  Possibly ask yourself before you read the trilogy what you are reading them for...if you are reading for the sexual encounters, bingo!  There are many.  If you are reading for the BDSM...eh, its very light.  Maybe my expectations were different because I felt it was marketed to me as erotica and wondered how/why you need three books for that.  Who knows, but you may also learn that you are not so \\"vanilla\\" after all and you don't need all of the \\"grey\\" in between.
034580404X|5.0|This was a great deal for 3 books. I saves $10 buying them through Amazon then in the store. ANd it comes with a box to store all three books making it a very nice set.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Enjoyed this second of the trilogy - better than the first one. Continue to enjoy the Kindle format and the Amazon support service.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|What the........?  Did the author get bored with the story?  Did he decide his readers were suckers for sticking with the series and decided to stick it to them? His commentary after book four mentioned that his work on the fifth book was so long that he had to cut it back.  Perhaps that's where the rest of the story is: on the cutting room floor. Why not have two more volumes and complete the many story lines he had so laboriously created instead of leaving us with a half-finished final book?  Clearly, I'm disgusted and disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm really only writing this review because I had to for the game so feel free to keep scrolling! :) I like this game I suppose. The only problem I have is that every once in a while the game has to update or something so naturally it starts to take up more space, but not everythings perfect.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Fleetwood Mac's \\"Greatest Hits\\" is a must for serious rock and roll collectors. Oh how I miss hearing this group perform. Their voices harmonize so beautifully as a group, and the solos have a haunting, and lasting effect. I remember when this group hit the top of the music charts in the mid 1970's, with a clear, unique, upbeat style of rock and roll.<br />Now, being able to play this CD in my car, makes driving a pleasure. They are definitely a fun and enjoyable group to listen to.<br />If you have any doubt about this CD, give it a shot if you are a rock and roll fan. I think you will enjoy it, as I sure have.<br />JB
B000FBFN0Q|2.0|I thought I'd like this book. It started out reasonably, with a sweet main character who loves shopping but has debt issues. It's written well, I had no problem with the prose.<br /><br />Spoiler---<br />I just kept waiting for her to change, to learn from her bad behavior. To NOT buy every single material thing she feels like. Instead she has her just manage to get more money so she can buy to her heart's content. It was disappointing. This character has actual problems, people who are this extreme and willing to jeopardise their real lives to buy expensive clothes have an addiction to shopping and need to address it.<br /><br />I finished to see if she'd learn anything at all, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|very addictive. love the game. I have a young boy and not much time for games but u can pick this up and play anytime. build ur own place and meet new people that help u out on the way. highly recommend!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I enjoyed this novel on a number of levels. It was well-crafted, the main character was engaging,and sweet, the plot and pace moved at a fast clip, and there was plenty of conflict and tension. I especially liked the family dynamics, the secondary characters (small-town people and a dog), the love-hate between mother and daughters (and why) and the growing romantic involvement. I did think that Rose was a bit gullible. She should have guessed what was happening, shouldn't have gone along with the bad guy and her attempt to rescue Joe was a bit of a fizzer. Overall, a fun read, which I recommend.
0062008528|3.0|I ended up getting this in audiobook format because recently I've gotten rather fond of listening to narrations of the text. It lends a new level to the reading and sometimes makes it easier to sink into the novel. (Well, except for when you're driving. Only so much sinking you can do then!)<br /><br />I have to say that while I did enjoy Fernandez's voice, I couldn't help but be slightly disappointed at times. He does a good job of keeping his general narrator voice the same (no big fluctuations or whatnot), but at times it felt less like someone acting out the voices and whatnot and more like someone just reading the book aloud. It's a good narration and I did find the voice for Monk to be one of the standouts, but this wasn't really the best I've heard so far.<br /><br />The story is good as well, having an interesting idea and some great scenes. It's just that there's so much going on here that it's a little overly busy at times. There's not a lot of \\"down time\\" with the book that allows you to kind of catch up with everything that's going on and mull it over. This can sometimes be a good thing with action novels, as you don't want to have too much down time, but when you have the action cutting between the two main groups and a few minor sub-groups, it can get to be a bit much at times.<br /><br />As usual though, the shining jewel lies in Rollins's imagination in creating potential \\"what if\\" scenarios based around historical myths, legends, and the like. No matter what the flaws were in this book, I couldn't help but want to keep listening/reading to discover what would become of everything. I suppose that in the end, that's all that one could really ask for in a novel. This might not be a \\"must buy\\" for every person out there, but it's worth a listen for fans of the series. (If you haven't picked up anything in the series, don't start with this book. You have to know the back story in order to know all of what is going on.)
B00785P2QC|5.0|lots of fun can play for hours and the kids like it too. glad I downloaded it and its free
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I bought this app because it was on the list of top free ads.  But as soon as I started playing it I instantly became addicted.  A TOTAL MUST-HAVE FOR APP LOVERS

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|When a plain, no frills calculator is all you need, this is the one you use.  The digits are large and easy to read, and the layout is functional.  I use it almost every day.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't usually write reviews of things, but Hugh, the author of this book, asked me to after I finished reading it. And since I enjoyed it tremendously, I felt obliged.<br /><br />This is a story of a rag-tag group of misfits living together in a hole in the ground called a \\"silo.\\" They are not allowed to go outside or they will die. Unless they ask to go outside, or kill somebody, or think for themselves. These three things are equal in the eyes of the people that run the silo. The catch is that when you are sent out, you have to clean the outside camera lenses so the people inside can have a clear view of the desolate wasteland. To make a long story short, some people learn the truth (bad) and decide to take matters into their own hands. Hi-jinks ensue, stairs are climbed (I swear, the people who live in the silo must have quads like Arnold), and some stuff gets blowed up real good.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the better books I've read in a long time, and I've read some really good ones. My suggestion to you is to pull up a comfy chair, fix yourself a big bowl of rabbit stew, and block off a few days to read this. Then write a 5-star review so Hugh can read it and say nice things about you. He seems like the kind of guy who would. Hi, Hugh.
B003YUQ9CG|4.0|This slip-on is a good alternative to sandals for going to summer bbq's or casual dinners out without looking too casual.  Comfortable to wear even without socks, although it can get warm.  If the material was a little more breathable, I'd give it 5 stars.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very relaxing,  soothing app. Great stress reliever in the office. I plan to try it as I go to sleep tonight. I think it will be a big help!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A rather fun game.  Controls are slick, and it's a great example of a simple premise having some depth. Highly recommended.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really liked this book! It took some time for me to get into it, but by a third of the way into it, I was hooked. There was so much interesting character development.<br /><br />I liked how the first half of the book established the characters and the second half moved them ahead in life. This was a true epic in that we followed Ender for many years and even in the last chapters we see him much older. I really want to purchase a box set of this series.<br /><br />The technology was also interesting in that they have desks, which are very similar to ipads. I always enjoy reading science fiction from decades ago to see how we have progressed. It is scary sometimes.<br /><br />This book reminded me of The Neverending Story in the way both protagonists are so innocent at the beginning and by the end they have developed into quite different people.<br /><br />I loved the interactions between the children. The topic of bullying and violence among children is very interesting. I liked the side story of Ender's brother and sister as well.
0375842209|5.0|This book was very moving.  It will captivate you from the first paragraph. The book is very original and leads you in an unusual way.  It makes you appreciate what you have and what things a person comes to value in their lives.
0061726834|4.0|The first half of this book did not impress me. The love being a disease seemed pushed and impractical.<br /><br />BUT, I LOVED the second half. I read the last two hundred or so pages in two sittings. The relationship culminated and everything seemed more real. I guess that's what the novel was about, though. Lena's thoughts are boring until the second half and that's when I really started enjoying it.<br /><br />The romance felt more real than most dystopian romances since love was such a central theme.<br /><br />I adored the ending.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|This is one of the few movies I have ever seen that is stunningly better on Blu-ray than on DVD.  I saw this film in the theater and thought the cinematography was out of this world.  The DVD played on a Blu-ray player through a Hi-Def television is very pleasing.<br /><br />However, there are subtleties of light and shadow and color that just jump off the screen from the Blu-ray version.  The cinematographer also plays with focus depth and this effect is more pronounced in the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoyed this film or wants to experience it for the first time will love this Blu-ray version!
0525478817|5.0|I really like John Green's writing. This is the first of his novels I have read, but he is a co-author of Will Grayson, Will Grayson and I thoroughly enjoyed it. John Green's writing feels very realistic and is chocked full of fun references and quirky thoughts. The characters in The Fault in Our Stars are all very real. Most of the characters have cancer and the ways they deal with it are unique and interesting.<br /><br />This novel is definitely a sad cancer book, but Green's writing connected me so well with the characters. The novel without an ending within the book that connects the main characters really adds to the story. The novelist in the Netherlands was one of my favorite characters. There are so many thought provoking topics brought up in this book.<br /><br />I suggest this book to EVERYONE. I will definitely be purchasing more of John Green's novels.
