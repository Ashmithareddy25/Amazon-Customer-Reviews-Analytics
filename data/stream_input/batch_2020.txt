B009WO7NQO|4.0|This game is definitely one of the best in the angry bird series. i like how they always have a theme and scene for each level.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The bits you see in the shorts are all the funny bits in the movie.Sorry but its not really that funny IMO.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i didnt originally want to get this app. but since i was bored i downloaded it because it was free. this game is just as addictive as temple run is.
B0044WSF5M|3.0|Disappointed, can not purchase this old movie for libriary, Only can rent for 24hrs. Picture quality poor. Love the songs
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. i think this is on of christopher nolan`s best work. the joker was a hit in this movie aqnd it was fascinating watching the joker push batman to the edge
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just got a new tablet and was disappointed that Kindle was not included. I was thrilled that I was able to add it at no cost.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Its nice to see another gane inthe angry bird series but its just not the same with the birds kicking the pigs asses.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an amazing game. l love every game, and it is great for passing time. lt is an amazing game that everybody l know loves.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This is such a beautiful soundtrack.  I just wish I had a better sound system to play it on :)
B000V86OKG|5.0|I chose 5/5 stars because I truly hated the series at first. It took me a while to finally get into the &#34;Ice Truck Killer.&#34; I thought-why am I watching a series about a serial killer and how could one enjoy this-even with the code and the ritual. Well I guess it was because Dexter didn't seem human. Second season captured his humanity (what scarce traces he has) and I was impressed at how this series continues to grow and grip me. I recommend the Dexter Series to ANYONE especially Second Season (Probably my favorite season so far) and I'm on season 4 currently.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoy this program!  So many interesting, historical things to keep it entertaining.  Hope it continues on the air for a long time!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book. Was a very quick read and was filled with an amazing strong from cover to cover. I recommend it
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Phillip Phillips has a distinct style and tone that I just love.  Every song on the DVD is wonderful.  Great sound showing his talent.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This is one area  where I am disappointed with Amazon.  After paying good money for a device that has the capabilities to take pictures it is difficult to believe tha Amazon would have its customers pay for an app to use what it already in the device.  To me this is not something I would ever buy.  The cost is not the issue it is the fact that it should have come with it.  I realize that opinions are like noses everyone has one. Now you have mine too.<br /><br />Knight68
B000VEA38E|5.0|It is great music for inspiration or to just have on as background music.  What a way to bring back great music all in one box set.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I think this is a great new show. We need more shows about heroes, it would do our country some good right now.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Always love Michael Connelly and this is one of his best! It will keep you reading and has a satisfying ending.
0345529057|5.0|I read other reviews stating that people received their books missing pages and with the binding in terrible shape. This was not the case for me. As soon as the books arrived I carefully flipped through the entirety of the four books (took a while) and made sure every single page was there. I found none missing and the binding/spine of all four was in perfect shape. None of the pages were worn or falling out.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with my set of books.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Not having enjoyed Spark's novels previously, I began this with low expectations. The first half was rather slow and then the action picked and it was hard to put down till finished. Really enjoyed it!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I downloaded this game and then all of a sudden I started getting charges to my amazon account.. from $19.00 to $1.99. This is not a game for kids. It is a SCAM to rip you off. I would check your account. I GOT RID OF THIS APP. I am going to pursue these charges. WHAT A SNEAKY WAY TO GET MONEY OUT OF PEOPLE. IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT I WOULD NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING WITH THE NAME GAMELOFT associated with the appls.
B009MO5G90|5.0|Loved the movie, but I have to say it is even better in 3D. The action scenes are fun to watch and it is a great addition to our 3D collection.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I've never watched all the movies before but I always enjoyed the struggle/win of the human condition of the ones I had seen.  I wanted the box set and when this came up with a fantastic price on blu ray, I couldn't resist!  Great deal and great movies!
B0091REZMW|4.0|its cool<br />I like it<br />I thought it was going to be boring but once you get into it you cant stop.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this App!!!!!  I had it on many devices and I absolutely love it!!!  Easy to navigate and always fun to browse around!
B005LJETYI|5.0|one of my new all time faves. couldnt put it down. original intense and profound. a must read. sci fi soldier xeno story
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I got this because it was free and looked like it might be fun but I really wasn't expecting all that much from it. I was so wrong! It's really a lot more in depth than I would have imagined, trying to breed certain types of dragons,  some of which are rare or limited edition. Breeding the right dragons to use in the races, or to earn the highest income is harder than you might think.<br /><br />Upgrading and decorating your park is also tons of fun. You start out with one island and about 5 visitors and the more effort you put into your park the more visitors you get. I'm currently level 22 with 5 of the 6 possible islands, 25 Dragon habitats, 58 dragons (each one different and one of them is the legendary Kairos),  and I have about 195 visitors in my park. You can't just leave it alone though if you want to keep raising your visitor count, you have to keep changing and upgrading your park.<br /><br />This is definitely a great game worth a look! If you still aren't sure about  it go check out their wiki page!!
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|My son got this for Christmas along with the Hape Kitchen. he loves it. He cooks and washes dishes, he cuts veggies and then his favorite thing is to feed his parents. Highly recommend.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Most enjoyable I couldn't put it down and kept ducking out os sight so I could keep reading. The prose had a wonderful cadence. Characters where well developed and kept you guessing as to who were the goodies. The plot had me wondering right to the last and I wanted more and was sad when finished.<br />Highly recommended and my pals all felt the same.
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I read some reviews here and elsewhere which warned that the image quality of Contact on Blu-ray is substandard. However, I do not find that to be the case. Since I now have both the Blu-ray and DVD, I can see just how bad the DVD print is, full of picture noise and compression artifacts. The color also doesn't look quite right in places. The Blu-ray image, while not reference quality, is a very good transfer which, while cleaning up the image considerably, also retains much of the natural graininess of the film. For the most part, colors are strikingly vibrant without looking over-saturated. The aspect ratio also seems correct (i.e., no vertical stretching). On a properly-calibrated TV, this looks vastly superior to the DVD print. And the sound is just fantastic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bonus material leaves a lot to be desired. Although the short-and-small computer animation featurettes from the DVD are retained, they look terrible. Also, I didn't find the extensive text-only production notes from the Special Edition DVD on this Blu-ray.<br /><br />A low price makes an upgrade from DVD more than worthwhile. Although this excellent movie deserves a better overall treatment, I find the quality of the movie itself on Blu-ray to be praiseworthy.
B005F3XVA8|5.0|its a great movie to watch and have a few laughs to its great movie with alot of stars in it pay atention to the voice and that how you'w'll  find out who they are
B00AEFY552|5.0|I did a fair bit of homework before buying this 2-disc Blu-ray set with a January 1, 2013 release date. (Yes, Amazon's description of the set is wrong - an unfortunately common problem!) The original release of Gladiator on Blu-ray was a noise-reduction, edge-enhancement mess that has since been replaced by a much better, more film-like remaster. But how to know which print you have received? This is tricky. Some investigations in 2010 and 2011 revealed that if the back of the Blu-ray case says \\"2-disc set\\" over the Paramount logo, or if the UPC sticker is not yellow, or if the color of the printed side of the discs themselves is light grey, your Blu-ray print might be the bad one. However, time has shown that these indicators are not reliable.<br /><br />What about this new release? The copy I received today has a *white* UPC sticker on the back that says \\"Distributed by Warner Home Video\\" and features the WB logo. (The sole reason for the 2013 re-release, as far as I can tell, is that WB has taken over distribution of this and many other titles from Paramount.) The case features the \\"2-disc set\\" label and a 2010 copyright date. BUT THIS IS INDEED THE NEWER REMASTER! The principal giveaway is that the unprinted side of Disc 1 features a code along the inner ring which ends with \\"B1R2.\\" But the only sure test is to play the movie. From the start, it has a film-like appearance that is not excessively scrubbed of grain and minor noise, but is nevertheless polished and color-corrected. It looks and sounds fantastic to me. I saw no noticeable flaws during the opening battle sequence that would suggest to me that this is the wrong print of the movie. (Hooray!) What small flaws I did notice seem to be inherent to the film and should stay as they are.<br /><br />I hesitated to replace my 2-disc DVD copy of this movie. I'm very glad to have this new release. It is the high-quality Sapphire Series Blu-ray release with both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, commentary by Scott and Crowe, a vast collection of featurettes, deleted scenes, images, and more. Language tracks: English 5.1 DTS-HD, French 5.1 DD, Spanish 5.1 DD; subtitles in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, and Korean.

8866130915|4.0|I ordered this small agenda book because I purchased the larger edition of it last year and it really kept my life organized it. I mistakenly bought the small size this year, but as it turns out, its big enough for all that I need it for.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|The case although not used seemed perfect for the product it was purchased for but the product did not work for me
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a great quick read. Started off a bit slow but then I couldn't put it down. I will read the rest of the series.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Seriously entertaining in exposing real human foibles, stark realities and fanciful desires.<br /><br />There's a touch of us all in at least one of the characters.<br />I have never read nor seen an HP story and given the number of poor reviews lamenting the lack of pavlovian wholesome comfort derived from the Potter series I'm loathe to venture into experiencing them. This work asks the reader to think about real social dynamics. It has some rather delicate and socially taboo subjects that I think most HP readers would find too deep to fathom.<br /><br />I could not put this book down, found it thoroughly engaging and would recommend it to open minded folk only.<br /><br />Well done J K rowling, looking forward to the next one!<br /><br />:-)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|If all you want is a very basic calculator, this is it.  However, if you want any higher math functions (e.g. square roots, percentages, algebraic functions) forget it.  This app adds, multiplies, subtracts, and divides and nothing else (there is a memory function).  But it is free, and it works.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|this is a great controller but the L1 button doesnt work and i love the controller but the buttons just doesnt work
B009ME47H2|5.0|This app does exactly what it says--one-touch recording with easy to understand interface for recording and playback.  Best, it is free if you can tolerate the ads, which are in a very small window at the top and not a nuisance at all.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is the most addictive app ever i love this app my little sister plays the app all the time its sooooooooooooooooooooooo easy
B0064X7FVE|5.0|You can not only get the weather anywhere in the world, you can get videos, maps, extended forecasts, and so on--and it is fast.  It even gives the pollen counts, severe weather alerts, and is highly customizable--all for free
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Typical hidden object game, kills lots of time. Nice graphics, complex story line. Did not register the share to my wall, so couldn't master all achievement. Worth a couple bucks.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|In addition to being a great movie, what I like best is the audio.  Great way to give my 7.1 surround system (and two sub-woofers) a workout.  If you crank it up, it feels like real cannon balls are flying through the house.
B005LAII8A|3.0|Not only is the cinematography dark, the plot is as well.  Actually it is a good premise and one that has been around for many years, in one form or another.  Reminds me of my days devouring Analog SciFi/Fantasy.  However, to the novice, the plot is very hard to follow.  Fortunately enough reviews are available to work out the plot in general terms.  The ending is actually rather predictable to veteran Sci Fi buffs, but the flashbacks and odd interactions make following along a challenge.  This is one of those movies I wish had been executed better.  The failing may be in the editing or just put it on the director's shoulders.  The action needs to be clear and not just reliant on shotgun gblasts.
8866131059|5.0|Very nice size, well made. There is definitely thought given into making this product.  It has a lot of little extras such as contact book, 2014 mini calendar, units conversion list, etc.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Keeps wanting to update, but never does. Basically does nothing but makes a little icon spin around. Removed it. Refund please..
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Not only does this free app provide a nice little alarm clock, it give you the local weather automatically  It also offers many options to customize the clock, sounds, etc.  The ads are not intrusive.
B007V65R54|4.0|An excellent discussion on the theory, strengths, and weaknesses of forecasting.  The description of Bayesian analysis was especially useful. I enjoyed the honest discussion of how data and predictions can fall short, including the author's.  This is a great read.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Best batman movie I've seen yet. I liked how the plot had a few surprises and the villain wasn't a straight-up weirdo or strange creature. Very well casted. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.

B008FPOIT6|4.0|The online short story version of this was what led me to help kickstart his first printed book, and I was thrilled to find this expanded novel had a great deal more to the story. I would love to work for Sloan’s version of Google, or meet almost any of his quirky and fascinating characters.
B007OUINLC|5.0|I've learned more and more about Jung and Freud in recent years, but was never aware of the perspective proposed by A Dangerous Method.  A great tee-up of their two viewpoints, anchored by a strong showcase story.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|This allows you to access another computer from your kindle.  only problem is, the computer must be on--not in sleep or standby mode.  Since I have my computers sent to go into sleep mode automatically, this is a problem.  But once connected, it works as stated  It would be helpful to have a way to enlarge parts of the desktop since tapping the correct area is not easy.

B000007WOP|2.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums that I had on CD for years. Not sure what happened to the band. They were great. The reason I rated this product two stars is because I ordered two copies of this album on vinyl from Amazon and they both had the same exact problem. The last track on side &#34;C&#34; (second album) skips. I could see maybe this happening on one copy, but when it was the same on both I figure it must be a problem with the manufacturer. So, buy this if you don't mind one song being unplayable. I'll buy it when the problem is fixed.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Not what I was expecting, but very interesting.  There were parts that were difficult to read, reality of wild animals and such but the premise behind it all was intriguing.

B0073LWEXK|1.0|Don't waste your $0.99! This game doesn't run, it crashes before even loading the first scene.<br />Really it would be great if amazon gave you the option to return an app for a refund within the first hour of purchase. Some of these games are short, so I can see not letting it go 24 hours. But c'mon. I've had it installed for 15 minutes.
B004X60QE2|5.0|US Marshall Jack Carter has a fear of flying, and is transporting a prisoner by car when he gets lost.  While he is distracted a dog wanders onto the road, and he has to swerve to miss it.  When he does so, he slides off of a wet Oregon road and is stuck.  A phone call later a tow truck appears, and he is taken to the nearby town of Eureka.  At first everything seems fine in this sleepy little town, but little by little things become increasingly unusual.  Finally, he gets involved with a search for a little boy.  His work brings him to the attention of the local town leadership, and he is recruited to be the town's new sheriff.  When this happens he soon learns that Eureka is no ordinary town.  It is a town populated by ultra-brilliant scientists and their families.  The scientists work at a nearby secret research facility - Global Dynamics.  It is supported by government and military funding, and researchers there investigate every field of science.  Jack Carter doesn't know what he's getting into.<br /><br />As time goes along we are introduced to a colorful, eccentric cast of characters.  These include the lab director, the local mechanic (who also does physics), the head of Global Dynamic security and her autistic son, the company psychiatrist, the chef of the local restaurant, the deputy, the corporate gopher \\"Fargo\\", and on and on.<br /><br />The show is funny, engaging, interesting, and a combination of completely believable and unbelievable.  Gradually Sheriff Carter gets used to the town, and they to him, more or less.  And though he's pretty much a regular guy, he and the braniacs of Eureka are able to find ways to work together.<br /><br />I am SO glad that I found this series.  I'm also glad that there are more seasons to watch.<br /><br />The character development and diversity of story lines and characters make Eureka a fun experience.<br /><br />I also VERY much appreciate the fact that this show is watchable.  There is very little foul language, and so far at least there is nothing in it that makes me hesitate watching this with my 13-year old daughter.<br /><br />I look forward to seasons 2-5.<br /><br />5 stars all the way around.so far at least there is nothing in it that makes me hesitate watching this with my 13-year old daughter.<br /><br />I look forward to seasons 2-5.<br /><br />5 stars all the way around.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Lots of histories, characters, and romance mixed with historical events and the actual players. Not only entertaining, but also educational.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I bought this game after playing the demo for those saying free should mean free and not noticing where it says unlock full version...<br />I am a mini puzzzel skipper but this game I didn't do that too many times. I loved the graphics especially the monkey. I played on the kindle fire and it worked great. the reason I'm not giving it five stars is the voice actors drove me nuts.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Despite the reviews I read about how disappointing the book was I still thought I would give it a go; and I'm glad I did!<br />I really enjoyed this book, although its not the same style as Harry potter this book was very true to the real life. There are a lot of characters but once you get to grips with who is who you feel as though you are part of pagford yourself.<br />It's a book def worth reading, it made me smile, laugh and cry.

B009T3AHDE|1.0|This was a deadly bore which I somehow managed to watch to the bitter end. It is a study in excess, with few characters to like, and a lot more to want to see their demise. I think Robert Pattinson did a good job with the material he was given, but I wonder if he even knew what was going on and what he was saying. No, this is one city I will not visit twice.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I like all the characters the human condition never change even with this devastation.  The character study is very real and stays true to the story.

B005ELZLZ4|5.0|In a way, this album kinda gives off the impression of being on another planet. And supported by the vision of a science fiction writer about space, conceptualized by a visionary from perhaps the 1930's. The eerie effects of space ships and humming energy fields really gives off the effect of no longer being of this earth. You are mildly introduced to it by the less than five minute opening track called \\"Sunrise in the Third System\\", but you know you've really ascended into an out of body experience when you get deeply into the thirteen minute piece called \\"Fly and Collision of Coma Sola.\\" For more than 30 years that I've had this album, I still never get tired of this piece. This is nothing near what you would call dance floor music. This is totally, anti-socially confined, inner-mind music.<br /><br />The human brain is just like any other organ in the body. The entries of thoughts and sounds can entertain the brain, and is further enhanced by the stimulation of the heart. Music has an effective way of stimulating the mind and the soul. To truly embrace it, you will need to shut out all other intrusions of thought.<br /><br />Like the other organs of the body, the brain can harden or soften, due to approval or disapproval of the entities that voluntarily or involuntarily penetrate the processing centre in the mind.<br /><br />Consciousness is an option to participate in the real or imagined presence of existence. If you can master the ability to leave one world, by entering yet another, will you know the meaning of true peace. This is truly, the closest you are ever going to ever meet God.<br /><br />Sometimes, entering the fictitious world of alternative existence can cause mildly vibrating pulsations in the mind. Do not be alarmed. You are beneficially relieving yourself of tormenting thought toxins that are commonly recognized as routine stress. This is actually your mind sending a means of gratitude back to your heart, for sharing in its comforting euphoria of peaceful, rejuvenating, stimulating, and regulating meditation for overall peace to return to the body, as a whole.<br /><br />\\"Alpha Centauri\\" was released in 1971. Only Klaus Schulze and very early Kraftwerk has introduced me to earlier episodes of spacey sound passages such as this. Tangerine Dream has been known to release over 100 albums, and is still recording today, but after 1983 (when they left the Virgin Record label) Edgar Froese, the one continuous member of Tangerine Dream, the sound of Tangerine Dream sounds like typical pop instrumentals that lost all hope that anything new and unique could ever be invented or discovered anymore.peaceful, rejuvenating, stimulating, and regulating meditation for overall peace to return to the body, as a whole.<br /><br />\\"Alpha Centauri\\" was released in 1971.

0393338398|4.0|I saw the movie and then read the book. I liked the movie and then really enjoyed the additional detail found in the book. Loved that Lewis features Jamie Moyer during part of the book and thought the author does a nice job with the mental side of the game for hitters and pitchers alike, in addition to the sophisticated statistical analysis he makes accessible. Any baseball fan who also reads should read this book regardless of whether she or he sees the movie. I mentioned Moyer specifically because I was always a big fan of his, but all of the players on whom Lewis focuses have interesting stories and unique styles of play. Meanwhile, Billy Beane was at it again in 2012 with another low budget, lousy-looking-on-paper A's team in the playoff hunt against the odds, even after the whole world had a chance to watch Brad Pitt give away his secrets on the big screen.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really interesting twists and great plot.  I wasn't bored throughout the book at all and it kept me wanting to read.  I'm excited to read Hoover's next book.  I really enjoy her style of writing.  Highly recommended!!!!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|this game is great they just wont let all of the dragons breed, so its a little maddening, but fun all the same
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|could not put it down, and didnt want it to finish, great characters awesome story made me wonder what was next for a few other characters.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I've always loved this movie ever since it was first released back in 1996.<br />it was always a bit of a headache to have to keep switching the disks though to see the 2nd half of the movie.<br />glad somebody finally got their act together and was finally able to put it all one side of one disk.<br />that makes it a thousand times better!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Pay attention as you start this read - the dates are important!  After a few chapters you get the chronological flip-flop and it is captivating.  Elizabeth Haynes' style is easy to read and the story not predictable at all.  While a sad story, it reached the feelings of many women who feel trapped in a bad relationship and even has a happy ending (thank goodness!)  I think for many who can't understand why someone doesn't simply leave an unhealthy relationship, this uncovered that real emotional (and physical) prison.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ive ever played out of all of my apps I am so hooked the only things that are okay are that it glitches up when there is a pop up text or reminder but still its so cool and the last thing is that sometimes it doesn't respond to the swipes but all and all this is the best game in the world and don't judge it by the two things that aren't good about it oops the two things that are not so good because this app is the king
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Great thriller, great story ! Read it voraciously. Characters really lept off the page. Loved Lisbeth Salander. What a heroine !!! Only thing I would add is that all three Stieg Larsson novels should be read in sequence in order to get maximum enjoyment and full understanding of the storyline and the different characters who appear in all three books
B008S4YZCO|3.0|this game is fun just a little more difficult than I like! a lot going on with the story and not a lot of instruction on how to do things
B007KOYEOC|5.0|the finally you know the end is soon but still so much cram packed into this third installment gonna miss these characters:(

B002RHGYOA|5.0|Couldn't wait to sink my teeth into this one and was not dissappointed. Well written and holds you from start to finish. Characters  very well developed and even the Swedish names of places and people don't detract from the story in any way !
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Second time watching this. Obviously it wasn't the most amazing compared to HD but the movie quality wasn't that bad either. Would recommend watching.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|these 2 characters are awesome even if you dont like the erotic bits its still a fantastic read makes your heart bleed for them
B0087DIEGE|4.0|Like others have mentioned, this lens cap should have been included standard with the camera. But despite the price, I still prefer it than the lens on a string that is a bit annoying  to put on and off. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars has to do with the price, but the product is great and I am happy with it.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book will have you talking about it months after reading it, requesting others to purchase it, you can't enjoy it without trying to get others to read it.  You know it would make a good movie after reading it.  Recommend pruchasing without a blink.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|E.L James continues without losing any of Ana and Christian's magnatism, have to read the first before the second and will no doubt wont be able to stop until all three are read
B00AREIAI8|4.0|they do bribe you for decent reviews but the game itself runs fairly smoothly<br /><br />cons<br />I don't like that they hide the prices on items you can buy with real money, or bribe for reviews<br />pros<br />smooth running with responsive controls
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|This would have been an amazing first season.  Since the 1st Season was so good, with so many twists, it is just second rate at this point.  Very dissappointed that it is suppossedly not connected to the 1st season.  We will see if there is a twist to make a connection since most of the actors are the same.<br /><br />Once again, good Horror and would have been great if the writers hadn't already set the bar so high with an exceptional first season.  Still looking forward to what is going to happen and the true connection for the ending!
B0047WJ12K|3.0|Not horrible but not great. There was a lot of hype around this movie and frankly I think it was just an okay movie. The concept is great and the story line is intriguing but feels drawn out at times and is less intriguing than other movies in the same genre.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Confession - I have been a Jack Reacher fan for over 15 years. I read this book in 1997 when it was first published and deservedly won the Anthony Award for Best First Novel. I revisited this book recently (it was unexpectedly free in the Australian region) to see what has changed in the 16 more Jack Reacher books that Lee Child has written since then.<br /><br />The answer is that this book is still one of the best in the series and very little has changed in the basics of later books (as long as you ignore the unnecessary Movie diversion).  Does this sound familiar:<br /><br />* Reacher has been drifting for 3 months after leaving the military. He has no ID and only uses cash.<br />* His travel destinations on bus, train or hitch hiking are random. This time he plans to visit the place where blues singer Blind Blake died.<br />* He accidentally gets accused of a crime he didn't commit and ends up helping the police with the investigation (and his skills exceed those of the police).<br />* There is mutual attraction with a female police officer.<br />* Reacher can defend himself against multiple assailants.<br /><br />Child's prose is still basically very short sentences, each clearly describing an action,or scene and is most effective in keeping the reader's attention and the action moving.<br /><br />This is classic early Jack Reacher and I recommend reading this book if you haven't read any other books in the series - but be warned you may become addicted. I will be keeping the book in my Kindle Classics Collection which contains books that I will read again at some time in the future. It is one of the youngest books in that collection.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This is an amazing book you won't ever want to put it down!!! It only took me two days to finish it was that good
B0089XH38M|4.0|So far it seems to be working great. Never had an antivirus for my cellphone. Will have to just wait and see.
0062197266|5.0|This book is a great read. Makes you really appreciate what you have in your life. I definitely recommend it to anyone.
B003LSTK8G|3.0|This novel, while informative and a good read in the fact that it was a page turner (I blew through it in about a week) was not the blow by blow account of the crises from start to finish that I was hoping for. On the merit of the story alone and how well written it was I would recommend this book to any one interested in the events of the 2008 financial crises but only as an accompaniment to other readings (such as Too Big To Fail) because a base understanding of the events and timeline are required to fully appreciate Lewis's more back ground account.

B004GK2B6Q|5.0|This was a nice adventure movie, had every element. The CGI was very well done. I enjoyed the story as well as the music.  The dialog lacked in some places,  but the clever use of facial expression helped.

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|i'd buy it just to keep watching through out the year!!! A very cute movie and Marky- Mark is pretty hott too
B008I34YYY|3.0|I admire the producers/directors for being the first to adopt the \\"Kickstarter\\" model and for their conception of \\"Nazi's return from the Moon\\". Nevertheless, I couldnt stop the lingering of the following thoughts when I was watching it. First, would the movie become more entertaining and hilarious if they had switched more resources from the building of those spaceship and battle visuals (very good with that budget, IMHO) to the development of funnier scripts? Second, would the boxoffice be higher if they had done marketing and promotion better, at least with a poster that can tell potential audience what the movie is really about? In fact, I saw it in the stand for a long while, and I had absolutely no interest to pick it up before a friend of mine did the recommendation. Third, would a better cast help? I am not complaining against the acting but their looks were not really convincing for their roles. In short, marginally ok for rent to watch, yet definitely not worth for a purchase.

B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I spent about 4 hours searching the internet for a fix for playing flash drive videos on the Kindle Fire HD and after trying everything that was suggested by Amazon, Kindle support and other owners, I was completely frustrated.  I called a friend and he suggested trying the MoBo Player app which I downloaded and within 2 minutes it searched all the disfunctional non supported videos I had already downloaded to the Kindle and every one of them worked.  I was thrilled with the ease and quickness with which MoBo solved this problem.  This app should be recommended by Amazon to all those that are experiencing this same problem.  I know there are many out there.  I couldn't believe I wasted all that time trying to solve this problem and then MoBo did it in minutes.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game play is very engaging.The graphics are fairly decent.One great part is that you can leave the game and it still collects the money. Buy this game its good!

God bless her,she is still here.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed this book very much!  The imagery was fantastic!  My only complaint is that the author seems bored with his story at the end and not quite sure how to end.  Consequently, he takes too much time explaining himself when he should just let the story simmer in the minds of the reader.  All in all, a great read!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|REALLY bad writing!  No character development, stupid non-plot, boring cliches.  This should be called &#34;part 1&#34;, would not read  the sequels.

B000U0O9FM|2.0|I was surprised by how badly written and choppy the book was.  Usually books are better than the movies, however, that wasn't the case here.  The book could have been so much better if he had but more material in it to fill in the gaps.  I feel that the movie took the problems with the book and smoothed them out making a much better story.
B000TERLEK|5.0|Possibly the best coldplay album. After listening to it a few times, I am really starting to love almost every song
B009IJJB8G|5.0|This is a very enjoyable show. Jonny Lee Miller is always mesmerizing [for this viewer] as Holmes. Something different for this Holmes is his vulnerability as a recovering addict, with family of origin issues. Also, the relationship with Irene Adler and the resulting heartbreak for Holmes is more apparent in this series. Lucy Liu is a great Watson.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Just an okay movie. Watch it on netflix if you really want to see it. Not worth renting or seeing in the theater.
B000HAB4KS|2.0|Lots of &#34;cool&#34; looking scenes and mystery in the beginning, but it was drawn out too long. Midway into the story and we still did not know what was going on.

1400023343|2.0|I was hoping this book was a practical/hands on guide with advise on raising a bilingual child, but so far it just has a lot of info on cognitive development and academic studies. The little practical advise that is in there is very basic and if you're bilingual yourself there isn't much that you couldn't figure out from your own experience. The advise given is pretty obvious common sense for anyone who speaks two or more languages and/or has worked with bilingual children/families in the past.<br /><br />If you enjoy psychological/cognitive development studies and discussions OR if you don't speak another language and want to get your children to be bilingual then you may get value from this book and enjoy it. If you're a bilingual parent looking to help your child in the bilingual road to hopefully have the same or better skills than you have then not a good read.
B004Z4M0GY|5.0|This novel still reads well and remains topical after more than twenty-five years. Mr. Wolfe handles confrontations with great verve and wit - these are confrontations between very distinct groups of people - bankers, district attorneys, ghetto thugs, preachers, journalists, detectives... Mr. Wolfe also perpetuates tremendous momentum through-out this six hundred page book.<br /><br />His observations of society through these different class groups are astute. For instance the detectives are bewildered by the Park Avenue doorman dressed in their Napoleonic regalia rushing into the street to flag a taxi. It is beneath the dignity of upper Manhattan types to do such a lowly activity. He explodes the bubble surrounding each class type. Within the varied encounters Mr. Wolfe illustrates the isolation felt by his characters.<br /><br />His settings - especially the fortress courtroom in the Bronx are well depicted and felt. Mr. Wolfe tells us that the lawyers within the courtroom dare not venture into the surrounding neighborhoods - they even order in for coffee. The deli lunch euphoria at their desks with their plastic containers of ketchup, mustard, relish, mayonnaise... is a contrast with the Fifth Avenue soirees embellished by tables of elaborate floral arrangements.<br /><br />Perhaps the ending is a little too sudden and is somewhat inconclusive. And too some extent none of the characters are particularly likeable - they all seem out to get something - money, women, status. To some extent Mr. Wolfe adjusted his characters in his future novels to make them more appealing.<br /><br />In many ways this is a novel about class cultures meeting and confronting each other - and all this in a New York setting where all is within walking and subway proximity. Mr. Wolfe, as stated elsewhere, captures the \\"carnival of life\\" - New York style.
1451624468|3.0|I'm not sure what his problem is, but unfortunately, mixed in with what would otherwise be a decent explanation of the universe and how things are, and yes WHY they are, Krauss also seems compelled to a) bash religion as a recurring theme, b) present disparaging commentary of famous astronomers such as Hubble, and c) leave totally un-named the famous, Nobel prize winning astrophysicists Penzias and Wilson, the discoverers of the Cosmic Background Radiation (CMBR). Here are his words: \\"One of the many remarkable things about the cosmic microwave radiation is that it was discovered in New Jersey, of all places, by two scientists who really didn't have the slightest idea what they were looking for.\\" That's it, no names.  But he does go on to refer to them as \\"hapless\\" and later to say that David Wilkinson was one of the physicists that should have discovered the CMBR, \\"had they not been scooped by the Bell Labs scientists\\".  I mean that just sounds like simply petty and childish.  The book is reasonably good at explaining things, yet I find Krauss a bit arrogant, self-serving, and unprofessional.  Unfortunate.  I'll take Neil Degrass Tyson over Krauss any day.

You see it all, experience it all, and love every disastrous minute of it.<br /><br />I loved reading \\"The Night Circus\\" as much as I enjoyed authoring the tragedy of \\"[[ASIN:B009VOA556 The Dead Children's Story]]\\" because it invites the reader to believe, for a time, in the same kind of alternate history and plausible magic that one can yet enjoy contemplating both fantastically and intellectually once their youth has escaped.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|First let me say there is nothing about this book that I did not like. I could have given it \\" 5 stars\\" but I am conservative and I was a little picky about the very beginning of the book. I found it a little slow to start. But as usual, with Follett, as the characters developed it became a page turner. He has a way with history that no other author has achieved. I think \\"Pillars\\" was a little better that this, but not by much. I am now looking forward to the second book in this trilogy since I grew up during WWII. Follett is a master painter whose tools of the trade are words and type.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|LOVE IT. Graphics are great. Lots of choices of animals. Easy controls. Hopefully will be playing for a long time.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Connelly is able to keep the reader engaged with his character of John Puller.  HIs second novel with Puller is the Forgotten.  This I found to be a very good look into the Army and its investigative work.
1401937519|5.0|Excellent!! This is one of the best books on what it is like to have a near death experience that I have read to date.  It's extremely well written and easy to understand.  Very powerful in it's delivery.
0763639184|5.0|This book has great illustration.  My daughter loves the colors.  She's too young to understand the story, but I don't mind reading the story which is probably more valuable to me at this point -- I find parents should like the books because they are reading them, too!
0525953590|5.0|I am not well-informed about this topic, but I bought the book for my grandson, who is talking about a career in Astrophysics, and he found it very interesting.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was well written and had interesting young characters. I'm sure anyone who has known, or has been a child with a potentially terminal illness, would appreciate the frankness and humor the characters employ. That said, this still struck me as a YA novel or \\"After School Special\\". A bit of a lightweight.
6300217019|5.0|It was as expected, brand new, in the box. I was glad I was able to find it on line.
1449410243|5.0|I love The Oatmeal! Most of these are already available over The Oatmeal's website, but it's really nice to have your own copy at home and show your support to the web artists that you love!
0802473156|5.0|The book came fast and so far is a really good read.  Has practicle advice that I can see myself using to improve my marriage
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I would honestly say this is the best digital keyboard I've ever used.  It has great theme and customization options, even how how much of the screen it will take up.<br />But what really makes this app stand out is its amazing predictive text.  It monitors your typing style and quite accurately predicts what the next word is that you're most likely to use.  The MOST impressive part is how it can link up to your online accounts like Google, Facebook and Twitter.  It will take your typing data from those sources (even when not on your phone!) to improve its knowledge of your typing patterns.<br />I have now used three different versions of SwiftKey on several different phones and I always come back to it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just read it for the second time and it was still as compelling as the first time. Still love it
B00ATPVA78|3.0|Typically G5 has awesome games, so I didn't hesitate to purchase this one before I'd even started playing it. The graphics are outstanding and at first, the storyline held promise. Unfortunately, good high definition graphics combined with a storyline that only continued to go downhill with each scene, just wasn't enough to warrant this game any more than 3 stars.<br /><br />For nearly FIVE DOLLARS, it took me less then 2 hours to finish one of G5's &quot;Not-Their-Worst-But-Not-So-Great&quot; Games! The story seemed as though it was going to be an exciting one but sadly it became lame &amp; &quot;cheesy&quot; sounding. Having the dialog embarrassingly laden with grammar errors throughout the story, more than likely contributed to thIs.<br /><br />I've come to EXPECT HIGH QUALITY from G5 &amp; don't mind paying their $4.99 price tag because of it. But, the entertainment quality of this game is much closer to .99&cent; or, a buck 99 even. Had I known I wouldn't be receiving the SAME high quality entertainment and, that it would only last 2 HOURS when they typically last 3-4 DAYS, I never would have spent the money.<br /><br />I really hope G5 reads their reviews, listens to their customers &amp; bring back the great games they are so well known for! Games like, &quot;Abyss&quot; is what keeps me coming back for more!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I like that ice/snow level and like to wreak the big metal piggies the pictures are funny too really awesome and funny
B008I43DYU|5.0|For those like me who find a calculator a handy tool to have this is a good basic app to have<br />Had no problems at all
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|My grandson and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was very good. I would recommend it for all ages. Tim Burton rocks!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|One of the best and most thought-provoking books I've read in years. Intricate plot, interesting characters, just well-written! A delight!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Iloved the first movie and ended up buying it. I have to say Expendables2 is just as funny as the 1st so this will be apart of my collection too.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good plot. Held my interest to the end. Very entertaining book. I would buy it again without hesitation. Great author.
B000001FDK|4.0|The product arrived in a timely manner as advertised and the soudtrack itself has been one of my wife's favorites as well as the movie.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Got this as free app but wouldn't pay for it<br />The grand kids love it but you have to pay to advance and I wouldn't pay the extra
1451688091|5.0|At first intimidated by its length, I found this an easy read, one hard to put down. It flows and captures one's interest. Thoroughly puts one in the room during this period of time.
B001RNO7C6|5.0|This shoe just really fits my foot like a glove.  It is the best walking shoe I have ever owned.  It does fit a little more snugly than other shoes but doesn't rub anywhere.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Sure it's entertaining but by far not the best of the series IMHO. Worth watching for sure but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so or purchase it.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Good action flick if you like that genre.  The plot is somewhat plausible, the action entertaining, the acting very good, but the end was disappointing...an end without an end.  Jeremy Renner is great in his role, my favorite movie from the on-screen odyssey of Jason Bourne adventures.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love it can't wait for the next one!<br />I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Greek or Roman mythology.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Got this for my grandchildren but found it was very addictive when trying it out Fun for young and old
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wow didn't expect the surprise with aunt Helen this book made me shed tears and smile at the same time.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|great movie! quality was fantastic and delivered without issue, would highly recommend it.<br />i used a roku box to have the movie delivered to my HDTV at my vacation property.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Was here on time, the albums cover is Great!! the Best is in side!!! Sound is Great, Can't not said enought about it
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Before taking up and read the book, be reminding yourself that you are going to read a novel, instead of a pure technical book with an animal cover.<br /><br />The book is about a journey that Bill, the VP of IT Operation has gone through, in refining the software delivery process. Myself, together with a lot of those working in this fields, will find the scenario very familiar. Hard deadline that cannot be missed, dev burning nights of midnight oil and released a broken build that ops had it deployed and fire fighting every single day.<br /><br />The author has given insight on how to work this around, through &#34;the 3 ways&#34; so to speak. Which personally, I think it works very well in resolving the issue. And since it is written in the form of a novel, the author can illustrate each of the steps taken, as well as pitfall that shows up with vivid scenario. Also, resolution are also provided so that we shall know what to do when we are sitting in the same boat.<br /><br />I am quite familiar with the DevOps motives and thus, would find it very useful if some more depth on how to execute the resolution is provided.<br /><br />If you have been riding on the DevOps movement, you will enjoy the novel like reading your own diary. For those who would like to introduce this approach to your company, buy a handful of this book and give it to your supervisor. It's much easier than pitching the project yourself!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just like the other two books in this series I couldn't put it down! It's a great story that keeps you till the end.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|It was okay, but not his best. You should not take my comment seriously because you might have a different comment. You should buy the book
B008TRUDAS|5.0|The main characters are extremely believable. The transition of dynamics from each separate character was effortlessly done and executed. I loved how easily the author made you feel the pain Lake went through and her falling in love with Will. I loved her best friend and the rest of her clique.<br />After reading Colleen Hoover's other book \\"Hopeless\\", i knew that this would be a good read too. I love her MA stories however it would be even better if it was geared for +25. Ill be 30 this year and would love to read something more towards that age gap.
B000QJM8Z0|4.0|This book was read by my book club in 2012.  We were able to discuss Bridget's constant need for approval and her unending struggle with her weight and what that said about her and about our society.  The structure of this book as a diary was also interesting.  Some of us liked it, and others definitely did not.  I would say that the constant calorie counting was tedious and made me think about why Bridget was so obsessive over this and yet so unhealthy overall in her food decisions and how those polar extremes could coexist.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This film was produced on a relatively (compared to Dark Knight Rises and Avengers) low budget but is still a beautiful rendition of a virtually unknown comic book legend. Much like it's predecessor that featured Sly Stallone, 'Dredd' also features a storyline loosely based on a story arc from the comics. This film is grittier and a little more grounded than the more over the top and campy 'Judge Dredd' while still maintaining the spirit of the title character. For me it is one of the best films of 2012.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|This book was hard to read-you wanted to see if you could help the parents see what was actually going on with their teenagers-you just never know what is going on in someones mind.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked it so much better than the movie... the details of everything are just so much more clear. Awesome
1449410243|5.0|I got this in my stocking and loved it. I'm a huge cat person and it was ideal as light reading on the flight home. I've read it over and over. It has a poster inside that you fold out. I'm not sure where I would ever use that. Maybe in the garage? I'm past the poster stage of life. Anyway, it's hilarious. I read parts of it to the family and everyone laughed. Typical people like it, young cat ladies will freak.
B004HYDM0A|3.0|Good movie about a current topic, that's about it though - about midway through you see the end coming and it's just follow through from there.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I really don't know what i purchased from facebook/from amazon but like both, always liking stuff on both i've read, bought or aquired in various ways. Since I don't know how this came about I am only giving three (3) stars.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Book was good and well written. I didn't care for the graphic killings, maybe because I didn't expect them from the beginning. Pi is extremely likeable and you root for him all the way through the book
B0015F1VY8|5.0|Very insightful into Elizabeth and the time she lived in and the life she had to live.  Cate Blanchett was fabulous.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'll have to admit, I was skeptical about a youthful Kirk and Spock, but they did a bang up job.  Excellent visuals, solid story (ok, someplaces are hokie), and I did like the acting.
B004MPESSY|4.0|Not for kids, or for most adults for that matter. Its good that these guys only make movies like this.<br />good shipper
B003E6YBG6|5.0|This is an excellent CD if you like BO music. It contains 18 of his hits, and I like all of them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is such an amazing show that I feel I have to patiently await each episode. It was worth the 2 dollars to watch this episode until I can see the next. Don't want to get too behind! I'm sure I will be using amazon prime to watch it again. So glad it's available there. :)
B0052U59F4|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. The dynamic between Steele and Anastasia is riveting and exciting. A highly recommended read.<br />Sexual and gripping.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought that this game was a blast and you learn how to take care of a horse. I have had a fun time around horse and this helped me learn how to treat them.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|It was really cool, man. Real cool and stuff. Real cool. I thought that Catfish was real cool. Would see again, man.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I love these headphones as far as sound, comfort, wireless, etc but the deal breaker for me is win 7 64 bit incompatibility.  They randomly cut out.  I've tried multiple ports, software, drivers and still can't solve the issues I am having.  Many other people have the same problem and it appears that Logitech doesn't care.  For that, I recommend a different product.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a free download! And you have 101+31 games you can play! What can I say but love it you can't ask for any more cause it's the best!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun but it could be better. it looks real and its kinda adittive but i think it could be funner and its hard to get more gems
B00003CX8N|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and one that no one I speak to has ever heard of.  It is a lovely, heart-warming, true story based on the written correspondence between an English Literature-ophile (ok, so that's not a word...) and the people in the London bookshop from where she buys her books.  (The American is Helene Hanff, a script writer for tv, broadway, and the movies, including the Ellery Queen tv series, as well as an author of books...she's a fascinating character, on her own.)  As you follow the letters, you also follow post-war history in the US and Great Britain, with captivating details that one would probably not learn about otherwise. It is hard to explain, but you will smile, laugh, learn something, have your interest piqued, and cry, some. Every single person I've cajoled into watching this (and I truly mean every) has loved it.
B004JOCU2O|5.0|You would think this Movie would be boring but its not it has a morale store to it if you paginating.I have recommended it to family and friends.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I watch a TV show and movie. It worked (over my wireless) flawless. I could even turn up and down the volume with my phone. lots of watching options, and can stream from your network. I did get it free, but I sure would have paid for it.
B003JBHQP4|5.0|This little Reader does everything I want it to; most importantly it is steady and reliable.  I'm ready for any and every kind of card with this reader.  it works great!
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS NEW SHOW, SO I HAD TO GET IT AT A SAVINGS...JUST IN CASE. I MUST SAY WITHIN  3DAYS IT WAS IN MY MAIL. IT WAS ALSO IN EXCELLENT CONDITION....IM VERY GLAD I STOP FEARING ONLINE SHOPPING  WITH AMAZON.. GOOD ..........GOD JOB..<br />GOOD SHOW TOO.
B0061QD88S|5.0|Regarding the issue I had with Team CoCo, has been resolved. Team CoCo made good on returning my full payment with a bonus. I would like to thank them for there quick and courteous response. It was great dealing with them and I hope in the future I can expected the same with all sellers I deal with. I would likely do busy with them again.
0374533571|5.0|I purchased this book on Sunday at the local store and I have to say I love it so far, I am reading it every second I have down time. I cannot wait to see the movie!<br />Pat Peoples has done four years in a mental health facility that he calls 'the bad place' he doesn't realize at first he was gone that long though, through out most of the novel he believes that 'apart time' from his ex wife Nikki will be over soon and keeps bettering himself so Nikki will be impressed. Along the way he meets Tiffany who has some issues of her own, I am not completely done with the novel so I can't tell you much more but I like the fact of being in the mind of such an unstable character. He keeps trying to do good but slips up and doesn't understand why, he is a highly flawed character but so are we all as human beings.<br />This book I am only halfway through with but it is already in my top ten favorite books!<br />Pick this book up before watching the movie you won't be disappointed!
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|Extremely interesting and valuable book on the subject, but it does go into to much detail on periphery issues. I would even go as far as to say the 30% of this book felt like padding.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think it's one of the best books I've ever read in 3 years everybody should read it it's the best.
0385535147|5.0|Can't get enough of Grisham. If he writes it, I read it. Have all of his works- bring it on.
B008OTTX6G|3.0|The first time I heard Michael Kiwanuka on Spotify, I was completely engaged.  The music is heartfelt and sincere, warm and inviting, even if a little contrived and retro at times (but of course, this is a part of its charm).  For this reason, I thought to myself, this would be perfect on vinyl.<br /><br />Bad choice.<br /><br />The quality of the LP is noticeably inferior.  It is a flimsy record that came warped right out of the sleeve.  Even the sound quality is poor.  Instead of the warm glow of classic R&B, this sounds like nothing but a scratchy mess.  Seriously, did this come off the back of a cereal box?<br /><br />So...<br /><br />Great album!  Definitely four, if not five stars.  It should be perfect on vinyl.  Due to inferior manufacturing, it's not.  The quality of the vinyl itself is less than one star.  I give it three stars simply because it is such a nice recording.  Don't even bother with this one on wax.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|it was just an amazing movie! i think i will rent it again in the future. It made me cry :,(
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|If you like Clancy's Jack Ryan books, you'll love this.  Jack Ryan Jr. needs to develope a little more personality.  He is a bit of a people pleaser, although he's always getting into trouble.  We just about have WW III here, and it's cyberwar.  Clancy has his ear to the tracks of the modern world, and is able to bring us along for the ride.  I could not put this book down.  Many great characters.  Buy it!

B007V65R54|5.0|I am going to sound like someone who thinks Nate Silver is a god and much more. Rather I would say that he is an intriguing and beguiling writer who gives us all sides of forecasting and predicting. I was amazed at how much I learned that was counter intuitive to what I thought to be logical and reasonable. But I will tell you this. Diehard Republicans will never read this book. They will wait for the hootananny from Karl Rove and Dick Morris, who were the laughing stock on election night. I think Nate Silver is a national treasure and I highly recommend that those who want fair and balanced, read The Signal and the Noise.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This is a fun game with several different pinball screens to keep from getting bored.  Really like it.  The color and sound make it feel real and with my tablet I can play it anywhere.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a overall amazing game I have had no lag wat so ever and the graphics are really good considering that this is on a tablet
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a Stephen King fan since his first book, Carrie. This is one of my favorites after a few disappointments.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|An amazing film of another time that is unlike anything else..love, sex, community, forgiveness. Unsentimental and funny at times and true to what it is.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is probably the best ever series ever!  Such great acting!  I would highly recommend this, in fact, I bought it for my daughter for Christmas.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|When I first read DeMille (and I have read all his books) I thought he was a smart ass. Then I realized he was smart without the ass. For me, as a counselor, I need to laugh as well as be intrigued, which is the case when I read Nelson. I hope he never dies and never stops writing. And I am not related to him and no one paid me to write this review. It was with my pleasure to light the fire beneath those who do not know Nelson DeMille and his books.
B001EC3JME|3.0|this says it fits all sizes and i originally got it for a triple c battery flashlight;<br />but that light was too big;<br />i use it now for my small maglite and that works very well, better than the maglight holster that comes with the flashlight since this holder grabs the light, so the light doesn't fall out as easily
B000DWMN2S|5.0|It was such an interesting story line. Of course it was a little exaggerated, but I was interested the whole time. I loved the music, the plot, everything. I don't watch movies over and over again ever, but this one I watch all the time.
0307887898|4.0|I summarized the book into a 2-page &#34;How to&#34; guide for the 1st year of a startup project -- Eric wrote a great book, but I think he could have cut out a significant amount of repetition to speed up the read and let us get back to implementing the ideas sooner.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I love this book, a page turner, hard to put down! I love reading books set in the early 1900's and that bounce back & forth between the past & present.
0783240236|5.0|What can you say, a classic movie by a venerated director. Oddly hard to find anywhere but online. suspense and action without nudity.
B009186E3O|5.0|The Rolling Stones before they became The Stones. Of all the 50th anniversary stuff that has ben released, including the vinyl box sets and what not, this has real historic appeal especially if the 60's era of the band is your favorite. Audio is very good and the blu ray is great for what it is. Remember this is 1965 and the film is 16mm so don't expect a Lawrence of Arabia type of restoration. Add in all the bonus stuff and the vinyl  and you have 1 pretty good super  deluxe set.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|ONe of the best book to read if you are having problems in getting used to something or changing something in order to become more productive.
B00782O7IY|5.0|This was such a good idea! It was such a good story and it reminded me of the innocence and sweetness of older movies. I wish all movies were this good still.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My 5 year old son loves this cd. He'll listen to it for long periods of time. Cute tunes! I find myself singing the songs too.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I am not usually into all the sex in a book, but good story line made for a decent book.
B0001I561E|4.0|My nephew loves this movie and it's in the vault so I had to buy it used.  It ran perfectly.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is addicting and trains your brain for different puzzles.It is very exiting and you will never let your device go.
B008TSVZHM|5.0|Works as advertised, arrived i great condition,packaged securely no complaints. Waiting for more variations or styles. This will be just for the android devices..
B009KHDT0C|1.0|It was not funny, it was weirdly sexual, and the story line was not good. I would not recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The acting is great, the story line is interesting and all of it is very entertaining! Watch all of the segments, starting with the oldest to get to know the characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in two days - couldn't put it down.  Very good story with twists.  Definitely became emotionally involved in this story.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was fast paced and entertaining and the story was very original. The ending however seem kind of rushed. I kept just thinking: Is that it? I guess I wanted more. I will definitively read another book from this author.
B000H1QYXY|5.0|I love anything George Michael.  My father and I share the same taste in music, and have always had an affinity for this man's talent.  This was a gift for my Dad, and he loves it.  Nothing like throwing in a 'best of' on those days that you want to feel a little nostalgia.
0618918248|1.0|This man is delusional. He is very intelligent in his field of science; however, when it comes to philosophy he is not intelligent at all and thinks in a steel box. He feels he must stand for what he has said previously and makes every attempt to prove it for the reason of pride. Try talking to a intelligent religious theist philosopher with the points Dawkins brings up in the book. The intelligent religious man will absolutely prove Dawkins arguments faulty with logic. He is angry in this book and this book actually turned to to theism. There are many ignorant Christians, but talk to the intelligent ones for logical answers. They have them. Be willing to search and not rest in ignorance and skepticism about religion after one bad experience or unknown answer. Do not settle with only seeing one side.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I loved this book for about the first two-thirds.  The relationship that develops between the two high school students, Holder and Sky, is steamy and fun.  Without ruining the book for those who have not read it, it turns out that the life Sky thought she had was not necessarily true.  Further, Holder knows more than he has let on.  I enjoyed the writing and the character development.  The revelations and the way they play out  are way too unbelievable, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Very entertaining. Writers and actors do a great job!  Must be watched from the beginning to get into the story and know the characters.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Great read for Agent Pendergast fans!  Preston and Child continue to deliver and not disappoint. I look forward to their next joint adventure!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is a hilarious romantic comedy full of endearing and memorable characters that you will quote for weeks to come! I laughed outloud many times!
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|Kinda \\"dark \\" for a band called Lumineers. Was expecting more upbeat after loving \\" ho hey\\" . Interesting but not something to listen to daily.
B00338QENI|4.0|Interesting read.  I thought some parts were to in depth for me, got a little boring.  However her story was amazing, I'm glad it was told.
0345803507|1.0|First off...all of these books are sooooo poorly written that even the \\"mommy porn\\" value is a total miss. I mean really, it's all so darn predictable and if you watch enough movies, tv, and read here and there...what goes on here is not shocking. I mean, I was expecting to be floored with all of this stuff by book 3, but instead it became so freaking boring that I found myself just skimming over all of their escapades...regardless of the setting and the toys. Just enough to see what they were doing and using, but not much more since Ana's growing comfort with these things and Christian's evolution were obvious conclusions as soon as you saw the direction of things in book 1. i.e. the second Ana decided some of this was hot and the second Christian modified his ways for Ana...you knew it would head this way. So the development of the so called erotic storyline is a TOTAL JOKE. My friends and I are all shocked that so many women are so riveted by all of this.<br /><br />I had the hardest time getting through this book as well because the writing went from bad in book 1, worse in book 2, to \\"I can't believe someone actually published this\\" in book 3. I mean the author is a HORRIBLE writer. My friends encouraged me to pick it back up just so I could get a good laugh at how bad it gets. I wasn't embarrassed to read these books b/c of the sexual content...I was ashamed to be reading something written by such a sub par writer...one that's making million on such drivel. I've read better erotica from novice writers in adult magazines...even those had better storylines and more fun \\"play\\" time passages.<br /><br />This book went in fast forward in all the wrong areas and lingered over the most riduculous story lines. The little blurbs at the end bothered me even more than the awful book itself. It all felt like things the author just wasn't intelligent enough to work into the story, so you just got her little leftovers since she felt they were important but failed to figureout how to write them in. I just kept thinking...your rushed ending was bad enough...why make it worse with this? Just never good when an author can't see that awkward jumps in time weakens the story.<br /><br />I really don't think you need to read this book unless you're curious about where the Jack Hyde story goes (and even that is laughable). The rest of it is so predictable, repetetive, so far fetched it's hard to care (Cinderella is a more believable story...and that involves magic and a fairy godmother!), and often meaningless that you'll curse the author for wasting your time.
6305428387|3.0|I choose this rating because the movie is great but the movie came later than the date it was supposed to come.
B005I2YL4G|5.0|It works despite what is thought about it and it is faster as well. It is very dependable to say the least despite its cheaper construction.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I love the way Mcewan writes but am having trouble finishing the book. It may be my  fault, not his. I am having problem with the characters of the book. I don't know if I will finish it. Being of a certain age, I do not waste time on things that are not 100% satisfying to read.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This is symphonic metal at its finest!  Sharon's voice is wonderful and the guitar riffs are excellent!  This is one of the very few albums that we have enjoyed every song on it.  You won't go wrong with this CD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is is a good app because in some ways sometimes, this app is teaching you how to take of a horse. I love this app. ;)
0765325950|5.0|I really liked this book, though it is not without its shortcomings. The entire book is essentially one long battle, and frankly that's a good thing because Sanderson excels at that type of writing. I found it hard to put down, the pace moves fast and even when you come to the occasional section that isn't that good it passes quickly to something better. Despite what some people have complained about on here I think Sanderson did a good job completing these last few books.<br /><br />That being said Sanderson's touch on this book is easy to spot at times. I read a review on avclub.com that put it well \\"The characters act the same as they always have... until they don't.\\" There are a few parts where all of a sudden Rand or Mat act entirely different then you would think they would. While these parts can at least be funny they do pass by quickly and if you don't like them then don't worry they are few and far between and go by quickly.<br /><br />I'm satisfied with the ending given in the book. Building this event up over fourteen books was just setting itself to some disappointment but I don't think Robert Jordan could have done better. As it stands it's good. Personally I would have enjoyed a Harry Potter style rap up at the end to see where all the characters end up, but its not necessary and I can't say it takes away anything.<br /><br />Over all it's a great book!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It fits perfectly and does not give that bulky heavy feeling.  The price is great after comparing to other Cases. Pleased.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Does such an amazing job integrating the media on my Nexus7 with my AppleTV through a seamless AirPlay connection.  Highly recommended!
B006K1C0MO|5.0|I won't repeat what everyone already said about this album and Gojira. Pretty much all of their album releases have been solid gold. Worth every penny.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great game but lacks instructions or guide to every aspect of game. would like to know what the golden egg gets you when found;
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a game that I would recommend to all ages. It ia good for the mind and is good for younger kids.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good airplane book.  Although predictable, it was entertaining and kept my interest going.  I would definitely recommend it for those individuals who are looking for an easy read.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|flowing plotting without action pieces or entertainment value and truly anti climactic. I have come to expect more from Liam Neeson movies but now I know to set the bar a little bit lower
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Great movie start to finish. If you've enjoyed any of Wes Anderson's previous films, then Moonrise Kingdom is a must see.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|App so far works pretty well. It is a bit slow but that may be more to do with my home network. I was a to stream pictures to my new 55 inch samsung led tv. It couldn't seem to find the video on my phone to stream though. Not sure if fault of App or if I am doing something wrong. Also couldn't stream music
1439181780|5.0|I think that everyone should read this book. It focuses on Loving ourselves, others and our circumstances. This book would be beneficial for anyone looking to become better and bless the lives around them.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read, I got so caught up in it I didn't see the hours pass I read it in less than two days, wish I was Abby haha
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a well written book about the redemption of a man, women and a marriage.  It looks at how we react to the little tragedies in life and whether we turn inwardly or reach out and what this brings to the relationships we have.  Harold Fry is capable of love,  he is just not capable of showing it.  As Harold sets out to walk the length of England he meets strangers who teach him how to love unconditionally.
B000PKX2KA|1.0|I bought it, it didn't work. I used their driver, it didn't work. I wrote my own driver, it didn't work. I figured mine was defective but guess what, it works fine on Windows XP.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A must read book.  Very difficult to put this book down.  I had devoured it in 4 days and only read while working out at the gym.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Sigue completando una de las mejores sagas, de espionaje y accion, para mi lo maximo, y espero la continuacion, sigan haciendo cosas asi
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!!!  But I wish it had better wii fi though.  But I still love it beacause I have always wanted my own horse and now I can pretend that I do.
B005I6EU48|5.0|We got this cover for my son, who is a book NERD & he absoutley loved it! Great cover for the Kindle fire!

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really like this clock it wake me up right away.And I cant believe that you can use your music to wake you up its pretty awsome
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|Not that we're stalking you or anything.<br /><br />Yes, they are. But that's ok, because I love listening to di.fm and this lets me listen to it on my Kindle Fire. The app saves your favorite playlists in a convenient one-two click system to jump between channels.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Every disc was at perfect condition! Value for money! Total worth it! I am sure that in the future i will make again an order.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|i love it, it was good music...I totally want to get the movie when i can.  Such an awesome soundtrack
142313494X|5.0|Hello, my name is Sebastian. I am a super big fan. I cannot wait until the movie. However, I agree with some other writers. The books need more love between Percy and Annabeth. One of my ideas for the movie is that there should be more movies ,each one based on one of the books. And in the last one please put some more love in it,especially with annabeth and Percy. Anyway I simply love your books. My favorite characters are Nico,annabeth, and Percy. I sometimes pretend that I am a son of Hades. The thing I like best about your books is the action and love. Please write back to me if you can. If you cannot then don't bother. But please take my advice
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I got this app because  my bff had it and now...... I LOVE IT! It's so addicting. And Ella is my bff and if your reading this..... HI!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book... wow I couldn't put it down not even for a minute. after reading the second and then this one I couldn't believe all of what happened, it got to a point where I was like \\"I can't read this anymore\\" or I actually started crying in a couple places. This book was very emotional for me. But overall very good.
B00860YICC|5.0|The Legend of 1900<br />This is an Amazing movie!  Fantastic music, incredible story, great acting and beautifully produced.  Well worth watching.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it and y'all need to make more books<br />Love the book and I loved all of them that I've read
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It is my favorate game but it crashes a lot. Steals your tokens. which is very frustrating . But yes I still play everyday or atleast I try. But hopefully they fix it at least return your credits when it happens.

B00846REIS|4.0|If you liked 50 shades you'll love the crossfire novel. Just read the second book and can't wait for the final book!!! Wish they would release it earlier then May.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|Just FYI, when you're ordering, the sizes to choose from say they come in men's sizes, but they are in fact women's sizes. I ordered a 6 because I wear an 8 in women's but it came and it was a 6 in women's. on the plus side, it shipped incredibly fast. I ordered it Monday and it came on Tuesday with two day shipping.
6302054974|1.0|I was getting into the film it was my first time watching it... But... After playing 19 chapters it stopped playing... It was only a one sided disk. I tried to flip it over just to make sure they didn't invent some thing where I can play it on a colored DVD side. Once the kid gets shot after being shot in the foot I get screwed. It is just that I bought a cheep 15 dollar Scorsese collection of good fellas, aviator, mean streets, and the departed? I'm slightly pissed. Bearly even one hour of film.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I tried to find a game that will be somewhat similar to mario brothers and I read about this one and so I gave it a try. I am hooked on it since day one. I definitely recommend it!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Loved it was the best series that i have ever watched. Love the crime solving and romance. A must see series
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|i love this show and have seen all the seasons and this one will have you in tears by the last episode
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Believe the hype.  Journey is a masterpiece.  Keep in mind however it literally is only a couple hours long.  Those couple hours were awesome.  My wife played this multiple times in one sitting and had lots of fun helping out other players.  Flower and Flow are a bonus.  Flower is good Flow not so much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so fun I keep playing and playing and I told my friend to get she said,okay shesh lol but seriously download it...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't been a Stephen King reader for a while, but read this on a friend's recommendation. I found the book to be very entertaining and enjoyed it throughly.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it!!!<br />An amazing book could not put it down.<br />I have recommended to everyone I know men and women alike!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|this was a very funny movie. we laughed through the whole movie. this is a must see for the kids
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn is always good.  Doesn't get too involved with the minor items and keeps you waiting to get to the next page
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Glad I read this, more content than the  movie. worth reading... if whole book was a movie it would have been twice as long.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This movie may not be ground breaking (as per NYTimes Review).  Certainly not in a worldly sense,  but it is absolutely soul breaking.  Healing families.  Preparing cadavers is much a martial art, just as the art of tea ceremony.  Departures is a timely movie. Encoffinment is, as are many other traditions, a dying art in Japan.  For a terrific plot summary see wikipedia.<br />An original review by Ann Marie Grumm, Children's Librarian
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I saw this advertised as a movie and thought it looked good so I decided to read the book. While this book is fantastic, it is also perpetually sad and filled with heavy topics that I was not expecting in the least. This book made me cry, made me smile, and made me fall in love with it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Easy  game for a quick break.  Dont  have to use  web to play, and can  sit in any room.<br />Grandkids . can also use it  easy.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|All of Clancy's books are well written But he puts so much in to them that there is a lot of pages that could simply be torn out.  Too much explenation about a weapon or a country.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have never read a book from a dogs point of view before.  It was a story that may have been lukewarm had it not been though a dogs eyes.  Being a dog lover myself, I now look at my dog and chuckle.  Can he really be having such thoughts in his head?  I hope so.  The story follows the dogs life from puppy hood through death and it intertwines with the life of his master and  family.  Saying that, it sounds dull, but it wasn't at all.  Some spots may require Kleenex if you are so inclined to be soft.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found Building Your Book for Kindle informative and easy for a beginner to understand and implement.  I recommend it for every beginner.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Love to have this on my son`s tablet,Thank you so much for this addition,this shows that you really care.Thank you!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|A welcome change  of  view . when the addaction to keep playing  hits.<br />Thanks  for the enjoyable  break . in  a busy  life.
0345529057|5.0|The series is great and you cant beat the price for the 4 book bundle.  The pages are a bit small but no big deal.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Interesting twist on classic time travel paradoxes. King is a great storyteller even if this is not a typical scary story.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|Cornwell is still one of my favorites, however in Bone Bed, Marino was left out a lot of chapters and I kept wondering where he was until the end of the book when he became part of the stosry again.
B000ZM7VVO|4.0|Unlike some of their later albums (which are also good) this one has a lot of irish influence which sets this apart.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies. A fun movie for children and safe for them to watch. great for the imaginative child or adult.
B003CH9PTU|4.0|Season 1 has gotten me curious.  I wouldn't say I'm hooked but I am curious to see where this show goes.  On to season 2...

B004LSJCJM|5.0|Joe is one of the greatest blues guitar players and singers around. Awesome player and write, must have for blues fans.
B003CHGV74|5.0|I liked season 1 enough to watch season 2.  Now I'm &#34;all in&#34;.  Season 2 has me committed to watching the entire series.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I honestly loved this game. I played everyday and had so many characters. As soon as the game recently updated, I opened it up and it crashed my whole Kindle Fire. It has not turned on for a week and I have to get a replacement. It is nice to know, though, that on my new Kindle Fire I am not allowed to have all my game data. So I will lose all my progress and have to start over. Gameloft: PLEASE make some sort of sign-in so we can easily get all of our information back.
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|Good news and data, but too much fluff and not enough substance. You would think a mobile app would adjust margins when displaying so you can read the whole article without scrolling. Very average!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So much easier to navigate eBay through the application instead of through network Internet. I highly recommend this app for anyone that frequents the shay world.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|This has the best car chase in movie history...a must have for any car guy and car chase lover, love it.
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you like Rocky you can't beat this all in one Blue Ray collection. While not what you would expect from a true High Definition movie, it is significantly better that the old DVDs.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Oscar Wilde is...Oscar Wilde. Modern readers will chuckle at some of the man-man interactions and physical descriptions. Nonetheless, worth it for a free kindle book.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is related to all past seasons like Christmas, year of the Dragon, etc. It is an awesome game. Is one of the rovio' s best games &iexcl;Download it now!

0525953728|5.0|Great fast service great product Would order again anytime from this person very easy to work with. Loved book and would order more like it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I just know this season is leading somewhere great...(it is right) due to the fact that the Governor is boring as hell..and in a world where\\"live men\\" are getting scarce Andrea just so happens to fall for another psychotic. Horrible in her \\"last man alive\\" booty conquests. On the upside sniveling, whining, Lori is gone so that's a plus. Looking forward to the outcome of this season. It started off powerful...dried out...yet I believe we will see a new upswing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Like this a lot interactive but not demanding. Good for most ages and for all who can not have a real horse. WATCH OUT PARENTS may cause those that are horse crazy to want the real thing<br />.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I find reading about the heros of world war 2 very interesting! This account of an incident between an American bomber and a German fighter is a very good read. The authors writing of the German pilots recall of the war for him and his thoughts on the inner workings of Hitlers regeme was, for me, very educational.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|This was ok but nothing to be excited about.  If you have something to occupy yourself while this plays in the background that may make the movie experience better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are great and nothing can beat the price either. I am in love with it. However, I wish the energy would last longer.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|3D Is Awesome~~~~~ watched it 5 times already!!!!! I told all my friends about this movie!!!!! Get This Movie !!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed all 3 of these books. I read the whole series in about a week. They were all great, quick reads.
0307740919|4.0|Toni Morrison's Home is a short intense novel, and a satisfactory read for those who are up to the challenge of spinning straw into gold.  [[ASIN:B005FCX4VA Read the full review and more book reviews from AALBC.com on your Kindle Edition]]
B005G5PPGS|4.0|It's a shame the big market teams and media can't accept they had been beaten by a master mind. Actually several master minds. Would have been nice to see them win a championship. Let the big markets keep blowing their money. And inflating their egos.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Love all these movies.  Bought it as a gift for my fiance. Glad to finally own it. Definitely a good purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Graphics are amazing, and this game is very interactive. The horse is very realistic, and the gaits are pretty well simulated.
3037783133|5.0|Every page is stunning. If your life involves any bit of flowers and arranging, do not hesitate to get this book showing the work of a remarkable man.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|Why would anyone want this game where the object is to kill everyone?  This is what our world does NOT need!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Authors from that era wrote with a style that doesn't seem to exist anymore.  I always enjoy reading old books.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Just doesn't work. When I try to use the app it does nothing. I have a Motorola xoom running jelly bean.
031250926X|5.0|She requests us to read this to her multiple times daily. She is asking me right now, in fact. The sliding pieces seems pretty sturdy too.
B003R50FRI|5.0|I first bought Shantaram 5 years ago and attempted to read it 4 times, never getting beyond page 50.  However books, like great teachers, come into your life when you ready for the messages and the story within the pages.  On my 5th attempt at Shantaram, I could not put it down.  Aside from a roller coaster journey that describes life on the run and in India in vivid and accurate detail, there are insights into the heart, mind and soul of a man in search of redemption.  Beautifully written, edge of the seat storytelling, this is a book to treasure.  Keep your highlighter handy too, there are passages you will want to remember and quote to others.  A brick of a book in terms of its size, this is worth the effort and your time.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This book tops any love story that is put up against it.  For those who haven't read it, do yourself a favor.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|What a great read. Nothing like learning the truth about how appointed officials are never there to help when you need them.<br />Why wasn't Ross Pero elected? He sure knows how to take care of his people.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book . I really liked it . It contains romance, keeps me on the edge of my seat, and has a little darkness.
B002PHVHFI|5.0|You either get it or you don't, but when you do, it's such an amazing album. Don't over think it. If you give it 3 tries and you don't like it you probably should move on and scoff at everyone who does like it. :)
B009K0OTVM|5.0|This show has the addictive factor that makes me crave more \\"revenge\\". The only other show I was drawn to in a similar fashion was \\"Breaking Bad\\".  The actors in this show are incredible including my very favorite Madeline Stowe who portrays Victoria Grayson!  I look forward to every Sunday at 8 p.m.  CST.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is thrilling novel that left me wondering about the lives of Nick and Amy Dunne long after the book ended.  This story has many twists and turns that I did not see coming, particularly with the type of woman Amy Dunne truly is.<br /><br />The end of this book was very controversial in many circles, but I loved it. The part at the very end involving Amy's comment about how she wished Nick \\"really hadn't said that\\" was nothing short of chilling. It was haunting and I felt it made sense when taking into account Nick and Amy's twisted relationship. Considering the evil that Amy is capable of, I imagined Nick to be too scared of Amy to attempt any retaliation or justice. To me, that would not have made any sense and it would not have been satifying as a reader. I also think that Nick felt that in some sick way, that was the kind of relationship he and Amy were meant to have and that they would always be in one another's lives. This ending worked really well from that vantage point.<br /><br />There were a few plot points that I didn't care for, one of which was how compelled Nick felt to stay with Amy because of the pregnancy. While I don't doubt that Amy would have kept Nick's sperm in order to have a baby to use against him later, as she demonstrated she'd go to any length to punish Nick Dunne. I don't recall much in the book, until the end, indicating that Nick was desperate to be a father. That didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />I also didn't love the story line with Amy living in St. Louis and how she chose to get back into Nick's life, but Gillian Flynn even made that work to me, even thought as it was happening, I thought it was slightly ridiculous.<br /><br />Overall a great read and kept me engaged to the very last sentence.
B001USHRCK|5.0|I am an adult collector/builder - Harry Potter, Creator, Indiana Jones, etc.  I find building lego sets to be very relaxing.  This particular set is going to be part of a larger diorama, so to speak, of a holiday/summer fun village.  Sort of like a Connor Prairie in Indianapolis sitting on the edge of a town or city.  Come spend your holidays here -- lots to visit and do.  These sets are practically indestructible - which they should be considering their cost.  However, having seen Legos' factory in Europe on a tv show, I can see why they are expensive.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very well written. Couldn't wait to see what happens next.<br />Never a dull moment. Humorous and a great young love story yet it broke my heart too. A must read!

B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I've always been a sucker for stories with strong anti-heroes as the main character, and after finishing [[ASIN:B00749ZNU2 Gaebrel's Gamble (The Nine Suns)]] by Zackery Arbela, I knew I needed another fix. Then I hit the mother lode, as it were, with the Lies of Locke Lamora. For anyone looking for that old school sword and sorcery reminiscent of Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar, this will certainly hit all the right spots. No noble elves and square-jawed heroes without a blemish on their character here, just thieves, backstabbing and glorious betrayal.<br /><br />To summarize: Lock Lamora is a thief, and a pretty good one at that, doing his thing in the city of Camorr (think Golden Age Venice meets Dickensian London...) Crime in this city is under the control of a mafia-like Don, which has brought an element of order to the once-chaotic streets (an arrangement supported by the powers that be in the city...) But then a new player moves into town, bodies start piling up, and Locke Lamora is forced to embark on a series of wild cons and hair-raising escapades to save his life and those he loves.<br /><br />Picaresque romance mixed with a hint of tragedy and biting social commentary...what's not to like?

B009UMTMKS|5.0|As a traditionally taught bachelors-in-business kind of guy, the message espoused by Startup Owner's Manual was an eye-opening look into startup formation.  Business school curriculum still focuses on management of established firms and places extreme importance on the business plan.  But startups are pre-business plan.  This requires a different type of thought process.  Read it and find out what I mean.
0143113100|5.0|Probably one of the most optimistic, upbuilding books I've ever read. It covers healing both in motor skills and behavioral problems caused in the brain.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book. The characters were amazing. I like how it wasn't just a sweet story. I like the darkness in it that brings Sky and Holder together.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|Given the more expensive choices, this cover does the job nicely.  Good looking, works well and won't break the bank.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|When I need suspense in my life and want to see great plot writers at work, I throw on a Dexter e[isode.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read in one day, at no point did I feel like I could put it down.  Great story and you just become engrossed with the characters.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Because it was a very good movie to watch and I think the warriors were a very cool gang to watch. I'm sorry to hear about your dad passing away. I'm sorry that with it took me this long to take. I just recently bought this movie off of amazon. I just recently lost two people in my life. My boyfriend for 11 years and my mom. So I can imagine what you're going through.
B003ODL004|5.0|My view of Inception:<br />Inception is an excellent CD. It causes the mind to relax and reflect, and inspires thinking and hope in the listner. It was everything that I expected it to be, there is nothing that I can compare it to because it is a one of a kind CD. I would recomend it to anyone.....
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Fun game to play. Easy to play and quick to pick up. Challenging gives hours of fun. I like it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the few apps I have on my carousel. It's super convenient to find out how much juice u have left and the visual is so easy to refer to, too.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I loved the movie! I watched the movie three times that's how great it was. I thought that Clint Eastwood did a great job in baseball. I guess that's because I love baseball. I thought that Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake played a very good role. In this movie Clint Eastwood was a baseball scout and he was using his daughter (played by Amy Adams)to use her eyes for him. He had claimed that the batter was losing his grip on the ball and that's why he has trouble with the curve. He also said that's how he heard the ball. And the person that they get to pitch for the Atlanta Braves is the peanut guy. Who, the batter was making fun of.
B004HX4RT6|3.0|what can i say if you love chess then its a good app, but i would have liked to have seen some skins variations that would have been nice and pvp over network.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Watched this with a friend of mine... Wish it could have been longer.... Great footage of the three and there backgrounds in music...
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I absolutly loved this book. I could not put it down and it was one of the most touching books I have ever read. Nicholas Sparks is a great writer. Such a bittersweet ending.
1419705849|5.0|I purchased this for my nine year old grandson for Christmas.  He loves the Wimpy Kid books and reads them over and over.  He loved this book.
B00913DPW2|1.0|that's the only thing i have to say about this game i just do not like point and click games.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book.....you must read the series.  Very suspenseful and  definitely a page turner..<br /><br />I highly recommend all three books.  Movie cannot be better.
B00139XTG4|5.0|This is a very unusual and unconventional book - something very rare these days, when too many people write and quite a few read thoroughly. After reading Taleb's book I began to see life in a fresh perspective, and I got more reasons to be skeptical about the so-called &#34;experts&#34; in economics and social sciences. I strongly recommend &#34;The Black Swan&#34; to all the people interested in behavioral economics - people who wish and need to get rid of the erroneous assumptions of classical theories about economy, built upon the fictitious character called homo economicus.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|Markers, page numbers, etc are incorrect. Its really a problem when you use multiple devices offline, or somebody changes pages.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|would have more to say about this game but my phone cant support it without burning my hands but it was a blast while i played.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Sweet movie, but It wasnt funny enough to overcome the awkwardness of having to watch them stumble through their sexual reuniting. The ending didn't make up for the cloud of depression that hangs over the entire movie. I guess the $1.99 price tag is a clue to the popularity of this movie. I will take note before watching other $1.99 movies.
B00006ILE7|5.0|I love Mel Gibson. He is a great actor. He has always kept my attention.I had a hard time watching the end of the movie....
B0055SWM08|5.0|This has become my favorite puzzle game.  I like the hint feature although I trying to use it too much
B0096CDG0O|4.0|a fun game you can play any time you have a few minutes to kill good pvp options just to bad its a paid app cause if you didn't get this game when it was free i really don't see myself paying for this game.
B001H5X7JS|3.0|Tropic Thunder is one of my top 10 favorite comedies!  But I was disappointed in the Director's Cut.  The new scenes really didn't add anything new to the movie.  They were more like...meh.  It was crystal clear exactly why they were cut to begin with.  And to even include the scenes where Robert Downey, Jr.'s makeup is running all down his face is just bad.  Skip this one and go for the theatrical version!
B0058YPL66|5.0|Love Once Upon a Time! Now I have the complete first season and can't wait to have season 2. I wish it had more deleted scenes per episode but I'm happy to have what they featured.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|My husband and I are enjoying the series together... Maybe a little bit addicted to it!  Will be sad when it is over
B009JNXK88|5.0|if you miss playing a game as challenging as any megaman game then this is the game we all been missing. cant wait for an update for new levels.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Got this at great price and speedy delivery.  I am saving for myself or a gift.  This game needs more than 2 people so my husband and I don't have opportunity to play much.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I wish I had read this book early in my marriage. I gave this book to my own children once they ventured into serious relationships. Even after 25 years of marriage this book opened my eyes to the reasons why love is so often misunderstood and difficult to keep alive. Read this book and you will find the reasons why your partner is not accepting or feeling the love you are communicating to them. In addition, you will learn how to explain to them your love language and what they do that speaks love to you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am very into this series of books. Couldn't wait to finish and get started on the third one.<br />Will be happy to see the ending. Great depth of character and emotions.  Money well<br />spent haven't been disappointed yet.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|i really love these kind of games that try to capture the difficulty that old school games had would just like to see more levels.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a fantastic book, I highly recommend to anyone especially those who enjoy historical fiction. I couldn't put it down.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It has kept me busy for a while. I am looking forward to the next game. My husband isn't too happy with it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game all the time my brothers and I have a compition over who can do the best.If I were you I would get it
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|angry birds and star wars what else could you ask for. love the fact that the powers that the birds have become unlocked and then upgraded as you play through the levels.
1609611543|5.0|This book is very informative, and easy to understand.<br />Gave it a five rating, I keep going back to it so I can get my mind around it.<br />Recommend it to anyone who has a problem with bloating and related problems to help you understand the problem better.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great read! Kept me turning the pages! Great job Kate Morton. Headed to find another of your books, keep them coming!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I had to read this book for school. I got it very quickly and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B0085YNML2|3.0|not much to say really but its fun for a while cant really complain other then that it doesn't really do anything to make me want to keep playing.
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|I loved the Dragon rider books by Anne McCaffery when I was younger and really enjoy Paolini's books as well. I felt this one was a little slower read than the first two books in this series, which is why I only gave it a 4 star rating. I've seen a lot of people claim that his ideas were too similar to Tolkien and McCaffery. I disagree, I think he has created unique characters involved in a great story. It is a fantasy novel so has many common fantasy themes. I look forward to reading Inheritance next.
B00B19DMUE|2.0|not enough going on drawn out to much. A rather boring movie the best shots are in the trailer .Acing was good though.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|I bought this as a present for a friend.  She was thrilled with her gift and I am pleased with my purchase.
B000JWTX3Y|5.0|I had seen this movie before and thought it was fun to watch. My daughter wanted to watch it but we were unable to rent it anywhere local so we watched through Amazon.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Very dark and a lot of storyline to follow. Plus at almost three hours long it just felt way longer than it needed to be.  Good graphics and nice story but there was an awful lot that I missed because the action was too fast or the screen was too dark.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|was please with the movie. lots of people said it was good but tanked at the movies. it was good.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and it was in perfect condition. The price was great and it arrived quickly.  I'm enjoying it very much. The Christian message is an added benefit. Inspiring!
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|Like I said it won't run on my kindle hd. It starts to load then drops back to the -open- screen.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i love this app use it all the time would highly recommend. This is same app i have on my phone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3<br />Love the setting, costumes and actors. Glamour and intrigue in every episode...can't wait for Sunday's!<br />The lack of violence and blatant sex is refreshing.
B0006J28MI|5.0|I bought this movie for my son and ended up loving it myself!!! go figure I guess that's how it works!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved it. Now I know what everyone is raving about. I watched season 1, 2 and up to current. Eagerly awaiting new episodes.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I didn't even want to finish the book I was so bored. The book never went anywhere it was just very slow!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok solo I was playing this app and I amidetlly fell in love. So you van go around building things in the world. You can also fly so you van get a better view but you can only do that in festive mode. In servival mode there is heart a.k.a. your life. You can die in servival mode. Also on servival mode there is zombies spiders skeletons corpses at night. You have to get your own rescourses in servival mode. There are no monsters in creative mode and it doesn't turn into night time in creative mode too. I hoped this helped.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Like always the movie was good but the book was so much better.  The book contained much more info. and explains the feelings and motivations behind the characters so much better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this series has it all...fabulous acting, intense characters with identifiable human stories, elegant stage backdrops....like a fine story of old that one can get lost in...
B008B3MZMY|5.0|I was not disappointed in this concert. I will watch it many times. Great audio and a great picture effects.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|The plot was confusing and very slow to build.  If a movie doesn't hook me right away, you've lost me.  I guess the acting was okay, but again it was an odd plot with odd characters.
B000UBOS0M|5.0|This album is fantastic. It sounds good through and through, and reveals new layers of complication and ingenuity with every listen. A great choice.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I love this backpack. It feels very sturdy, like it will last a long time. Lots of compartments. You can tell a lot of thought went into creating this. The stuff it pouch and crush proof compartments are awesome.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I enjoy the mouse. its very fast and fairly easy to use.  the one problem I did have is the instruction book for programming it is terrible. i&#34;m not a teck so I cant make heads or tails of it. I was able to program one button by luck.<br /><br />other that that I really like it.
B006RXQ8RI|4.0|Have seen this many times.<br />Awesome Movie. Can't wait to see volume 2 again.<br />We bought the movie and it didn't work so we rented the instant movie and are going to send back the other one.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good read. It is Nicholas sparks so you already know how it will end the minute you start reading it but it still did keep you a little on edge reading it which was a nice change for him. Plus the movie is coming out so many people will be reading it soon
B002DPRLEI|5.0|This movie is too funny for words.  Of course, Doris Day couldn't be cuter.  Tony Randall also makes this movie complete.
141659521X|5.0|This is a great book, as all of the Vince Flynn novels are.  I got it at a very reasonable price, and I purchased it for my son as a gift.
0761163808|4.0|Such a cool book that i bought it immediately when shown the content within. I really like the cool design and excellent pictures of animals. My 4 year old loves the book.
B0098VXE50|2.0|The acting was barely adequate, the story line dropped some key points along the way, elements were introduced that were unnecessary, confusing or pointless, and between the fight scenes, which weren't too awful, it was as if you are waiting for a bus that is late.  An, frankly, Kristen Stewart is not the &#34;fairest in the land&#34; by any stretch of the imagination.<br />If you can see it for free, it will still a couple of hours you will never get back
0765325950|5.0|For those of you who have not read the book, but have decided to post 1 star reviews as a form of \\"protest\\" because there is no e-book until April...really?  I understand your frustration of not having the book available on your preferred reading device - I have some of the same frustration when my favorite self-published authors release only in digital format.  That however, is the nature of the publishing game today so I accept it.<br /><br />I see that greed is stated as the number 1 reason for why this decision was made, which quite frankly is just ignorant.  Authors make far more money from the digital versions than from actual print books.  The reason this decision was made is that RJ's widow Harriet wanted to ensure that the book debuted at number 1 on the best seller lists.  It might be viewed as selfish in your eyes, but so what?  She is protecting his legacy and acted as she felt appropriate.  Whether you agree with the decision or not, it is her right to make this call.<br /><br />Those of you that are raging because you can't have what you want when you want it have larger problems.  You are a generation that received trophies for just showing up, were taught that you were special, and unique compared to all others out there.  Yet you don't understand why you can't get jobs out of college and are living at home again with mommy and daddy.  I'll let you in on a little secret - you are not special.  The world does not owe you anything.  Life doesn't always go your way, and often times just isn't fair.  You need to get used to it, or the next several decades are going to be very painful for you.<br /><br />As for the book itself...<br /><br />Most of the reviews out there do a very good job of pointing out both the excellent story and conclusion to this series, as well as the flaws and shortcomings.  These have been hashed out in detail in previous posts so there is no need for me to retell them here.  There are some fantastically fun scenes in the book (two that jump out at me is a very entertaining and rewarding expansion of the Talmanes character in the prologue and the Rand and Matt interaction when getting Tuon to agree to the treaty), and some plots that I expected to be resolved that were completely ignored (Elaida's foretelling of walking a ruined black tower for instance).  Yes, you can tell that the end scenes were written by RJ years before the majority of the series came out.  Yes, the numbers of the armies and channelers  are off, but it doesn't change how rewarding this ending was.  Essentially non-stop action for 900 pages, an end to an epic adventure 20+ year in the making, and the heart and soul of two extremely talented writers poured out for our entertainment.  You would be a fool to pass this up.
1609611543|3.0|This was purchased as a gift for a family member.  She requested it by title.  I had not gotten any feedback from her.  I think she has been using some of the recipes.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|I like that you can stream content on your phone to your tv via Apple TV.<br /><br />I think it needs more content and content with more bulk to it. There are many clips, but not a lot of full episodes.<br /><br />Needs more content :)
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Rankin's book builds on all the believable characters in his previous stories. He writes with substance and depth which seems effortless compared with many crime authors. Rebus is as feisty, flawed and likeable as ever. Long may the drama continue...
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|After the first 15 minutes it is almost not-stop action. Only during the brief pauses in this action do you realize that it is inferior to the original. It's not nearly as clever, certainly not as fresh, and not as entertaining as the original. That's not to say it's a waste of time, it is a good action flick, just not as good. Certainly good enough for a rental.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is a good novel, if you don't take some of the impossible things that Jack Reacher does too seriously.  This is a fictional character.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed the characters, quickly draws me in and maintains my interest while traveling.  I would read other books by this author.
B009E3EY38|5.0|2 days before XMAS we ordered this set. It arrived on the 26th in time for New Years party. Would recommend to any Led Zeppelin fan.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good book, although a bit graphic at times.  Reminded me of all the old romance novels that I used to read
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun game, and is easily played with a couple of variations.  It does not have an adequate exit point.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy using this product.  I am not sure why I need to use fifteen words to describe my likes and dislikes.
B008SLAXGO|5.0|This book is a masterpiece...excelent paper/photo qualities, and is gold for every Gaga fan....buy it before it get discontinued. ♥ GAGA
B006MW3VC4|2.0|What an utter waste after a satisfying season 1.  Season 2 devolves into a bad soap opera with repetitive, nonsensical, underdeveloped plots.  I don't think I've ever had such a drastic change in opinion of a show.  If you want a good historical drama with complex, compelling, and relevant themes rather than simple soap opera drama watch Deadwood.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not usually my type of book, but a friend insisted I read this, leant me her copy which sat on my nightstand for three months.  I felt bad, gave it back to her, unread and ordered book one on my kindle.  Could not put the book down!!!  Loved it loved it! L
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This was a real eye opener.  I always knew North Korea was a repressive government, but I never knew how bad it really was. They are almost as vicious as the nazis.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|i laughed during this movie. there are some really great parts. i love how the avengers interact with one another.
B0060MYK7G|4.0|As a huge fan of Spartacus, HBO's Rome, Camelot, and other historical dramas, I am surprised that the Borgias doesn't get as much buzz as it deserves. It's definitely one of my favorite shows and is as good as any show I've ever seen in ALL aspects. I'm glad its extended for AT LEAST season 3 and perhaps beyond. I have not SEEN the European version called Borgia and the Tudors but I can PLAINLY say the US version The Borgias is an amazing show that demands to be watched. It's a tad boring in Season 1 but Season 2 is bigger and better in all aspects. The only gripe about the show is that only 9 episodes in season 1 and Season 2 only had 10 episodes they should have at least 13. I'm glad Juan is dead!!! yay!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the entire series, this one however, was a little drawn out, predictable and lacked much of the passion of one and two, but if you have read first two books then you have to read number three!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|It was an interesting read.  Not normally something that I would read, but it was ok.  I am interested in watching the movie now.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|it was just what i was looking for!!!! very happy with this product and it allows me to carry my tripod!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|it wasn't free as I was led to believe and I had to delete another game to get it on my kindle fire. but it's worth it and would buy it again. got that?
B002PJ8AE2|5.0|Fiat car is stylish on the inside & out & the pretty barbie has cute clothes. Glad I bought it.  Granddaughters & their friends love it.  Great addition to the other Barbie cars we have. Glad I bought it.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|I'm a sherlaholic..loved the set and the amazing price..easy to read and love the use of the English in the books
B003ASLJS6|5.0|I BOUGHT THE SERIES OF THREE MOVIE PACKAGE THEY ARE ALL EXELENT!!! YOU CAN WATH EASTWOO GET BETTER & BETTER!!!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Does what it says it can do and does it well. Also a number of extra features that make it infinitely more useful.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|This app may work on some platforms but isn't worth the $0.99 cost if you are using it on a Kindle HD Fire.  I bought it mostly to view Excel spreadsheets and it doesn't even work well with the included test spreadsheet.  I want my 99 cents back!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a can't put down type book... I'm glad she is home where she belongs... and that monster is locked up...
B008YI9CWW|2.0|I have Amazon Prime and for some things it is great. Service and access to movies through Amazon Instant Video is excellent, but I do not understand why there are many videos I would like to see that are not available. I ended up having to purchase this video since it was not included on Amazon Prime and wasn't even available for rent. I did not want to buy it but it wasn't available at the local movie rental store either.<br /><br />It was double discouraging when I went to connect the ipad to the tv and learned that Amazon Instant Video doesn't support this function. So I ended up with a movie I didn't want to own, watching it on a 9&#34; screen. Not real happy about that.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|LOVE the game. Thought it was all free but just found out it isn't and I'm hooked. But with no funds to buy it right now :((
B004J4WL50|5.0|As people saying ,it is inspiring,it is a easy ,quick read . A book you must read. Thank you for sharing your story Blake!
B008US25FW|5.0|I love the songs on the album. Her voice is perfect, and great array of songs. From slow songs to fast pace. Songs that are relevant , such as &#34; je n'ai que Toni au monde&#34; dealing with wives and girlfriend of soldiers returning from battle. I don't know If young folks in early 20's can appreciate it
0307730697|4.0|I want to state up front that I did break my rule to read and review this book. I state under the header of my blog that I will not accept books with swearing in them. However, my husband (who is ex-Navy) read this before I did and based on his and my sister's recommendations I decided to go ahead with this book. The swearing is not extreme (though certainly way more than I like), and some of the worst words just have the first letter and a line to complete the word. That said, I'll move on to the actual review.<br /><br />This is a very powerful book. Adam Brown was a man with many personal demons who overcame incredible odds to eventually become a member of the elite SEAL Team Six. This is a no-holds-barred, brutally honest story of his life--his failures and successes. There is plenty of swearing, drinking, drugs, etc so I would not recommend this book for kids (including teens) without the parents checking it out first. From a drug addict with multiple arrests to an Navy SEAL, Adam lived life full-out. He didn't know the meaning of the word quit. Towards the end of the book someone states that Adam \\"surrendered only once, and that was to Jesus Christ.\\" ...well, except all the times he surrendered to the call of drugs. That part really broke my heart. This couple is supposed to be sold-out christians who know that even though he's now kicked the habit, he'll fight cravings for the drug all of his life. They know that if Adam drinks, his willpower drops and that's when he usually falls to the drug again, but instead of staying away from alcohol, he still goes to bars and partys and puts a one beer limit on himself--which he doesn't always stick to. It broke my heart that some of the awful times they went through could have possibly been averted from staying away from anything that might bring it on. Please don't think that I'm denigrating them or their story. I'm just being honest.<br /><br />The book starts off a litte slow, but certainly doesn't stay that way. No book about this guy could stay slow and boring! He never did anything halfway, but barreled ahead at full speed no matter what the danger was, and it definitely took a toll on his body with multiple injuries, any one of which would have given him a medical discharge no questions asked. Adam, however, refused to quit. He overcame injuries that NO ONE would have thought he could overcome and even stay in the military, but he went on and AFTER these injuries passed the brutal tests to be a part of DEVGRU (SEAL Team Six). An inspiring story that I recommend only with the reservations on language.<br /><br />\\"I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.\\"<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]s guy could stay slow and boring!

B005QUQ99K|5.0|Our son still loves Ninjago. This lego set met all of our expectations~ Great piece to build on his own~
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I was looking for a big book. One that I can enjoy and learn from. I am just starting but already looking up things about history. Starting in the early 1900's and exploring characters from many countries, Mr. Follett's research always amazes me and I enjoy how he can intertwine the lives of the fiction and non-fictional characters...even the ones we know about, For example, at the beginning of the book when the Archduke Ferdinand is at a house party for the King of England in Wales...you know his future is not going to go the way he plans. Looking forward to spending a lot of time with this book and the characters. And the next one is already out!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I love this book everytime I read it. It never gets old. I would rate it at the top along with Pride and Prejudice.
B001F0WXY0|4.0|I put off reading this a long time and finally got caught up to read it. I thought it was a good read, but not as great as some claimed it to be. Maybe the expectation was unrealistic and I would've been better off not having any and be surprised by it. Overall it was entertaining.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This dictionary is what you should read before you read any other books. It's so informative and helpful,and will help you understand what you read better. I recommend this to everyone.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|Its awesome!!! Great vocals and amazing talent!  Kelly Clarkson is the one and only American Idol!! Can't put stop on this cd!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game so much . This game is much fun even my two year old sister like this game.
B009Y6V7XK|3.0|I am not going to totally down this. I give it three stars on the account of the music itself and some of the songs but is it me or is the music as awesome as it is drowning Dani's voice? You can really tell on the song the Abhorrent. I have been a cradle fan for years. I am still a fan. But I noticed the production was like this on the new Dimmu Borgir CD.  So maybe it is Nuclear Blaatn which is a great label otherwise. Just my opinion
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I liked it<br />because it made me know what the definition of a word is.<br />That's why I think that we should all use a different dictionary.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wound up reading the collection in about two days. Engrossing,  and much more than science fiction. Thanks, Hugh, for giving me a new obsession... reading  your books. :-)
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|It was a good movie. Cant wait to see it again. Ill be sure to recommed this  movie to anyone looking for a good comedy
B000001DVD|5.0|This is an all time rock classic...no debate,no doubt. These young Brits threw this sonic bomb across the pond to America and the sonic KaBloom was,well..best keep this g-rated! The dual guitar sound is completely OWNED by the boys,and Mutt's work on every sonic detail lends the drums and bass' bottom precision,absolute perfection.Yet,the vocals are the blu-print for all following hard rock albums for the rest of the 80's. Seriously folks,this is a hard rock master,get a copy-they ARE expensive,though
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I liked this book because it is also a movie.<br />It is also a book I recommend too other kids.
B004GYY714|1.0|Unusable on 1st gen Kindle Fire after December update. Will only force close now. App used to be great. Unfortunate.
B00884GR0W|3.0|ok well like the title says. its a good game but there are a few bugs. for one the game periodically exits while im in the middle of something. also it would help if it save my work before it exited itself
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed this game. The puzzles were just difficult to intregue, and yet not so difficult to annoy. I don't buy lots of games, but i may just buy this one. I'm just afraid I would be sad when I finished.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game! I like this game because it helps me to understand more about how to take care of horses! I want a horse now!
B007SPPANM|1.0|This movie sompetes with \\"Plan  9 from Outer Space\\" as the worst movie ever made. But \\"Plan 9\\" is actually better since that director, Ed Wood, had a vision but no money. Now we have money and no vision or concept. I really can't imagine who \\"enjoys\\" garbage like this unless it's those who think that reality TV is in any way associated with art or intelligence. This film drags on with no purpose whatsoever aside from CGI, diCaprio, and Winslet plus it plays fast and loose with history as well as reality. The acting is bad (at best) and the direction (if you can call it that) is asleep.<br /><br />Far better films (all on DVD) of the Titanic sinking are \\"Titanic\\" (1943 German), \\"Titanic\\" (1953 with Barbara Stanwyck & Clifton Webb), and, best of all,  \\"A Night to Remember (1958 with Kenneth More). These are all much better acted and directed as well as being more accurate.
0765356147|4.0|The Brandon Sanderson style is pretty fun.<br /><br />He writes his characters deep into a hole.  He drives them into the hole, through the ineluctable logic of the situations he puts them in.  Then he goes all \\"Silmarillion\\" on the reader, filling in a bunch of metaphysical and metaphorical back story, thereby deux ex machina'ing their butts out of the hole.<br /><br />In this final volume of the three volume Mistborn series, we find our heroic figures, Elend and Vin, Sazed and Spook, all pursuing their best guess choices, trying to capture caches of supplies, hoping to stumble across a way to save the world that is clearly ending.  Do any of them find a way out of the mess?  Not from their efforts.  Not from their wits.  Not from their skills or wisdoms.<br /><br />From Sanderson's pen.<br /><br />The result is pretty fun, although you may feel manipulated.  I would tell you how, but it would be spoiler rich.  Let me just say that no reasonable person could have figured out what to do next, which means all are fated to either die or fulfill an unwritten plan of the Gods -- or in this case, the author.<br /><br />Yet the fight between Vin and the dozen spike-eyed crazies was worth the 400 pages of sad slogging towards an inevitable ash-filled death.  So, a good read.<br /><br />Now, if he wants to get better as a writer, he might try a plot that builds, instead of making up a bunch of mystical crap that saves the day in the last ten minutes.  All that will get him is a rich contract to finish somebody else's series.. (Wait!)
B005UD1D62|3.0|I love Lauren's work. It's easy to read, it's fun, and I can just switch off and pretend to be rich and famous. Her storylines are believable and her characters are largely likeable. It's not in depth and it's not going to challenge you mentally or emotionally, but it's a solid contribution to the chick lit arena.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book provides closure and ties up all the loose ends. It's the...and they lived happily ever after. Easy read, although I did have to skip through some of the sex scenes as they were too similar, an rd I wanted to get past them and see what happened next to the characters
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I was hesitant at first to try this game because I have been so disappointed by this genre in kindle apps in the past. What a joy to discover a game that not only has it all (hidden object, puzzles, interactive scenes, good graphics and plot) bit it also runs well on this interface. I recommend giving this game a try.
B002P79KAC|5.0|Big Laughs and a great cast make this a fun show to watch.  We are using Amazon to watch the series from the beginning.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game it is so additive  and the fact that iti s free is awesome! i play it all the time
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|This game reminds me of space invaders. I am still getting use to slidding just my fingers instead of a joy stick and buttons. I will like it better once I get use to it.
B00913DPW2|3.0|I do like the idea of this game, kind of a scavenger hunt trying to figure out what has happened, but it is way too intricate a story/game for the amount of time I have to put into it.  One day when my kids are grown maybe...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is one of those very rare books that lives with you for a lifetime.  The story of August and his family demonstrates how the petty and hurful attitudes that flavor the reactions of many people when confronted with someone who looks or acts &#34;differnt&#34;, can be transformed into attitudes of caring and protection for the very differences they were once prejudiced against.  This book should be read by every human being of all ages, as the life lessons experienced within the pages have the ability to transform, transcend, and uplift us to a higher standard of life.  The author has not only written a book...the author has written a means to change the face of the human race.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My granddaughters fight over who gets to play it next.  They love it.  So much so that they will both be getting their own kindles for their birthday's this year so they will leave mine alone.  LOL
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing!!  Its so much more descriptive than the movie!  After reading this and seeing the movie I can't wait for more!!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Interesting idea, bad story telling. For example, the story never explains why Loopers must kill their future selves. Why can't another Looper kill your future self? The entire problem would be fixed, but the movie never explains why this answer is not an option. Some of the characters had no real role, i.e. Kid Blue. His character whines a little, screws up a little, and then culminates into nothing more than an awkward shoot-out with Joe toward the end of the movie. How does Sarah go from a completely independent woman, taking care of herself and a disturbed child, to being completely dependent on a stranger? It wasn't good, it wasn't bad. If I had paid the price for a theater ticket, I would have felt ripped-off, but the rental was fine.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a clever and magical book this is!  I was literally enchanted througjhout and had trouble putting it down to sleep and work.  I've told numerous friends about it and after reading, each one without exception, has been just as delighted with it as I am!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Our youngest granddaughter is more thrilled with this one than her sister is.  Her sister likes &#34;Horse Life Adventures&#34; more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really liked the romantic story behind it and it really tells you how for example people with cancer really feel it makes you think about all of these other things and can really  change your perspective on things.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I will never get tired of this one. It has everything in it from action to drama to drugs, betrayal, suspense, and faith. This is a truly inspirational movie and I believe anyone and especially man should watch this.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|I'm sure I'll get a lot of thumbs-down for this (generally favorable) review, but here goes anyway.<br /><br />AMERICAN GODS is reputed to be Neil Gaiman's masterwork, so I was happy to see the Kindle version selling for a mere $3.99. I found the story of a recently-released convict and the declining aspects of various gods to be enjoyable. Anyone who has read Gaiman knows he has a gift for words third only to King and Pratchett. The story is fun, the main character interesting, the plot never predictable, and the final twist deftly handled. Plus, as a native Tennessean, it was nice to see a familiar place as the setting for the final showdown.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />... a masterpiece? Not really. It was clever, certainly, but once you've completed it, you'll start wondering about logical inconsistencies. Why does the ocean make a god spawn another aspect? How does one character manage to be dead-not-dead at the end? Why would the main antagonists get what they were trying to get out of all of this? Why does the main character get the gift he gives away (it's never actually spelled out how/why that happens; perhaps I'm a bit slow at not figuring it out)? It all can be waved away under the explanation of \\"magic,\\" but if you prefer a take that doesn't boil down to \\"because the writer wanted it that way,\\" you won't find it in this novel.<br /><br />To me, the test of a \\"masterpiece\\" is if I'll read it again and again. AMERICAN GODS doesn't meet that test. It's certainly a bargain for less than $4, but I might read it again once (at most) after the initial reading. Definitely worth your money and time, but not something I'd see as living forever on my virtual bookshelf.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I don't have HBO and I have been wanting to see this show for a while since I am a big fan of the books.  Definitely not disappointing.  There is a bit more nudity than I care to see but it is HBO after all.  They stick to story very closely and knowing that the author is involved was reassuring.  If you love the books and haven't seen it yet, buy it!  It is worth it!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down! I gave  it 4stars only because it got a little technical in a few (ha)  places. Good read. If I  ever get stuck on another planet, I would want astronaut Watney on my team!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I starting reading the book based on the publicity it has received. I kept reading to the end to see if a plot would be presented other than 'I want you badly, I want to control you and treat you badly, I want you all the time, again and again!' It became comical as the book progresses where the master's sexual prowess and subject's sexual appetite is continuous and repetitive as they go at it like rabbits.  The ability for immediate recovery to go back at it is humerous when compared to real life situations that could ever be presented. I found myself laughing. The book has depended on the idea of erotic acts, more than the actual use of it, to attract an audience that wonders what it is all about. It was time wasted with so many other better books to read.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Guess I'm sappy, but I like a sweet story.  Loving dogs helps love this story, too.  Easy read.  Since I was a kid, I have liked stories told from the view of the dog.  Wasn't a real tear jerker, but that's okay.  Nothing to deep, but enjoyable read.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Good movie, fun twists and made you think about time travel and implications for impact on future, etc. - other actor good too - glad to have watched it.  Doesn't get a 5 star b/c I reserve that for Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption and movies along that caliber.
B0068THAGY|5.0|This movie has great writing, great acting by a young ensemble cast, and really something for everyone.  I tend to be a sucker for a movie with kids running around doing off-the-wall junk, and this movie certainly delivers.  Other reviews say this is derivative, but I don't think so.  The special effects are certainly worth the price of admission.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game gave me hours of entertainment!  The hints were perfect, the bonus games challenging, but not so difficult that you'd want to skip one minute of fun.  Can't wait for a sequel!
B009ETEEAU|5.0|this camera is great, i got it for chrismas and i love it.<br />it can film 720p or take 5, 3, or 1mp still pictures the mounts are great too.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book is so awful I can't finish reading it.  I can't remember the last time I couldn't finish a book.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|eveb though there is pop up adds to buy gens thus is a great game people who say stuff bad about this game are idiots cause this is one awesome game
0736083863|5.0|I ordered this book for my friend, who really loves pilates and wants to teach it.<br />I read the book myself with her and we both love it. It's very informative and has lots of clear diagrams. The book is also lightweight, it is paperback and is about as big as an ipad.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Finally got to have movie night this weekend.  Although a very good movie the ending left me going WTheck.  Would recommend it tho.
B002N8A14M|5.0|This armband works great! I have used it various times and it has never slipped and doesn't irritate my skin or slip when worn over my athletic jacket! It fits perfectly with my iPod and I can change songs and adjust the volume quite easily! I love it!
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|What a wonderful cd. Listening to Whitney sing makes you wish she were still here. I purchased this cd to give to a friend. They are not disappointed.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|The movie was very good, though there was some violence.  The movie stopped 4 times while trying to watch it.  The internet would disconnect from Amazon, or Amazon would disconnect from my internet.  I don't know.  I did enjoy the movie anyway.
B00007KWHG|3.0|Shipped quickly, but after opening it and directly inserting it into my CD player, the CD somehow played as though it was scratched. Unfortunate. Don't know how that happened.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is so awesome on so many levels.  It will take you thru a range of emotions I never thought a book could do this
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I found the characters were all a bit cliched. The uptight and unloving mom, the neurotic daughter, the spoiled half sister, the sexy detective, etc. The plot is interesting enough, but nothing to write home about. I would recommend reading Gone Girl by the same author instead. That is a real page turner.<br /><br />I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:<br /><br />Books I love or at at least really, really like:<br /><br />The Last Policeman<br />We Need to Talk about Kevin.<br />Tell the Wolves I'm Home<br />When the Emperor Was Divine<br />The History of History<br />The Remains of the Day<br />We Have Always Lived in the Castle<br />The Night Circus<br />Water for Elephants<br />The Sisters Brothers<br />The Poisonwood Bible<br /><br />Books I REALLY hated:<br /><br />The Bear in a Muddy Tutu<br />1Q84<br />The Buddha of Suburbia<br />A Visit from the Goon Squad<br />Sun Storm<br />A Long Way Down<br />When We Were Orphans<br />The Haunting of Hill House<br />The Fault in Our Stars
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The movie speaks for itself. Not much for me to say. Perhaps just a request to read (and insist that your children read) the books first, so you can appreciate the story and all they were cramming into a movie-length film.
B000002G8N|5.0|This is one of Clapton's lesser known albums from the mid-seventies. He was seriously messed up on drugs/alcohol during the making of this recording (as he was for most of the seventies...we pretty much all were...) yet somehow the album really was not bad. Pretty mellow with some good blues, too. While I wouldn't put this album in the ranks of &#34;Eric Clapton&#34;,&#34;Layla&#34;, or &#34;From the Cradle&#34;, I do believe this album has merit. It's in the lines of &#34;461 Ocean Blvd.&#34; and &#34;Slowhand&#34;. Very good albums in their own way. I do think that almost any Clapton album is better than most of the music produced at that time. He is truly a &#34;God&#34;, and this album didn't do anything to tarnish that reputation.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put down this book like the first one it will take you thru any emotion you can think of.  It will make you want to read more
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|You would think that a story about a teenager diagnosed with cancer would really draw you in and make you care for the characters, but this was not the case for me with this book. I feel the novel is almost like a Judy Blume novel, written for a young audience. I enjoyed reading them when I was a kid, but need something more complex to keep me interested now that I am an adult.<br /><br />I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:<br /><br />Books I love or at at least really, really like:<br /><br />The Last Policeman<br />We Need to Talk about Kevin.<br />Tell the Wolves I'm Home<br />When the Emperor Was Divine<br />The History of History<br />The Remains of the Day<br />We Have Always Lived in the Castle<br />The Night Circus<br />Water for Elephants<br />The Sisters Brothers<br />The Poisonwood Bible<br /><br />Books I REALLY hated:<br /><br />The Bear in a Muddy Tutu<br />1Q84<br />The Buddha of Suburbia<br />A Visit from the Goon Squad<br />Sun Storm<br />A Long Way Down<br />When We Were Orphans<br />The Haunting of Hill House<br />The Fault in Our Stars
B006TLFIAQ|3.0|This movie didn;t do a thing for me,  The ending left me saying&#34; that was it??!!&#34;  Jason Statham was the only reason I wanted to watch this movie, but he was not enough to make this movie worth the 2 hours I spent watching it.  All in all-- a very average movie that I could have done without.
0765325950|5.0|Ties up a lot of loose ends even if it left some to be interpreted.  Considering everything I was happy with the book and though it unfortunately still keeps me wanting more - like a few volumes of lost tails to round out everything or something just extra.... It is an ending but I still hope Sanderson may not abandon it completely now that the main story is finished.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This is the rudest movie I have ever seen I see no reason why there needs to be so much cussing
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really liked this app. this is by far the most realistic horse app I have seen. being a rider, it is nice to see an app that is pretty realistic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it I am sorry that I can't find another game like this:(<br />The Girl who is you are playing the game and I am sorry for singing games and tramp
B00A80SHFM|3.0|i would have given this five stars except for the missing \\"who am i?\\" and fantines death. i can't imagine why those two important songs were not included in a highlights album. and after seeing the film more than once am i thinking there is a bigger version of \\"do you hear the people sing?\\" heck that song is one of the reasons i bought the album!<br /><br />here's hoping they put out a more complete version but i am not  holding my breath.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the game it's a time filler. The price it great and the graphics are awesome. x x x x x
0439813786|5.0|I loved this book. I have read this book to children and encouraged older children to read this book on thier own. The story is wonderful and the pictures are even better. This book grabs the reader by both pictures and story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My friend Jasmine was playing this game on her new smart phone, and couldn't quit playing... She said it was addicting! She gave me a quick synopsis of the game, making me want to see if it was all it was cracked up to be. After I waited for it to download, I immediately started playing it. I couldn't get off for hours until I was to too sleepy to even comprehend that I was even playing it... Sleep surfing! I recommend this app definitely for kids who you can't get to shut up or just need to calm down, because NO ONE can resist the power of SUBWAY SURFERS!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Even if it is fiction, this series will make any decent person very angry that the people who are supposed<br />take care of teach children could do such things
1577311523|5.0|If I had to choose one book to read ever, no doubt the power of now would be my choice. This book has the answers to all questions :-)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Fast and easy read. I have never read a Nichlas Sparks book and was surprised that I enjoyed it so much.
1451695195|5.0|I ordered this book before it was published, based on my having heard Dr. Alexander speak, and having met him over lunch while attending a conference the month before the book was available.  After having read Proof of Heaven, I wanted copies to give to friends and one to lend, so I ordered 3 more.<br /><br />On reading the book, some things that interested me about Dr. Alexander's story were the differences I found between his near death experience and those I've read from so many other experiencers.  No life review!  Interesting.  No memory of life on earth during his experience.  Fascinating!<br /><br />The girl on the butterfly's wing was not there just to look pretty and be welcoming; she had a purpose, and I personally think perhaps Dr. Alexander's whole experience had a purpose for all of us as well as for him.  Put another way, I think perhaps Dr. Alexander's near death experience was orchestrated by God to help Dr. Alexander, and through him, all of us, learn the incredible part love plays here on earth and throughout the universe.  Perhaps Dr. Alexander isn't just serving that purpose but was chosen for it.
B000ICXQS8|5.0|This is an amazing story of love.  It definitely does the book justice.  Great story, great actors.  I love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app for animal lovers. I love horses; they are such beautiful creatures.  This is a great app! I recommend this app for everyone who has a soft spot for animals.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Why is it I have two different games going on each device. Any other game whether it's on my phone or tablet it's still the same game. Have different scores on each. That Sucks!!!
0812993292|5.0|People you might know with all their stuff of relationships and pasts.  Harold takes you with him on his walk through England and through his life.  There is so much here to ponder.  There are twists in the journey and twists in the lives of these people.  Very rich reading and a excellent first novel.  It is one of those books that make you feel better for having read it.  You cannot walk away without having grown attached.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|As a big fan of the Harry Potter books, naturally I'm a big fan of the movies. I love having all these DVDs and I feel as though I get to watch the characters grow and develop over the years. They've come to be my &#34;sick time on the couch&#34; videos, perfect for those winter colds and flus.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|Love Never Dies has some of the most gorgeous music you will ever hear. It has the power to draw emotions out of your soul that you never knew you had. Please bring this wonderful phenomenon to Broadway, New York!
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Fits my Kindle Fire perfectly.  It has a great cushioning that makes me very comfortable knowing my Kindle has protections from bumps and falls.  Nice color too!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|read the complete trilogy first and was worried the movie wouldn't be as good...I was wrong...well done. waiting on the next one is tooooo long!
B008G12ERC|5.0|I bought this for my husband's Christmas present and he loves the latest release. Highly recommended by a mutual Muse fan!
B004LWZW4W|3.0|This is a fair update to the Planet of the Apes series.  I prefer the original and the costumed characters outdo the actors.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Wow.<br />Just finished reading this, it was amazing. The book was so action-packed and suspenseful. Even though the book is about demigods, I felt like I could still connect to the story. Totally recommend this for anyone who likes mythology and action-adventure books.<br />Five stars, no doubt.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is addictive and fun. I haven't had any issues with crashing or anything either. good free game that I would reccomend. kids can play most games too.
0140564349|5.0|I bought this for a friend's daughter. I wanted something that reminded me of my childhood and this was absolutely perfect!
B000RD0RDU|5.0|This fan is what a CPU fan should be, quiet and gets the  job done.<br />Nothing else I can ask for.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I loved it, It had romance, suspense, action and adventure. I thought the characters were great and the story was beautiful. I was hooked from the beginning.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Just love it.  I have read this book from cover to cover at least 10 times.  It is still just as good the first time I went through the story.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|She said immediately upon receiving her iphone 4s that she needed a LifeProof case.  So we searched and found one here.  Amazing price - and wonderfully speedy delivery.  Thank you!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is the best I have ever read and I m one on Rick Riordan's biggest fans so I hope house of Hades comes out soon.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is my first read of a Vince Flynn series, and I look forward to the next book following the CIA operatives.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Such fun to play this game. I love the puzzles. They are super challenging, which I love. My 17 year old son actually had to help me with a few. I knew what I was suppose to do but just could not wrap my brain around it. But I rather have a game that is going to challenge me and not have it finished in 5 minutes like some other games I have tried. Thanks for a great game and I can not wait to get unstuck and get to The Haunt 2. Keep these types of awesome games coming.
B00009V7OL|5.0|Bought this for my brother as a Christmas present.  He particularly enjoyed this movie and I wanted to get for him the Special Edition.  He loved it. Unfortunately he passed away the following February.
014241493X|5.0|I absolutely adore John Green and this book lives up to my expectations.  For me it reinforces that saying we've all heard, &#34;the journey is more important than the destination.&#34;
B005LAJ17M|5.0|One of the best series.  Very exciting.  Damien Lewis is excellent in this role.  The drama regarding a marine who has been a prisoner of war for eight years and then is returned home is exciting.  He becomes a congressman and possibly a double agent.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love this game! Graphics are awesome. The storyline is great. No complaints except I wish it would have kept going. WTG guys keep these type of games coming. The harder the better..;) ok well at least really challenging.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Thought it was weird when I first heard them... But I love this album and it is now one of my favorites.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was slightly predictable but in opinion a very good romantic read. I connected with the characters, and very much enjoyed the story.
1400067820|5.0|Here's probably one of the toughest review I ever had to write and I am not sure it is a good one, even if the topic I am addressing is great and important. But it's been a challenge to summarize what I learnt: Nicholas Nassim Taleb gives in this follow-up to the Black Swan a very interesting analysis of how the world can be less exposed to Black Swans, not by becoming more robust only, but by becoming antifragile, i.e. by benefiting from random events. His views include tensions between the individual and the groups, how distributed systems are more robust than centralized ones, how small unites are less fragile than big ones. This does not mean Taleb is against orgamizations, governments or laws as too little intervention induces totally messy situations. It is about putting the cursor at the right level. Switzerland represents for Taleb a good illustration of good state organizations with little central government, a lot of local responsibility. He has similar analogies for the work place, where he explains that an independent worker, who knows well his market, is less fragile to crises than big corporations and their employees. One way to make systems less fragile is to put some noise, some randomness which will stabilize them. This is well-known in science and also in social science. Just remember Athens was randomly nominating some of its leaders to avoid excess!<br />Now let me quote the author. These are notes only but for serious reviews, visit the author's website, fooledbyrandomness. First Taleb is, as usual, unfair but maybe less than in the Black Swan. Here is an example: \\"Academics (particularly in social science) seem to distrust each other, [...] not to mention a level of envy I have almost never seen in business... My experience is that money and transactions purify relations; ideas and abstract matters like \\"recognition\\" and \\"credit\\" warp them, creating an atmosphere of perpetual rivalry. I grew to find people greedy for credentials nauseating, repulsive, and untrustworthy.\\" [Page 17] Taleb is right about envy and rivalry but wrong in saying it is worse in academia; I think it is universal! In politics for example. But when money is available, maybe rivalry counts less than where there is little.<br />Now a topic close to my activity: \\"This message from the ancients is vastly deeper than it seems. It contradicts modern methods and ideas of innovation and progress on many levels, as we tend to think that innovation comes from bureaucratic funding, through central planning, or by putting people through a Harvard Business School class by one Highly Decorated Professor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (who never innovated anything) or hiring a consultant (who never innovated anything). This is a fallacy - note for now the disproportionate contribution of uneducated technicians and entrepreneurs to various technological leaps, from the Industrial Revolution to the emergence of Silicon Valley, and you will see what I mean.\\" [Page 42] [Extreme and unfair again, even if not fully wrong!]<br />\\"The antifragility of some comes necessarily at the expense of the fragility of others. In a system, the sacrifices of some units - fragile units, that is, or people - are often necessary for the well-being of other units or the whole. The fragility of every start-up is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that's what makes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the fragility of the individual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate\\". [Page 65] What surprised me later is that Taleb shows that this is true of restaurants (not many succeed) as much as of high-tech start-ups. So it is not only about the uncertainty of new markets, but about uncertainty above all.<br />Mathematics of convexity<br />I have to admit Taleb is not easy to read. Not because it is complex (sometimes his ideas are pure common sense), but because it is dense with different even if consistent ideas. The book is divided in 25chapters, but also in 7 books. In fact, Taleb insists on it, he might have written 7 different books! Even his mathematics is simple. His definition of convexity is a little strange though I found it interested (I teach convex optimization, and you might not know, it was the topic of my PhD!).<br />Jensen inequality is interesting [Pages 342, 227 - Jensen was an amateur mathematician!]- the convex transformation of a mean is less or equal than the mean after convex transformation. Again individual (concave, we die) vs. collective (convex, antifragile, benefits from individual failures). So risk taking is good for collectivity if with insurance mechanisms. Risk taking + insurance vs. speculation with no value added. An example of a short and deep idea: \\"Decision making is based on payoffs, not knowledge\\". [Page 337]<br />\\"Simply, small probabilities are convex to errors of computation. One needs a parameter, called standard deviation, but uncertainty about standard deviation has the effect of making the small probabilities rise. Smaller and smaller probabilities require more precision in computation. In fact small probabilities are incomputable, even if one has the right model - which we of course don't.\\" [Taleb fails to mention Poincare yet he quoted him in the Black Swan, but whatever.]<br />A visible tension between individual and collective interests<br />Quotes again: \\"What the economy, as a collective, wants [business school graduates] to do is not to survive, rather to take a lot, a lot of imprudent risks themselves and be blinded by the odds. Their respective industries improve from failure to failure. Natural and nature-like systems want some overconfidence on the part of the individual economic agents, i.e., the overestimation of their chances of success and underestimation of the risks of failure in their business, provided their failure does not impact others. In other words, they want local, but not global overconfidence\\". [...] In other words, some class of rash, even suicidal, risk taking is healthy for the economy - under the conditions that not all people take the same risks and that these risks remain small and localized. Now, by disrupting the model, as we will see, with bailouts, governments typically favor a certain class of firms that are large enough to require being saved in order to avoid contagion to other businesses. This is the opposite of healthy risk taking; it is transferring fragility from the collective to the unfit. [...] Nietzsche's famous expression \\"what does not kill me makes me stronger\\" can be easily implemented as meaning Mithridatization or Hormesis but it may also mean \\"what did not kill me did not make me stronger, but it spared me because I am stronger than others; but it killed others and the average population is now stronger because the weak are gone\\". [...] This visible tension between individual and collective interests is new in history. [...] Some of the ideas about fitness and selection are not very comfortable to this author, which makes the writing of some sections rather painful - I detest the ruthlessness of selection, the inexorable disloyalty of Mother Nature. I detest the notion of improvement thanks to harm to others. As a humanist, I stand against the antifragility of systems at the expense of individuals, for if you follow the reasoning, this makes us humans individually irrelevant. \\" [Pages 75-77]<br />A National Entrepreneur Day<br />\\"Compare the entrepreneurs to the bean-counting managers of companies who climb the ladder of hierarchy with hardly ever any real downside. Their cohort is rarely at risk. My dream - the solution - is that we would have a National Entrepreneur Day, with the following message: Most of you will fail, disrespected, impoverished, but we are grateful for the risks you are taking and the sacrifices you are making for the sake of the economic growth of the planet and pulling others out of poverty. You are the source of our antifragility. Ournation thanks you.\\" [Page 80]<br />Local distributed systems, randomness and modernity<br />\\"You never have a restaurant crisis. Why? Because it is composed of a lot of independent and competing small units that do not individually threaten the system and make it jump from one state to another. Randomness is distributed rather than concentrated.\\" [Page 98]<br />\\"Adding a certain number of randomly selected politicians to the process can improve the functioning of the parliamentary system.\\" [Page 104]<br />\\"Modernity is the humans' large-scale domination of the environment, the systematic smoothing of the world's jaggedness, and the stifling of volatility and stressors. We are going into a phase of modernity marked by the lobbyist, the very, very limited liability corporation, the MBA, sucker problems, secularization, the tax man, fear of the boss...\\" [Page 108]<br />\\"Iatrogenics means literally \\"caused by the healer\\". Medical error still currently kills between three times (as accepted by doctors) and ten times as many people as car accidents in the United States, it is generally accepted that harm from doctors - not including risks from hospitals germs - accounts for more deaths than any single cancer. Iatrogenics is compounded by the \\"agency problem\\" which emerges when one party (the agent) has personal interested that are divorced from those of the one using his services (the principal). An agency problem is present with the stockbroker and medical doctor whose ultimate interest is their own checking account, not your financial and medical health.\\" [Pages 111-112]<br />Theories and intervention.<br />\\"Theories are super-fragile outside physics. The very designation \\"theory\\" is even upsetting. In social science, we should call these constructs \\"chimeras\\" rather than theories. [Now you understand why Taleb has many enemies.] A main source of the economic crisis started in 2007 in the Iatrogenics of the attempt by [...] Alan Greenspan to iron out the \\"boom-bust\\" cycle which caused risks to go hide under the carpet. The most depressing part of the Greenspan story is that the fellow was a libertarian and seemingly convinced of the idea of leaving systems to their own devices; people can fool themselves endlessly. [...] The argument is not against the notion of intervention; in fact I showed above that I am equally worried about under-intervention when it is truly necessary. [...] We have a tendency to underestimate the role of randomness in human affairs. We need to avoid being blinded to the natural antifragility of systems, their ability to take care of themselves and fight our tendency to harm and fragilize them by not giving them a chance to do so. [...] Alas, it has been hard for me to fit these ideas about fragility within the current US political discourse. The democratic side of the US spectrum favors hyper-intervention, unconditional regulation and large government, while the Republican side loves large corporations, unconditional deregulation and militarism, both are the same to me here. Let me simplify my take on intervention. To me it is mostly about having a systematic protocol to determine when to intervene and when to leave systems alone. And we may need to intervene to control the iatrogenics of modernity - particularly the large-scale harm to the environment and the concentration of potential (though not yet manifested) damage, the kind of thing we only notice when it is too late. The ideas advanced here are not political, but risk-management based. I do not have a political affiliation or allegiance to a specific party; rather, I am introducing the idea of harm and fragility into the vocabulary so we can formulate appropriate policies to ensure we don't end up blowing up the planet and ourselves.\\" [Pages 116-118]<br />\\"To conclude, the best way to mitigate interventionism is to ration the supply of information. The more data you get, the less you know.\\" [Page 128]<br />\\"Political and economic \\"tail\\" events areunpredictable and their probabilities are not scientifically measurable.\\" [Page 133]<br />The barbell strategy and optionality<br />\\"The Barbell strategy is a way to achieve anti-fragility, by decreasing downside rather than increasing upside, by lowering exposure to negative Black Swans. So just as Stoicism is the domestication, not the elimination, of emotions, so is the barbell a domestication, not the elimination, of uncertainty.\\" [Page 159] \\"It is a combination of two extremes, one safe and one speculative, deemed more robust than a monomodal strategy. In biological systems, the equivalent of marrying an accountant and having an occasional fling with a rock star; for a writer, getting a stable sinecure and writing without the pressures of the market. Even trial and error are a form of barbell.\\" [Glossary page 428]<br />\\"The strength of the computer entrepreneur Steve Jobs was precisely in distrusting market research and focus groups - those based on asking people what they want - and following his own imagination, his modus was that people don't know what they want until you provide them with it.\\" [Page 171]<br />\\"America's asset is simply risk taking and the use of optionality, the remarkable ability to engage in rational forms of trial and error, with no comparative shame in failing, starting again and repeating failure. In modern Japan, by contrast, shame comes, with failure, which causes people to hide risks under the rug, financial or nuclear.\\"<br />\\"Nature does a California-style \\"fail early\\" - it has an option and uses it. Nature understands optionality effects better than humans. [...] The idea is voiced by Steve Jobs in a famous speech: \\"Stay hungry, stay foolish.\\" He probably meant \\"Be crazy but retain the rationality of choosing the upper bound when you see it.\\" Any trial and error can be seen as the expression of an option, so long as one is capable of identifying a favorable result and exploiting it.\\" [Page 181]<br />\\"Option is a substitute for knowledge- actually I don't understand what sterile knowledge is, since it is necessarily vague and sterile. So I make the bold speculation that many things we think are derived by skill come largely from options, but well-used options, much like Thales's situation [who had an option with olive presses - pages 173-174] rather than from what we claim to be understanding.\\" [Page 186]<br />Taleb is skeptical with experts, with anyone believing in a linear model academia -> applied science ->practice (\\"lecturing birds how to fly\\"); he believes in tinkering, heuristics, apprenticeship, and makes again many enemies for free! He claims the jet engine, financial derivatives, architecture, medicine were first developed by practitioners and then theorized by scientists, not invented or discovered by them.<br />Tinkering vs. research<br />\\"There has to be a form of funding that works. By some vicious turn of events, governments have gotten huge payoffs from research, but not as intended - just consider the Internet. It is just that functionaries are too teleological in the way they look for things and so are large corporations. Most large companies, such as Big Pharma, are their own enemies. Consider blue sky research, whereby grants and funding are given to people, not projects, and spread in small amounts across many researchers. It's been reported that in California, venture capitalists tend to back entrepreneurs, not ideas. Decisions are largely a matter of opinion, strengthened with who you know. Why? Because innovations drift, and one needs flâneur-like abilities to keep capturing the opportunities that arise. The significant venture capital decisions were made without real business plans. So if there was any analysis, it had to be of a backup, confirmatory nature. Visibly the money should go to the tinkerers, the aggressive tinkerers who you trust will milk the option.\\" [Page 229]<br />\\"Despite the commercial success of several companies and the stunning growth in revenues for the industry as a whole, most biotechnology firms earn no profit.\\" [Page 237] [Optionality again]<br />\\"(i) Look for optionality; in fact, rank things according to optionality, (ii) preferably with open-ended, not closed-ended, payoffs; (iii) do not invest in business plans but in people, so look for someone capable of changing six or seven times over his career, or more (an idea that is part of the modus operandi of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen); one gets immunity from the backfit narratives of the business plan by investing in people. Make sure you are barbelled, whatever that means in your business.\\" [Page 238]<br />\\"I did here just debunk the lecturing-Birds-How-to-Fly epiphenomenon and the \\"linear model\\", suing simple mathematical properties of optionality.

[...] The golden rule: \\"Don't do unto others what you don't want them to do to you\\". [...] Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility or uncertainty.

The only solution? What about transparency?]<br />About Science<br />\\"Science must not be a competition; it must not have rankings - we can see how such a system will end up blowing up. Knowledge must not have an agency problem. One doctoral student once came to tell me that he believed in my ideas of fat tails and my skepticism of current methods of risk management, but that it would not help him get an academic job. \\"It's what everybody teaches and uses in papers\\" he said. Another student explained that he wanted a job at a good university, so he could make money testifying as an expert witness - they would not buy my idea on robust risk management because \\"everyone uses these textbooks\\". [Page 419] [So true!]<br />Conclusion<br />\\"All I want is to remove the optionality, reduce the antifragility of some at the expense of others. It is simple via negativa. [...] The golden rule: \\"Don't do unto others what you don't want them to do to you\\". [...] Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility or uncertainty. [...] Time is volatility. Education in the sense of the formation of the character, personality, and acquisition of true knowledge, likes disorder; label-driven education and educators abhor disorder. Innovation is precisely something that grains from uncertainty.\\" [Pages 420-22]<br />\\"It so happens that everything nonlinear is convex, concave or both. [...] We can build Black-Swan-protected systems thanks to detection of concavity, [...] and with a mechanism called convex transformation, the fancier name for the barbell. [...] Distributed randomness (as opposed to the concentrated type) is a necessity.\\"<br />[General comments]<br />Taleb sometimes gives the feeling of contradictions: marketing is bad, but Steve Jobs is great; barbell strategy and optionality is great, but isn't it about risks and downsides transferred to others [Isn't Thalesa pure speculator?], cigarettes are bad but traditions are good.<br />Also this love of tradition makes people with more background at ease to take risks with barbell strategy; but what about the poor with nothing to lose? Benefits might statistically go to those who already have... [It reminds the story told by J.-B. Doumeng: It is a millionaire who recounts his difficult beginnings: \\"I bought an apple 50 cents, I polished it to shine and I sold it for one franc. With this, I bought two apples 50cts, I carefully polished and I sold them 2 Fr after a moment, I could buy a cart to sell my apples and then I made a big inheritance...\\"]<br />You now know why it has been a challenge. A very strange, dense, fascinating book, but if you like these concepts, you must read Antifragile. In fact you must read the Black Swan first, if you have not and if you like it, I am sure you will read Antifragile.
B00181JGI2|3.0|The movie kept reloading and freezing up.This made it very hard to enjoy. I downloaded the Big Lebowski from online tv.
B0007M22TI|4.0|We are enjoying this DVD very much.  Although I like the songs and music on the &#34;Songs From The Heart&#34; DVD more this music is just as high quality and well done.  Worth the money and the time to watch it.  We have watched this DVD many times already and will watch it many more times in the days to come.

B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Having just finished this journey of a book, I can't help but find myself feeling more content than I have in years. A fictional novel that brings light into your heart and a new perspective on thought, this is a book that will be kept close on my bookshelf for the rest of my life. Excuse me while I go contemplate this book for many more hours

B008TRUDAS|4.0|This is not the typical teen love novel but that doesn't mean there isn't that sort of drama. This book was beautiful, the poetry had meaning that was simple enough to understand yet powerful in the words chosen.<br /><br />I finished the book in a few hours because I couldn't put it down. I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a novel where love can't exist but strives through in the end. Wonderful story, and if you're concerned, it's a PG book, no sex whatsoever.<br /><br />I'm not a poetry kind of person but I think still with slam poetry it's a good novel esp for teens and people in their twenties.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game when your bored. you should totally down load it. don't know how to change horses name. lol. I might need a life
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|It was a huge thrill to FINALLY read Mario Puzo's classic 1969 novel THE GODFATHER. Now, granted, my point of view is 100% skewed by the fact that THE GODFATHER is one of my favorite films ever...and I've seen the film many many times. So I could not help but approach the book with as an extension of my love for the movie.<br /><br />What amazed me is how similar the book is to the movie...and how vastly different the book is compared to the movie. For example, I was shocked about how big a role Johnny Fontaine plays in the book...as he is only in the film briefly. I was thrilled to learn more about him, as well as his best friend (who was left out of the movie...Nino Valenti). I also got a kick learning more about Luca Brassi, Al Neri, and especially Lucy Mancini...and her future husband (post Sonny) Jules. Plus, the way Puzo spins Police Captain McKlusky's story, yet almost feel sad when Michael guns him down.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me was the frank and gratuitous sex in the book...which is only brought up once during the film. Puzo's open and perhaps vile take on sex and sexually was much more shocking than the violence in the book.<br /><br />As good as the novel is, I was surprised how little subtext was used in the dialogue. Instead, Puzo spells things out very clearly...perhaps too clearly. There's much more subtext, and depth in the screenplay Mario Puzo wrote with Francis Ford Coppola.<br /><br />THE GODFATHER is the first ever electronic book I have ever read. Reading Puzo's novel on my Kindle Paperwhite...and my iPhone...was a truly great pleasure...sort of like the book itself. Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER is a truly great pleasure.

0385338910|1.0|When your total time of knowing and being married to someone is less than two years you do not qualify as a widower/widow. Even Social Security sets the bar to at least 10 years!<br /><br />All the characters are rich and Jewish. So it's all emotional, no other worries. But how emotional can you honestly be when you barely knew the person. There's no history to build a story on here.<br /><br />I came looking for more Tropper after reading his excellent 'This Is Where I Leave You'.<br />I do not recommend this book.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|I'm very happy with this purchase the product arrived on time even earlier than I expected.<br /><br />And protect very well my kindle
B0083VP2KQ|3.0|Yes, the CGI is more advanced and at times impressive, but also sterile and unengaging. Unfortunately, the narrative structure of the original BBC series 'Walking with dinosaurs' has been abandoned in favour of a succession of random facts and scenes. Combined with surroundings that are now completely digital, it just doesn't feel like you're there any more. It's not Walking With Dinosaurs, it's Watching Clips Of Dinosaurs.<br /><br />Next time, bring back story arc, emotional involvement, actual backdrops, Kenneth Brannagh and composer Benjamin Bartlett.

This novel kept me emotionally interested all the way through. This novel got me to feel something for each individual character, which is why I gave it five stars. Excellent work! I highly recommend this book.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I purchased the book based on the high volume of 4 and 5 star reviews. In the first few minutes, I thought this was a reasonably well-written but average YA romance novel, and I wondered why the heck I purchased the book. My initial thoughts went something like this - 'Sky was raised by a hippie, vegan, technology-adverse mom in a homeschool environment until she convinced her mom to allow her to attend public school. Even before attending, Sky had developed an undeserved reputation as a \\"loose\\" girl. Holder was a bad boy who \\"attended juvi\\" the prior year.  I expected the two would meet, overcome any prejudices against each other's respective reputations, and live happily ever after in the snarky world of YA.'  (btw - these are not spoilers since you'll read this in first few chapters. It just lays the foundation for the story.)  Instead, the themes were much more sophisticated, not completely predictable, yet completely captivating.  We start to unravel the mystery surrounding Sky and some of her idiosyncratic behavior. I enjoyed the book thoroughly and look forward to reading it AGAIN.

B0052RDHTM|3.0|Russian revolution was tedious--overly drawn out.  Hard to get &#34;into&#34; the characters--too much jumping back and forth.<br /><br />However, very enlightening  about the WW1 and Russian revolution time period, and I'm sure a good lead in to his next book of the trilogy.<br /><br />Learned quite a lot but not as enjoyable as most of Follett's books.

B00005JLKB|4.0|DVD discs came brand new. Playback quality was good. Did not have any trouble playing the discs. Only reccomendation is to provide better packaging as the case carrying the discs came a little damage. However it did protect the discs so it was ok.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is excellent!  It seems that the more often I watch, the more I love it.  Will Ferrell depicts this character perfectly.  Reasonably clean too.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I loved the book-don't get me wrong. I gave it 4 stars for a reason<br /><br />*** SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />I loved the fast past, Lauren kept us on our toes. She made it seem very real through Lena's eyes. Additionally, she didn't make everything happy and sappy-there were deaths and gruesome scenes. I definitely took pleasure in some of the scenes in the book, especially when certain people got revenge. Yes, as many people said-much of it is predictable, but Lauren led us to know things ahead of time with clues, unfolding it a piece at a time to confirm our suspicions, which made me like it even more.<br /><br />Now to the part I didn't like. Julian and Lena's relationship. It seemed contrived from nowhere. There are points in the book I really like Julian's character-however, for her to fall in love so quickly with him didn't seem like her character. She thought Alex was dead-but she also thought her mom was dead...I would think she would've tried to find out more what happened to him if he really died or not. She knows how tricky the regulators and everyone are...but I definitely loved it to see Alex reappear. The whole time I was waiting for him to come back, hoping. She talked about him constantly, but then poof-another guy touches her hair and she's in love with him. I sincerely hope Lauren rights this in the next book. I definitely loved the book, but was upset with the love triangle turn...although I guess I saw it coming, I was hoping she would've been the stronger character and denied him.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Unfortunately, my television make, Vizio, is not supported by the app.  In an effort to get connected, I finallly came upon a brief statement which simply said that Vizio televisions are not compatible with the application.

0634060384|3.0|First, some background:  I'm a guitarist, I've been playing jazz for the past...7 years or so almost exclusively.  I play mostly swing and bop, but my real passion is gypsy jazz.  I'm also almost entirely learned by ear, though I know my theory quite well.  As most of us do, I spend an enormous amount of my time listening to music, which is how I developed my ear and my style;  in the words of clark terry:  imitate, assimilate, innovate.  That being said:<br /><br />This is my first day running through it, and I can say with conviction: I'm really not very impressed.  While gypsy jazz has its own set of standards, many of them cross over to the standard swing canon.  I love swing and bop, and that's what I was expecting.  Instead, I got a bit of swing with a lot of post-bop (sorry to ruffle feathers here) crap.  I've had other non-printed fakebooks, but this is just not very useful for me.  If I go to look up some tunes I regularly play:  Four Brothers, Days of Wine and Roses, Are You Real?, Indian Summer. and many more, they're simply not in here,  though they aren't in previous fakebooks either.  I guess I was expecting an improvement.<br /><br />But honestly, I guess someone just has a crush on Pat Metheny and Wayne Shorter, because this book is just chock full of their originals.  I just don't get it (they didn't even include Shorter's Devil's Island!)<br />I've never heard about 1/4 of the things I flipped to.  I consider myself very well-versed on swing/bop, and this stuff is just completely foreign, and for good reason; no one outside of modern musicians know these tunes;  your audience sure as hell won't.  Ever heard of 'Tame Thy Pen'?  Me neither.  If you google 'Jazz Bible Fakebook', the first result is a .pdf that is very similar in content to this one.<br /><br />If you like hot jazz, this isn't your book.  There are several songs off 'Birth of the Cool', Bird/Miles tunes, a bit of Cole Porter, a bit of Gershwin, stuff you'd expect, sure, but it's totally missing on early swing (Rosetta, Tea for Two, etc.)  This book exemplifies the problems with IP law in this country - plenty of good, common tunes are omitted, while something like 'String of Pearls' is included (I've only ever heard Benny Goodman or Glenn Miller play it - it's definitely a big-band tune, not a heard-everyday-in-the-clubs tune)<br /><br />Furthermore, buying the 'legitimate version' doesn't really help the dead musician or their estate either, for that matter.  Do you think Gershwin's estate is getting much from this printing?  And should they?  I can't answer that.<br />I'm keeping it so that I'm not totally out of the loop when I play with other people, but I will continue to be 95% ear-learned for sure.  I bought an app for my android phone from realbook, which gives you the transposable changes to thousands of tunes. The only downfall is the lack of lead sheets, but it's definitely worth the few dollars I paid for it.  Handy if you can figure the melody out, but can't remember the changes - it's my go-to piece of equipment at jam sessions where I'm the only one who doesn't know the song, rather than flipping through books.<br /><br />As critical as I am, I do recognize how difficult it would be to whittle down a genre of several thousand songs into a couple hundred pages. You could have books devoted solely to cool, solely to hard bop, etc., and still not please everybody.  I'm just disappointed in the modernity of the choices - I just don't like a lot of these songs, so I don't play them.  It's definitely the best option out there right now at the price, but it could be so much better.<br /><br />As an example of stupidity,  take 'Like Someone In Love'.  Go listen to Getz or Trane or Hawk or justaboutanygodamnhornplayerinthepastcentury, and they all play it in Ab.  This book has it in Eb.  Transposing up a fourth just makes this entire page useless imo, leadsheet and all.  I'd be better off just digging in with the chords and fumbling throughit than trying to re-write everything on the page.<br /><br />If you want a real book, buy Volume II first.  Volume I simply has too much crap in it.
B005COO1X6|4.0|The monster in this story is rather silly, a combination of Christine and the Blob.  However, it is still an amusing tale and very worth reading.  The Dune was similarly amusing, if only for the last line.  A worthwhile read.

Do not pass up this app if you want to be able to show your photos without loading them onto the kindle fire directly.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I Wish the styles and things weren't so expensive or cause so many games. It doesn't make people play more, it makes us irritated and stop playing. Other than that I like the game and the layout of games and activities
0446554995|4.0|OK, I know I'm going to nitpick, but Preston is better than this.  I love the Pendergast series.  He is a very unique character, in many ways as unique as Sherlock Holmes and at least as interesting.  Both of these characters are capable of action, but are not action heroes.  Certain parts of the novel, such as the assault on the Nazi stronghold, would be better suited to James Bond.  It just seemed to take this character out of his comfort zone.<br />This is a good story with an interesting character.  It should have been five stars, but it falls short.  First of all, do we have to dredge up the Nazis yet again?  Seriously........... Find some new villians!  Nazis living in South America nearly seven decades after the fall of Germany is almost as stupid as finding a bunch of unrepentant Confederates down there.  It's just plain silly and has been done too many times already.<br />Now, for the science.  You aren't going to set off a volcano by blowing up a munitions store.  Also, if there is going to be volcanic activity in South America, it would be up in the Andes, not the middle of the Brazilian jungle.  It's just not there.<br />Also, Pendergast identifies his son as being the murderer when evidence is obtained from mitochondrial DNA.  Wrong!!!!  Mitochondrial DNA is maternally derived(It all comes from the oocyte.).  It is genomic DNA that comes from both parents.  Don't use big words if you don't know what they means.<br />I really like the Pendergast novels.  I really wanted to give this novel five stars.  It just wasn't there.  Perfection is in the details, and the authors missed a lot of details in this one.

B0000062FN|4.0|This is Santana's third great album after Abraxas. Fabulous Batuka instrumental intro with the song Everything is coming our way keep this album very memorable.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|A very nice book with a known story line, this does not mean that it is not enjoyable but it does mean that you can figure out much of the plot. This is the first book that I have read from this author and while I am not a Vampire enthusiast I do like fantasy. If you have read any of my previous book reviews you will remember that I have a very simple criteria; Good Guy Wins Kills the Bad Guy and Gets The Girl.<br /><br />Pretty simplistic but that's what I like. This book follows that formula so far and I am awaiting the sequel. Hopefully Thor gets out of his present difficulty and saves the day.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I was entertained for the price<br />the game were not so difficult to figure out<br />the graphics were also very nice

0143113100|4.0|This book takes the reader to the beginnings when some neuroscientists believed that the human brain can take up learning new skills even if the initially designated zone for that skill was damaged. Like all radical new ideas it was ridiculed and it was not until devotees persevered and continued to record instances of brain plasticity that the notions was taken seriously.<br /><br />In layman's language Norman Doidge explains how this is possible and illustrates it with amazing stories of people that learned to do things they never thought they could.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down, better than a mystery story because the stories are real life events. It is awfully inspiring as it opens up so many possibilities for learning and development in both young and older human brains.

B000005RU2|5.0|They apparently broke the record on loudest electric guitar in a live concert. This live version of &#34;Smoke on the Water&#34; with the slightly different Ian Gillan announcement and Richie Blackmore guitar intro blows all others out the water ('scuse the pun)! The instrumental play, recording and production make it a milestone. Buy it if only to get the live version of Smoke on the Water and play it loud on a good stereo with the best speakers! Deep Purple's Made in Japan is best LIVE album ever.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Morton offers an excellent portrayal of how the confluence of war, misogyny, and the parallels of patriotism and familial loyalty controlled women’s choices.  The prose of her text rivals Taylor Caldwell and encourages appreciation of content, characters, and her ability to captivate the reader.  I love her work.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I'm sobbing as I write this.  What a beautiful story!  It took a little getting used to since the story takes place in England... but I eventually couldn't put it down.

B0058YPL66|5.0|A great storyline, complex, well developed characters. This is a great twist on the classic fairy tales. They do an amazing job of showing the backstories of the fairy tale characters, and tying it into the current story. I was hooked right away!
098555780X|5.0|This book is great. It is very easy to follow and has improved the quality of the items I make.
0345803485|3.0|My wife thought the book was okay. She thought that Book Three was the best one of the three books
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this app on my kindle fire and it is my go to game to unwind. I really like the tapping feature and the auto complete when the win is achieved. The victory shuffle always makes me smile:-)
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Another great Album. Really like quality of cd and artist work!<br />She is young but very talented and will definitely be a hit with pop or country fans!
0316187216|5.0|Ambercrombie has become one of those authors that you read the minute his book comes out and get forced to wait impatiently for the next. This one was worth the wait. Nobody creates characters like you will find in his books and this is no exception.
0345803493|3.0|I bought the trilogy for my wife. She said she liked<br />Book Three the least of the three books. She lent thewm to a friend's husband.
B008FOB124|5.0|I recently got to see them perform much of this album, and many other songs, live in Austin at the Moody Theater.  It was truly amazing.  I was going to go see them in '96 for their last tour, but ended up not being able to - then they disbanded.<br /><br />This album and the subsequent reunion tour was a childhood dream come true.<br /><br />This album has only 8 songs, but they are all amazing in their own right.  Great work from my favorite band of all time.
B0072OFM28|4.0|if so you'll love this brutal depiction of life among the Spartans and Romans. Definitely Not for the kiddies! When these guys say, &#34;Can I give you a hand... they mean it!!!&#34;
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|SPOILERS.............SPOILERS............<br /><br />I don't know what the posters who raved about this film were smoking, or the parents of the girls, who allowed them to appear in this horrible, filthy film. If you want to see a film with young girls whose lines consisted almost entirely of obscenities and treating people, especially their father, with gross disrespect, this is the film for you. I felt so sorry for Clooney's character, whose main flaw seemed only to be that he worked too hard, but otherwise loved his daughters and his family and friends. None of them seem to return his affection, blaming him for his wife's infidelities and the accident that killed her. I wanted him to stand up to all of them, especially his daughters and his wife's best friend who wailed that the \\"affair wasn't the wife's fault...\\" to him, and he did confront his older daughter at the comatose mother's bedside, only to have both daughters hurl obscenities at each other, a few moments later, as the younger cretin child brings a friend in to display her mother. The \\"wonderfully mellow\\" Sid is also a completely brainless and mannerless waste of air as he laughs at the grandmother, who has Alzheimer's. The point of the film was that Clooney had been an absent father who had failed his daughters, but I certainly didn't see that the mother had been a stellar parent, with two hoodlum, filthy mouthed daughters. I actually didn't see the end of the film, I couldn't stand any more. I gave the film two stars, one for Clooney's honest attempt to portray this character, and the other for the Hawaiian scenery.
0345803507|4.0|My wife enjoyed the trilogy. She said she liked Book Three the best. She lent the books to her friend's husband to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. This season begins like the other two, with thoughtful writing and suspenseful acting. I can't wait for more.
0143119419|4.0|I was clueless about hedge funds prior to reading this book.  Now, I'm no expert, but I feel smarter than average about them!
B001L63JC8|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been written. This work is just genius and I have listened to this for 40 years.

B0066W1AZK|1.0|if the pieces looked like the pic it would be great...but it gives an overhead view...they all look the same through there
B004P98QZ8|5.0|this was a gift for my grandson, a Ninjago fanatic.  it was a &#34;surprise&#34; and he absolutely LOVED it!  doubtless the highlight of his Christmas.  i looked at the huge array of parts and pieces and gave up at once; however, he went to work on it at once and spent the remainder of the holiday engrossed in the temple.
B000006TSC|3.0|Not their best work but I had to have it to complete my collection of all Camel albums, Not bad but not great
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|i have all the Xmen DVDs.  Just one of my favorite movies.  movie came promptly. i had no problems with this vendor
B009O2XY12|5.0|a game the whole family can enjoy and its free!  a great buy and we have really enjoyed it a lot
B000002LLC|5.0|\\"I'm Breathless: Music  From and Inspired By The Film Dick Tracy\\" is a a novelty cd that highlights Madonna's singing. There is the well-known and classic \\"Vogue\\" song on this cd.  Then there are also multiple songs on this cd that contain swing music that showcase her voice.  I admit that \\"More\\" is one of my favorite songs on this cd. For this reason, I would more recommend this cd to those who listen to various types of music and/or Madonna fans.
B0050PLT8W|4.0|Really a good album, but still Scars & Souvenirs is the best album they ever made.<br /><br />Haiya, ya, ya, ya, I can't get this album out of my head...
B0095XPZBC|5.0|My son wanted the second season of Star Trek Next Generation for Christmas.  He just came back from his second deployment in Afghanistan.  This was a great gift to come home to!
B005V5WBFG|5.0|even stops pop ups...love it!  feel very  safe with this product.  we've had it for years...best out there.  good product
B00957T6X6|5.0|Loved the two seasons of the shoe and it was great reading them as well. I sure hope they make a 3rd 4th and 5th season of it.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This pen is amazing! You can write something and it can only be seen if you have an ultraviolet light or another sonc screwdriver. So Cool!
B004Y042N8|2.0|I got this as the free app of the day, and am glad I didn't pay for it. It's fun for a while, but after 20-30 puzzles you realize that they're not getting any harder, and some are almost exact duplicates of each other. It seems like in order to get over 2000 puzzles, they just drew shape after shape and threw them in the game.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love watching the series and seeing how the aristocracy and the servants &#34;lived&#34; and worked together.  I love seeing how people lived during those times and how they dressed.  Excellent series.  Highly recommend it!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Almost brandnew, refurbished. Manuever is nice, but sometimes there is a small delay. There are oil on the sticks that comes out after a lot of movement, but is nice after wiping it with alcohol.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved everything about this book...even my crying at the end. I knew I was a dog lover, this book showed me how much.
157421327X|3.0|I was a bit dissapointed upon receiving this, as it is extremely basic at 19 pages.  If you know anything about Zentangle from having taken a class or visiting any zentangle instruction site, this booklet will basically be useless to you.  This may be better for a grade school art teacher or instructor to have on hand as reference for students as a part of a library.  The first page tells you what you need to get started - pen, pencil, paper.  The next page gives the four basic instructions of how to make the square, draw a string and fill in the sections with tangles.  There are twenty-five simple tangles that show step-by-step instructions (which can be found on tangle patterns . com anyways).
B004F1F32A|2.0|The movie was great but the streaming through Amazon was so poor we could not enjoy it.  Just when the action was getting to its peak, the streaming came to a halt and had to wait up to 5 minutes to continue
B00992CF6W|3.0|I want to play wit other people the reason three stars is because it's fun but just need to play wit other people.
B007QUUJMG|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. It's a great book to read on a holiday because it's nice and short.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|I would give this app a 3 star or more rating if I had received a response from the customer service inquiry.<br /><br />My Denon sees this app's service as DLNA but as unapproved. In Windows three is a process to set up the approval between the DLNA server and my Denon.<br /><br />Why no such feature on imediashare?<br /><br />Where is my answer from customer support?
B004TI5N38|4.0|If you like Lee Child's Jack Reacher you will like John Puller. The story moves well but I feel Puller is a more believable character than Jack Reacher. Reacher is enjoyable but the set up is just unbelievable. He wanders around with nothing but the clothes on his back, kills a bunch of bad guys, mostly in an unlawful manner, destroys a lot of property and walks off into the sunset.<br /><br />Puller is still in the Army, his actions are more believable, but again super human, and he acts within the law and the consequences are more in line with what my imagination calls reality. Reacher (and I have read all the books, so I am a big fan)has become for me, tiring. Puller actually has emotions and a conscience. I think Puller is my new guy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was awesome<br /><br />I loved it I think everybody should read this book because it was awesomely cool and i loved it and I think everybody will like.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this more than 1,000,000 times, and I don't mind reading it more. Totally recommend this book. Please read it.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Love the movie and watched it on the airplane. It will not work on a Notebook. I would recommend this movie
B003QTSMXE|5.0|My two year old loves Wall-E, and I like him just as much.  I love the environmental, conservation, and health contexts in this movie.  Sometimes feels like we're doomed for a world like the one depicted in Wall-E.  Great movie.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Just as my title suggests, I have yet to use the app. Heard good things, saw it was free, dl'd it for when I do have a smart tv.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mrs.Collins, I'm begging you.....plz write another book without the hunger games I will die of boredom!!!!!! And I'm not exaggerating when I say die of boredom....
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|The product arrived on time, it is exactly what I expecting, because I love this band! I totally recommend it!
B000MAH5O2|5.0|Reading this book helped me gain an understanding that our President has really tried to help people from all levels.  He didn't grow up as part of the typical privileged political system and used his intelligence and motivation to become what he is today.  He discusses his struggles growing up based on having being pulled in multiple directions with his family and living in multiple countries.  This book will show readers that he isn't perfect, but cares for everyone, works more for the working class.  We are fortunate to have him as our President despite what many think.  Read this book and then decided whether or not you like his political actions.
B00AW0KHMY|1.0|the Industry needs to stop this crap , we allready bought your movie , I'm certainly not buying it for an Extra 8 minutes !! ...not enough the fans gave you 5 of the Biggest Grossing films in years & this is how you treat them ?

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft, was purchased for my grandson and he thinks it is the most awsome game, and will tell all his friends about it.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Really fun and addictive game but even if you win you run out of energy and it wants you to purchase more...for$40. Am thinking of deleting.  That is a bummer because it is a lot of fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Misses the program on TV. It was great to be able to watch it on amazon instant video. Pls keep more British dramas on amazon instant video
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Throughout the entire story you will be on the edge of your seat wondering about the mysterious life of Katie and if her abusive husband will ever return to hunt her down! The end, just when you think there US no more surprises, there is one more! You will be on the edge of your seat all night long.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First book in a long time that I was unable to put down once I started reading. Already started book 2!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Some writers are willing to take a risk by letting the reader really get to know them.  Cheryl Strayed is one of those writers.  Her openness and sheer determination make this book hard to put down once you have entered the adventure with her.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think others should play this game<br />it's fun. who ever likes ice age movies would like this fun game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I agree with most people, its awesome. Recommended to the Temple Run, Panda Run, and other sorts of games like those.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved season 1 and they hooked me after the first episode in season 2.  I liked that they used some of the same actors.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is quite possibly the best series I have Ever read.  I can't wait to read the rest of them!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie is the epitome of EPIC! However many times I watch it, I can never get enough. It's the Avengers. 'Nuff said.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was so deep, sexy of course but the darkness of Christians character draws you in and keeps you begging for more. I am not one to ever read romance novels but after all the hype this book got I just had to see what the fuss was about. Now I am dying for more! Kudos to the author for doing such an amazing job!!! I can't wait to read the next book
B0058YPL66|5.0|I only started watching this series because I was bored and this series was on Netflix. Why wasn't I aware of this tv series earlier? I love how this series takes all our familiar fairy tales and spins them in a way that is new and different. Love the casting and the continuous plot progression.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is the best app Ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever  ever ever ever e ever ver ever ever ever ever  ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever we  ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever IN THE WORLD ever
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show, highly addictive and will leave you on the edge of your seat and jonesing for the next episode!
B000FCKIFU|4.0|GOOD FAST READ WITH A GROUP OF INTERESTING CHARACTERS THAT ARE CLOSER TO REPRESENTING PEOPLE  IN POLITICAL POWER THAN ONE WOULD LIKE.
B0000714BP|5.0|My little brother was the one who persuaded me to watch this movie. I was floored when I heard that Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes were in it. Brilliant performances and awesome themes too. Defiant comedy and movie that shows that you can't always give up on something because of your appearance.<br /><br />Beyond hilarious and great.
B007HACDLK|5.0|this was and awesome book vince flynn really knows how to capture and keep your attenson I wis there was some one like rapp to help with our problems today if there were I guess we wouldn't know about
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show.  Its fun and amusing. It has its serious moments too, and you can really feel the emotions of the characters.<br />Yes I would recommend this show to anyone who likes British TV shows.
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|The appeal for me was the super-clean design.<br />The watch as shipped has \\"titanium mesh\\" in white letters at about 4pt size on the face around the 6 o'clock marker.  I probably would have chosen a different design if I had known.<br />Otherwise it's a pretty straightforward replacement of my previous two similar watches.
0439321603|3.0|The book was on time but damaged. Not from shipment but the inside was written on. Not because of notes taken and I do not meant he supposed notes that &#34;Harry Potter&#34; took on the book but the writing form &#34;Heather&#34; that she needed to write on the cover of the book that the picture does not show and that I was not told of. Some pages stick on certain spots that I really do not want to know why. Its okay simply because I needed the book for a class but never again would I buy something from them.
144235545X|5.0|another great book by Vince Flynn, I think I have read all of the Mitch Rapp stories and look forward to the ones to come
0399160450|3.0|This book, like the previous novel co-authored by Clancy and Greaney is a step up from the previously co-authored Clancy novels. Anyone who considers this a true Clancy novel has simply not read his past solo novels. This one is far from the standard Mr. Clancy has set over the years. First of all, don't let the 650 or so pages fool you, this is not nearly as long, or detailed as past novels. The pages are smaller, margins larger, and intricate details are just not there.<br /><br />Having said that, it is a pretty good novel, and does indeed make the reader think about possible future scenarios as out enemies become more tech savvy. There were definitely some realistic scenarios which, in this readers opinion, was negated by the fact that this small group of Hendley Associates warriors always manage to be in the right place at the right time, anywhere in the world, and are able to rescue everyone, including a group of Navy Seals for example.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Basic calculator on your Kindle. It works well. Large keyboard makes it very easy to use. One less thing to carry.
B00AKKS278|4.0|As a already motivated person, this is concise method of forming good consistent morning habits that immediately begin to make a difference. Well written and concise. Every morning my routine now adds focus to my day.  I am seeing the results and like what I see.  Try it and make a change.  Not for everyone but great for someone who wants to stay motivated and make positive changes!
0783235607|5.0|The box was in great condition and the movie played beautifully. Not to mention it's a great movie.<br /><br />Would buy again
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This was another Christmas present. It completes my bf's collection. And it showed up in a day! I couldn't believe it!
B00B19DMUE|4.0|This movie was a pleasantly scary surprise.  I was expecting an over-the-top gore fest and violence-filled scream queen type of a flick.  But it turned out to be a well-acted, well-made horror movie.  Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan head the capable cast.  But it's young Natasha Calis that gave the standout performance in the movie.  This is Natasha's movie, and it could very well propel her to stardom.<br /><br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a collegiate basketball coach, and a recently-divorced father of two young girls.  As the story begins, he is trying to pick up the pieces and start a new life in his new home.  At the same time, he is also facing a career decision when he learns of a possible job opportunity to coach North Carolina.  He is currently sharing custody of the girls with his ex-wife.  One afternoon, while driving through a residential neighborhood, the girls sees a yard sale.  Needing items for his new house, the coach agrees to stop and let the girls pick out items that he might need in his new home.  The younger girl, Emily, sees an unusual wooden box.  They purchase this box, along with dishes and utensils for the house.<br /><br />Emily becomes increasingly fascinated with the box.  Eventually, she manages to get it open.  From that point on, strange things begin to happen.  Swarms of insects start appearing in her room.  Her behavior starts to change.  Understandably, the adults assumed it was just a minor issue related to their separation.  But the problem continues and Emily's behavior becomes more violent.  The box is a prison for a malicious spirit called a dybbuk.  In jewish mythology, this spirit is evil and likes to possess the body of the living.  By opening the box, Emily has released the dybbuk from its prison.<br /><br />The story was inspired by the events surrounding a wooden box that was auctioned off on eBay nearly ten years ago.  This box, referred to as the Dybbuk Box, was handed down the family line of a holocaust survivor.  Every one who has owned the box have made claims that strange things began to happen in their lives during their time of ownership.  In any case, several possible explanations have been given for these events.  And should you ever come across a wooden box with the Shema carved into it on eBay, I would suggest that you pass it up.  :)<br /><br />Anyway, regardless of whether you believe or do not believe that these events were caused by the box, this is still a very good movie.  I highly recommend it.Every one who has owned the box have made claims that strange things began to happen in their lives during their time of ownership.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|The book is an adventure story at its core but much more in its entirety. The book primarily deals with the an Indian boys life growing up and centers on a singular event (a shipwreck) that he relates in his later years to a writer looking for new material. I found the observations concerning the major world religions made by the author as he describes the boys early years extremely insightful. The shipwreck an its aftermath are absorbing and some of the best page turning material that I've read in years. I highly recommend this book.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Quite enjoyable...contrasting the prim, proper and often scandalous behavior of those &#34;Upstairs&#34; with the &#34;downstairs&#34; crew who also have their prejudices as well. Love this period.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many wonderful ideas.

B00AYB0SX4|3.0|The twist was good and Lawrence was great but some of the scenes were overboard or weren't necessary for the plot
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved it.<br />Hopeless was a great book you have to read it and find out for your self. I had a hard time putting the book down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|so far I am loving this!! the animation is beautiful and the story line is interesting. I love most of the G5 games I get. the only thing I don't love is having to pay $5 to play the whole game.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Not nearly as interesting as the original Total Recall movie,way too many chase scenes and a vague almost incomprehensible plot. No \\"CC\\" access on version I viewed.
B000000993|5.0|This is one the best albums of any band of all time.  I highly recommend to any fan of the rock genre.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished this amazing book and will probably add to this review later because at the moment, I am having a hard time putting into words how this book made me feel. To be honest, it made me feel everything! I laughed in parts and gasped in shock at other parts. I cried. I cried. I needed a chapter break. This book was an amazing read and i am so glad i read it. I highly recommend this book. Grab tissues.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Let' you enter the book relaxed and as you get into the 2nd 3d you are hooked. It is hard to put the book afterr that. Excellent read.
B00687Q0VC|5.0|Everything about this mini-series is carefully and lovingly replicated for us.  This true story of our Nation's history is better than any novel that could be read.  The acting is splendid.
B007IJ4IMM|5.0|Greatest book of all time and my granddaughter, for whom it was a gift, agrees.  She got it in plenty of time for Christmas.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had when I got my kindle fire ant it is awesome I made a battle arena and in the 0.6.0 is out I will put a piston door and a piston elevated
030716327X|2.0|I ordered Pat the Bunny Book and stuffed animal in a packaged set as a Christmas gift for my sister's baby.  The book was smashed and the pages were separated from the binder.  I had to go out and buy a new book to give.  Very disappointed.  Thumbs DOWN.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Good deal. The books are combined to make all three easy to read and use. Great bunch of books too
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The author knows his subject and I would agree that if couples could learn each other's preferences in the way of emotional needs you could only be better together.  There is no groundbreaking here, at the same time, I felt like the book had a lot to offer because it does focus on the importance of being in tune with our partner's needs.
B004FOA84A|2.0|It was o.k. but I didn't like the fact that it had no hints or explanation to help you and it was way too short!  It should be a free game.  It only lasted about one hour!  The Lost City was so much better by this company.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I have the black lifeproof case that I bought at best buy and loved it. Then I ordered the pink one from amazon and its horrible! The screen protector bows out, the flash reflects back and ruins pictures and calls are staticky. Not sure what the difference between the two is but this one sucks!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|works great<br />very useful<br />interface is nice though can use some work as far as note organization goes<br />one of my favorite apps
B004DLPXAO|5.0|A very good app. You dan set the font size and see the print very well. I recommend it Highly.

B0053O8AQE|4.0|I was looking for something new to watch and I came across this show never seeing a preview of it or anything. I only purchased it because of the high ratings it had on this site. The first couple of episodes are a little slow, but after that you can began to see the shows true plot and potential shine! I love Max because she is very clever and witty. Her personality type is similar to mine, and I love how her character relates with eveyone. The other characters in the show make it just as funny! This show surprised me and I am happy I made the purchase.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|My husband wanted this so I purchased it as a gift for him.  He likes the older science fiction movies and I am sure he will pick out another.

1933633867|5.0|This guy knows his subject and does his research.  Full of surprises, and, no, history didn't happen the way your education has misled you to believe.  If you want to know what went wrong to put us where we are with the stinking economy where the rich feed on all teh rest of us, this is it.  Might even help us figure out a way out of this mess.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is great. Entirely different story line than the first but I like this one even better. Very creepy and dark. Also very un-expected
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is an excellent show that can be re-watched without being boring.<br />I bought the DVD season for my sister and she loves it.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|An interesting story that I can't really compare to any book I have read before. It's narration was different, unlike any I have seen before. It seemed happy, sad, cold, and pleasant all at once. It was different... and that's all I can say.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute app that gives fun to all ages, would be good to show a child responsibility, for the days to come!

B00A6L78YE|5.0|Psychedelia is no longer a niche genre. It seems nearly every indie band these days dabbles in some form of mind-altering music, whether it's the catchy 60's-influenced kind, shoegaze, or pure \\"innerspace\\" music. Foxygen definitely specialize in that first category, but unlike most bands that borrow from psych-rock's past, the influences on 'We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic' are all jumbled together in a way that makes the old sound entirely new.<br /><br />Some of the songs here even seem to draw from pre-Beatles pop music, such as the absolutely infectious \\"On Blue Mountain,\\" which sounds like early girl-group music, only played by the Stones and copping the chorus from Elvis's \\"Suspicious Minds.\\" \\"San Francisco,\\" one of the best tracks here, sounds like a 50's crooner song, while \\"Oh Yeah\\" draws from early Motown, yet both manage to sound totally fresh, with lush instrumentation giving them a rather unique sound.<br /><br />Other tracks are firmly rooted in the Summer of Love, such as the title song, which would have fit perfectly on the original 'Nuggets' compilation of 60's garage bands, and could almost pass for a lost 13th Floor Elevators track, if the lyrics weren't so hilarious and the vocals so ridiculous. Closer \\"Oh No\\" borrows from late-period Beatles and the call-and-response of early 60's girl-groups, with sweeping orchestral arrangements that make for an excellent headphone journey.<br /><br />One key area where Foxygen separate themselves from most current psych-music is the lyrics, which can be both clever and beautiful. An example of the former: \\"I met your daughter the other day, that was weird. She had rhinoceros-shaped earrings in her ears.\\" And the latter: \\"If you believe in love, everything you see is love. So try to be what God wants you to be, and say that I love you, again.\\" Every lyric is well thought-out and sincere, not just throwaway lines that get buried in the mix like with other psych bands.<br /><br />This albumwas one of the most pleasant surprises for me in quite a while. As good as the bedroom psych of their first album was, nothing could have prepared me for the just-plain-gorgeous music here. While Foxygen aren't exactly reinventing the wheel, they're definitely sprucing it up, and those looking to get lost in melodic, blissful orchestral arrangements and great storytelling would be hard-pressed to do better than 'We Are the 21st Century..'

B005LAII8K|5.0|Finally! A new movie that is an original story! Some people have pointed out that it is &#34;copied&#34; from Cowboy Bebop and Akira, but because those productions really aren't mainstream, this is a breath of fresh air to come out of recent Hollywood!

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have been collecting and maintaining watches for about 20 years now and only became more interested in automatics within the past 5 years. That being said, I have only ever purchased very expensive autos in these past 5 years and this watch is by far the most accurate. I am consistently getting -2 seconds a day with this watch and sit in an office all day (meaning I am not constantly moving my arm to wind the watch). This is fantastic!<br /><br />As for the build, this watch is very sturdy, even with the exhibition caseback. I enjoy the oringal strap but have since purchased a couple others to keep things interesting. The look of the watch doesn't scream high-end (no polished steal, no saphire crystal), but I didn't want something too flashy anyway.<br /><br />The size of the watch is perfect in my opinion. I am not a big fan of how the common watch has become so large these days and I was looking for something that was about the same size as any watch my grandfather ever had. This watch fit the bill and has that classic looks just based on its size alone.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with this watch and it is now my favorite automatic (even beating out my higher end victorinox's).

B0053KWDES|5.0|Easy five stars here.<br /><br />If you are looking for a basic no frills amp, look no further than the FiiO E11. The design complements many smart phones and mp3 players you may be using it with and it's light as a feather.<br /><br />Don't expect a flat sound EQ though. This amp does add some color to your music, only in a good way however. There is a slight bass increase even on EQ setting 0 but the bass I experienced is tighter and better depth so it's a win. I normally leave the EQ on 0 as only the biggest bass heads will want to turn the EQ to 1 or 2.<br /><br />Powers the Audio Technica M-50/V-Moda M-100 and Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro wonderfully although if you are using this with Beyers, might I suggest switching to high gain as the high gain does some great things with the sound stage on the Beyers.<br /><br />For a portable amp it doesn't get better at this price point. Hit the buy now.

B0093BUWGE|4.0|Musician Jos&eacute; James further asserts reason to believe that R&B music is NOT dead. Describable artistically as an amalgam of soul and jazz in addition to other influences, the talented vocalist delivers a strong punch on 2013's [[ASIN:B0093BUWGE No Beginning No End]].  His first recording for esteemed jazz label Blue Note, James does not concern himself with being characterized as a jazz artist; he is most concerned about being an artist. The results, hence, are nothing short of sound and ultimately enjoyable. No Beginning No End follows up 2010's [[ASIN:B003JRD7Y2 For All We Know]].<br /><br />\\"It's All Over Your Body\\" sets the tone, establishing a soulful, jazz-influenced groove within bass and drums.  Horns further accentuate the production and the cool sound. Much like the production, James adheres to a soulful, yet cool and relaxed vocal approach. The results yield a superb opener and one of the effort's crowing achievements.  \\"Sword + Gun\\" loses no momentum, sporting a funky bass line and an ethnic percussion styled groove.  Guest Hindi Zahra adds subtle vocal contributions, complementing James's chill vocals.  A desirable timbre, \\"Sword + Gun\\" possesses a hypnotic effect.<br /><br />\\"Trouble\\" argues for the top spot on the set.  Soulful and more overtly R&B than many, \\"Trouble\\" may be one of the shorter cuts, but proves to be one of the most fiery. Driven even more by the appearance of organ, James remains cool, but does so passionately. \\"I need someone like you, to understand my heart baby and my soul,\\" he sings on the memorable chorus.  He keeps up the pace on the urban-smooth jazz production work of \\"Vanguard\\", which is driven by electric piano, a full/present bass line, and conservative, albeit rhythmic drums. As relaxed as always, James \\"tells\\" so much by stepping back.  The laziness of the sound is an attribute, particularly by the end when drums, bass, and electric piano are rhythmically out of sync with one another.<br /><br />On \\"Come To My Door\\", Jos&eacute; James channels Bill Withers.  Never rushed, the cut paces itself naturally and by the end takes its time to unwind. \\"...Oh you can come to my door, I don't mind, I don't mind...\\" James sings, supported by backing vocals.  He is assisted from R&B singer/songwriter Emily King ([[ASIN:B000TJ6AME East Side Story]]) on \\"Heaven On The Ground\\".  King receives a bigger role than Hindi Zahra did on her turn on \\"Sword + Gun\\", taking the reins on the second verse.  When James and King sing together, they complement each other superbly.<br /><br />\\"Do You Feel\\" is a showstopper, sporting a six-feel and overtly leaning in a gospel-blues direction.  A cut R&B singer D'Angelo would 'eat up', James absolutely slays it.  Laden with bluesy piano licks and soul-wrenching organ, \\"Do You Feel\\" is one of the quickest seven plus minutes cuts you will ever hear.  Propensity for predictability exits upon the unpredictable bridge section, which adheres to the angularity of jazz harmonic progression.  If \\"Trouble\\" packs a savvy punch in three-and-a-half, \\"Do You Feel\\" provides a TKO.<br /><br />\\"Make It Right\\" keeps momentum lofty following \\"Do You Feel\\", honing in on jazz sensibility. \\"Birds of Space\\" ends up being the lengthiest cut of the album, drenched in lushness and characterized by slow tempo.  It's not bad by any means, but perhaps a bit too ambitious in its length.  \\"No Beginning No End\\" delivers a solid, organic title cut steeped in neo-soul sensibility. Penultimate cut \\"Tomorrow\\" utilizes strings and a more stripped sound. As always, James's vocals are pure.  Closing cut \\"Come To My Door\\" arrives as an acoustic bonus track.<br /><br />All-in-all, [[ASIN:B0093BUWGE No Beginning No End]] is a solid R&B album. Soulful, cool, and reserved, Jos&eacute; James proves you don't ever have to over-sing to make your audience feel your passion. A class act, James sounds fantastic and easily conveys his artistic vision through his fourth solo studio album. Highly recommended.sé James channels Bill Withers.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is my very first book review.  I read Hopeless and immediately fell in love with the characters.  I couldn't put it down.  In fact, I have to share that never have I read the same book more than once until I read Hopeless.  This book became my new favorite!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Rarely have I read a book that I had so much trouble putting down. This series captured me. The professional reviews are so divided, but I believe that the ones who don't like it are people who are not as in touch with their inner selves. This author nails human emotional nuance, especially romantic struggles, better than any other. This is not a series that should be read by teens or anyone without a decade of sexual experience under their belt as they may miss a lot of subtext and fail to understand...which I also believe is where some of the young pro reviewers miss out. I found the story line very entertaining.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|cute movie for all ages - lots of talent and very funny!  the singing is great. highly reommend for anyone that is looking for some easy watching.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found this as  exciting and interesting as the first book.. I am really looking forward to the next book.
B00968THRE|5.0|I was not expecting this album to be that good because I wasn't particularly a fan of Ellie's previous album or EPs, but upon listening to Halcyon by recommendation, I was blown away. Yes, this is an electronic album, but Ellie uses electronic sounds like real instruments to create a very deep and soulful album that happens to be futuristic. You will not regret this album. Ellie is both a pianist and a vocalist, and it shows throughout. At least give the deluxe version a download, if you don't purchase it -- but I think you'll be compelled after just one listen to do so (or two, from wanting to re-experience it). I hope that all albums of future generations have the amount of uniqueness that this one has, not letting its genre of electronic dance music keep it from being an emotional journey.

B0095P31L6|3.0|Predictable, vaguely insulting to it's character 0-caloric story. It's not bad; to be bad it would have to elicit an emotional reaction, or do something wrong - but the movie never leaves it's formula. Never steps outside it's boundies. Wholly unimpressive, but not terrible...

0812984412|3.0|Cloud Atlas is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It is structured in a way that makes for a great deal of work on the part of the reader (this is definitely not a fast read), but I felt it was worth it, if only for the persistent allure of a mystery about to be unraveled.<br /><br />Essentially, David Mitchell's book is a set of seven independent stories, told over a period of time that spans from the early 19th century to the far future. Each story is told in a temporally ascending order using a unique style and voice typical of the period.  Each one breaks off at a high point (the first stops in the middle of a sentence - I was sure a page had been torn from the book), to be continued in reverse after the apex of the pyramid (the seventh tale).<br /><br />Although Mitchell's writing is masterful, and his use of voice fascinating, I began to have doubts roughly a third of the way through the book. One of the characters accuses the narrator of that section of being a \\"hawker of fatuous gimmickry, \\" an accusation that might well be leveled against Mitchell himself were it not for the skill with which he wields the written word. By the second half of the book, it became clear that what Mitchell had done was to write seven unrelated novellas, split them in half and reassemble them. The connections between the characters were superfluous at best (the comet-shaped birthmark was a red herring, meaningless to the plot or characters). And although references are made to the other sections, there really is no unifying force or plot element that binds them all to each other. Even the final philosophic musings of our first narrator do not suffice to give cohesion to the stories, or to solve the mystery which we, as readers, had trusted the author to eventually clarify.<br /><br />Ultimately, although I enjoyed this book, and consider Mitchell to be a first-rate wordsmith, I had so many reservations about how he structured his story, and the ad hoc manner in which he attempted to tie these disparate tales together, I had to conclude that, like his 1930s composer of section two, he was a \\"hawker of gimmickry\\" rather than real artistry.hich he attempted to tie these disparate tales together, I had to conclude that, like his 1930s composer of section two, he was a \\"hawker of gimmickry\\" rather than real artistry.

B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This game is a lot more than I expected. The graphics are rudimentary but fun and the puzzles  are fun and challenging.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector is the same, &#34;can't put it down&#34; fast moving novel we've grown to love from Tom Clancy.  I've read every one of his works and this may be the best ever.  In fact, I first ordered it for my Kindle and then ordered the hard-bound just because I didn't want it missing from my bookshelf collection.  Clancy's spellbinding descriptions have enthralled us since &#34;Hunt for the Red October&#34; and this is no exception.  You will love this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was an avid laptop pinner before downloading the app. loved pinterest then, but I'm now crazy in love with the app on my droid, kindle fire, and iPad. it's much easier and more convenient to pin via touch. now you'll spend days opposed to hours pinning!

B007URVZJ6|5.0|This \\"how to\\" book is short, easy to follow, and totally accurate!  I used it to publish \\"Talks with Nature,\\" without any errors.  All of the steps are up-to-date, and there is no extra, confusing information.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far I'm really enjoying this app. I mostly downloaded it for something to kill time, which it does well. It's also fun and something I can distract my little one with. No complaints so far.
B003IDMUPO|5.0|A great look into the life of Gordon Ramsay.  Once you have read this book you will respect the man and understand why he comes across as intolerable in his various TV programmes.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time. As a retired engineer I was surprised at the depth of the detail that was presented.  What a fun book to read.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Can anyone ever get enough of Hugh Grants accent? I love this movie - it always gets me in the Christmas mood.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|This game would be great, except once you get through a couple of levels, you have to buy the full version to continue.  I get that the company needs sales to keep in business, but it shouldn't be advertized as \\"free\\", when it's really a trial version...
B007PT1PEY|4.0|I hate e-books, but I've been reading this on my iPhone on the train, and enjoying it. It's a great set of stories of course, which helps...
B00992CF6W|4.0|overall it is a pretty good app, but it would be better if amazon app store buyers, could get the 5.0 update
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Quick and easy way to catch up on the shows I miss! Plus it is super suspenseful and always keeps me guessing!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game a lot.  I tried another one but this app is far buy the best. Thank you!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|As are all his books, this was suspenseful till the end. I would've liked to know what happens to all the players going forward but I guess that could be another novel in itself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Would highly recommend to others! The suspense you feel about who she will choose and if Peeta will ever recover.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A great way to pass the time, I love the graphics and game play. I absolutely love the features it has.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I loved it! Could hardly put it down once I started it. The author did a great job<br />of switching from one date to another. Have recommended it many times.

B001G7HKZ4|5.0|This movie was such a great surprise.  I wasn't sure what to expect since I had not read the book/short story but I truly loved the entire movie.  The plot moved along well but still held several surprising turns.

B003H6KRIE|4.0|This was cheaper than the shops, even with postage. And it was exactly as its described. Also, the code matched my DVD player
B002BRRTUO|4.0|So I watched this movie based on the fact that they referenced and mentioned it several times in the Movie &#34; Ted&#34;. I must say it's one of those 80s Scifi fantasy flicks that is so cheesy that it becomes a classic. The soundtrack is performed by Queen and it's almost to the same level as &#34;Highlander&#34;, although, in the latter they did a better job. It's a must see for those that enjoy Scifi and one man versus the evil dictator. Classic!!
B007RTAR64|4.0|This is a pretty good representation of Katniss.  The only negatives that I saw was the bow and the hair.  The bow is unable to stay in her hand without the box ties and her hair is not plaited correctly.  Other than that she is a great doll!

B008XG1X18|4.0|I have this on my kindle Fire and sometimes it freezes up. It is easier to use Pinterest on the internet than the app. You also cannot view more than around 10 notifications , and only the most recent show up.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|i think not. done with the series. would understand if the book was brand new but two more have came out since then.
B00ACB9Z3U|5.0|I got this to complete my seasons of the Show (that's currently out on dvd) They work wonderfully and I am very happy. Not much else to write about.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I selected Wool largely at random.  I read the sample and was drawn to the initial characters, the setting and the direction the story line seemed to be taking.  I got totally caught up in the intrigue and the plight of all of the characters as the plot evolved. Howey left me constantly wondering how the story would end, and when it did, I wanted more.  This was a great read!
B005HSL626|4.0|Great way to waste time when you have nothing else to do. I like that there are options to play timed or the one with bombs
B00A23MYCC|5.0|it has a very simple plot but at the same time very very funny definitely a must see if your fan of Family Guy or any of his other animated series
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Need more Pendergast sooner!<br />Love the ending but not as good as the early ones. Need to get more supernatural.
B009CG955Y|5.0|My grandson  and me just love this movie. It gives us a really good feeling and the music we sing the songs all day long,
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Read the whole thing in one sitting. The main character is convincingly old but we never get an idea of the vast age, if you understand.  Overall I liked it.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Easy to understand 'sciencey' explanations on how processed food/drinks are the root of all evil. Great introduction to Paleo lifestyle. Wish I could use this book in high school health class.
B0085LMFAE|4.0|Great album!  Sounds just as great as my original 'cassette' tape from yester-years!  Any fan of Paul Simon will enjoy this remastered version.
B005LAII8K|5.0|We saw this in the theater and it really stuck with us.  My hubby talked about it for months and wanted to add it to our disc collection, which doesn't happen very often.  He really loved the cinematography.  We enjoy sci-fi/fantasy, apocalyptic, drama and some action types (LOTR/Firefly/Inception/WalkingDead/ManonFire).  We thought the acting in this was fantastic, especially the kid actor.  The story was new and thought-provoking.  It was futuristic, but imagined in a way that still felt familiar and plausible.  Also, I love JGL and Emily Blunt.  Two of my favorite actors.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down it got to the point where my parents took my kindle so I would get sleep for school the next day<br /><br />Though I do here that the first one is the best I will have to disagree on that one(i haven't read the third and final one yet though so this opinion might change)
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I loved the book (I even saw the movie first and I don't think it ruined anything). Definitely a worthwhile read!
B00999DFP0|2.0|technically i should've given this review 3-stars (5 stars for each o' the 1st 3 seasons, and 1 star each for seasons 4 & 5......divided by 5 = 3.4), but i chose to xploit the fact that no one had written anything for the 2-star slot, so 2 stars became the shortest distance......anyway<br /><br />no doubt i'm in the minority here, but i lament the unquestionable loss o' that which made this series truly unique in the 1st place, that which has been steadily losing momentum during the last 2 seasons (and no doubt is continuing to occur in season 6)<br /><br />i don't always collect things sequentially; so this last xmas i was sent the one season i was missing - s2.  i had picked up s5 while i was visiting family in october cause i actually found a copy for $25 (not even on amazon was that possible back then).  however i held off watching it until i returned home, i even watched disk 4 o' s4 to help set the stage.....however s5 failed to really hold my attention - even after repeated viewing. in fact since then i had also been watching s4 more in an effort to want to like it; yet it simply never solidified into anything i could recommend.  sure there are sporadic moments which made me laugh, but the direction o' the show had quantifiably shifted<br /><br />in between watching s5 and the arrival o' s2 i read an article in an ish o' entertainment, and while i found myself disagreeing w/ much the author had to say about the show it wasn't until i received s2 and popped in the 1st disk that my suspicions were utterly confirmed.......<br /><br />the all too predictable focus on relationship conundrums has been steadily eroding the ONLY interesting aspects o' what made this series genuinely original in the 1st place; and if they don't find a way to bring it back then i'm most likely going to give away the last 2 seasons, cause they really aren't as engaging as the first 3.  like many who instantly gravitated to the series i LOVED all the scientific references, the `inside' math jokes, even the cursory celebrations o' nerd culture (despite the heavy-handed emphasis o' dc over marvel); but sadly BBT has become much more about the most superficial trappings o' nerdom rather than about mining the precious nuggets o' humor based on the actual glories o' math & science - and even their awkward xtrapolations into the amerikan social spheres.  it's no accident that their oft touted impressive leap (almost quantum-like given the arena in which it occurred) in viewership coincided precisely during the season when the math & science took an unmistakable backseat to the stereotypical plights o' relationship foibles - that tried & true safe constant o' ALL popular sitcoms.  personally i don't give a lab rat's ass if leonard and penny EVER hook up, they so aren't ross & rachel - that high-water mark which nearly every romantic probability will forever be compared.  however let us not forget that what made this show such a singular phenomenon in the 1st place was the fascinating interactions o' a gaggle o' PhD holders (and their plus one MIT graduate) and their erratic orbits around one another; the pole-star being a particularly eccentric `alpha' nerd<br /><br />it's bad enough our country scores so low against other nations in the disciplines o' math & science, must we also dumb down our writing skills to cater to such pathetically low xpectations ???
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and fun to watch! We enjoyed Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams working together. I would highly suggest watching this movie.
B004PGO25O|5.0|After reading\\"The War of Art\\" I became an immediate fan of Pressfields.  Hungry for more, I decided to get the rest of hid nonfiction books and see what else he had to say on the subject of \\"resistance\\",  and \\"Do the Work\\" was a fantastic follow up.  If these books don't motivate you to become the person you've always wanted to become but were to scared to , then I don't know what will.  This book will change your life.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|if you like puzzles this is a good one.  you have to really use your brain and memory. I found it enjoyable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a wonderful read! It had such real situations that one can relate to. I connected with the characters and that defiantly makes for a good read! I can not wait to watch the movie. I have seen a few Nicholas Sparks movies but this the first book of his I have read. I have been missing out and will defiantly be reading more.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is an outstanding movie for children and adults alike.  It is both entertaining and thought provoking.  The animation and cinematography is supurb.  The music is beautiful, and its' choreography is awesome.  I'm not usually a fan of Tom Hanks, but his multiple performances are memorable, and captivating!
B0056CUZRA|4.0|After downloading this book to my kindle and reading it on the weekend I realised that I had read it before.<br />Great read - love Ken Follett's books.<br /><br />When is his next book?<br />Christine (Virgo) Frith
B007URVZJ6|5.0|In assisting a friend to edit his book, I realized I should aquaint myself with the Kindle process. I found Building Your Book for Kindle to be the ultimate resource in preparing (me) for this task. Short, concise, yet packed with pertinent information every successful author and/or editor of Kindle books should know!
B007RTAR64|2.0|found for much less in Shop Rite! Over priced but  good quality, would love to see Hippie Barbie re-issued, maybe a Julia Childs Barbie!
B009DT9ANW|5.0|First half is great, Peter rolls through the entire album, but the second side blew me away. You gotta get this one!
0425252868|3.0|Was greatly disappointed that there were no photos of the bomber when she return to base. Ive seen photos online in different forward emails, but I expected the book to have them. I gave the book away.<br /><br />Ray Selvig USN Ret.
B000I9X53W|5.0|Great acting by all, story compelling, happy ending, and great wardrobes! Well ahead of its time, brought out subject matter still relevant today.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Have read every one of his books so far. He is so knowledgeable and tells things like they are - not how the media want you to think they are.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|This is a great looking watch with awesome features at an amazing price. The &#34;sweeping second hand&#34; and &#34;crystal backing&#34; were two selling points for me, and I could not be happier. To address some things other people have mentioned: yes the counterweight for winder is loud, but only noticeable when you shake the watch around your ear. The face is smaller than other &#34;in style&#34; watches but this watch is made too look old. Up until this weekend the watch has been less than 4 seconds off of current time and date. This weekend after a ski trip it is now off by 12 seconds, but I spent a great deal of time in &#60;20 degree weather. and P.S. it did go through some shock and falls.<br />This is a great looking value, I want more of them in black and tan.
B008OB5E9O|5.0|This is a book to read to babies, children, adults, and your parents or friends.  Whenever there is any question about the cycle of life--what goes around comes around--this is the book and the only book.  Yes, it harkens back to a simpler time, but this is my standard baby's gift and seems to be universally appreciated.  Note also that this is still my daughter and my favorite book to share and she is already 33.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I have multiple Wifi networks to deal with.  This piece of software makes knowing what networks are up and their strength a trivial exercise.  It has bar charts for strength and a &#34;radar map&#34; sort of display, by frequency.  I consider it indispensible.
B0036MDNN0|5.0|a very detailed model of an unusual, more recent fossil.  It's nice to see some of the more unusual species represented.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|An easy and sexy read. Love at first site?  You'll have to read to find out!  A unique story to say the least.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app sucks on kindle fire hd. It takes forever to open up, then it won't load up most photos. The facebook app works better on my Droid 3. It also worked better on my old original kindle fire, so I' m thinking it needs tweaking to work on the fire hd. Please fix this, soon?
B0072IUZUS|5.0|The dragon has good color scheme and exceptional detail, in a reasonably large and durable model.  Detachable rider made the dragon model better as an independent model by itself.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves hidden object games! I just wish it was a little longer...lol.  I just can't get enough of these kind of games!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|After watching the Granada series with Jeremy Brett and the BBC series with Benedict Cumberbatch and reading the original stories, I came to this show with curiosity and an affection for Lucy Liu. It was different than I'd been led to expect and far more interesting. The series takes elements of the original stories and re-shuffles them into a new order. Holmes is still an Englishman, but he lives in New York. His addiction, barely a problem in the Conan Doyle stories, now takes front and center, and Joan Watson comes into his life as a sober companion, a 24/7 watchdog hired by Holmes's father. Captain Toby Gregson, ably played by Aidan Quinn as a solid New York copper, is Holmes's connection to the NYPD. The focus of the series is not on the cases, but rather on the slowly developing relationships of the characters and how they change one another--not merely Holmes and Watson, though they are primary, but also Holmes and Gregson, Gregson and Watson. What makes it even more interesting is that there is so far no hint of any romantic interest between the two main characters, only a carefully constructed friendship that is more delicate and touching than the standard will-they-won't-they arc. I definitely recommend this to people who like a little detective work with their character development.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is great I can't wait to finish the season.  The clothing & actors are great.  The really portray the charcters very well.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|I watched the first episode of season one. I love this kind of genre and I was looking forward to watching the series. But I'm afraid it includes too much language, nudity and violence for my taste.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|I had heard the song..Glad Rag Doll..on the internet and thought I'd enjoy the rest of the CD, but I found myself just skipping all of the other songs so I tossed it :o(
B000FC12C8|5.0|This is the only book you need to read about investing. In the land of snake oil salesmen, half-baked theories, Untrue truths and ultra short attention spans i.e. the stock market, Benjamin Graham shone a bright and lonely light to guide helpless souls. This book is an eternal and timeless masterpiece.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The writing isn't anything to go crazy over, but the movie is funny and good entertainment. Worth watching another time even.
B0091LRZZW|4.0|Since I am a long-time fan of Paul McCartney, I really liked this album.  I don't know why I don't really really love it, but it is soothing as I am driving along.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is something were you can expirence something that can realy happen in life its something anybody should be able to play and expirence
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Totally addicted to the family and happenings.  Marvelous costumes and acting.  Storyline and the way the plot enter twines just captures the imagination and can hardly wait for the net episode
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|The book was enjoyable, but predictable.  I'm usually pretty oblivious when it comes to guessing where the plot is going, but I was able to pick out most of the major developments before they happened.  For a younger reader, I'm sure it would be great.  I still liked reading it and will probably read the rest of the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fantastic!!! Riveting........brought me out of a 15 yr book reading slumber. Thank u thank u!!<br /><br />Can't wait for book 2!
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Not as clever as the first one, but my 7-year-old daughter loved it just the same.  Definitely worth renting.  Maybe not worth owning.
145210655X|5.0|it was a quick read, put a smile on my face and made me giggle. It would be interesting to have Darth Vader as a dad.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is fun to play when I need some down time. We enjoy spider all the time at my house.
B007XF4J70|5.0|I recently purchased this for a Casablanca party we hosted.  We already owned this on DVD, so my husband was dubious about spending the money to purchase another copy.  Most of our guests had seen this movie MANY times before and they commented on the increased picture quality.  I recommend it.
140191716X|5.0|Love this book. I just open the book and it always seems to open to a page that I need for that day. it helps me so much. Such a simple concept that has been a great source of inspiration for me.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Not a fantastic movie, but the acting was quite good and the historical aspects were interesting but could have been elaborated more and integrated into the storyline. The villain was fairly one-dimensional, and could have been developed further.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Fantastic entertainment!!! Love this whole series! Amazon made it so easy to watch! Can't wait to watch the rest of this!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|An easy read, and it surprised me with an interesting underlying plot. However, it gets very repetitive so I got annoyed at some points.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Not an incredible movie, but I thought it was funny and had a compelling storyline. The acting and cinematography was also good and made the film a pleasure to watch.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|It was an ok movie but not as good as I expected. The actors are very talanted but story could have been better
B007N3A2F0|4.0|This CD is very good, but there seems to be something missing. I feel this way everytime I listen to a CD by Sonata Arctica. I don't know exactly what it is. Aside from that, it is a very good CD, one of their best.
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|I can see why this is the non-Trekkie favorite. The humor is great, the storyline is great, the writing is great. The only thing is that there is not enough background of the story - I was left with so many questions...Overall, this was highly enjoyable.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is a wondderful period piece showing with reality the way of life in English high arcy in a very human way. The relationships between the servants and people they serve. LOVE THIS SERIES
B008RZF2I0|5.0|I really like Kamelot and really enjoyed this CD. I did not get the one with the bonus DVD, but wish I had.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Not great, not bad. Some aspects of the storyline seemed a little out-of-the-blue and didn't add much to the story.
B005LAIISA|4.0|Funny,exciting, great entertainment for whole family! these characters are loveable and always overcome all the ostables put in their way and the squirrel is huliarious
B008Y5OW20|3.0|We were disappointed in this CD. We thought it would be more along the lines of the Traveling Wilburys. It is good for what it is, but not at all what we expected.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I am hooked on this series.  I can't wait to finish them to know everything that happens. Though I will be sad when I am done, all the same.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|AMAZING GAME<br />this game is one of t h e best available for the kindle fire. And it's for free
B00005UWP1|1.0|This is an import and does not play in most all American DVD players, so buyer beware, don't buy it!
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|This was such a Great book. I am so excited to read the next one. It left me wanting more.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|I mean come on this is really hard . I like gameplay and concept but had to play level 10 on undead spear like 4o or 50 Times b4 I cold beat it . I wnt spend that kinda $ to get past 1st floor when theres only 40 to 5o totally and sent take but few min . I wanna top notch weapon and all skills possible b4 I've played every level so many times I wldnt want to play whenever I had time
B002ZG977Y|4.0|This was an entertaining movie, but lacked the character building and story development needed to make it a hit.  The special effects were quite good.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is very tricky, and I like that. it is fun and makes you think. if you're completely in the dark about completing a level, the creators  give you hints.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is life like. The graphics are great for being free. I'm not much of a gamer, but this I'll stick with.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|This movie should have had everything needed to make it a hit, but just lacked the character development and story line development.  The special effects were very good.
0823015033|4.0|I found this book to be overly technical (especially with the measurements) and difficult to understand in full detail. The sculptures are stiff and generic.<br />Also the armatures are very poorly structured and explained even worse.<br /><br />I do think the book is worth a look at, if you already know your way around polymer clay and simple figure making. It offers good tips and ideas on how to make humanoid figures. The 'lifelike' part is something you must learn on your own.<br /><br />This is certainly not the ultimate guide to sculpting humans, by a long shot. But it is interesting to look at Katherine Dewey's techniques.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Very enchanting, and addicting to read. The writer is so good at making you feel like your in the circus. I just loved this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read, can't wait to compare to movie! It keeps you reading and hoping for an ending that is happy for all four.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I like Rio, Seasons & regular Angry Birds a lot better. These moon things just don't do it for me, I never play them but maybe others enjoy them?
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Love this book how you realise with the character of Rachel how bad her addiction is. Brilliant read, and re-read
0446585041|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It made laugh so much and so hard. Definitely a positive energizer. Absolutely recommended :)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was about to give up on this book half way through, but things started to happen and I couldn't put it down until I was done.  After half way through the beginning makes more sense.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is an excellent game, not only for fun, but for eye coordination and memory.  I feel this is a great game for senior citizens, also.  There are many different displays (game layouts) to choose from.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love everything about NCIS, and Season 10 is no different! A winning combination of drama, comedy & action! The writing is fantastic, actors do an outstanding job as well! I highly recommend the two-parter of Shell Shock I/II, Gone & Shabbat Shalom/ Shiva.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I loved the movie and enjoyed the book as well.  Slightly different ending with the love interest for Rue. Great read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games trilogy was just as good as  the 1st book. Actually if not better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was a little late on reading this book, however, it has been one of the most well thought out and interesting books I have ever read. I loved the nature of this Novel. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read!
B009VA1FN6|3.0|This book was ok, but I can't say more than that, mainly because the main character wasn't very likeable or even interesting. There is a reason for that, which is revealed through some clever twists, but by then I'd lost interest. I will try some other books by this author though, because it was well written.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved how interesting it got. it was fun to solve the mystery. the graphics are awesome. I recommend getting it!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|when I started it was fun until it reset by its self like I had bought a person that cost 70000 coins and now I don't have it
0670026603|5.0|I'm finding it hard to put into words my feelings about this book. I loved it and I hated it all at the same time (though there was much more love than hate). I couldn't put it down while I was reading it, and I couldn't stop thinking about when I finished. There were parts of the story that I did not like or agree with (thus the hate), but at the same time, I have an appreciation for the story and the points of view of the characters that may be different from mine.<br /><br />I knew very little about the book before I picked it up, and I think that is a good thing. So I won't spoil too much here. Don't read too much about this book; just read the book yourself and let the story unfold for itself!<br /><br />This is the story of Will, a man suffering serious injuries from a motorcycle accident, and Lou, the woman hired to care for him. And it is a romance, though that term is misleading. It is a love story, but it definitely doesn't read like a traditional romance novel. The cover makes it look like a light and fluffy romance, but this is a book that you shouldn't judge by its cover.<br /><br />It is a fairly predictable story, and I had a feeling where it was headed early on in the book. But it was still enjoyable and unforgettable to read the story of Will and Lou and about how they ended up where they did. It is a book that I will remember for a very long time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome book!  Extremely catchy story :) Not many books keep me motivated and curious enough to see what will happen next. I am ready to start the third book!!
0061743526|4.0|The book is a good read.  I read this book in middle school and now my daughter has to read it in middle school.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a great story, just the right amount of action and detail. I enjoyed every minute of it and adding in the scientific facts made it that much more enjoyable.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I missed one episode!!! I was mortified, but found it at Amazon.com. It was quick and the price was good. I will try not to miss another one again.. This show is great!!
0812982622|5.0|Having read all of Johnson's earlier works, it wasn't clear to me that he was a novel writer, rather than just a short story master. But he's left behind some of the incandescent, self-conscious virtuosity to mine extraordinary depths of human emotion and insight. It's a terrific, moving book that feels true to the claustrophobia of North Korean life--and the humanity that makes even the strangest scenarios recognizable.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I was only able to watch 45 minutes of this video. Highly considering switching to Apple products! Very very dissapointed.
B00884GR0W|4.0|If you like Minecraft, you'll love this. The authors have many new features they're working on for the next update that could make the product exciting.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|I was never able to get this video to finish loading. Highly considering switching to Apple products! Very very dissapointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app with good features.  Built in bible studies make it easy to read God`s word.  Also easy to search and navigate.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very fun! Makes you really search for the different paths to take, outside the box. Will recommend to others.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|'Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore' is a contemporary story set in San Francisco involving an underemployed 'techie' and an ancient cult who collide in an unusual bookstore.  Unique storyline and well told.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty impressive and varied game play. Good graphics.<br />Like the tasks and competition.  Ready to buy more horses. Addictive. Enjoying the game a lot.
B009MO5G90|5.0|The movie was great but the 3D fell a little short compared to the Afterlife movie. Still a good movie..
0446554995|4.0|I just finished Two Graves less than an hour ago, and the pleasure will last for a while. As always the Preston/Childs<br />books please.  I'm all set and ready for the next one.
B000B5MI3Q|3.0|Had to have to buy a watch winder to keep it going over 12 hours.  Manual states 40 hours but 12 is best
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Very compelling story.  Would recommend reading the books on order, although I did not and this could stand on its own. Read if you like some fantasy in a thriller
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you want information this is the place to find it. But be warned, it is addictive, once you start looking it's hard to stop!!!! Lol
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Jane Austin's heroines are dignified, passionate, and embody a distinct feminine strength I find compelling and unique. Beautifully written and sheer pleasure to read.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is really fun but I wish you didn't have to wait to get coins to unlock all the games!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Alright I'm a Minecraft fan and I love Minecraft, so you can't keep me from knowing if there is an update available.I've tried and tried to get it and I can't.I bate that.  :(
B0063GORYU|4.0|The visuals were fine and it played well with realistic odds. A good buy like the other MobilityWare card games.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Everyone in our family likes this game.  The only problem is...once you start playing, it's hard to quit!<br />Some of the levels can get frustrating because it almost seems impossible to pass them.
0439023483|2.0|The preview reaally sucks you in big time- I read it before buying the book and thought, yeah why not seems like an Ok story.<br />And then I read it.<br />After the first chapter the story goes downhill- no actually more of a dead drop straight down. The first person point of view tends to jump from past tense and then back to present all over the pages. The lovesick character of Peeta is immature and ridiculous.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|The book started off well but the story line became somewhat implausible and somewhat stupid. It certainly didn't rate the four or five stars that previous readers gave it.
0345803485|1.0|About 3 chapters into the book I had to look the author up to make sure she wasn't 14 years old.  The entire book is the exact same chapter written over and over again with slight changes in the scenery.  She (Ana Steele) is stupid, and I do mean stupid and he (Christian Grey) treats her like property...literally.  She alternates between blushing, biting her lower lip, and saying \\"jeez\\", to dropping f-bombs at the drop of a hat; and he is so out of control that's it impossible to imagine this guy creating and running a billion dollar company.  The jealousy between the both of them is profoundly unhealthy and damaging, and yet presented within the book as normal displays of love.  The sex becomes incredibly boring very quickly, and I actually found myself becoming angry when he would do something awful to her and then they would have sex and all would be forgiven.  Now I'm all for makeup sex, but I'm also for a relationship where both partners stand on equal ground and \\"playtime\\" doesn't include the man treating the woman as a business asset.  In 40 years of reading books, many many books I think this might rank as the most poorly written (didn't the publishing company have an editor??) and poorly told story I have ever read.  EVER.  Ana Steel actually talks about her genitalia as \\"down there\\".  Seriously?  If you are 12-14 this will probably give you a few thrills;  but if I had a teenage daughter, I would not want her reading this horribly written misogynistic junk.
B008S4FZHI|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Scarpetta and The Book Of The Dead. However,since these two were published, Patricia Cornwell has gradually gone off the boil with subsequent books. I found The Bone Bed dull, had a story line that was padded out with trivia, and was lucky to rate a two star.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I really enjoyed all of the books.  I know there are lots of mixed opinons on these books but I thought they were great.  I loved the charcters and thought it was a great love story, about two people finding and helping each other.  It not a mills and boons type book, and I don't think they have been described well in the media - I didn't think they were that rude!  Summary good book good read!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who loves to read. All of the classic elements of a Sparks novel are present. He goes one step further by approaching a subject new to him: domestic abuse. I enjoyed reading from different character's points of view. I feel this gives the reader a well rounded story. I loved this book, but of course I expect nothing less when reading anything by Nicholas Sparks :)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was the worst book I have ever read please don't check out this book or buy it at a store
B005K17RU0|3.0|This is an ok app for kindle fire. Nothing too fancy but very very usefull. Fine free app. Thanx for reading me

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely awesome, and I'm a guy saying that. It's fantastic and so incredibly thoughtful and thought provoking. It makes me evaluate so many things. What an incredible book.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|My Kids Can Get Enought Toy Story…. All They Want Is To See It Over And Over….I'm Telling You They Just Can Get Enought….
B004IV32HU|5.0|This is one of those movies I've been meaning to see for years, but never got around to it. Well I finally did and happy because of it. I cannot describe how much I loved this movie. The acting, the story, the cinematography, the music, the sets, the characters, I loved everything about it. The performance from Johnny Depp is phenomenal and confident, but it doesn't stop there. All of the side characters are brilliantly portrayed, my favorite being Bill Murray. And of course Martin Landau's Oscar nominated portrayal of Bela Lugosi is equally heartbreaking and inspiring, proof that sometimes the Academy knows what they're doing. All of the classic Burton elements are here, but in a very subtle fashion that doesn't get in the way of the story. They're so subtle that I had to keep reminding myself throughout the film that it was directed by Tim Burton. It may not be his most original film in the visual sense, but it really is his best film in terms of just overall impact. It is the story of a man who just wants to be himself no matter what others say. Although Ed Wood may have the been the worst filmmaker of all time, he sure was an original who loved his work and loved his life. It will leave you inspired and smiling. If you're on the fence about this one because you're not a fan of Burton/Depp collaborations, believe me I get why you wouldn't be, throw those doubts away and just give this underrated gem a chance. You will not regret it.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think that this game is boring because all you do is tap on something and wait for it to finish.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Harder than other similar hidden object games and good amount of gameplay. Hope the sequel is as good as this one.
