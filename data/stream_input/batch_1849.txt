B0053O89IS|5.0|I love the new turn of the movie with Bones and Booth having a baby together. Its great to see Bones putting logic aside and embracing being a mother. I can't wait to see what happens next~
B004UID2LC|5.0|Outstanding! Can copy and review Youtube on my Nexus 7 without using Wi-fi. A real winner here. Thank You! Wo
B001DDBCUA|5.0|The show was great, and the movie was a great tie in to the show. I didn't want Carrie to end up with Big since I loved Aiden, and then after what he does to her on their wedding day made it worse.... but thats what a good show does. It gets you sucked in and makes you think the characters are real. I loved it!!
0140149295|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my aunt.  She loves the book.  She is an avid reader of unusual books and specifically mentioned this one.  So I got it for her.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I wasn't sure I liked the show at first, it seemed kind of childish. But after a few episodes I really got into it and ended up buying it on Bluray. I can't wait for Season 2 to come out on Bluray~
B0064HJX56|5.0|very unique story and interesting characters loved  all the details to make this story so great and couldn't put it down
B00936A0RU|2.0|DVD has some sound problems and static not very good quality. So please advise others. Music hard to hear. Film not very well seen.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Draw something is a fantastic app for friends to play. Draw a picture of a word and try to have the other person get it right. If you get it right, you can earn coins to buy new colors and bombs. You can find friends by email, Facebook and Twitter and I would highly recommend it to anyone with a android or kindle! And you know what the best part is? It's free!  :)
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Have multiple types of compilations of the Stones but this adds just the right songs to complete a nice history.<br />Perfect for gifts to non fanatics.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent !!  The story line, the sex . Kept me enthralled. Read in 1 day. A must read for the entire series
B0058YPL66|5.0|I love this series! It so cleverly turns favorite fairy tales on their heads while still managing to be true to the original tale. A great show to watch on a rainy day. I was skeptical when I first started watching but the storylines and the characters quickly drew me in. Happy to say I am now thoroughly addicted to this show!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|There's a reason why people talk about this series over the water cooler at work the next day--it's that good.  It's a high-brow Brit soap opera, equally at home with a bowl of popcorn (for the soap opera bits) or a fine wine, for the well done, good show, aspects that the British bring to these period dramas.<br /><br />BLUE-RAY Edition:  Quite simply drop dead gorgeous.  One of the most beautiful blu-ray sets I've bought.
B004KABG9U|5.0|The booked has good condition and I am happy to get it in such bargain price. My son like it too and read it every night!
B009LA1QW6|4.0|I have never heard of Lana Del Rey. One of several aliases she uses to call herself by. She has to me a very sensual voice but a voice that also hauntingly speaks of sadness and sorrow. After reading about her background my perspective has forever been altered. Her voice is very distinctive and I think she has the potential to rise above many well known  singers of todays genre like LADY GAGA or ALICIA KEYS for example, but will she? Apparently on SNL she bombed, it being said she can't perform well live. If she can stay sober and grounded metaphorically speaking, with her incredible vocal range and unique style the sky should be her limit.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Installed this on vacation when I needed to wake on time for scuba diving. It worked great and I was able to set it to play my favorite song
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|A friend compared my work and ambitions to Paddy Chayefsky so I had to read the screenplay to see what he meant. I was not disappointed.  How prescient Paddy was.  It's amazing how well this work stands up today.  Brilliant.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|There is no other television show out there that I love more than The Walking Dead. If you're a fan of zombies, I would definitely recommend watching this show.
0525958002|2.0|Just finished the book.I guess i had higher expectations for this.Very little insight into the music.Even less insight into the person.But i guess when you are engaging in the amount of drink and drug use he was ,you are left with careless memories.Die hards will probably enjoy it,and i would have as well in 1986.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this during a lightening deal for around $35.  It's the exact same remote we received with our Playstation 3.  That remote had been broken and just needed to be replaced.  Very happy with this purchase!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Got this blue ray at a great price and it's such a cute movie! We have watched it repeatedly we all love it!
0545128285|5.0|A definite must have for any hp fan. With commentary by the famous Albus Dumbledore, you can't help but love it!
B0056C6XIA|5.0|Really nice rubberized grip. Great feel in hand.  Good array of tools and super sharp blades. Overall a really nice set. I purchased this for my son who is a Boy Scout and a big fan of Bear. He loves it. My only complaint is the flashlight uses a twist action so it can turn on when in the holster and the holster is a bit bulky. For the money, this is a great basic camping / survival multitool set.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|There's not a thing wrong with this movie.  But it it's the same movie you've seen 50 times.  The same character actors play the CIA guys.  They probably have it on their business cards by now.  (\\"FBI-CIA agents a specialty\\").  There's the Tom Cruise/Russell Crowe/Matt Damon chase scene and the Bruce Willis/Arnold shootout scene, the knife made from broken glass, car chases and of course black SUVs in the desert.  All are done well but these things are so familiar, they seem pretty mundane.<br /><br />Denzel is excellent and you get to see a little of Cape Town which, for all it's problems, is a beautiful spot (and not quite as violent as what's in the movie).  The ending is routine but judging by the 5 star reviews, a lot of people were surprised to find things were not what they seemed at the beginning.  Fair enough, I won't give away the shocking ending.<br /><br />So...if you want action, this will do.  If you're interested in how a neophyte, caught in a dangerous situation rises to the occasion see Three Days of the Condor.
B0067EKY9K|4.0|Strange concept. At first glance, it's unlikely to catch attention. Most likely to appeal to a niche crowd. But slow down, give this charming little film sometime and you'll find yourself watching beyond fifteen minutes. Witty dialogues, great chemistry and an unusual topic makes this movie a tale of hope and faith.
B009B2U73I|4.0|Another great album from this lady .....<br />Great songs and unfortunately I would not go to a show of her since I'm here in Brazil
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|A great marriage of drama and CGI makes this a compelling movie of the year. The raw vulnerabilities of Suraj Sharma who plays the teenage Pi and the passive aggressiveness of the tiger, Richard Parker, leaves one to ponder the deeper meaning of life, existence and spirituality. You'll probably never see an animal, especially a tiger, in the same way ever again. The scene where Pi departs from Richard Parker which heads straight for the jungle without turning around makes for a devastatingly heart wrenching scene.  Once again, Ang Lee has made a superior adaptation.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Everyone on earth should hope for this trilogy to become a quadrology; the massive impact of these books is hard to overstate.<br />For forward thinking people, The 4-Hour Chef is the coup de grace that ties the rest of Ferriss's books together, and pushes you into a life of lasting satisfaction.<br />If you're looking for a good New Year's resolution, make it to read these three books.<br />Thanks Tim!
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Doesn't matter what season I love this show could go on for 10 more seasons and I would love it still.
0374531269|5.0|First off, let me warn you that this is a very difficult read due to the true real-life  subject matter. Let me also say that it is a MUST READ.  The manipulation of children by adults to do horrific acts (and it is interesting to note that Ishmael Beah barely touches on his terrible acts of violence compared to the acts the he witnessed before he was \\"drafted\\" into the war) against other children and civilians is abominable, and never more clearly demonstrated than in Mr. Beah's real-life account of his experiences.<br /><br />The casual style in which this book is written is almost disarming, drawing you in almost as if he is inviting you in for a drink.  I couldn't put the book down, but part of me also couldn't wait until it ended.  It is very intense.  It does open one's eyes to the serious world issues glossed over that every day Joe in the U.S. never hears about.  It also shows what incredible effort and work a charity organization like UNICEF does, and the dangers it's people go through.  Many times failing, but every once in a while able to turn out an Ishmael Beah, no small feat.<br /><br />One thing I see in the reviews is the question whether this is suitable for children.  Any parent considering having their child read it should probably read it first before making this delicate decision.  I personally feel not until early teens, but every parent knows their child better than I or has different personal beliefs of exposure to certain subject matters.<br /><br />I actually never bought this book, but found it on the steps to my apartment building.  It has since become one of my top treasured books of all time.<br /><br />Funny how things work out like that sometimes.
B009O36EO0|5.0|Won several awards in Sweden, best song, best singer, best new performer.  Totally awesome voice and music by Loreen and most popular winner of Eurovision contest. Highest score EVER in Europe for song Euphoria, and more.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|I liked the book, it definitely isn't a book I would say is my favorite or probably recommend it, but for the purposes of entertainment value I liked it. I was not deep or profound to me, but did give me an interesting view from another angle into the supposedly glamorous 1920's
0345803485|1.0|Everybody has been ranting about this book but please let me tell you... It's crap, it's just.... Crap. It's soooo unbelievable and mr grey is weird. I had to stop reading it.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I do love this. I'm still learning how to work it but I can go to footnotes very quick at all the verses. I use it during Bible study and I'm anxious to see all that I can look up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really am really liking the game so far. Once you get to the 3rd lv it kind of starts getting hard to get enough points to keep going (I'm making this review to get points). but great game if you looking for a time waster
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I've only uses it on my kindle a small amount of time but anything that makes ebay easier is great. I did have some trouble getting to everything on my account but that was probably just me. I need some more time to get use to it. It will be nice to be able to place a quick bid when I'm not able to get to my laptop.
B007JMW46U|5.0|A great collection of stories.  The illustrations enhance the reading experience.  For the price, it is a great read for any fans of Sherlock Holmes.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'd give this book two stars for writing quality, and four stars for the author's vivid imagination, which means it gets a 3. I decided to buy it when I saw that about half the readers were giving it 1 star and the other half were giving it 5. Again... a 3-star book. The characters and the plot are fresh, and you have to give credit to E. L. James for turning the taboo into mainstream fiction. My advice is to lighten up and enjoy the read. She's not going for Pulitzer material here, people. She's dabbling in fantasy. It's brain candy, and it just might inspire your own imagination.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an easy to learn game that really makes your mind work to figure out the routes to take.  Great game for kids to, start out easy and work your way up.  Lots of fun, good app to add to your collection.
B008BRC7BE|5.0|If you love Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, you get the &#34;Best of Both Worlds&#34; here. A `Must Have` for fans of either group.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I thought this album was going to be dissappointing, since they are all older now. Man, was I wrong! This CD rocks just as strong as any with front-man DLR. And Eddie plays as well as ever. This is a &#34;Must Have&#34; for all you original Van Halen Fans!
0688091717|3.0|I was disappointed when I received this book.  It is a shorter, modified version of the original work.  The original is definitely richer in the prose and illustrations.  I will be searching for an original version of the story.

How to host a dinner party with sample conversation starters? I acknowledge that I am not the target audience here and I did not know who Timothy Ferriss was when I stumbled across the title on my kindle. I did research him after I read the book and I wish I had done so before I made the purchase. You are forewarned and I will leave you to draw your own conclusions if you should choose to check out his credentials.<br /><br />Many other reviewers have mentioned the ADDH nature of the book. What struck me was the resemblance to the wikipieda centric papers turned in by my undergraduate students, completely derivative and barely one step from the original source matierial. Timothy had the benefit of a book advance to indulge in first person research and expansive (and expensive) toys. Which results in a lot of name dropping and marginal recommendations. I finished the book with the same exasperation with which I routinely walk out of moive theaters following a typical CGI orgy with no actual plot or character development. Sort of like a McDonalds meal when you wanted sushi. Timothy Ferriss is the male version of Elizabeth Gilbert and \\"[[ASIN:0143038419 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]]\\". Predigested experience(s) for fans of the ultimate fan boy. The gratuitous bits about robust sex and killing various critters in the name of respecting your food could be down right offensive to the unprepared.<br /><br />I am an experienced home cook - I was sucked in by the words \\"Chef\\" and \\"Pro\\" in the title. This book will not turn you into a Chef, nor will you be cooking like a pro at the end of it. Not in four hours, not in a year. It may get you sufficiantly past the fear of walking into the kitchen to perhaps purchase a more usefull resource like Alton Browns \\"[[ASIN:1584797959 Good Eats: The Early Years]]\\"  or any of Rachael Rays books \\"[[ASIN:0307383199 Rachael Ray's Big Orange Book: Her Biggest Ever Collection of All-New 30-Minute Meals Plus Kosher Meals, Meals for One, Veggie Dinners, Holiday Favorites, and Much More!]]\\".<br /><br />Alternatively if you are doing market research on self-indulgent egocentric man/boys of the 30 somthing variety, this book will give you a comprehensive insiders view. I gave it three stars because it was hilarious reading, and when viewed in that light was worth the $9.99. One caveat to those serious about the cooking part - the book is very badly formatted for view on a black and white kindle.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very good game! I loved the graphics and the story line. Plenty of play time so it's not overpriced. Plus you get a monkey.
B008L69ICQ|1.0|This is another terrible covers tribute album done by the infamous Solisti e Orchestra Del Cinema Italiano in 2012, no original recordings here from Morriconne, though they sound very much alike, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME!!! they lack the punch and genius of Morriconne's presence, don't buy this rip-off elevator muzak whatever the cheap price may be.
B0000025H6|5.0|If you like the good old music, here it is. This will bring back some memories. Slap it in your cd player and head out for an old fashioned road trip, no place to go and no time line to get back.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Excellent show, not your run of the mill zombie show. The make-up, costumes, characters, the whole storyline is just very well done and not just halfway done.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Great price! Would never of bought it for Christmas at the new price. Spread a little joy for a little one at the used price. Thanks!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all the many different categories you can search. Gives great ideas for recipes, crafts, places to visit and so much more. Love it
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Very well done! Classic love story. If you like Jane Austen then this movie is for you. I enjoy watching this retelling as much as reading the book!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|great free demo.  excellent visual effects.  this is a great game and well worth buying the full version.  two thumbs ago
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I am in *love* with this album! Yes it is different than a musical on stage, yes it is supposed to be that way. There is actual acting and real, palpable emotion mixed in with singing. It's a totally different experience than anything we've ever had before!<br /><br />And I love love love it!<br /><br />Yes it is different than a Broadway cast doing it. I was expecting it to be. It breathes new life into classic pieces. As a Les Mis fan for a solid 20+ years, I was able to hear these songs afresh for the first time. I could understand the story better... how the only songs of hope and joy are those that Marius and Cosette sing to each other. How there is so much misery all around, and how they are the only ray of light in the whole musical, it makes me understand why the other characters would fight for them, and die for them. You truly feel the dawning of the new tomorrow that they all yearn for, for you can feel the utter misery they all experience every moment of their lives. It took me on a whole new journey and a new understanding of the musical.<br /><br />It made songs that I have heard a hundred times become new favorites - suddenly I am actually laughing along with \\"Master of the House,\\" and tearing up over the raw emotion in \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" (previously rather an overblown song in most renditions, in my opinion, dealt with delicately and with tenderness here).<br /><br />*happy sigh*<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the full recording, including \\"A Little Fall of Rain,\\" my only favorite that was left off this time. Oh well - only four more days til I get to hear it anyways!<br /><br />Oh and ps- am I the only one who liked Russel Crowe as Javert? I thought he did a fine job and I loved hearing him sing.
0375842209|5.0|Beautifully written, compelling story. I could not put it down. One of the best books I've read in the past year.
B0063IH60K|5.0|In a good way (smile).  Wife loves the chances of winning, choosing one card at a time; I love the challenge when receiving three at a time. Nice version!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Very realistic tale of what could happen should dangerous supplies for bomb making be left behind from years ago and the characters are mostly fine upstanding people who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  A bit of realistic information that makes you stop and think.  It's a hard book to lay down, long but well worth the read.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. It makes you think and plan. It's more fun than chess. I like that you can go back and redo the puzzles that you took too many moves to complete.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I usually like Michael Connelly but this book was just boring.  I didn't care about the characters or<br />anything about it.  I guess I just don't like &#34;cold cases&#34;.
B0026PW67W|5.0|Great service and product and will shop again here in the future.  This is a gift and I'm sure it will be greatly received
B007HACDLK|4.0|I just discovered Vince Flynn.  I love his books, The Last Man was the best one I have read so far.<br />Looking forward to reading more
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was an absolutely ter<br />ific book. I  found that once  I started reading it, it was hard to put down.  A  more modern day version of  The Story of O.
B007GOTJ6Y|5.0|My granddaughter loves this group. Can't go wrong if you have a young girl in the house. She loves this group.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was completely blown away by this series, these are a definite must read. To understand what Christian has gone through to act the way he does,just blows you as away.  Not the story most people think it is.
B0096BIENY|5.0|To those who haven't seen Il Divo yet ...  this CD the next best thing.  All their great songs in one place.  AHHHHHH
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There had been so many people telling me the third book was not as good. …I actually thought the third book was fantastic, out told so much more about the characters, made you really see into Christian and Ana's lives. I think the series could continue. I would read it. Excellent!!!
B003JIPJRE|5.0|This movie is good at the beginning, but is great at the end. The human element of Batman really shows at the ending. Tou won't be dissapointed if buy or rent this title.

034580404X|5.0|What a deal this was!!  All 3 books at this price, YES!!!  Read them all & now they're on the shelf.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I was  bored by the long, child's narrative used to introduce the novel; there are too many five year old thoughts for pages and pages. It took perseverance to wait for the novel to accelerate. Once we got into the plot more actively, I was content. I like the concept. I think the vehicle needs more style. The author does end it well; she does progress through the child's evolvement steadily.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Very well written. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. Book four is every bit as good as the first three.

B0076DELIG|5.0|If you liked previous Bosch books, then don't worry, get this one. Its classic Bosch. The atmosphere is right, Bosch is still cranky and human. Loved it.
B0002TJGQS|2.0|Here we go again....... How in the world can you evaluate a product until you use it.  Batteries are something that don't get used right away.  Well not with me anyways.  SO I think I will have to withhold judgement until a later date.
0811879542|5.0|I gave this to the 3-year-old for Christmas, but the 5 and 7 year olds loved it too.  They couldn't wait to do the next instruction.  Lots of fun and laughter!

B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This is adorable and love it. I would recommend kitty to everyone. My grandson adds more little things making this kitty funny and so lovable.
B0025KW29U|5.0|So glad this is on blu-ray. My first one and I couldn't have picked a better movie. Buy this now! :D
B00003CXXP|5.0|Excellent movie and addresses life's foibles. Jude Law is not only a good actor, he is hot! His counterpart matched  him  skill for skill.
B005K17RU0|5.0|What what a program, so many features. Love the health, fitness, and misc. reports. Video's are cool also! Highly recomend!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book will have you feeling every emotion that she feels. I couldn't put it down. This has been the best trilogy I have ever read just amazing
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|An improvement over the previous book, but not nearly as good as his first three books.  Go back to your roots, Tom Clancy.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I've been a fan/follower of the Alien movies since the first one and I'm very loyal.  Great story and effects.  The only complaint I have is the casting.  Great actors put into less then optimal roles.  A bit too much cliche there.  Maybe if they'd switched roles around with the cast it would have been an easy 5 star.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This was a delightful movie. Lovely story line with a good ending.  Excellent if you want a good cry. Excellent acting
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|dont understand how to play it I am not really into games I guess just thought i would try it cause I love pigs.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Not too complicated.  Simple things you can do to make your life happier.  There were quite a few &#34;aahh, I hadn't thought of that.&#34;
B009A9EPLM|5.0|This cd rates right up there with the soundtrack from Gettysburg!  The music is moving and matches the emotions of the parts of the film it occurs.
B005XLN97M|5.0|This was a gift for my 5 and 8 year old granddaughters.  They love it.  Mother reports they play with it all day long.  With 2 barbies, no fuss over who owns the house; it is big enough for them to share. They thought it was great that the tv changes channels...the picture turns around.
B0034G4P80|5.0|GREAT movie! My daughter loved it. Appropriate for all ages. Saw the Avengers and went backwards to catch up on all of them. A must see! Part 2 is coming out next year, cannot wait.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Mr Martin's fifth book revitalizes the series that was basically lost in the extremely disappointing book four. So good to have most of the most beloved and hated charactors back and follow the increasing complex plot of the series. A series that you can't wait to see how it ends but dread when it does.
B001LM1456|4.0|Disappointed Norton didn't reprise his role in the Avengers. Pretty good movie. Very good delivery and prompt. It is better than the first Hulk they made. Have seen both.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|While I've only purchased 7  of the 14 vinyl remasters individually and not the entire box set I wanted to comment briefly on my experience with them so far. I am Beatles collector and own all of these albums in there original forms (in various different pressings, mono, stereo, imports, etc.) While I don't have a top of the line audiophile set-up, I do have a high end technics turntable with an Ortofon cartridge that delivers the best quality sound for my buck. That being said I can see where people have had quality control issues with this set.<br /><br />The first of the set I played was Revolver, dropped the needle and the countdown of Taxman came on. It was like hearing the album for the first time. No clicks, no pops, just crisp gorgeous sound. The quality only improved once I put a good pair of headphones on. It wowed me to the point where all I could was sit on the floor next to my receiver and just absorb the whole album. Later I had a similar experience with the Yellow Submarine remaster.<br /><br />Now onto to the bad (or the not so good) and why I say this set is most likely a mixed bag.<br /><br />After these great experiences with Revolver and Yellow Submarine I felt like I had to experience Abbey Road. Come Together came on with it's signature bass line and sounded great. Listening to Side A I noticed the same thing many reviewers of this set and the Abbey Road remaster in particular have complained about. It is filled with pops and clicks and other surface noise. Now, I wouldn't say it ruined the listening experience for me but having played the other remasters with hardly a decibel of surface noise I was a bit surprised Abbey Road would be this noisy.<br /><br />As a comparison I pulled out my Beatles From Liverpool Box Set (an 8 LP Japanese import released in 1980 featuring highlights from each of the Beatles studio albums http://www.amazon.com/The-Beatles-Box-Liverpool-Japanese/dp/B000U5U6VS) I put on the final lp that began with Come Together andother cuts from Abbey Road. The entire side played just as beautifully as the remastered Abbey Road but without a single pop or click. Granted Japanese Imports are generally pressed extremely meticulously to ensure the best quality sound I still would have liked to have seen the same care and attention in pressing these 2012 Remasters. If they could make it sound this good in 1980 there is no reason it shouldn't sound as good or realistically BETTER today.<br /><br />The long and short of it is, they did cheap out a bit in the pressing of these remasters. Some seem to sound immaculate and others are a bit lacking. As I've said, I don't own or have listened to the entire set but I was very pleased with 2 of the 3 Lp's I've played so far. The Abbey Road remaster leaves much to be desired. All of that being said, if you are a fan of The Beatles and the amazing quality you find in vinyl records do not hesitate to pick up this set, or least buy some of the individual remasters. Mixed reviews aside, this is still a great addition to any Beatles collection or a good start to a new one. I gave it a 4 out of 5, based on the Lp's I own, which to me means this a great set but by no means a perfect set.<br /><br />I hope this at least somewhat helpful to potential buyers like myself who were on the fence due the mixed reviews!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Saw the Avengers and went backwards catching up on all of them. Great movie! Good script. Appropriate for all ages. Few bad words.

B003CSV7TK|5.0|This came promptly.  The cover shows color.  It is black and white which is fine and reflects the period of time.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|The rooster wakes me up... and love to do my math to take away the slumber in the mornings.  I like it!
B00A77II0U|4.0|All in all an entertaining game at a very reasonable price.  I played at &quot;expert&quot; level and thought it could have been a bit more challenging.  There were too many clues and prompts given for what to do next, which was unnecessary and made it too easy.  Graphics were quite good (and creepy), and the game was fairly long (especially given the price).

B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this app I get absolutely nothing done.  Totally addicted.<br />It's on my phone, my Ipod and my Kindle Fire.
B000000P17|3.0|Honestly the weak link in the Golden Age GnR catalog.<br /><br />Some good songs like \\"Ain't It Fun\\",\\"Hair On the Dog\\",\\"Buick Machine\\",\\"Since I Don't Have You\\", and \\"You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory\\" are fitting, but there's a lacking focus.<br /><br />Is the problem not having the classic lineup? Axl and Slash not talking? Izzy not being there(why cut his parts?)? Overall, it's six guys.<br /><br />If a Steven-esque drummer who's accidental,sloppy even,no keyboard player(Sorry Dizzy), and more interest in the album were present, it could work.Gilby fits in well enough, and could be the  rythym player on post-Izzy tracks.<br /><br />Generally,it's hit-and-mess.
B001QJUX24|5.0|I bought this for my 30 yearl old son.  as a boy it was his fav movie.. he would watch it over and over

0439813786|1.0|I was very conflicted on how to rate this book.  I settled on a review of 1 star; I don't expect this to hurt the overall rating of the book, nor do I want it to.  This is probably a wonderful book for children (I wouldn't know, but the reviews certainly suggest as much), but I want to make sure no one else is misled as I was.  I want to be as fair to the book as possible.<br /><br />In short (since it's a long review) the book is not a real \\"book\\" and is mostly pictures; it is not about what it appears to be about at all (it's not about steampunk contraptions); and it would only be interesting to very young readers who are just beginning to read on their own.  It is mostly empty of content, mostly a comic book following a boy around, with almost no dialogue or detail beyond visual representation.<br /><br />I like to read young adult fantasy fiction, because it doesn't contain any of the shoe-horned and gratuitous sex and violence that is rather common in fantasy intended for adults.  So works like Narnia, or Harry Potter, Inheritance, Series of Unfortunate Events, or even His Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman.  In the bookstore where I purchased the book, it was in the young adult section with Harry Potter, not the section with picture books.  The hardcover edition is also very, very well published, with cloth binding and everything (it is a beautiful book).  I read all the descriptors on the jacket, saw that it won some award, say it had 5 star review with some 480 reviews on Amazon, so decided to shell out the $25 retail for it.<br /><br />The jacket describes this as a story of Hugo, an orphaned boy who keeps the clocks in a train station, until he meets an eccentric and bookish girl and a bitter old man who runs a toy store that put his life and most precious secret in jeopardy.  There's talk of a cryptic drawing, a stolen key, a mechanical man, and a message from Hugo's dead father.<br /><br />I didn't open it up and look at it, because that normally causes unintentional spoilers, and really; who would ever expect a picture book to be bound in this format?<br /><br />Based on my observations, I was expecting a steampunk fantasy adventure in the line of Phillip Pullman's stories, or a kid-friendly version of Stephen Hunt's steampunk books.  I was expecting alternate histories and adventure and fantastical clockwork automatons and maybe some sinister plot to destroy London (or Paris).  Maybe I was wrong to think that, but given the information available, it isn't a completely unfounded suspicion.  And so I was excited for this 500+ page book (and apparently also the first in a series given Wonderstruck next to it) giving a imaginative journey of two orphans, one a clock keeper and one a bibliophile, who team up with an old toy seller and save the day with their clockwork machine man comrade and possibly a hot air balloon (on the cover?).<br /><br />I carried it home, and was really very disappointed to see that the first 40-some pages are just pictures.  And that most of the \\"text\\" pages are almost entirely blank.  But I pressed on and read, insisting on delaying my opinion of the book.<br /><br />Needless to say, this book did not deliver.<br /><br />Firstly, the book is not what it presents itself to be, as it isn't actually a \\"book\\", but a picture book.  The binding format makes it look very sophisticated, and I can't imagine why it is bound in this manner, as doing so necessary mars the pictures with the book seem.  If it were not published in a \\"book\\" format, but as a picture book with one an entire picture for each page, it would be significantly more enjoyable as the pictures would not be split in two - that's part of why I never expected a picture book when I purchased it.  You can also see the problem this creates in how the text is spaced; pictures must start on the left-hand side of a page, so the text that appears between pictures is spread over over two mostly-blank pages to allow for this.  All of this leadsme to a feel that the publishers are trying to deceive, as the format makes the book less enjoyable and seemingly only serves to get adult readers to consider it.<br /><br />[SPOILERS AHEAD]<br /><br />Secondly, it was not what it presents itself to be.  It is not a story of a young orphaned clockmaker and an eccentric, bookish girl; nor is it even really about clocks, or clockwork, or automatons, or bookish girls.  It's about a film director who retired in misery.  The book is about the movies made by the film director and their legacy, and the imagination that went in to them.  The presence of clocks and automatons and eccentric, bookish girls is purely a device to get you to start reading, so that the stuff about movies can be seemingly dumped on your lap.<br /><br />[END SPOILERS]<br /><br />Other than this, it would be a great book for children.  The illustrations are well-done (except for the way human faces seem to have scales), and the storyline -- while not being near as exciting as a I hoped -- is at least educational and more interesting than stories about bunnies on farms, as is par for picture books.  For a picture book, the characters are interesting and the plot devices are astounding, and the mystery and resolution is fun and warming.<br /><br />If I were a parent or teacher and suggesting this to other parents or teachers of young children, I would give it an unhesitating 5-star review.<br /><br />But because I'm an adult speaking to possible other adults who may be confused by the presentation of the book, don't buy this book.  It is in the upper range of book prices, gives you maybe 2 hours of reading (if even), provides no real story or character depth, and suddenly flip-flops the plot in an almost deceptive way about midway through.  You might enjoy reading it if there's a copy lying around, and the movie adaptation is probably entertaining (and half the price of the book).<br /><br />I hope that's a fair review of the book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I'm first pleased that this app was free as it should. It offers an easy, quick read. As well as more portable than my Bible.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHlN!<br /><br />I love this movie.  I mean, I really love this movie.<br /><br />There are so many things to like: Jean Reno's solemn, restrained performance as professional hitman Leon; 13-year-old Natalie Portman's sweet, affecting acting turn in her first full-length movie role; Gary Oldman's over-the-cliff portrayal of a corrupt and certifiably insane NY city detective.<br /><br />I loved it in the theaters, and came to think it was the only version of the movie.  It was only later that I realized a fuller international version had fleshed out the relationship between Leon and Mathilda (Portman), but they'd been worried that American audiences--though totally comfortable with the violent murder of a drug dealer's family--might quake at scenes that hinted at an intimacy between the very young Portman and the older Leon, even though the film made it clear that nothing did indeed occur between them.  This version re-places those scenes, and their inclusion makes for a better movie...a feat I hadn't thought possible.<br /><br />The plot details I'm including are not spoilers, as they can be found on the back of the box.  A young girl narrowly escapes the murder of her family by a corrupt cop angered by their cheating him on the drugs they kept for him.  Taken in by a hitman who has quite necessarily lived on his own his entire life, Mathilda slowly begins to win him over, and as he begins to teach her his profession her need to exact revenge upon the man who killed her family leads the two into dangerous territory, and their survival is dependent upon whether a psychotic cop can get to the girl, or a professional assassin can protect her.<br /><br />It's not just that a switcheroo has occurred--the deadly protecting the innocent against the lawman--but a whole reassessment of life.  Is it possible to change an aging predator for whom the closest thing to a relationship is--no lie--his care of a potted plant?<br /><br />The director and writer of this wonderful film is Luc Besson, known for his excellent absurdist sci-fi movie \\"The Fifth Element\\" (1997) as well as his clever, exciting \\"La Femme Nikita,\\" (1990)--later remade in this country as \\"Point of No Return\\" with Bridget Fonda.<br /><br />But it's the acting that drives this movie.  Reno is exceptional as the methodical killer (he prefers \\"cleaner\\")...his puppy dog eyes are perfect here.  Sad, affecting, wise--there is so much that hides behind his lined, unshaven appearance.  And Portman, the ing&eacute;nue, making her debut in this role, is is clearly a talent, hinting at the career to come.<br /><br />Yet the pivotal portrayal here might be Oldman's, a maniacal roller coaster of a man whose demonic character not only provides the tension, but nicely offsets the restraint in the main roles.  There are a few talented actors who can be called upon to portray a wild, frenzied malevolence without calling so much attention to themselves that they monopolize the film, and Oldman is perfect here as the corrupt, despicable cop who has no problem targeting a small child for extinction.<br /><br />See this terrific movie.  You won't be disappointed.r of this wonderful film is Luc Besson, known for his excellent absurdist sci-fi movie \\"The Fifth Element\\" (1997) as well as his clever, exciting \\"La Femme Nikita,\\" (1990)--later remade in this country as \\"Point of No Return\\" with Bridget Fonda.<br /><br />But it's the acting that drives this movie.

B00631HASU|4.0|This is a great alternative to Luxor, a very similar game with its own features.<br /><br />What I like about it:<br />1. Touch-targeting, just touch where you want your orb to go.<br />2. Launcher is in the center for more of a radial setup.<br />3. Magic spheres similar to Luxor but very cool.<br />4. Choice of amulets which help you during game play.<br />5. Sound effects are great - try using an aux cord into a car stereo.<br />6. Very responsive controls.<br /><br />One downfall is all of the levels have a similar appearance without amazing graphics or backgrounds.<br /><br />Overall a great app, I still play it about every day for a level or two.

B001NLKT60|5.0|I bought the paper back of the first book and when I finished it I had to buy the second and third book! So many twists and turns!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|A totally outrageous spoof of 1980's action movies; lots of humour, action, unbelievable story twists and action (did I mention action?).  Nothing like seeing heroes hide behind sheet metal shelving to protect them from a machine gun fire to remind you of 1980's action movies...  Wait, they did intend this as a spoof, right?
B001CC7PKS|4.0|had heard much negativity about this movie, but the moment I saw the trailer for this I became hooked. Took me awhile but I finally viewed the film and boy was it a fun and affecting ride. This was the first movie, in a long time that resulted in vertually every emotion happening to me, laughter, anger, nervousness, sorrow, happiness, confusion and shock. And this was purely because of the theatrical cut. Once I viewed the complete picture in the director's cut, I felt happy that I saw the truer version of the picture and that I got gotten all I could from the movie.<br /><br />Daredevil, first struck as awesome due to, the father and son relationship. It was a pairing I truely cared about and I was really sad when Matt's father died. The dark tone of the movie, was perfect for me, negative, real like and identifiable. Unlike most I didn't fully understand the character of Daredevil and this movie and Ben Affleck helped me to achieve that understanding, both as a lawyer and as a superhero. As you probubly guessed I enjoyed Affleck's preformence.<br /><br />The other actors I felt all did their roles perfectly, though most lost some of their best scenes in the theatrical cut. Duncan rocked as the Kingpin and I personally feel, making him black made the character smarter and more menacing. Jennifer Garner was amazing as Elektra, the chemistry between her and Affleck was amazing. This was the first superhero romance that I actually wanted to be together (unlike spiderman, superman, most batman movies and captain america). Bullseye truely was evil and I got lots of menace from him. Everyone else I loved.<br /><br />Many parts of the movie really affected me, the funeral, the death scenes, the church fight, the final battle and the ending. A movie that can make it so I feel stabbed when Elektra gets stabbed, is definutly a powerful movie. Also the film introduced me to Evanescence and a few of their best songs.<br /><br />I won't mention weakness's with the theatrical cut, but I will mention the DC's problems. Removing the confussionals between Matt and the preist, one weakenss the preists character and makes him a nobody, two makes Matt's vigilante arch les meaningful along with Matt's 2nd to last speech &#34;I also saved myself&#34; and finally makes his knowing of Matt's identity useless.<br /><br />I feel the order of Bullseye's scenes should be changed, first the airport metal detector, then the plane ride, the bar, throwing a pen into Frank Miller's head and then the battle. Doing the bar first now doesn't work, as he still has the beanne on at the airport, when he didn't pick it up.<br /><br />With parts of his vigilante arch removed, I feel Daredevil's sparing of the Kingpin, makes less sense in this version, instead of the theatrical, where that arch was the main focus.<br /><br />Also the bitts dealing with Matt's religion or the scenes that try to mention his mother, I feel shouldn't be here.<br /><br />But those aren't that much of a problem for me, as this movie will always hold a soft spot for me, due to how powerful it was. Even though I bought the blu-ray I'm keeping my dvd's, as the commentaries are different (it was actually the first commentary I ever listened the entire way thorugh).<br /><br />Of course my enjoyment doesn't completly overhsadow the faults this movie does have so I'll give it 4/5. And also this movie has a novelization. I own that also.
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|So the basic elements of story, actors, cinematography, etc.. are all here, but the pace and flow of the scene sequences are so messed up this becomes a long boring mess.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A completely different take on NDE.  Well written and presented.  Unfortunately, to those who will not believe, no words are enough; and to those who will, no words are neccessary.  I found it compelling and while I don't look forward to death, I surely fear it less after reading this book.  Recommended it to friends who recently lost a loved one.<br />PJJ Sandy Springs, GA

B0091QS88K|5.0|My girls (two and six) both loved this game so much I had to upgrade! Great for starting out, but very limited as far as content is concerned.
0439023491|3.0|After reading The Hunger Games I just had to read the rest of the trilogy.  This, the second book in the trilogy, did fall into the classic second book trap.  It did spend a lot of time going over old facts from the first book - as if anyone would read this book without having just read the first one! - and the story seemed a lot slower at first but it did end well, quite nicely setting up the story for the third book finale.<br /><br />Again it was well written and flowed really well.  Set out in her, what is now, classic three parts it contained quite a lot of detail to take in.  I may well re-read part three as I felt like I missed something.  It either moved very quickly and implied a lot of information I was looking for or I just missed something (which is highly possible).  Still a must read if you have read The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Although, she still has not covered how Panem and The Capitol came about yet. I just hope that is all covered in the final book.<br /><br />I am very excited about the movie version of this as there is so much they could do with it.<br /><br />3 out of 5 as I gave The Hunger Games 4 and this rated just slightly below it, more like a 3.5 but that is not possible to give here.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I'm not sure why, but the graphics are just awesome to me. The characters themselves look a bit odd, but I think that makes it all the more entertaining. I also like that there's a lot of variety. From shaving to curling to dying to decorating with bows and then starting all over again, it's potentially hours of entertainment!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was worth the $4 rental at the time, there are some funny moments in the movie and you can definitely tell it's the creater or family guy.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My kids (two and six, both girls) absolutely love this game! The characters are so cute and the premise of the games are very easy for them both to understand. After a while it does seem a bit repetitive, but they don't even notice!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I love Cornwell's character, Scarpetta.  However, in this latest book, I found the first half of the book more tedious than usual.  Cornwell paints Scarpetta in a less favorable way...still smarter than the average person, but maybe a little more ornery; perhaps a bit paranoid?  I wasn't as pleased or entertained as I usually am by a Scarpetta adventure.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Fun and all, but very slow going so I tried to jump ahead by saving money and buying a building that would help me. I get a mission later to buy that building but I already have it. So you are screwed. I hats the games with goals that don't account for what you have already!

B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little girl love's it.  She asked me if she could get it.  so I got it for her.  so me and my little one. Both love it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great read from Follett as always. Cannot wait for the next book in this trilogy.  The wife is into it now.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod has some great guests who sing with him through out the album, it is cheerful, upbeat and enjoyable. Great Holiday addition to your library
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I loved the show when it aired on Starz so when it came time purchase the seasons I had two choices, DVD or Bluray. The show was visualy stunning enough where I decided I had to buy the Bluray version and boy was I glad I did. Not only does the show look and sound great on the format but the actual packaging for the season is like a harcover story book complete with great graphics on each page of the &#34;Book&#34;. Highly reccomend this product for any fan of the show. Spartacus is great!
B000000OY9|5.0|Listening to this album 20+ years on I think any real Neil young fan can look past the curious production values of this album because that's what Neil is all about; he goes out on a limb and does something that most people deem obscure because it strays to far from from harvest or comes a time even his record company Geffen at the time tried to sue him for this reason!<br /><br />Yes the electric drums are pushed way up in the mix and the music overall sounds a bit tinny but how can you deny songs like Weight of the world, Violent Side, Hippie Dream, Touch The Night, people on the street and pretty much the whole album. As other reviewers put it these songs are not far removed from his most accessible work, it's really the production and the additional instrumentation that turns people off.<br /><br />It's a shame that he doesn't play these songs live anymore, it would be great to hear these tracks with crazy horse behind him live. Give this much maligned album a try.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I am a huge comic book movie fan so when Avengers came out I knew I was purcasing it even though I had missed it during it's theatrical run. I was not disappointed, I had to watch it twice the first night just to absorb the awesomness. Fantastic movie.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|Excellent story, well written and a nail biter right to the end.  Have read all three from Daniel Suarez now and I'm a fan.
B0049J0CTM|1.0|My 3-yr old son often asks to watch movies from Amazon instant video but the result is always frustrating: chopped video and interruptions.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Killer drones, hacking, and corporate conspiracy are my three favorite subjects.  It would still be a great book even if I wasn't biased towards the themes.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and it never gets old!  This one will stand the test of time.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I down load alot of the free kindle book, this one was one of them.  I really enjoyed reading this, it was a quick read and I could not put it down.
1611134226|5.0|Never would have thought Pendergast would give in to depression. Watching him work through it, is as interesting as the mystery.  Excellent!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Will open Christmas day. need 14 words. oh boy oh baoy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is the best movie going in 3D and we have many 3D's.  The color and effects are wonderful. If you saw Avatar in 2D, you need to see it in 3D.
B0054LVP3Q|5.0|Got this book from my secret Santa at work.  I was sceptical about the book.  But once I got reading it was a great easy read.  About half way through the book I desperately wanted to flip to the last chapter to find out what happens, I resisted and finished the book within a day.  I will recommend it to friends (or lend out my copy)
B000GJ0KOG|4.0|I first saw the Broadway Musical.  I ran out and ordered the original movie.  It doesn't have the the big musical production numbers of the broadway play, but the singing is still worthwhile.
B000RJO57I|4.0|Simon Pegg does it again - great movie - the more you watch - the more you pick up in the movie.
B008D28HYS|2.0|On the store, in said this game would be fun and educational but it turned out to be boring and dumb.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Having lost my mother at the age of 21, I was interested in reading about the experience in another point of view.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|This album is fabulous and was cheap! It was way cheaper than on itunes so I just had to buy it from amazon.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I watched the movie because of the actors but, I  was kind of dusapointed. I felt like we were intruding in their marriage counseling session and some of the details were too personal for my taste. I liked the ending though.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I am happy with this app because it doesn't notify me like other weather apps. It's also pretty accurate. Yay
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|She loved it! Thought it was fun and it kept her entertained up until we had to leave our dinner date!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fabulous. I play it all the time and it's a huge time waster. There were a few glitches but they seem to have been sorted out.
B002XXLKL0|5.0|Fun movie, entertaining, and great for the Christmas season. Danny Devito really makes this movie. I think this one is the best of the old Batman series.
B008EL4YX6|2.0|The way the app store made this game sound is like a super fun and challenging game but it was hard and boring.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I respect the author’s efforts in exploring a new venue but she may have tried to do too much here.  There are a lot of themes, a lot of characters, and a lot of different social issues.<br /><br />Somehow it just did not work for me.  I never really cared about the characters.  To my eye the story was very fragmented and unappealing.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I thought this game was gonna be super fun because i LOVE angry birds, but this game was just confusing.
0345529057|5.0|I love it, although I spend a looooooooot time reading them. I plan to read them again when I've time.
B00A17AD36|5.0|This is a have to have very deep I love it 30 songs for the price wow. Its R&B/Jazz mix the sound is so smooth peaceful words he speaks and songs are so rule true to the heart. Takes you to another place another world its its own high. Nothing extra needed.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|I love this musical, the DVD has subtitles in spanish so a friend who doesn't speak french could understand it. It's one of those things that you can look several times and never get tired of it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|As a female of 38 yrs of age I felt more like Mr Grey their are about 50 plus shades of me. I bore easy and the beginning of this book did not hold my attention but my friend assisted that I kept reading it. So I did to make her happy. When it final got the part that caught my attention I was drawn into the Contract. As a woman who lives like that I wanted more of someone like Ann. I got married to a male 5 yrs younger than I. He was basically a virgin which excited me to turn him. Well to say we are divorcing he bored me to childish and not even what I needed to please that monster inside me, I never cheated while married to him for 11 yrs of hell I changed and became what I'm not. Now I'm free and enjoy the Mr Grey type of life style. 50 plus shades of Ms Wessells is me. The best thing that has come from the marriage is my daughter who is 12. As of love I don't know what to think of it ladies and gentle we do exit out here I am 1 we walk among you and yes I have men and woman that want me I don't do woman at all. We drive you crazy and you think if you could have us but I find men can not handle me. I have ran into someone like Mr Grey and its intense I love it where woman you want that because you read it but this type of life style is serious and lonely. I don't  mind being alone but when your sex drive starts on a Wednesday - Sunday morning and the men I have want to talk or complain their tired I drop them fast with no return. So take the time to think after reading this do you really want to enter into our world. Is it what you want and can take emotional, physically, mentally and spiritual. Because if your a fall in love type walk away. Because the outcome can most of the time come out different than the book. I have left a lot of males hurt and still wanting me but I don't want them. 50 Plus Shades Of Ms. Wessells. Come question me write from me a woman that lives this life. Enjoy ladies but be careful what you imagine or ask for.
B009B0L324|3.0|Sadly, but fairly predictably, the CD release of the River Plate concert is another victim of the loudness wars. A great concert is ruined (for me) by the suffocating brickwalling. It's loud and proud alright but with no light and shade in the music it just becomes a drone, especially if listening with headphones. The DVD mastering is much better with the music having room to breathe and the music has a depth to it that the CD does not.<br /><br />Those not familiar with the loudness wars or brickwalling will probably be happy with the CD release - don't let me put you off buying it. My observations are more for those who wonder if it is brickwalled, unfortunately it is.<br /><br />Great concert though and I love the DVD.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is at the top of the game.  I couldn't put it down and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great mystery.
B002HP269O|3.0|This season lacks one very important thing: closure. There were a lot of story lines floating around from seasons 4 and 5, but few of them get resolved. One notable exception is Bette and Tina. Thank God those two finally figured things out.<br /><br />But Helena loses her fire; Shane ties herself down in a horrid relationship; and Jenny... if possible, she acts even crazier than before. So in general, characters act very uncharacteristically throughout this season.<br /><br />That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, but the finale in particular left me feeling very unsatisfied. It's bad form to present a huge mystery and then not answer it. Personally, I think Sounder did it. Man's best friend? I think not.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this saga. Again Connelly brings Harry Bosch to life. Knowing the geography and history behind the story made it real.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|My youngest daughter loves Justin Bieber and she said this CD rocks... She won't stop playing it.. Thanks so much..
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Good movie my little girl loves it good movie for family not just kids  buy for your kids they will like it
B00003CXCT|4.0|Great condition! Some of the discs have a few scratches on them, but they work perfectly and don't skip at all. Very happy with it!
B008A1NSTG|4.0|I really liked this movie.  It was based on a true story and the actors did a great job.  A love story about the whales and two people.  I could relate to Drew Barrymore's character being an animal lover, myself.  I would recommend this for family or self.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I Love this app. so does my daughter. We are always taking pictures of ourselves and others. It's real easy to use and thats very nice.
B00846TRHY|5.0|I love Gerald Butler and the description sounded interesting so I decided to watch this movie.  I loved it.  The passion of the story was well protrayed by Gerard Butler.  Not for children, it has violence.  But, definitely worth watching for adults,
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It is a good book. A modern \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" written in a  \\"The Color Purple\\" format.  I felt it could have been a better book if written in third person. Have not seen the movie yet<br />Dewayneg
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book!! I haven't been into books in along time this really got me interested. Great romantic novel. It's been said that its comparable to mommy porn..
B000SEI618|5.0|For a man in middle age, who watched his mother wither away with cancer, who lost a wife to divorce, who loved and misplaced friends, who lost a found his car keys and wallet a thousand days, who has waded into the sea on several coasts, who recalls the fragment snapshots of his life so far, who wonders what name or recollection will fade away next, this book--this author--resonates like a moving piece of music I look forward to remembering.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I was laughing nonstop through this movie... I didn't expect it to be so funny! My fiance, who is not a fan of musicals, was laughing throughout too!
0385360177|2.0|This book's plot is weak. This book is all about how to have sex in different ways, and how to use sex toys. You may get horny once your past the 7th chapter of the first book and in part of the second book. Your partner may appreciate that you are reading it.  I got to chapter16 of the second book and could not take it anymore. Anastasia was way too wishy washy for me. Her character  made me tired of reading the book.  Some of the series  might be a good &#34;How Too Have Excitig Sex&#34; book. After you got your lesson you can stop reading the book and apply it to your sex life. You do not need to read all 3 books for that.
0439023521|4.0|I know this is technically a young adults book but I loved it despite the fact I am no longer &#34;young&#34;.  Is it great classic literature - no.  It is a great read, refreshing premise and on a par with the Harry Potter Series.  I immediately purchased the rest of the series so I could continue reading.  Highly recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This omnibus of five books is one of the best sci-fi books I have read this year. The life of a silo citizen is made very clear and the disfunctional society they live in is ripe with injustice. I enjoyed immensely and recommend to any who enjoy reading about dystopias.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Cannot believe the reviews this series has gotten.  Everyone I have spoken to who has actually read it feels the same - it is terrible.  Do not recommend.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|CD arrived on time and in excellent condition.  Daughter loves this band (though it's not one of my favorites) - but it wasn't for me.
0439023513|3.0|The problem with exciting trilogies such as these books is how to end them.  This final book in the series felt as though the author didn't really know how to end things.  The book dragged in parts and Katniss had a complete personality change.  However I would recommend the series as a whole.
1451695195|5.0|Clear and readable, especially for non-native speakers. Written from a personal experience, gives us all hope and confidence for a life beyond of what can we touch and feel.
0143034901|4.0|How different is this book?  I don't give 5 stars on any book as I believe everything can be improved but this is definitely a 4.5 star book.  This is one of those very rare books that you know will live in your soul for ever.  I was on holidays when I came across it in the holiday house library.  We had to leave before I was finished and the very first thing I did when I got home was log on and order it.  This is great literature and I highly, highly recommend it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|What a great book, I couldn't put it down!!!!! I read it in two days and truly enjoyed every minute of it.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I was introduced to the Reacher series after purchasing a hard cover book while on holidays.  That sent me searching on my kindle for others.  I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend both it and the series.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|We got a really good price on a great movie. It came on time, and arrived in great condition. We all love this movie.
1410420442|4.0|Slower start but as enjoyable as the first book.  I will be reading this series again in the future.  Highly recommend.
B000I186FW|5.0|Love the action, the story and Hugo's voice, I got it as a Christmas gift and I included a mask of V
B009X011UQ|3.0|I purchased this for my Kindle Fire 8.9 because it was lighter weight than the Amazon cover and it seemed to work well for older Kindle Fires. I didn't care for it that well- it seems like the 8.9 was a little heavy for it and I had to switch the cable in and out of the connection because I use the Fire a lot with the cable attached. I couldn't keep the cable attached with the cover folded back and then just fold the cover forward again. Also the layers of cover on one edge were starting to come apart also, so I returned it and got the Amazon cover.
0345803485|2.0|After hearing all the hype about these books, I thought I would read them for myself and see what all the fuss was about...<br /><br />Now, having read the first two, and currently struggling with the third, I am surprised to find this yet another series where the primary storyline is that of an older male &#34;hero&#34; who stalks, immediately isolates, and assumes complete control over a young, naive woman. Take away the good looks and money and you simply have a man taking advantage of and control over a young woman.  As a parent, I find this disturbing, but I won't get out the ole soap box and start preaching.<br /><br />Moving on, I am convinced  the author, E. L. James, is NOT a middle-aged woman, but rather a man, living vicariously through his COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC fictional creation, Christian Grey. A character, who, despite his tragic past, has achieved more personally, artistically, sexually, and financially, than most men twice his age.<br /><br />Regardless, man or woman author, another irritating aspect of the books for me is the grammar. The language used throughout the series swings like a pendulum, from vulgar, immature declarations to obscure, dare I say, &#34;brainiac&#34; terms that most likely had some readers Googling for definitions.<br /><br />In addition, the subject matter of sexual exploration/domination etc. etc. is by no means &#34;new&#34;. The Fifty Shades trilogy is simply a contemporary rehashing of the book, THE STORY OF O, written and published back in the mid 1950s.<br /><br />What I have read of the series so far leaves me wondering, really, New York Times Best Seller List?! Really? Where is the new, well-written, fresh story lines?<br /><br />Just my humble opinion.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Great songs with catchy tunes and lyrics that tell a story. A highly original and inventive band with a style distinctly their own. Hard not to smile and sing along with lyrics that span the meaningful to the whimsical. Plus, a great bridge for getting kids to enjoy some new music.
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|cant go wrong with legos. Shipping was on time and no surprises for the item. For kids who love to put thing together this would work.
0792164903|5.0|What a great movie. Would recommend it to anyone who loves suspense. It came early, at a very good price, and well packaged. Thanks very much.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|dr seuss has always put out good movies. the place i bought this was very good. they had the product out in good time and was represented well
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Red Riding Hood like you never would have imagined. Loved it. Great price, well packaged, and came early. Thanks alot.
0553382179|5.0|Could have written one of the testimonials in this book. Simple and yet oh so effective! Easy and yet so elusive. I love the FlyLady and she writes in a way that makes you wish you could have her over for coffee and a chat.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|application for kindle fire only gives one hour of news feed. unacceptable. please fix this!!! thank you for your time!!!!
B002OSY2T6|5.0|This toy has been one of the most popular with all ages (baby to adult) in our house. Roll it, lay it down and spin it around, flashing lights and noise, what more do you need. Batteries have also lasted forever.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Hilarious! More movies like this need to be made , ted for the win , like a boss, amazing movie
0140067477|5.0|When you are starting to spin, read this book. It's a wonderful introduction to Taoism and the tone and content is relaxing.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Maybe because I'm a guy but I find this book boring.  I usually read a book in a couple of days to a week but can't get through this one.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Papa Roach has picked up where it left, off producing great heavy rock.  The album is solid throughout, and definitely a must-buy for any fan of Papa Roach, particularly their more recent albums.  I'm really digging Leader of the Broken Hearts - a triumphant spin on being broken hearted - brilliant work.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I bought the hardcover when it first came out and just bought the Kindle version for a friend in anticipation of our seeing the Stones here in Brooklyn two weeks ago.  Anyone reading this already knows how good \\"Life\\" is but since I got an email from Amazon just now asking for review, I thought I'd throw my twopenneth in!<br /><br />What sets this above and beyond most other autobiographies is Keith's voice rings loud and true through it - it's intimate, self-deprecating and of course wry and funny as hell (it's almost impossible to keep a smirk off your face while reading it).  Starting with one of the best opening chapters you'll ever come across, you're whisked along in breathless fashion that's almost the literary equivalent of what a ride in Keith's Bentley must've been like back in the day:  white-knuckle at times, but the adrenaline rush leaves you gasping for more!  I've actually felt a sensory overload reading some of this; amazing that the fella who actually lived it is still here to tell the tale.<br /><br />But what's best of all is for the musicians out there:  Keith delves into discussion of his influences and his distinct style - the description of his excitement at discovering open tuning jumps off the page (and you'll have a guaranteed \\"AHA!\\" moment yourself if you didn't already know this secret to the Stones sound).  So many (auto)biogs neglect the music bit entirely or paint it as merely the means to getting the sex, money and fame - for Keith, it's the reverse:  that the whirlwind of excess around the rock lifestyle - while occasionally hugely entertaining! - is in a way the baggage one puts up with to afford the freedom to get what he *really* wants:  spending sleepless days on end in the studio recording, playing live, going to gigs and hitting local record shops on days off - it really is all about the music, baby.  It's crystal clear that's what drives the man at his core - and that is why we love him and the Stones at the end of the day.<br/><br />It's a book that I will revisit every few years as it's like uncorking a bottle of your favorite vintage wine or single malt whisky.  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|I liked the mystery surrounding the characters but their story lines tended to be a little vague and the story line was a bit hard to follow at times.  All in all it was not a bad book and I did like trying to figure out who the bad guy was. Turns out I chose the wrong one.
1455527475|2.0|This book is terrible.  A quick summary would read like this:<br />I did really, really good in school and got into Stanford.<br />I did really, really well at Stanford and worked really, really hard and got an internship at Goldman<br />I worked really, really hard at Goldman and got promoted.<br />I worked really, really hard at Goldman, aligned myself with the right people and got promoted again.<br />I kept working really really hard... and aligning my self with the right people, and I didn't really like where the industry was going, so i resigned in the NY Times.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I learn so much about myself and the important things in life, every time I read one of Mitch's books.  This one is no exception.  It will change your perspective on life.
B007918P1E|5.0|They are, for lack of a better word and a bit of a cliche, epic! This was my first foray into Epica and I have since purchased a couple more albums and seen them live. I was attracted by the symphonic melodies and beautiful vocals and stayed for the complex metal riffs and powerful growling. I especially appreciate how all the different aspects are intertwined, often overlaying each other. I'm glad to see that Metal is alive and well.
006198969X|5.0|came on time. has useful tips to get your style started. If your trying to find a style that fits you, you may want to check this book out.
B009329Y30|4.0|Well worth the rental. My teen daughter loved it.  Was cute and happily predictable.  Will probably go under the tree as a gift :)
B000AGTPUK|5.0|We have worn out four DVD's of this movie.  Our grandchildren play it constantly and not only at Christmas.  I will need to stock up on the polar express.  I purchased the lionel polar express train for the tree this Christmas...Wow...It's great and only gets turned off to recharge batteries.
8866130923|4.0|I love this planner because it gives me a week at a time, plus plenty of room on the right page to jot notes, write down more information about my appointments, etc. The only thing I don't like about it is that Moleskin is slow to jump on the eco-friendly printing bandwagon. Not sure why-- get with it, Moleskin!
B0058YPL66|5.0|Excellent show and nicely compacted disc set. If you like any type of fantasy shows you'll love this one. The one downfall is it can get a little soap-opera-y when the actors get a little too dramatic.
141659521X|5.0|Love Mitch Rapp and I think this is one of the best! Fast paced and a fun read if you like action stories.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great movie and the 3-D is very good.  The colors are vivid and the 3-D is more &#34;3-D&#34; than some others we've seen.  Of course  it was shot in 3-D, not just converted, so that would account for the quality of the 3-D.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I AM A BIG BIG. FAN OF DIANA GABALDON. I JUST LOVE ALL OF HER BOOKS AND WILL CONTINUE TO READ ALL OF THEM.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Great book<br />Did not want to put down until finished. One of Nicholas sparks best books yet! Highly recommend this_
B009T8XBBO|1.0|Save your money. Although it only needs 49mb and I have plenty of storage available it will not load. So save your money and look for other games to play.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This was cute story with imaginative twists on the old classic. We felt it was very well done, and the children (4 & 6) were entertained. Will rent again next year.
B00846REIS|5.0|These are a must read. I loved the Grey Series, But for some reason Gideon and Eva have captured me a lil more.
B0081HLM2E|3.0|`Headhunters' is a fun ride.  It has thrills and some excellent technical work and the story is compelling enough to keep your interest throughout.  It tells the story of a young man who makes a living stealing valuable art pieces and selling them off.  He isn't the most attractive young man and yet he manages, through his wallet, to secure for himself a KNOCKOUT girlfriend and a KNOCKOUT mistress.  Apparently, it isn't all in his wallet (that aspect being in his head) since they both seem to genuinely have feelings for him.  He winds up getting in way too far over his head when he attempts to steal from a new suave prospect putting the moves on his girlfriend.  Next thing you know he's running for his life as he becomes the hunted in a wicked game of cat and mouse.<br /><br />The film is adapted from Swedish author Jo Nesbo's novel.  I'm currently in the middle of reading Nesbo's `The Snowman', so I can say that the film certainly carries his stamp of delivery.  I can see his writing in the film despite the fact that I haven't read the source material.<br /><br />`Headhunters' is fluid.<br /><br />My issue with the movie is that it lacks any real bite.  I won't say that it isn't thrilling, because it does have those elements, but at the end of the day it is truly forgettable.  Fun, for forgettable.  Unlike other Swedish bred murder films (namely `The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo') `Headhunters' can't rise up to make us remember it when it's over.  It lacks the haunting quality that is needed to make it a better film.  Instead, it is just a little too familiar, pulling from other films (at times obviously) and it struggles with finding a tone (it really wants to insert humor in places it doesn't fit) and some of the plot developments are just obvious and sorely underplayed.<br /><br />Bah, it could have been great, but it will have to settle with good.  It is good, I won't begrudge it that.  I just wish it was better.
097747609X|4.0|It explains the reasoning behind Hitler's hate toward Jews and provide very deep explanation of the National Socialist party and the ideals that they wanted to pursue for the German people. It has a lot of gramar errors, but that is intended as the translation was left original. Nothing was changed.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love this show and season 4 just keeps getting better. Seriously the creators and writers for this show and brilliant.
B000FA6720|4.0|Very good love story and I am not one to read this type of book. Was apprehensive about reading it with the negative reviews some gave along with my cynicism about gooey love stories. But it was recommended by a good friend. It was not disappointing to me at all.  I read it in 2 days.  Well worth the read!
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I was afrai to buy an ebook had bad experience opening an ebook prior to this book. No problem opening and reading book, very happy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed. Would recommended for those seeking adventure. I began to wonder if this was really fiction or could it be reclassified as fact.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|ok movie, to much like original  , needed more original action and suspense. Like trying to recall him with freind.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Our granddaughter loves animals and playing with Legos.  This made a great combination.  Duplo Legos are out every day during play time.
B005HSL626|2.0|Randomly in the middle of playing, the screen sometimes goes black but the game keeps playing. The option in the game to fix it does not help. Also video and fullscreen ads usually crash the program for me. All other ads are fine. It's a shame because when it works right it's a great game. If they ever fix the black screening I'll pay for it. If the make the ad display stable I'll play free again. Until then I'm done.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Another great title by Mr Ferriss. I have read them all this far and would highly recommend each one! Thanks again Tim!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Excellent game amazing graphics, fluid very entertaining, a real journey to the discovery of another reality, the best thing is that it is intuitive, I recommend it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This new Ryan legacy series keeps getting better! I can't wait see where it goes next. More on the cybercrime? Return of<br /> NETforce? ;)
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is an excellent app but no less than I would expect from the Beeb which is home page on all my other devices.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  It was a fun read and enjoyable.  I would recommend it to the next reader.
B007YOC4RW|4.0|This is an excellent album. It should satisy any Joe Bonamassa or blues guitar fan that is into the this genre
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The News Feed only displays the first dozen or so articles, then displays a few in blue and won't show the rest of the feed. Please update to fix this problem!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very accurate of a current threat invasion from out side sources of personal educated in US and  thus indicates an increase need for funding for this very real  threat.
B000816TCY|5.0|Much happier with this battery and its charge. I'm just not going to try the cheap ones any more, they didn't hold out but a few months of use and not many recharges.
0156027321|5.0|Like most books....better than the movie. This book was recommended by my sister who is a high school teacher. I'm over 40 and I enjoyed it a lot. You should read this book/.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I am a big fan of John Clark and gang...It began with Without Remorse, then Rainbow Six, etc and Threat Vector is the latest and a good read, albeit a tad lengthy. Clancy has a tendency to go into long detail in his books making them longer than need be in my humble opinion but still, a great writer. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was the length.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have read all the Harry Bosch books and anxiously wait any new ones.  I also enjoy the short stories that I have found to download to my Kindle.<br /><br />I am from California and  that is what drew me to Michael Connelly's books at first, I could almost smell Los Angeles from his descriptions.  But next I just fell in love with Harry.  I  like his half-brother too.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the next one.  I know it will be just as good.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've read every Michael Connelly book which of course includes every Harry Bosch novel. I<br />can't put them down. Always entertaining. I like that Harry has a mind of his own and takes<br />on the establishment. Given the fact Lincoln Lawyer (not a Harry book) was made into a movie,<br />one would think that the Harry Bosch series might make a good TV Series. One of my favorite<br />characters.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My six year old cannot get enough of this game. it keeps him entertained when I am trying to do house work and homework
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Love this album, no love allowed and love song  are my favorite songs,those 2 songs are always on repeat.<br />Must have album
0307744434|4.0|This was a good book and came in perfect condition as described. Kind of reminds me of the new Cirque de Soliel movie coming out.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|These work great! We have a hallway entrance and in a light remodel it was the only place I couldn't easily run wiring for a lightswitch and light.  I was hesitant to try these, especially since I didn't think they seemed like a good price for what you get, but I am very pleased with them.  They sense perfectly...as soon as we open the door the whole hallway is illuminated with ample light.  If anything, they are maybe a little too sensitive, as it tends to turn on when we are in the house and just walking past the other end of the entrance hallway...but I can live with that.  Good little product. I'd buy again.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I like DeMille, have read most of his books.  This is a good story,but too many jokes, too many clever remarks, for such a serious story. He can be very funny, I didn't appreciate the &#34;blend&#34;.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i have watched the first movie and i loved the movie so I decided that I should read the books. All I can say is I loved them!

B009B8YZKS|5.0|Don't get me wrong but the other halo movies don't compare to this. This really gets to takes the cake.
B009KHCT94|3.0|Good: The first half of the movie, and the visuals. The plot starts out really well, with lots of unique aspects, and stays engaging throughout the first half. If you're anything like me, you will think that the movie just keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better. You will be amazed... until the second half.<br /><br />Bad: The second half of the movie, which turns the most entertaining sci-fi movie I've seen in years into a thinly veiled, passive-aggressive political attack on the USA. (I live in the USA and I DON'T like my government, so keep that in mind.) They take this highly engaging creation, and then they just have to ooze their irrelevant personal opinions all over it. Imagine that you're watching Alien, and in the middle of fighting with the alien, Ripley takes a break to start lecturing the alien about how much she doesn't like Donald Rumsfeld. You'd probably think that was idiotic. It would fail to do anything to advance the plot or character development, and it would seem contrived and out of place. It would seem like something put there by a person who thinks so much of their opinions that they have to interject them into everything, even if they don't match the context of the discussion.<br /><br />This movie comes complete with a female US president who is obviously supposed to be Sara Palin. This includes a room in the White House furnished awkwardly with bear skin rugs and moose heads, and a pretentious take on the US national anthem with lyrics about whether the USA is heaven, or (and this is the implied state of affairs) hell. The Palin character even has a Nazi write a speech for her. It has a lot of badly acted, falsely emotional stuff in it. It makes me think the author doesn't have a cogent argument, or does but won't just come out and say it, and has to surreptitiously tug on my heartstrings instead because that's all they know how to do. Finally, the US behaves in a greedy way and the world's response is a slow shot of the US spaceship being torpedoed by the rest of the countries, who then fall on each other.<br /><br />The overall effect is that I felt mislead and disappointed, like going into a restaurant hungry, but finding that they only sell power tools. I would be fine watching a movie about the tragedies perpetrated by the US government on its own citizens, and the rest of the world, if that's what it was advertised as. In fact, I would probably enjoy that movie. However, luring me in with a fantastic sci-fi plot, and then doing a complete 180 halfway through the movie to snivel and impugn without saying what they were REALLY after, came off as childish. I was surprised to see in the credits that this movie received funding from the EU. Why would they contribute large sums of money to fund a bait-and-switch opinion piece on the US, when their own house is on fire? Don't they need to figure out how to stop Greece from imploding, and taking the rest of the EU with it? And even if they want to be in the movie making business, could they at least choose a plot that doesn't make them look completely sophomoric?<br /><br />Should you see this movie? Well, maybe. Just consider that the people giving it to you are not intellectually honest with themselves. It DOES have a lot of intriguing plot elements and eye candy, and if you aren't too bothered by the ham-handed political message, you might like it a lot.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was the ultimate superhero movie.  The Dark Knight series is quality but bleak.  The Marvel movies are about the wonder and fun.<br /><br />I can't wait to see where they go from here with Phase 2.
B004UID2LC|1.0|The app had to be forced closed three times before I could get it to work. If you want to watch youtube videos on your kindle just search them on the internet, because this app is no good.

B007FG9LIE|3.0|When the fellow wakes up next to a lake and doesn't remember how he got there, then wanders into town with people looking at him strangely, well what am I to think.  He doesn't have any ID but begins to remember things.  He is questioned by a psychologist, beaten by a muscular sheriff, then tortured by someone from his past war experience.  He finds himself in a hospital and trys to escape with the help of an unknown friend who had previously been a bar maid in a tavern that the sheriff in town does not know or ever heard of.  All very strange but by the half-way point of the book I grew weary of reading all of his tortures.  He needs water and food.  He's exhausted.  I'm exhausted and start skipping paragraphs, then reading pages at the top and bottom, finally getting to the torturous end which makes no sense whatsoever.  The suspense is not only killing our hero, it's killing me.  The only thing that makes it better than a Stephen King novel is that is does have an ending - of sorts.  The writing is good and draws you in but because I started skipping meant that I would have appreciated a view from the other side sooner.  I wanted to get to a \\"reason\\" for all of his suffering.  Had anything been explained earlier in the book I could have rated it higher than three stars.<br /><br />No more of the long and drawn out books for me.  The author needs to know when to turn the corner.  He has lost me as a reader.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The acting and plot was absolutely terrible.  Most of the men in it are pretty hot, so I enjoyed that :-)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am not in to those who get turned on by inflicting pain on others to achieve a high.  This book explores the feelings of a young girl who falls in love with a gorgeous looking man and innocently goes along with his quirky ideas in order to find out why he gets a sexual high out of inflicting pain.  I was very disappointed in the book after hearing how great it was, and have no intention of reading the sequels to it.<br />I read for enjoyment and love romantic novels, some of which include steamy sex, but this book should be read by those old enough to know this type of bondage exists.

Some will have you tapping your toes like the live version of Dweller on the Threshhold.  Wavelength is poetry set to a dancing beat.  If you don't know much about Van Morrison's music, start with this one and you will be hooked!  I love this CD.
B007QUUJMG|4.0|The writing style of this novel is quite unique and took a little while to adapt to. But once settled, I enjoyed rolling through this as quite an easy read. Perhaps my brain was on holiday, but I didn't see the ending coming at all so found the conclusion to the novel quite shocking and abrupt.

0756666937|5.0|I bought this book for my 8 year old son, who is utterly fascinated by anything and everything lego, as a christmas gift.<br />Pages are beyond amazing to say the least. it's colorful & durable not flimsy thin pages but heavy duty paper. includes the history of legos, some info on the company & family, some other products they started with & of course nearly every lego set in existence. i love that it includes a great amount of the lego sets he really likes like the harry potter, ninjago, lego city, spongebob...amazing & at a fraction of the price it normally costs anywhere else definitely do not double think this one!<br />bonus - I ordered this on 12/19 & it said to be delivered on 12/24 which i was kind of worried about but wouldn't you know it I got it the next day on 12/20!
B006RUJST6|4.0|I had low expectations, but this turned out to be quite a good little read. Perhaps better suited to a young adult audience?

1439152799|4.0|I purchased this book on the strength of another Kate Morton novel I read. Unfortunately I felt that the other was better and this suffered from comparison. On it's own this is a good read, with an engaging plot and some interesting characters. Just not her best.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|the reason i have to tell you i liked it was because i did not finish it just got busy and my son deleted it, but i did like what i had read so far about half way through
B002U3CCKQ|3.0|I purchased this novel because I really loved Gone Girl. Unfortunately Dark Places suffers from comparison. I thought the book was ok, but not great.
B004X80QNG|5.0|this is a great program works perfect no problem and it is very easy to use and navigate through for beginners.
B002VHI8J0|3.0|I found this incredibly hard going. I know that Cloud Atlas is highly recommended by others, but the first story in particular moves at a glacial pace. I had given up this book three times before I reached the second story. From there it got easier to read, but I didn't particularly enjoy it. Perhaps not literary minded enough to get excited about the themes and messages.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This review is really from a story standpoint as we haven't had a chance to watch all of the extra content.<br />I loved Alien and Aliens and have seen both many times- and as amazing as those both are who wasn't left wanting to know more about the space jockey? Amazing horror, the amazing aliens themselves but you're still left wondering about the otherworldly pilot of that ship. Well you'll get some answers and even more questions and a sizable amount of understanding on where our more recognizable aliens originate. It's definitely a film Ii feel benefits from multiple viewings and the fun of theorizing and speculating on what you're seeing because in my opinion it's not laid out in front of you - it' going to require some thought. I really enjoyed it and definitely felt like this was an aliens movie- if you're a fan of the originals I highly recommend it.
B0031R5K8G|5.0|This book is written in a unique voice that takes a chapter or two to adjust to. Once immersed, there is a beautiful story here with well drawn characters and a wonderful conclusion. Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm 96% finished with this book, and I'm trying to postpone reading the last 4% because it's such a good read; I don't look forward to finishing it.  And, quite frankly, with such a little bit left to read, I STILL have no idea of how it will end.  I definitely recommend GONE GIRL.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I loved this book. A story about a husband and wife who cannot trust each other. Due to the switching narrator the reader experiences the same feelings as those characters, who is telling the truth? Difficult to put down.

B005EGXTEE|5.0|There isn't much to say about the Hunger Games Trilogy that hasn't already been said by twenty other people. A great book.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|My attention has been drifting a bit in and out on this book and I don't know if its the storyline or my waning attention span these days. But its definitely intriguing thus far.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I really enjoyed the first 90% of this novel. Incredible story that absolutely sucked me in, I struggled to put the book down. I found the conclusion a little disappointing, but I'm not sure what else could have been done with it. This was the first Stephen King book I have read and it made me want to read more of his novels.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|I have listened to this album several times now.  There are many who think this is one of Donald Fagen's best and some who think it's among his weakest.  I feel that this is one of his best, though below his masterwork, The Nightfly.<br /><br />This work keeps growing on me the more I listen.  What keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the recording.  The way to go on this, if you can afford it and if you have a good vinyl setup, is the 2LP set mastered at Bernie Grundman's and pressed on clear vinyl.  This album is not going to win any awards for sonics.  It sounds dry, and it lacks the richness and presence of many of the Steely Dan and Donald Fagen solo titles.  That being said, the CD of this sounds thin, opaque, somewhat compressed, and lacks harmonic richness and clarity.  The vinyl, on the other hand, I'd at least give a sonic rating of 7.5/10.  It still is not THE most transparent, but there is a good deal more separation among the instruments and vocals.  Furthermore, while there is a gray cast over the soundstage on the CD, the background on the vinyl is much blacker, allowing a greater deal of harmonic color to come through, plus the subtlety of instrumental lines to be heard much more clearly.  The arrangements here, as is usual for Fagen and Steely Dan, are fairly sophisticated at times and the vinyl mastering allows all of what's going on to be much more appreciated.<br /><br />The vinyl is also more dynamic, so, to me, the musicality of the album is much more readily apparent on the vinyl.  Whereas on the CD, some of the tracks and seem dull, my interest in the music peaks up much more when listening to the vinyl.<br /><br />While the CD is not the overly loud, compressed sonic crap you often hear nowadays, for a Fagen album, it's so lacking in harmonic bloom, presence and transparency, I am quite surprised that Fagen allowed it to be put out.  It just sonically isn't up to his usual standards.<br /><br />The vinyl is still not quite as ripe sounding as say, Goucho, Aja, The Nightfly, it's a MUCH better, more satisfying listen than the CD.  I hate to say it because at $39 retail, it's a lot for a 2LP set with no digital download or CD accompanying it.  Not to mention that the record only takes up three sides (the fourth is blank).  I will say that this weekend, at Soundstage Direct, another online music site, there is an 11% off everything sale plus free shipping.say, Goucho, Aja, The Nightfly, it's a MUCH better, more satisfying listen than the CD.

B005AKFXZW|5.0|One of my favourite books. I read the kindle edition and then went an purchased a hard copy of this book for my bookshelf! A fantastic premise that is developed in to an incredible story. Beautiful writing, wonderful character development, could not be more effusive in my praise. Highly recommend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is great. it kills time but its fine. fun fun gameloft pleases make more free games. gameloft is the best making games.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A main character that you really want to succeed. The plot builds expectation throughout the book and the ending is beautiful. A great read and one I have recommended to others.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It is fun, it works well, no bugs I have found yet.  I would recommend if u enjoy games to keep your mind moving.

B00351YEVC|5.0|Absolutely stunning writing, incredibly moving, richly developed characters (particularly the children), beautiful writing, well worth the time. Would absolutely recommend to others.
B004TACMZ8|5.0|I love it. it can be used as an airport security scanner as well to detect metal or conceal weapons made of steel!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I needed something to do quick carpet sweeping in between regular large vac cleaning and it works on hard surfaces as well so this works just fine for my needs...
1932907009|5.0|Not only is this a very useful screenwriting book but it's also fun to read. In fact, I still refer to it regardless of whether I'm working on a screenplay or writing a book. When I feel I need a bit of a refresher, this is the first book I turn to.
B008Y7Y0AM|5.0|I recently received the vinyl edition of A Map of All Our Failures as an early Christmas present, and I must say that it's a wonderful album! I won't even bother talking about which tracks are the best, because they're all equally magnificent. I've been playing this record non-stop on my Numark turntable for two days, and I simply cannot get enough. It's everything that I expected to hear from a My Dying Bride album and then some! Grab this one if you're a fan of the band.
1449410243|5.0|Matt Inman is the greatest man in the world. If I could marry him, and be with his comic genius for the rest of my life, I would.<br />This is such a great book, and the poster was superb.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I recieved this knife 2 days ago. Really fast shipping. As soon as I openned the box and held it the knife in my hands I was amazed. I did a lot of research before my purchase and I have made a good choice. It's extremely sturdy and well built. The blade was pretty sharp out of the box. The blade is the thickest blade I've ever worked with. I tested it out on some dead trees in the back of my property. Tore up the wood easily with any problems. Very impressed!<br /><br />The handle seems indestructable and sturdy. I have medium sized hands and it feels perfect with and good grip. The sheeth is very tough and fits the blade perfectly. One drawback is that the blade was pretty hard to deploy because of the tight fit. But I just losened the top two screws and now it's much easier to deploy while still having a secure grip on the blade. The only drawback is from the sheeth itself. The knife edge rubs against the sheeth and therefore dulling the blade somewhat. But it's pretty minor to me since it will be used as a hiking/camping tool and I will be doing some heavy duty work with it.<br />All in all it's a great knife.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|No misses here!  Can't wait for the rest of the USA to catch up to Emeli Sande.  She sings as though she's speaking through a glass brightly, with her heart not nearly as concealed as her talent would require in anyone less gifted at voicing the truth of her heart.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|The transfer on the Blu-ray is great, with phenomenal looking scenes and color. The special features and well drawn out, and any fan of the movie should be more than satisfied with what the Blu-Ray has to offer. The only thing I would've liked was directors' commentary, but that's just the spoiled side of me.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I don't get what all the fuss is about!?  Nothing more than an overrated romance novel.  I've read better.  Not considering the sequels.
B004ZBFRTY|4.0|For any fan of the movie, it's a must have with all of its special features and whatnot, but don't be fooled, almost every single special feature is on DVD. However, it's still such a knockout price for everything, the DVD is the best you're gonna get, so just grab it. And also, the transfer isn't that great, but it still plays well on the Blu-Ray player, just not amazing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After the Hunger Games, couldn't wait to read #2.  Easy reading.  It held me attention and was surprised to finish.  Couldn't wait to read #3.
B007ZZKXWS|5.0|Space Nazis how can you go wrong. they say insanity is one step removed from genius and i have to agree with it. This movie is compleatly insane but somehow it works. If you want a crazy over the top action adventure then you found it. One issue though your going to need a region free DVD player to use this
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading the first 2, was a little disappointed on this one.  Felt a little 'draggy' and was still glad that I finished the trilogy.  I would read the author again.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|I enjoy Daniel Craig as Bond, I have seen all the Bond movies and he is now my favorite.  I bought 'Casino Royale' and now I have Quantum, I just saw 'Skyfall' at the movies and will but it the moment it become available.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was pleased with this one!  I couldn't put it down.  Easy to read and get into.  Couldn't wait to get to #2. Loved the characters and concept.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|For a free app, you get all of the different tones working nicely. Paid version will let you run this in the background. No big deal though, you can still turn off the screen when playing in the free one so its ok.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Pretty good story telling. I'll probably check out the next book in the series. I would definitely recommend this one.

I will miss him.

B009MF56GC|4.0|This was a great action movie, the first one let me down a bit, too much self reflecting drama. This one is great, the original cast was really good, but Chuck Norris was great, I just wish he would have had more screen time, and Jet Li was awesome too. Really enjoyed it!

B001N3OJEG|2.0|I love this movie but hate the format.  Have ordered twice now from sellers which advertised DVD as fullscreen.  Both times turned ou to be letterbox, which I hate.
B0084HJE0S|2.0|I really think what somes thks book is the title I have given it for review. It is inconsistant and under explaned and lacking for any programer let alone any lay person to use it.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I saw the hero of the book on 60 minutes and I decided to buy his biography. I was not disappointed. His story of deprivation in the work camp, his escape at the age of 23, and his new life outside North Korea is extremely instructive. As someone who lived under a communist rule for 20 years, I was very familiar with the depravity of communist regimes, particularly in the former Soviet Union and in China. I knew about gulag, about Red terror in the USSR in the thirties, about executions of political opponents, about famines that killed tens of millions of people, and about forced resettlements of various ethnic groups to Siberia and beyond. But I had no idea about another incredible depravity perpetrated by a communist regime, this time in North Korea. I had no idea about the existence of huge, virtually non-escapable work camps, run as industrial towns, with factories, farms, mines, housing complexes, schools, and hospitals, where children were born to imprisoned parents, raised in captivity as if they were animals, deprived of basic information about the world outside the fence, forced to work from an early age, and died from hunger, exhaustion, beatings, or work-related injuries years later, without ever setting their foot outside the electric fence of the camp. Since the camp where the hero of this book was born (one of a number of similar camps) was established in 1959, quite a few generations of people were born, lived and died in the camp. I believe that this camp is still in operation. This is truly chilling, and at the same time, unknown even to people who are familiar with communist depravities elsewhere.
B004T6IBNY|5.0|I love pinball and this provides a nice way to pass the time if you like pinball as well.  If you are unsure of whether you want to actually pay money for the premium version, you might want to first download Pinball Deluxe Free.  Give it a spin, and if you like the free version, go ahead and upgrade.  I highly recommend for pinball enthusiasts.

0321885112|5.0|This book comes in multiple editions, and I believe this version which comes with access to the video is by far the best value.
0375507256|4.0|It captures the imagination and sends it whirling into different worlds. Mitchel has a gift for sending the reader on a rollercoaster ride into other realities.

B007FG9LIE|2.0|Reads like a sophomore creating writing project.  Sort of like science fiction, but not really.  Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.
0553801473|1.0|(semi-crossposted from Westeros.org)<br /><br />Unlike many of Ice and Fire's fans I wasn't put off much by Feast. I did think it was the weakest of the first 4 books but there seemed to be good excuses for that. It was \\"bridging the 5 year gap\\", had tier 2 characters, etc etc. That just made me all the more hungry for the next book. The writing was still good and it was sort of refreshing to take a break from the plot-heavy action for a more leisurely look at Westeros.<br /><br />But in ADWD it is beyond obvious that something has gone seriously wrong. From what little happens, Dance and Feast could have been combined into one book easily. EASILY. There is no reason we had to have eleventy chapters of Tyrion looking at turtles and having witless conversations with Penny, or of Dany tugging her braids and doing absolutely nothing except chaining up the only sources of her power base and forgetting about them.<br /><br />Worse, though - the prose feels DEAD. Ugly. Muddy. Crude. Bitter. There's always been darkness and profanity in the series, but there used to be an energy behind it, a contrast to beautiful and hopeful things that were also present. Now every POV seems to have the same tired and sour mind behind it - a mind that I'm worried is that of the author himself who just might have started to really hate the series.<br /><br />My anticipation for the rest of the series feels like it's been surgically removed. It's amazing how differently I feel now than when I started Dance. I have no more faith in GRRM's ability to handle his profession and will stop recommending this series to my friends.<br /><br />Two stars on its own merits. One star because it is not just a bad book in and of itself, it also torpedoes what had been shaping up to be a truly great story.
B007QPFGJW|1.0|Selected this one on the basis of others' reviews. Turned out a big mistake.  The setting is Oslo.  The theme is all about drugs and occsionally rats as they enter an illusionary state.  I could take it only a short while and gave up about a third of the way through, besides I got lost in the streets of Oslo.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Not yet optimized for the HD screen of my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, but this app has everything anyone could want in a weather app. Perhaps the &#34;Wunderground&#34; is slightly more comprehensive, but this one is built right into the Kindle, and it has 95% of what the Wunderground has - plus this one loads instantly, while the Wunderground takes a lot longer to load.
B003TOMAPC|2.0|I tried to look at this movie because I liked Aaron Johnson Taylor in Anna Karenina, but it had such fowl language I just could not watch it. The basic premise was used on Glee and I thought it was a very fun idea  I hope Mr. Johnson will not limit his work to R rated movies.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|If you want this bluray you have already seen the movie, so I wont review the film.  However, the bulray is top notch.  I don't have a high def display yet, but the picture and sound are superb on my standard def television with anamorphic squeeze running lossy 5.1 sound.  Haven't really had time to go through the extras yet, but they seem to be the standard fare.  I was able to see The Batmobile extra feature and thought that was pretty well done and interesting.  The ultraviolet copy of the film is useless to me since you can't use it in iTunes, but it's there for those who like a UV copy.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I still love Rod Stewart after all these years!!  Fabulous Christmas music-smooth, sexy voice!  Absoluetly love Rod Stewart and Merry Christmas, Baby!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Excellent classic! No wonder they made so many movies out of it...!!! I would read it all over again, maybe next Christmas!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A very entertaining tale that mixes characters who love books and bookstores, with modern technology in the quirky atmosphere of present-day San Francisco.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Seriously when I saw this book I noticed everyone was reviewing it with 5 stars saying how great it was and I admit I was skeptical at first because there have been quite a few books that I've read that have been rated as 5 stars and to me haven't been a 5 star book. So when I started reading this it was cute I liked the story, but you could tell something big was coming. When you learn the secret its INSANE! Everything started clicking and I swear I was so overwhelmed with emotions. Just when you think you're done, even more surprises hit you and you're like OMG!!! can this story tug on your heart anymore!! It was a beautifully written story and so powerful and passionate. I love Sky and Holder and I love their story. This book definitely deserves way more than 5 stars because it was absolutely positively AMAZING!!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is so fun. You build your own army base and make it really big you can raise your own troops and build vehicles. Then you can fight friends or other people and do the campaign.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable. Not as good as early Clancy, but a good read nonetheless. I look forward to the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, easy read.  A fun sci fi thriller that throws you into intense action which is hard to down until you finish the story.  The best book of the three.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The movie is for a Xmas gift, but I know it will be appreciated. It arrived promptly.<br />Having a word requirment is stupid!
159562015X|3.0|The book did not really tell me anything I did it already know.  It could some help some people who need this.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|An interesting adaptation of the theme of man vs man and survival.  An endearing heroine.  Leaves you with a hunger for more of her life adventures.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Of the three books this was my least favorite.  The first book is the best by far, the second not as good but better than the third

B003O86FMW|4.0|A good read and exciting sci-fi story.  Not as good as the first book but still a good read that is hard to put down until its finished.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was amazing. I finished it in one day. It really wheeled me in. And I highly suggest reading it yourself.

B007THA4FI|3.0|Really love the detail but the story takes forever to pick up. It is super depressing,too. Still a good read with an important message
B007SGLZP8|3.0|not to be taken seriously but a fun read<br />flows good and all together enjoyable hard to put down .
B000YHG72E|4.0|Will Ferrell isn't my favorite comedian, but he's good in this movie.  Not appropriate for young children, but still mostly funny.  Some crude humor, but good physical comedy.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My newphew loved this item.  A hit for anyone who loves legos and wants to enjoy something every day in December.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|It was a really cute movie.  I liked the updated take on how Santa delivers presents!  I already recommended it to my brother.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I've watched this movie at least 3 times every Christmas season since 1989. It is not only hilarious, but also relates to almost every 'normal' family and extended family I know. Brilliant writing and great cast. Never tire of watching this and finally realized I didn't own it yet on DVD, soI bought it for myself as a Christmas gift. As much as I love this movie, there are a few things I could do without ie. one F bomb, main happily married male character flirting suggestively with younger woman, then fantasizing about her losing her bathing suit in pool and a few other suggestive things that weren't needed.  This movie would be funnier without those things.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I don't care for Kristen Stewart's acting.  She acted just like she was Bella in the Full moon movies.  I don't recommend it.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|This was the best of the trilogy. You could see the writer mature in her expression even it still contained too many 'oh my' & too much 'flushing' .
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It ended up being different from what I thought it would be which is great!  I love to be surprised by movies!!
0547884591|5.0|I own both kindle and print version. And I must tell you, the print version is the most beautiful book that I've ever seen. Impressive stuff plus extraordinary print equals jackpot.<br />Good luck to all who want to translate this book because they wont do it any justice. Cheers.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book in two days because I couldn't put it down. I couldn't 'figure out whether Jacob committed the crime or not. I had to keep reading to find out the answer. One unusual feature of this book is that I did not like the book's main character at all (and it isn't Jacob). I found him maddeningly frustrating and unlikable. That feature makes the book different from most.
078322947X|5.0|Not CITIZEN KANE...not RULES OF THE GAME. SORCERER and HEAVEN'S GATE are the two greatest films ever made.<br />And Cimino and Friedkin paid a heavy price for creating them, as all TRULY great and challenging artists must. Genius ain't pretty.<br /><br />See them, and realize everything you think is \\"brilliant\\", isn't.
1451695195|4.0|This book is a must-read for atheists, agnostics, and those who want to re-affirm their faith in God and Heaven. It presents the most compelling evidence I've read for the existence of God and Heaven. The author describes his near-death experience. My one regret is that he does not describe it in great detail. I found it interesting that the author states that near-death experiences date back to Ancient Greece and Egypt and that they're fairly commonplace occurrences. He also provides an extensive reading list at the end. I had no idea that the literature on near-death experiences was so vast. He is persuasive in proving that his experience of God and Heaven could not have been produced by his brain; God and Heaven must exist independently of him. A compelling read!
B009LDCZDC|5.0|all i can say is that i'm helplessly addicted to this wild show & it has made every other series i once loved a complete bore. just topped off season 2 & am devastated i have to wait another year for more. it will be nice to have my life back though... buckle up.
B0091LS0BU|5.0|I love this album so when i saw there was a blu-ray I bought it without hesitation.<br /><br />It is interspersed with quick interview snippets, but nothing too intrusive - and it makes it useful as both a casual listen and a documentary. Some of the best musicians are on this, so if you're familiar and appreciate them, it's a huge bonus.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this riveting (I didn't watch the entire thing in one session) but it's still excellent entertainment for the right time and mood.

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Best Batman ever! It is a classic in my book. The acting, story, action, everything in the movie was awesome.
0307341577|3.0|This book started off very well but it seemed rushed toward the end. It is decent, but not one that will have you talking about it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have had no problems with this app. Some reviews say it has a lot of glitches I haven't experienced any (yet) only had the app a few days but I think it works great
0785162348|5.0|I got this as a gift, but from the front and back it looks good and I think he will like it. I would recommed it to those who like the Avengers.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I never imagined that I would write anything less than a glowing review of this album, but I'm afraid I must do just that. I understand that this is a \\"highlights\\" album, but how on earth is \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" not a highlight?<br /><br />As for the music that is present, it's good, but it's hard for me to hear the songs being \\"acted\\" rather than sung. I'm sure this will make for a fantastic film, but it doesn't make for an amazing listening experience. I never expected for Jackman to equal Colm Wilkinson or Crowe to equal Philip Quast, yet I still feel disappointed. (As a sidenote, Eddie Redmayne has exceeded my expectations,  Samantha Barks is as wonderful as I hoped, and I was thrilled to hear Wilkinson as the Bishop.)<br /><br />A highlights album will inevitably leave out someone's favorite song, and I'd recommend you check the track list before deciding to purchase this album to make sure your favorite song is included--I sure wish I'd done that! Surely they'll release a complete cast recording at some point that will make everyone happy. Until then, I'll keep listening to my favorite Les Mis recording, [[ASIN:B0027P2ZWC Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert]].
B00000425L|5.0|In this Double Decca recording, Vladimir Askenazy gives us a fine interpretation of the complete sets of Preludes by Sergei Rachmaninov. The Preludes were published in three sets. The earliest - and the first of Rachmaninov's published pieces for the piano - was the second movement of the five pieces comprising his Op.3 of 1892. The second set of 10 Preludes, Op.23 appeared in 1903 and the final set of 13 pieces, Op.32, was published in 1910. The Op.3 piece is one of the most popular pieces Rachmaninoff composed.<br /><br />In addition to the preludes, the CD is completed by a performance of the Sonata No.2 of 1913, which was revised in 1931. All of these pieces are so thoroughly characteristic of Rachmaninov's romantic music, beautifully played by Ashkenazy.

B009K0P10K|5.0|CAN WAIT TILL NEXT SEASON, JUST A BIT DISAPPOINTED IN THE LAST COUPLE EPISODES. WILL CAPTIVATE. WORTH IT GO GET IT!
B0086700CM|1.0|This is horrible and it doesn't let me turn the way I want to it isn't a fun game like iPods this is horrible!!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is a kick ass ending for the Dark Knight. I have to be truthful, I hate Batman Begins,.and love The Dark Knight. This isn't quite as good as the Dark Knight, but it is definitely worthy of being it's sequel.<br /><br />Tom Hardy did an excellent job as Bane, and the issue with not being able to hear him is not a problem at all. He plays a very smart and tough villain, and you definitely believe he can give Batman a run for his money.<br /><br />Christian Bale pulls off another great performance a a the Dark Knight. He makes you believe Batman is worn down and age is becoming a factor. Good thing he has Catwoman to help out every now and then, and she its some sweet eye candy, which is always a plus!<br /><br />So I don't think you need me to tell you to check this one out, since out was the most anticipated film of 2012.
B004LUHQ1G|2.0|The hit songs were great, but the rest of the CD was not as good as it was reviewed!  A little dissappointed in the Foo's.
B0068RHSZO|4.0|I thought this was a fantastic thriller and am very surprised at all the negative reviews. It may not be the most sophisticated thriller, but it does have twists and surprisingly alot of heart, the ending was sad in a way and kind of just melts your heart, which is something you don't usually get in these type of movies.<br /><br />I thought the acting was spot on. Daniel was perfect as Will, he seems like a normal, successful man, who really lives his family. At the same time you can tell there is something troubling him. Rachel did a fantastic job as the wife/mother. She is just perfect. She has a sweet and innocent feel to her that makes you fall in love with her and care about her. The two little girls, who are sisters in real life, do a great job also. They have limited screen time, but they still make you care about them and want to protect them. Naomi does a great job also, you are not sure of she can be trusted or not, which really helps drive the story and makes you want to find out more about her.<br /><br />I say ignore all the stupid negative reviews and be sure to check this movie out.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I bought two of these because this is going to become a true collectors piece.  One will be given to my 8-year old son for his next birthday; the other one is an investment piece to be enjoyed a couple of years down the road. The LEGO Star wars Super Star Destroyer is going to become a highly collectible piece; Lego will most likeley discontinue this in 2013.  Regarding shipping...  This is a giant and very heavy Lego box: close to 16 lbs.  Previous reviewers on these heavy Lego sets have sometimes noted that the LEGO product box arrived damaged because the outer shipping carton was beaten up.  I agree that these expensive sets should be packaged with more care by Amazon (cardboard boxes should be sealed with tape along \\"all edges\\" of the cardboard box; not just the horizontal fold of the box).  I have a simple solution to minimize any potential shipping damage: upgrade your account to Amazon Prime and select Next Day Air for $3.99 which ensures save arrival (ground shipments take several days during which the boxes are naturally beaten up along the way).  $3.99 upgrade for overnight is a very small price to pay considering the high price tag of this item.  By the way, I have purchased numerous times from the online lego store and I find that their packaging system is pretty equal to Amazon.  Just upgrade to Next Day Air and you will have less to worry about.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious! If you are a fan of Seth than it is guaranteed you are going to love this film. Where else can you find a raunchy teddy bear who likes to have sex, get stoned, is in love with Flash, and scared to death of thunder? There isn't another movie like this out there, it is nice to see something so original come out of Hollywood!<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg does a excellent job on this movie. Most of the time he was reacting to air, which had to be hard, but he pulls it offs with ease. The fight scene is a very good representation of this. This had got to be one of Marks best films, he really helps to suck you into the story, and in some weird way believe it.<br /><br />If you want to have a good laugh this movie provides lots of them, don't pass this one up, you will surely regret it if you do!
0399160450|5.0|I have read all of Tom Clancy's novels.  This one is very hard to put down. I also like the fact that Clancy follows the same characters in his novels.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This movie was spectacular! I was really blown away by all the negative reviews,which seem to mostly be about Kristin Stewart for some reason, and they almost kept me from seeing this movie, but I am glad I went ahead and watched it cause now I am looking forwards to the sequel. The CGI is incredible, the fight scenes were really well done and the villain is a grade A badass.<br /><br />Like I mentioned above alot of the negative reviews seem to be focused on Kristen, who I thought did a great job as Snow White. I think the whole cheating scandal was still fresh and everyone was just hating on her, and thanks to that this movie kind of got a bad rep right from the get go, but let me tell you, this is a awesome movie and it is definitely worth checking out!
B00005JMUA|4.0|Kill Bill Volume 2 is a great movie with good acting by all the actors in it.  I agree with other people doing reviews volume 1 was more action less plot.  Volume 2 on the other hand is more plot driven and less action but still has mutiple action scenes the scene with the fighting between the main character and another woman in Budd's trailer.  The other scene is when she is being trainned by the master ontop of the temple.  What did it for me though is the character trying to find out if her daughter is still alive and find a way to kill Bill.  When it gets to be face to face she is shock beyond anything and left speechless when she finds Bill and the surpise he has for her.  So overall this is a great movie to watch the first one being about 2 hours, and the second movie being about 2 hours and 15 minutes.  So if you like the director's style of writting and directing then pick this movie up for the action, plotline, drama, and pure intensity of a determined woman getting her revenge on a man who tried to kill her.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is beyond words good. Awesome - wonderful! I cried and laughed. I fell in live! It consumes you and does not let go.<br />Trust me you need to read this. Ok so I am a Colleen Hoover fan. Slammed amazing. Once again she has knocked off my socks! This book tops my lists. Sky and Dean (Holder) I don't have the right words.<br />This books deals with some gritty stuff. It's raw and makes your heart ache for them. You struggle with them. Honestly I just cannot tell you enough here.. Read this book!<br />Sky is witty! She is strong! I loved her! Getting to know her page after page was a gift. She just was such a brave and strong person. Holden.. Hello! Perfectly written from start to finish. It is not possible to not fall in love with him. He is so full of regret. When he speaks he melts your heart. He carefully chooses words and you feel him with each one. This does not even speak about the physical connection they share. I felt my breath catch while reading parts of their story. It was that good! It is wrote so perfectly that you feel each touch, look and moment. We have secrets that are revealed. Life is not what we think and well so many things. I'm being serious nothing I say will do this book justice. Nothing. I can only say with my whole heart read it. Allow it in, save a day for it because once you start you cannot stop. It's just that good. Its beautiful and dark and it makes you feel every letter on the pages. It will break you in pieces and heal you within the chapters. I was blown away once again by Colleen. Keep it up! Please!!!!
B001TODCII|4.0|Taken is a very good action movie with a great message about family.  What I mean is it shows how far you would go to protect your family and get your daughter back.  The movie is very fast past and intense fight scenes with guns, knife's and other weapons.  If you don't mind some great fight scenes bloody bodies, and things getting blown up then this is the movie for you.  It is a very enjoyable movie and I never get tired of watching it because of the great acting by Liam Neeson, the plotline, and the scenes of Paris landscape.  It is one of few action movies or movies in general I can watch from start to finish in one setting, so if you have yet to watch this movie pick it up and savor a great action movie with lots of elements for the fans to enjoy as they watch the movie, you won't regret buying it trust me.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I want to read slower to make this last. Harry is part of me now. He is moving towards retirement! Surely this is a testament to the quality and appeal of Mr. Connily's talents. I loved this book.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|If you are on the fence about seeing this movie, let me help you.<br /><br />SEE IT!<br /><br />This movie is unpredictable, funny and above all else touching. It isn't common these days to find something this funny that has this much heart. I assure you, if you are looking for a funny, family friendly movie to watch...this is your movie.
B008BU70HW|5.0|Downton Abbey pulls you into it's story of this amazing family; as you go through the Joys, Trials, and Scandles. I eagerly anticipate each episode and savor them.
B000WT7R6O|5.0|A must have for any Supernatural fan. Not only is the story engaging, and the effects incredible, but the two lead actors are so handsome that they can be distracting in the best possible way.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A continuation of book 1 full of unexpected twists and turns.  The characters develop further and the ending leaves you hungry for what lies ahead.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a fun game to play. I like the different rooms you can go to. It is pretty fasted paced.
B0058YPL66|5.0|We really enjoy this show, it is one of the best shows on television. We can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD.<br />We normally record it on our DVR, this is so much nicer not having to fast forward through the commercials, and having my wife say &#34;OH WHAT WAS THAT, I WANT TO SEE THAT COMMERCIAL&#34; I despise commercials, once we get our collection of TV shows, we are having the satellite disconnected!<br />I enjoy watching my favorite episodes again and again!
B00A993UWM|3.0|It's ok.  I still love her though!  The album starts out strong but eventually all of the songs start running into each other.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The dancing is fabulous. The story line is innocent and heart warming. It is a wonderful movie to watch with the family during the holidays.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|This game is so challenging and addictive. There is no way you wouldn't love this game. Its stimulating and keeps you going for hours if you're not paying attention to the time.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Pac-Man is released on pretty much every system known to man. From the top of my head, I can already recall it being released on Game Boy, Nintendo DS, NES, Wii, PSP, Sega Genesis, etc, in pretty much any Namco Museum game collection ever (If not that, then perhaps some kind of Pac-Man game with the arcade game as a bonus).<br /><br />So why is it necessary for Namco to give us a one-level demo? I mean....I'm pretty sure Namco Museum is a very affordable collection. And that's on everything since the Playstation 1. For all I know, the full game of Pac-Man should have been free, if not a dollar or two.<br /><br />If you could find Pac-Man on just about anything, then there's no reason why anyone should come across this incredibly small demo. Just simply buy a Namco Museum or some collection for whatever system you may have. Or you could just go ahead to an arcade. Do anything but play the Lite version or buy the iOS game for a hefty $5 (Considering it's the original Pac-Man).<br /><br />To help decide, here's a list of systems Pac-Man is released for and in what game/collection it is in:<br /><br />Game Boy - Pac-Man: Special Color Edition (Includes puzzler game Pac-Attack)<br />Game Boy Advance - Pac-Man Collection, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary<br />Playstation - Namco Museum Volume 1<br />Nintendo 64/Dreamcast - Namco Museum<br />Gamecube/Xbox/PS2 - Namco Museum, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary (Gamecube games can also be played on Wii)<br />Wii - Pac-Man Party, Namco Museum Megamix<br />DS - Namco Museum<br />PSP - Namco Museum Battle Collection<br />Xbox 360 - Namco Museum Virtual Collection, Pac-Man (Xbox Live Arcade)<br />PS3 - Namco Museum Essentials, Pac-Man (Playstation Store)<br />3DS - Pac-Man Party 3D, Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions, Pac-Man (Game Boy - Virtual Console)<br /><br />Again, many of these collections are much more affordable than buying Pac-Man on iOS for $5. To top that off, they contain many (with few exceptions) other Namco arcade games to sweeten the deal.weeten the deal.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is an easy to use and handy app for the kindle fire.  I'm glad that I downloaded it for my own use.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart is a;ways good.  And at Christmas it's double terrific.  We have all of his &#34;oldie&#34; albums and this one adds to our enjoyment.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Although I'm a big fan of family guy, i didn't have high expectations of this movie.  I was quite pleased with how funny it was
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Many have praised Goodwin's work and I'm just another (new) fan.  Bluntly, this is my first &#34;history&#34; book since school.  I didn't think I would enjoy it so much, but lately I've found myself watching documentaries on the History Channel so I gave it a shot and I'm so glad I did!  I couldn't put it down...twice!<br /><br />After the second read, and a trip to the theatre to see the movie (which was also amazing!), I've just finished reading &#34;Killing Lincoln&#34; and loved every page.<br /><br />Team of Rivals highlights the greatness of Lincoln and leaves the reader with a heightened sense of sadness that we'll never know Lincoln's true potential.  I've tried to imagine how different our country might have been had Booth not been successful and had Lincoln completed his second term.  No one will ever truly know how much he could have done, but we know, from what he was able to do, that it would be great.<br /><br />Thank you Doris Kearns Goodwin for making me a fan of history and for introducing the world to Abraham Lincoln in such a personal way.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Best Drama on TV. Maybe Ever. Period. Mandy Patinkin is the star as far as I'm concerned. This is a must watch for any thrill seeker.
0060594896|5.0|This is a book that I will continue to read for the rest of my life. I love Jack Canfield!
B000A7DVR2|1.0|I heard so many people (usually burned out stoners with skulls full of mush) rave about this movie, so I bought it. Big mistake. Like most mediocre movies, it has some moments, but overall sucky.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|the game is very fun but it wont let me download the full version for some reason but if it lets u download it I defenitly recimend this game its very addictive and fun
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I've used it one day so far. Its harder than the space one. Its frustrating when the pigs are in cased in rocks.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Great fun and runs perfectly on my Kindle. Got it on DotD, but think its worth the money also.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|The suspense is there but it's still not as good as the 1st season. Hopefully the 2nd half of season 2 will be better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This sequel is so good, it feels as if it is written by a committee, a table filled with smart women whose clever, sophisticated ideas on characters and situations and details all contribute to the exciting, erotic plot.  I have read many of Sylvia Day's books, it is always a pleasure, but these Crossfire books have so much happening in them from so many directions, they are a thrill to read and re-read.  I admire the skill and ambition of this author!  The Crossfire characters are consistent but complicated, their families are interesting and three-dimensional, and they live in an exciting city with lots of plot opportunities, and a country with many beautiful excursion locations.  American characters written by an American!  Thank you for many terrific hours of reading.
B009OA57MI|1.0|The free version works but not the purchased version. I would not buy this product. Hopefully they will fix it soon.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|The Jurassic Park trilogy brought back memories from my child hood. Although the first movie is rather old it translates very well to high definition. I could watch these movies over and over. A worthy investment.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Yet again, another wonderful album from an amazing band!! I love the music and enjoyed the duet with Carrie Underwood!
B000PMG16U|5.0|This is Episode 1, 2 and 3 of the the Star Wars Series. Although Attack of the Clones is a terrible movie this is a great purchase. In high definition these movies look amazing. If you enjoy star wars at all you should pick this up.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great job Vince Flynn! The story was engaging, the dialogue realistic, and the story was fantastic. I eagerly await the next Rapp saga.
B00009YOQW|5.0|I wanted some natural toys without chemicals for my childcare infants and toddlers.  This not only satisfies our music and rhythm urges, but has a great tone also.  Actually 3 different tones depending on which section you tap.  I'll likely keep the mallet up until it's time for us to use it together since I know they'll put it in their mouths still.  With the natural materials used, there was a small crack in the side where the wood bends.  Doesn't affect the drum at this time.
B000W453KQ|5.0|I revisited this title after many years. Being a Streisand fan has been a bit of a guilty pleasure over the years as many in my day were mixed about her as an actress. I was astounded at the layers in this movie and the absolute cinematic richness. So many historical elements are touched on and the story of these two is realistic to a fault and honest. If you are looking for a hero or a happy ending you will meet only realism and frailty in Robert Redford's character. Streisand's character is the real hero in this story of love, history, and surprising warmth.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|I love this CD.  I listen to this CD while in the kitchen, in the bedroom, and in the car.
B005LAIH2W|1.0|What movie combines the absolute worst writing, directing, and acting of the 21st century?  So far, \\"John Carter\\" gets my vote.  On Amazon, the customer reviews indicate a hit movie, with revenues dozens of times the budget.  But it lasted only two weeks in theaters, and I can see why.<br /><br />Edgar Rice Burroughs was a hack, but like Louis Lamour, he was a hack with vision, and a decent writer as well.  His dialog was a little stilted, but his vision was well above average, and his storytelling ability -- spellbinding.  But this movie has nothing in common with the \\"Martian Books\\" other than the names of the characters and locations.<br /><br />Plotwise, the movie seems confused, erratic, even drugged.  The dialog is base and pretentious, among the worst of any large-budget film I've seen.  And the vision is strained and trite.  It would have been a thousand times better if Disney and company had simply taken the plot, vision, and dialog straight from the books, simply editing out whatever was burdensome (and there is a bit of that).  But making up everything from scratch?  Why even bother to use the names from the Burroughs books?<br /><br />The Peter Jackson \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, with its inept dialog and mediocre attempts to fill in gaps in the books with meaningless action and supposition, was saved by superb acting (I wonder if his version of \\"The Hobbit\\" will be so lucky) and some wonderful settings.  But \\"John Carter\\" has none of that.  The acting is as unpalatable as the dialog the actors are faced with, and the settings are pure CGI.<br /><br />The plot, however, is the real nemisis of this piece of spoiled celluloid.  It's hard to tell where it is coming from at any given moment.  This is the lesson I hope Jackson has learned:  Stick to the original; there is a reason why it is so famous and beloved.  Somehow, \\"John Carter\\" seems like a haphazard attempt to combine disparate elements from the first three books, simply rushing along on a path tofailure.  I heard that Disney intended this to kick-start a franchise.  Then why not let it play out as the original stories did?  They became a successful franchise.  \\"A Princess of Mars\\", a complete story unto itself, would have been a thousand times better.  After making up a new story and character for the first thirty minutes, the writers and director try to cram way too much into the remaining time.<br /><br />Last, but not least:  Characterization in this is so dull.  The obligatory \\"woman with a sword\\" (again, see Peter Jackson's LOTR, in which any woman can get the drop on Aragorn -- why didn't Sauron just send a half-naked babe with a blade after his mortal enemy?) replaces the Burroughs-era obligatory \\"damsel-in-distress\\", without adding anything of value to the story.  John Carter, instead of being the honorable \\"southern gentleman\\" becomes the \\"rebellious adult-delinquent\\".  And the extra weight of cramming too much plot and weird magic (nowhere in the books is there any magical device, nor a Thern on earth) simply takes away from the novels' delightfully slow revelation of character of the green and red men and women of Barsoom, and their culture (like when John Carter first calls Dejah Thoris \\"my princess\\", ignorant of the impact of those words between a red man and woman, or the significance of her calling him \\"my chieftain\\").  This flick is all black-and-white characters, none of which have any motivation, depth, or subtlety, led by  the protagonist constantly whining about wanting his \\"cave of gold\\".<br /><br />These reflections concern only the first hour of the movie, as I have no intention of watching the rest.  This may be the worst money I've spent since the \\"Kill Bill\\" dvds went on sale for $5 apiece.  And this was $14.99 -- what a travesty.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|mad men season 5 finale ending sequence starting from the new office window gazing, through the walking off set (epic cinematography), to the &#34;are you alone&#34; ending... just wow. that is an epic piece of film making and should have won the emmy just for that. just wow. and the opening and closing of doors motif. just wow. weiner is a genius.<br /><br />The rest of the season is full of gems like this.  this is easily the best peace of TV I have ever seen.  And that is inclusive of the Sopranos...
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The colors and scenery in this movie are beautiful, and the characters varied and not necessarily what you think.  It reminded me of a trip to India a few years ago.  A pleasure to watch.

B003TH14H4|5.0|Classic mysteries sprinkled with funny innuendoes.  Storylines move quickly.  law and order with Mentalist twist.  Easy to watch and enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first, the book seemed slow to catch my interest, but not even half way through I couldn't put it down. I think the only thing I don't like is that it's a three part series instead of one giant book that could continue reading. Can't wait to get started on the next!
B0059XTTW8|3.0|I suppose we should be thankful for what this film is - a realistic interpretation of the way the real intelligence community works, or did work in the '70's.  Thankfully, no overly extended chase scenes, gun battles, improbable martial arts, etc.  In fact, there may be only three gun shots in the whole film.  John Le Carre's novel is replicated in atmosphere, realism, and tension.  It's a subtle and dark film, and no doubt some reviewers who thought it slow and dull may not be tuned in to something that isn't \\"Mission Impossible Part Whatever.\\"  So I thank the filmmakers here for trying to provide a cerebral spy film, for a change.<br /><br />But my problem is that I have the memory of the seven-part BBC production from 1979 as my touchstone, and by comparison, this film falls short in some ways. It's unfair to say Gary Oldman is not as convincing as the late great Sir Alec Guinness in the role of George Smiley.  Oldman offers a commendable (if rather constrained) version, given the impossibly short time he gets to develop the character.  This may in fact reveal why the film is a bit unfulfilling - by trying to cram into one reasonable-length film, a sprawling, intricate, complex, and carefully developed story that took the BBC over seven hours to portray was not a task that could be done without truncating something.  This shows in the characters.  Even several of the main characters under suspicion of being the mole in MI6, Bland, Esterhase, and Haydon, have little dialog.  Only Alleline, in my view somewhat miscast with Toby Jones in the role, has significant words that extend very far.<br /><br />This truncation is so extensive that Ann Smiley, the troublesome wife who drives much of Smiley's thinking, is not only without dialog, I don't actually think there's a full facial shot of her (this character was much better developed in the BBC series). Perhaps the director thinks this was an effective device to make Ann mysterious, but it just makes it puzzling how Smiley can be so tortured by her, when we barely know what the heck she looks like, much less what she may say that also creates anguish for Smiley.<br /><br />I suppose for those not already knowing the plot there would also be an issue of confusion, since the non-continuous scene jumping and flashbacks could lose many.  Also, the jargon of period British intelligence could be puzzling to some as well. Again, given so little time to work on the development of what is perhaps one of the best Cold War spy stories, one gets the impression that too much content is being forced into too small of a vehicle.  OK, modern audiences may not have the patience or attention span to sit through many hours of a multi-part series these days, but compressing 7 hours of a story (which as I recall, was still pretty compelling) into 2 hours or so means something's going to be lost.  And this film loses a bit too much.<br /><br />To be fair, I would recommend the film, even if I feel it could have been more complete, and/or more faithful to the full story that I think Le Carre was intending to tell.  It's still a very interesting effort and worth watching.
B008NIS2SS|5.0|The best jazz pianist ever in great perfromances, esp the set with Nat Adderley. V. good sound quality even if mono.
0553328255|3.0|The stories of course are amazing. I think I'd rather buy a better quality copy next time. Perhaps I would even get each book separately. Don't get me wrong, I use these copies to read on the train for about two semesters, but they're just so big! And the one I used is falling apart, but don't take my word for it because I put it through hell.<br /><br />It comes with two books, the first of which is thicker than any textbook I've ever owned. I never actually got to open the second one because I ended up getting a tablet. If you weren't aware, I think all these books are public domain and the e-books are available for free on all the book stores apps.<br /><br />All in all, a decent set for the price. This was definitely a great deal before I got my tablet. But don't expect them to last very long and they're not very practical for everyday reading.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|well written and helped me with my faith...not tons of bible verses like half of the books out there.  Just a man and his experiences.
B0000X61UU|3.0|I have Cindy's first workout tape and I love it. The first tape has two 40-45 minute workouts and a 10 minute workout, so you can alternate between them. This workout is good, but it takes about 50-60 minutes, which is a little too long for my busy schedule and I don't like the order of the workout. I would recommend her first one highly and this one as a maybe...

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoyed playing the game. It was easy to play. I will tell my friends to get the app to play.
B005LJETYI|3.0|You think that grown ups are way past needing pictures in our book, isn´t it? well, i sure needed a picture, drawing or  frakin resemblance of what did the mimisc look like.... &#34;bloated frog, spike shooting starfish&#34; spare me please!!!
B00A757EFW|4.0|I have to get used to the controls, bur I did enjoy the game.I will continue to play it until i get the hang of it.
B004MPJZ1O|4.0|WOMEN ROCK! Love to see women getting revenge. Great movie and way better than  the remake. My husband recommended this movie and we really enjoyed watching it
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Better than the first, but not as good as the second one. The Joker makes the entire trology worth it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Love this case.  It protects without be clunky and is the perfect case for protecting my kindle.  Coming back to buy another one for my Mom's kindle.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|Led Zep's dignified swan song is well captured and celebrated with this nice package.  Sentiments run high when it comes to anything Zep, and while I wouldn't go overboard and gush about how great they were - what I will say is that it's much better than expected.<br /><br />Sonically, this is certainly a huge improvement over the youtube videos that have been circulating (a PLUS).<br /><br />For battle tested bootleg listeners and those used to Percy's aged like wine voice, you will be fine with this.  Those who expect a young Zep charging out of the blocks circa 1971 should probably stay away.<br /><br />NOTE: Robert Plant has lowered the keys to most of the tracks but for the most part, I don't mind it.  He paces himself well instead of overreaching.  Stairway to Heaven will be a bit singalong for real diehards but overall, the band actually plays quite an ambitious and varied set.<br /><br />The Plant Page tour era was probably a closer approximation of the Zep sound.  But this is much better than the Unledded set that brought the two men together.  Plus with John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham - what's not to celebrate?
0802473156|5.0|A very quick and informative read that helps the reader understand the point of view of their partner and themselves.
1847370292|5.0|This was to me a very unique way of looking at things. I highly recommend that it be read by people with an open mind. My belief in God is the most important thing in my life and by know means did this book interfer with my beliefs.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I watched this movie w my kids and my in laws and we all loved it. Great movie and not your typical princess who needs to be rescued.
B001DHXT20|5.0|really cool movie so much smashing and life saving and the evil smashing guy and it was great really yeah
B006AZZPCM|4.0|this app is awesome I use it all the time when I gi to far places and I don't even get bored when we are in a long car ride!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Very happy receiving the DVD well in time for Christmas, and in its brand new packaging.  Should be great, and highly recommend!
B000000OQ5|5.0|Mechanical Resonance is so good from start to finish that one would expect it to be a greatest hits album. It is not. It was the major label debut of Tesla.<br /><br />I break this era down to 2 types of Rock Music. We had Hard Rock and Metal. Metal would include Slayer, Metallica and Death Angel has examples. Hard Rock would include Guns-n-Roses, Van Halen and Tesla has examples. In that frame of context...I would rate this album has one of the top 5 from that era in the Hard Rock category. It is that good.<br /><br />I would implore anyone that is in too Rock music to purchase this album. I bought it when I was a kid when it first came out and still listen to it all the time. It is pure rock music. It is it's own entity in a class that few other bands have joined from that time period.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Really good for 11 year-old s it's hilarious and good for kids it is so entertaining for me so try it
1401922732|5.0|Out of all my oracle decks from Doreen Virtue, this & the ArchAngel Raphael decks stand out the most. These decks offer high quality images with beautiful messages. Get this deck!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app will keep you busy for hours. some games are more fun than others and some games are easier than others but overall lots of fun.
0439023513|5.0|This final part of the series is not just a &#34;young adult&#34; novel, but rather, a very good novel.<br />It's an enjoyable, somewhat surprising, ending to the trilogy. It's no spoiler to say that the ending<br />is less dark than I thought it would be. That may disappoint some, but it did not me.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love this new music...it is fun and a great sophomore effort.  I would recommend this to people who enjoy Bruno Mars.
0307887448|5.0|Really loved this book. Saw it on an 'employee recommended' section at the Harvard Bookstore. Grabbed it and I'm really glad I did.<br />Read this book if you like 80's video games and music.<br />Read this book if you are into today's video games and music.<br />Seriously, this is a great read for anyone looking to lose themselves in the future of music and games.
B009HEMJCW|5.0|James McAvoy steals the show as the beau who turns his life around, but Mom and the dwarf journalist are also terrific comic personalities.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is awesome! I love how easy it was to download, and all the great reading selections! just like having a kindle!
B0095R64AO|3.0|While I watched the whole movie and found it entertaining, I wouldn't say I would rave to friends about it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Let me tell you that Minecraft is just my favorite game EVER. Just a great original game. Have fun and MINCRAFT FOREVER!
B008220CYM|1.0|READ THE BOOK & SKIP THE MOVIE! Tom Cruise cast as Jack Reacher? Unbelievable! Totally unbelievable! I can't imagine what the casting director was thinking. Of all the actors who could have played the part of Reacher as created by author, Lee Child (\\"One Shot\\"), Tom Cruise was the best Marin could do? Since Cruise is the 'main' producer (even though not listed here), guess there was no other choice. What a shame!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This movie is the best if you love Daft Punk. It's one of my favorite albums and in movie form, it's perfection.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|So far there still are no good browsers for tablets. Trying to use this is like trying to browse the web on a phone, that is it's mostly a useless waste of time because you can't see much and nothing on web pages will work. You can read some text on the page but nothing will play and if there are a lot of pictures like there are on Hulu dot com it freezes before the whole page will load.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I received this product for free when I purchased the Nikon D3100. It was free, so of course I love it. I can't tell you if it's good quality or not because it's a present, but I can tell you that shipping time was great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|so well written, so creative, nice characters, couldn't stop reading it. loved it since the first book to the last.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|...and the price was right and delivered in two days!  As a theatre educator, finding movie versions of stage plays and musicals helps in my research and decision-making when choosing a production for performance!
B003O86FMW|5.0|so well written, so creative, nice characters, couldn't stop reading it. loved it since the first book to the last.
B00AFY2SQK|5.0|Reading this textbook is a playful way of diving in the subject again, after using Stryers' Biochemsty 2nd edition in med school.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|so well written, so creative, nice characters, couldn't stop reading it. loved it since the first book to the last.
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|From the get go, the graphics are great. The story, a little slow for my tastes, but it gets really good. The ending is a cliff hanger!!
B004JN1D2I|3.0|But I just could not believe it when I got to the end and it was not the end. First two books are better, last two are kind of repetitive. Got very upset when could not know what happens with the main characters.
B001BKM3MQ|4.0|John Mayer, I hate on principle but somehow love this music. Born and Raised made me listen again and now here I am going back to Continuum (on a $3 deal).
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I haven't had the chance to check out all the options. But so far it does the job nicely. It's great if you're traveling with your kindle or need to utilize it for reminders; ie; picking the kids up, luncheon, or doctors appointment.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Got this today and already test drove. Should have bought a long time ago. Simple install, LED's are great in low light. I don't play any games requiring key bindings so can't fill you in on that but for FPS gaming it works perfect. Contour of the wrist pad makes it extremely comfortable and 25 keys in close proximity makes it perfect for FPS. Would recommend to others.  Will update as I learn more about it but so far it's a winner.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an amazing book that got me both laughing and bawling throughout. Highly recommended to anyone who wants a great read.
1451627297|5.0|Well crafted story - not your stereotypical Stephen King novel, but excellently interwoven plots and well-developed characters.  I couldn't put it down.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I'm normally not into shows like this. However this was well written and directed, with convincing actors. It keeps you entertained and on the edge of your seat
0810997827|5.0|My grandchild is going to love them.  I can't wait for Christmas and for him to open the box and see them.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|This was a different view of what the North Pole and Christmas could be compared to traditional Santa Clause stories. My family and I enjoyed watchingthis show together. It was fun and entertaining for all ages.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Of course I started with City of Bones and it was good. So I natually moved on to City of Ashes. But this one was great. I could not put it down. I lost some seriuos sleep trying to finish this one.
B004U52VPS|1.0|no time to play yet - it will be played soon  no time to play it yet. okay I have review enough, lol
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I havent watched it yet but heard it a great movie got it as a Christmas gift for my brother. Simply it comes just like buying it from the store.I can say that it came pretty fast.
B009ZE27US|5.0|I love this game so much but I always always am 33 years old and sometimes I am 45 years old.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|I love La Roux's voice.  She is a wonderful singer but some of the music sounds very dated.  Some songs are rich with character and depth and others are just silly pop.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love the way you can customize the calender. Works great for remembering my High School Assignments. Plus it has the perfect memo list for to do lists.
B008ULRY78|4.0|this movie is all action from the jump. During many of the fight scenes I saw subtle moves that I have never seen before. I would definitely recommend watching this movie
B00005JSGK|5.0|A new twist for John Wayne the all around worlds greatest cowboy.  Very fun movie and lots of action hunting wild animals in Africa.  Great movie.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|and I definitely do not regret buying this game. It is fun, challenging and visually captivating. I would suggest this app to anyone looking for a user-friendly puzzle experience.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My kids loved this movie.  Didn't see it at the theater and now wish we did.  Very funny and well done.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This movie is well done and brings out the kid in everyone. Enjoy with your family and a cup of hot chocolate.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is suspense concentrated. Haven't read something this engaging since the Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Can't wait to find out how it wraps up!
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is a great movie with great music. Everything is well done, and it is very entertaining. I hope you enjoy!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Keeps it interesting with different puzzles. Not the same thing over and over. Just wish I had a bigger screen.
B008Y67LEK|5.0|I wish Mrs. Plath had stayed around longer because she was able to communicate thoughts that could reach straight to your soul and help you know yourself better. This will be a book that I will have to come back to over and over again.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I bought this adapter thinking that it was perhaps the most expensive amongst the different offerings and hence would have a good quality.<br /><br />While the outside casing of the Moshi looks good, I am sorry to say that after only 12 uses the Moshi adapter one fine day stopped working. I have always stored this product in its case and have used it very carefully.<br /><br />I blame the manufacturer for poor quality and will never buy a product from Moshi again.
B00A757EFW|4.0|It is a little hard to control and see the little guy because there is kind of a glow around it but is pretty close to the original game.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love this book can relate with some things in my past  !!! wish the story would continue on to another book tho !!!
B009ZE27US|2.0|After downloading it I dont feel that it gives you the correct age of a person. Maybe update product .
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I rarely give 5 stars but this game deserves it! Interesting story w/ good HO and puzzles. Game length was good and w/o unnecessary fillers. Cute liittle quirk w/ the monkey! Please keep these coming!
B000HAB4KS|1.0|Movie was GREAT. The technical delivery was horrible. The Amazon player used on Google TV via a Logitech Revue crashed, froze, sped-up....<br /><br />No such problems with Netflix.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm in Afghanistan and it gives me weather here and at home with no hiccups despite me looking at locations on opposite ends of the world. Very straight forward and easy to use!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Comments? Really? This is a classic ... I'm only adding this because more words were required to post a review. I recommend it.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|The song selection and performance were top notch.  I didn't know Tom Cruise could sing! This movie is definitely going to move into my top ten.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Many years ago, I used to play this with an actual deck of cards. Now, I don't have to worry about whether I have all 52 cards in the deck. :)
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie. It  held every ones interest. From the smallest to th tallest. We all loved it.
B008476HBM|1.0|Another Classic, but it just drags for me. Of course, I don't think I'm in the target audience Jane Austen had in mind. I attempted to read it, because it came with my Kindle.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Kids keep playing it.....star wars theme a bonus.  It is fun to play whether for a kid or an adult.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I always have high expectations of Steven King. This one won't replace any favorites, but I still enjoyed reading it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fun little game for all ages! Found only one glitch, but it doesn't slow game play. Highly recommend if you want to kill some time.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. If you like this you should also read Into the Fire or Unbroken. All great books by great people!
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|this game is super boaring but not what I expected at all. I hate how u restart ur lvl when ever u start a new match. I don't recommend wasting ur space of Gb on this if u have kindel fire like me works great just not what I thought it would be.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a wonderful read, I'm struggling with words to do this book justice.  Colleen Hoover knows how to evoke feelings in her readers, I've only cried a few times during books and now Hopeless has made that list. How this story unfolds just blows me away, be prepared for the ride of your life while reading this.  I give Hopeless 5 stars and recommend this book to everyone!
B00005R23S|5.0|I could not believe my ears, eyes other senses when I caught this performance on cable....and of course I had to have the DVD in my collection.  Bruce and the E Street Band are a match made in Heaven and I look forward to more performances - hopefully released on DVD's.  I could watch and listen to their music and performances all the day long
B009HEN7LY|4.0|Initially, I thought this was going to be a mediocre movie, but I think they did a pretty good job.  I thought it was entertaining from start-to-end.  If you enjoyed the previous MIB movies, I would encourage you to check this out.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Wow!  Clancy's got his mojo back!  I wish every American could read this book.  Clancy takes our obvious weaknesses six steps beyond anything i could have come up with!  Definitely a WOW!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle is way easier to load than Nook (which is what my husband uses). And you can't beat the prices!
B009DH379C|5.0|Great remastering process, great audio and pristine image quality. It is really great to watch that concert in BD after watch it at my local Cinemark. A+!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Our family loves action adventure movies.  This movie is great, and we loved the first scenes as Erron Cross goes over a mountain, and wrestles with a wolf. The kindness and care displayed by the lead character, even when he is under great pressure physically, and emotionally drew us in.  Sometimes language is so bad in action movies that we are unable to watch the movie.  The Bourne Legacy was gritty, powerful, and didn't feel the need to put a bunch of swear words in.  Our family gave this movie a two thumbs up.
B0009HLD0K|4.0|This is an entertaining coming of age movie that can be enjoyed by everyone.  This movie seems to have been forgotten since its release, which is sad because it has so many great performances in it. Dennis Quaid is fantastic as the kid whose dreams are out of reach. Paul Dooley's completely flustered father is so real, you feel for him when he shouts, \\"No more ini food!\\"
0062202081|5.0|Love this book but ordered it off amazon and the front cover of the dust jacket was BENT!! I paid for new condition but didn't get it!! The book tells the story of Justin's last tour and the accomplishments he's made. This was very informative and touching to see how much he cares for his fans especially the ones in children's hospitals or tsunami victims. He goes above and beyond the call of duty because he really does care JUSTIN BIEBER IS AMAZING!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|ANOTHER GOOD READ FROM MICHAEL CONNELLY. A LITMUS FOR GOOD BOOKS. YOU WILL FINISH IT IN A FEW DAYS NO MATTR HOW BUSY YOU ARE.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its like frontierville my little pony style. considering that its free, its awesome and fun if you like mlp. I enjoy it
B000ID37RM|5.0|Fantastic acting and incredible story!  Gregory Peck was one of the greatest actors of all-time!  Watch this movie and be amazed!
B0063GORYU|4.0|It challenges me when I need to be challlenged and frustrates me when I don't win any games.  Wonder if I will ever go past two suits.
1616960922|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Sanderson. This shorter novel is set in a fantasy setting, of kings and magic. The main character has a unique magic, and the book is entirely focused on exploring what that type of magic can do. Any description I can write would give too much away, so I'll stop there on the plot.<br /><br />I was awed by this book. What I like best about fantasy novels, is when the author explores a fascinating and creative new idea. The magic system in this book is a perfect example. Just when you think the author has presented you with all of the possiblities, the main character thinks of another creative use of her magic.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I might even buy one of Sanderson's longer books on its strength, despite disliking long novels that can only be read as part of a very long series.
B0085YNML2|4.0|So cute it fun to try and figure out the path ways.  Like the ability to go back and improve my score.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The plot was intriguing and clever and twisted.  The graphics are very good. I especially loved the monkey! All in all a very fun game.
B007REV4YI|4.0|In my opinion as a James Bond fan this bond isnt good at all. I mean hes cool but for example the Bond girl from this film is...M. And that sucks and the tipical \\" the movie is over lets bang\\" scene isnt in this Bond. Though those details are missing i liked seeing our old friend the aston martini fron \\"GOLDFINGER\\" back. Also almost none gadgets i mean a little gun? Come on Q you can do way better than that. I also hope that it comes with the latest 007 bluray format as the new releases have come with or also for the people who bought the BOND 50 collection.<br />If youre not a bond fan and you have only seen the Daniel Craig films see this you are not gonna get what all this original MR. KISS KISS BANG BANG stuff is and you will enjoy it so buy it I liked it i mean only those detail from the DC series but the story is cool
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Artic Silver 5 delivers just as advertised ! A very economical solution for any PC enthusiast looking to either maintain their CPU in the coolest state or, for those looking to upgrade/update an existing obsolete CPU. Highly recommended; a must have !
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|Not really anything to rave about just basic functions.  Really wish it had a forward facing camera anyway but oh well knew that when i bought it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Get this for real men you care about.  This is a great Christian movie -- heart-pounding action mixed with heart-touching story-line, portraying action and physical force in a proper light (not glorifying senseless violence, but demonstrating that people of faith sometimes need to use force too -- with constraint and integrity).  Sets a really good example for what it means to be a real man and be a Christian.
B000TGJ7ZY|3.0|I just read the book also;  the film is a watered-down version of the book without the 19th-century style.  The book is creepy and suspenseful -- that gets lost in the film.  (Probably if it were a close adaptation of the book it would be too long.)
075669812X|5.0|As usual DK comes through with a top-quality book and wonderful clear, colorful pics.  Love the bonus LEGO minifigure included too!
B0076DELIG|4.0|A fun read as always. After awhile they all blend together. Comfortable like an old shoe but I like my old shoes.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I&#34;m amazed how powerful this light is for its size. Its easy to carry and fits the hand very comfortably. You have to be careful of the hot surfaces but your hand shouldn't be up there anyway. I just love it. Would recommend it strongly.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|If you are a fan of the Bourne movies you will not be disappointed. No regrets from buying this movie. Looking forward to a sequel.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Mr Nolan comes threw again with an epic tale of the dark night. Nice to see new characters from the comic come to life
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this and finally determining the plot after many twists and turns along the way .worth the read

B0052RDHTM|5.0|A well told evolutionary saga of the aristocracy at its pinnacle while middle class society is just beginning to raise.  A story, filled with rich characters, that brings to life the western world prior to and during &#34;The Great War&#34;.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Always love his work. I like how he has  his music has &#34;grown up&#34; over the years. He has great preformers acompaning him.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Rich characters who evolve with the story.  Ken Follett brings history to life by stitching cause and effect actions across a global sphere.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Complex plot that keeps turning on its head; just when you think you have it figured out a new punch is delivered.
B0053O89WY|5.0|And I can enjoy it anytime I want now.  Shipped when it said it would, arrived in great shape!  Keep up the good work.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book was slow at times, but the strong female characters reminded me of Scarlett O'Hara, Mammie, and Melly Wilkes at times, along with the more recent heroines from The Help.  It's an entertaining read.
B000JQU1VS|1.0|Don't know where this product review came from as I did not order or ever receive this item thank you!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I don't like facebook  very much lately. It is too off & on. I can't use it half of the time, and when I do, it does what it wants to do, and not what I want it to do. I use to like facebook when it was simple, then they stated the timeline thing and IMHO  I don't care for it.<br />Just Saying
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|I like to see all the movies over again so i can get caight up to see the new movie in the theaters. great movie
B009MF56GC|5.0|It's a great action movie, what can go wrong with all these action stars in it?  Looking forward to the next installment.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I only wished i had seen it at the movies but thought it was going to be a cheese movie and my Geaorge it was a excelent movie
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I went to watch this movie in the theater originally, due to my baby crying, my wife and I had to leave the theater right after the air plane hijack scene.  However, my old boy stayed and finished watching the movie with his cousin.  They were telling me how good the movie is, and I refused on listening to any of the spoilers they were telling.  So I had the itch to watch this for a long time, and I finally did on the day when this is released AND IT WAS GREAT!!!! Sleepy at 4 AM that night was worth it!
1567184855|1.0|Not exactly what I expected. Does not seem to agree with a lot of other sources that I have read.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|This item arrived quickly and as promised. I saw this series on tv and thought my dad would love it as well. Highly engaging and I learn more every time I watch it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This video was in perfect condition when I received it. This is a truly heart warming and inspiring movie. I has watched it at the theatre so I just had to buy it for my 80 year old mother. She enjoyed it to the fullest.

B00AMBK6J2|4.0|This was a friggin funny movie ! Any family guy fan will loves this , and even a couple of you Flash Gordon fans as well😉
B009P0VLGI|5.0|This album is excellent! contains a new english version of &#34;Prostye Dvizheniya&#34;, 3 excellent remixes and a new artwork! perfect for your Tatu collection.
1439102430|4.0|This book complements the TV show well.  Great story line and unexpected ending, make this entry a good substitute when you are away or just to get more forensic info.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|i absolutely love all the angry birds, the ads however are getting bigger and cover too much of the game. i have boycotted mcdonalds and campbells soup because of these and will continue to ax retailers and companies because of thier ads. i am sure i not the only one.
1406307629|3.0|It's a great read if you are someone who does not read very often and wants something that will keep you entertained or if you read a lot but want something light between books. It doesn't have too many &#34;slow&#34; areas and the plot is very interesting. The writting style is apppropriate for teenagers and people looking for a &#34;fluff&#34; book, and I don't mean that in a snobby way. I love &#34;fluff&#34; reads.  Most of the plot developments are very obvious for a long time coming, so if you are looking for something thought provoking or a book where you try to put the puzzle together before the author does it for you, this book is not for you. But for purely entertainment value, I fully recommend this book.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book really is a turn-on about learning -- whether it's how to cook, or learn a language or play a game.  This book is inspirational for those of us who dread the early (stupid) days of learning a new skill -- you can go from zero to, well, about sixty (out of 100) quickly... forget everything you hated about learning because you won't find it in this book. I liked the personal aspects of the The 4 Hour Chef -- they took the curse off a potential \\"how to\\" story.  I read the whole thing in just a few days! and I recommend it wholeheartedly!
B007XIC1GI|3.0|good book, but found somewhat disturbing.  i did not like the female degradation.  Still an interesting read.  Good insight into a twisted mind.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love traditional puzzle games (Sudoku, crosswords, word searches, etc.), and this one has become one of my favorites. Check out the original CrossMe, too.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I heard so many of my friends say &#34;You've got to read this book!&#34;  I am so glad I finally had the chance.  It was both heartbreaking and yet it revealed the caring of one person for another in need.  Just as I was sinking in sadness the author would place a humorous moment in the story to help me continue on.  This is a must read.
B00A757EFW|3.0|is exactly as I remember it, but you have to purchase the full game.  Lite means the game stops when you get to the second screen

B00A2AU0KI|5.0|This movie is a amazing. The perfect amount of baseball, humor, romance, and drama. As a baseball fan I found it ture to the game. As a movie conosure I found it moving and heart warming. If you like movies with a good plot, great acting, and and awsome sport then this movie is for you.

B0093H8HXS|5.0|Well, first of all the CPU is great, i used to have the Celeron G530 paired with the HD6850 from AMD, and it was ok at gaming but sometimes the bottleneck from the CPU was annoying so i decide tu upgrade to the i3..(not enough money for the i5).<br /><br />The \\"problem\\" that i have is with the temperature of the cores, i read reviews here and on another sites and it seems that the idle temps are between 28 and 33, my cores are at 38c on core0 and 14c on core1 with a room temp of 15-17c....at full load the temps are more close, 56c on core0 and 48c on core1, i thought that maybe the motherboard wasn't reading the heat sensor right so i try the i3 on another board and the result is the same, it kind of worries me that i received a faulty chip, and that at some point it may fail on me, because right now is very cool where i live, and it idles at almost 40c, so i don't know what is going to happen when the ambient temperature rise to 30-35.<br /><br />I still think that the CPU deserves a 5 stars rating because the performance/price is great, and i do understand that when you buy electronics, something can be defective...it happens.<br /><br />Any ideas about the high temperatures?<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />P.S. I apologize if my English is not right.<br /><br />UPDATE 01-21-2013<br /><br />I decided to return the CPU to amazon after the user M.Zaurov told me on the comments of this review that it was possible (i didn't know that) and i have to say that i'm very impressed.<br /><br />I sent an email to amazon support at 12 pm on January 7th and in less than 5 hours i received an email telling me that a new order was placed for me at no charge and with the prepaid labels from UPS for the return of the defective CPU. Amazing.<br /><br />The new i3 i recieved is working as it should, the idle temperatures are between 26-28c on both cores and on a very cold night it goes down to 18c using the Hyper 212+ and 43-45 at full load. With the stock cooler i didn't notice a big difference at idle, 27-29c but on full load it goes up to 51-54c so i decide to use the Hyper 212+ although the stock fan is quieter.<br /><br />Yes, i'm happy now :)difference at idle, 27-29c but on full load it goes up to 51-54c so i decide to use the Hyper 212+ although the stock fan is quieter.<br /><br />Yes, i'm happy now :)

B007SGM084|5.0|Only on the first few chapters, but so far so good.  Delivery was direct to iPad and everything went smoothly. Good reading.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Downloaded for a plane flight. It was ok. I might not watch it at home but on a flight was good enough for entertainment.
B009GENZKS|1.0|I don't like renting cartoons. Upon seeing my mistake I passed on the movie and found another movie to rent.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|...but these guys really are the next Queen. And this album really validates my previous statement. I'm not sure if it's my favorite Muse album but they're consistently putting out great music and that makes me happy.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|The movie is not a remake. It has familiar names some familiar connections. Other than that it was action packed with special effects with a man on the run trying to do the right thing.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|This movie makes you think a little and is just fun to watch. I've seen it a few times and I'm sure I'll watch it a few times more.

B003CSV7TK|5.0|The BEST Christmas movie EVER!!-All the newer versions can NEVER compete with the original 1947 version-only one word is needed-GREAT!!!!!
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Why is my favorite song, Master of the House shortened and containing a few different lyrics here? They ALWAYS do this whenever they make a movie out of a musical. Plus, the added dialoge. Why can't they ever make a movie out of a musical and do it exactly the way it was on the stage?
B007SGM084|5.0|i started them and just went on reading them till book three best book in a long while. you dont have to read all of them to know its a great read. although it makes no sense purchasing one and leave your self wanting.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|After all the talk about this book possibly giving away military tactics or secrets I was disappointed with this book.  There was nothing even remotely sensitive written.  Unlike fiction novels our hero is not always part of the team actually doing the shooting.  Kudos to all the men and women in our armed forces.  It is never an Easy Day for you.
B009HEMW4W|3.0|I hate the fact that so many movies believe you must have vulgar language to make a decent movie. Once they got past what seemed like mandatory vulgarities at the beginning, it turned into an OK movie.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This one just didn't work for me - but then the last couple of Scrapetta's have not really been all that good for me.  But for some reason, I keep reading...
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My wife is not usually much for action/adventure movies, but even she liked this movie. I liked the fact it was free of vulgarity and sexuality.

B008JGSM6G|3.0|I just didn't find this game very challenging. Once you understand the parameters most of the puzzles are pretty simple.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I do not often review games, but this by far is the best, true you cannot loose a game and the tiles shuffle at stalemate allowing you to progress, but the tiles and the sounds are fantastic, very pleasing on the eye. This game beats a lot of other versions including the ones we all know in the windows environment. If you like Mahjong you need this one.
0316044695|5.0|I can't wait for the movie to come out. This is a must read for anyone who wants to know about the battle going on in the middle east and what the taliban are up to.

0307362043|5.0|I loved P.D. James' Author's Note about Jane Austin's writing about guilt and misery, which she would not. However if Jane Austin wrote this book, she would have written it bette.! I felt P.D. James did a great job in making the characters come alive in the Jane Austin spirit. A great read!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Thank you.  My favorite band.  My cds were stolen  out of my vet this summer.  So I had to purchase them all again.  Good price and quick shipping.
014241543X|5.0|This book about a Near Death Experience. Was very interesting. You would have to believe in leaving your body during this type of experience. I found it believable because of another book I read recently &#34;Closer to the Light&#34; by Melvin Morse, M.D., with Paul Perry. Dr. Morse has done an extensive study of Near Death Experiences of Children.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|... and this little game is pure dynamite. Awesome graphics, challenging venues, great realism. Only regret is they can't put real courses on here.
0812993357|5.0|The book itself it really well written, very fun to read and grace's illustrations are just so adorable. she tells her life since her childhood up to working with the most amazing fashion icons, truly interesting, you can't stop reading. This is a must read for any fashion lover
B000SW2ER2|5.0|Not an adventure. Not really a romance, in the strict sense. This film addresses questions of human consciousness much as did Stanley Kubrick's &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34;, but with the emphasis, not on machine &#34;intelligence&#34; or human evolution, but on the personal psychological meaning of survival, purpose and love. All performances are top rate, especially that of the strangely beautiful Ms. McElhone who must (and does) convey the circumstances and plight of at least three distinct characters with three very different personalities. Casting all around is impeccable. Storywise--references to a God &#34;the Creator&#34; and the immortality of the Human Spirit are so subtle that if you reach for the popcorn you might miss them. Story-telling by intercutting &#34;real time&#34; drama with stream-of-consciousness flashback memories and present imaginings is innovative and excellent. Of course, the elephant in the room is Solaris--a planet? a conscious entity? an expression of the subconscious? It's for the viewer to speculate. There is, in fact, a resolution--and it's one heavily weighted with compassion, understanding and an unexpected benevolence. Caution-- this film is mostly for the cerebral (and certainly for fans of Natascha). Apart from a few very convincing special effects, there is nothing really here for Frodo, Luke Skywalker or even Arthur C. Clarke.
B004H3WWU2|5.0|Fine details, good quality and well thought pockets. very happy with the purchase. has the size I was looking for.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have this app on my phone and kindle and it is a must for memory joggers and/or checklist to remember groceries or other items.  Simply works perfectly.
B008Y778ZG|5.0|one of my favorite special effects movies! i watch it over and over again on my big screen! love the drama!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|What a great way to spend the 2012 blizzard we had! :)  Great product, great movies, and great price for all!
B009AJD5E0|5.0|Visually wonderful. Watch and think &#34;what if&#34;. Let the story be a question, not an answer and open your mind to what we don't know, or what might be, or what else there may be.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|I bought this as an add-on item, but the light I received really looks nothing like the one in the photo. Cheap plastic legs that could easily break. When you try to stand the light up it will fall over. There is no lens to protect the bulb. It's really just a cheap novelty light for a key ring.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Easy to use and fun too.  I primarily bought it for my nieces and nephew to use while they're on my phone.
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|I would recommend this movie for viewing.  You should not expect too much in terms of a story line.  Good for a Friday or Saturday evening movie if you can't find anything in TV.
B005SQ3AI0|5.0|Over 10 years ago, I bought the Dinah Washington Jazz Masters cd from Verve.  This collection covers that, throws in a dose of Brook Benton, and many more enjoyable swinging recordings.  I don't think you can go wrong.
0071390111|5.0|I'll be using this as the primary text for the neurology part of a course in neuromotor control.  I have other texts that will supplement this one.  It's not often when the author is a Nobelist.
0060723513|5.0|Fascinating read. Takes one into the culture of the Aborigine - up close and personal. I return to it periodically for inspiration and the adventure of it. Recommend it to friends.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|This will be an all-time favorite in my collection. I love everything about it. This should be a staple in any music library.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I liked the premise of the story - I'm sure it's happened more than once! I enjoyed how the story played out - lucky girl! The writing flowed, and kept me interested. A good bed time read!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I like all the Bourne movies and thought this was an excellent addition.  I didn't give the movie 5 stars because the story seemed to jump around a little and I thought the usual chase scene at the end was too long.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I rate 5 stars great connecting to Bingo game.  I love bingo and Bingo Blitz is one of my favorite games on Facebook.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Great stories as always from Munro.  Most are shorter and somewhat simpler than in her other collections, but they pull me in in their quiet way.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I am a big fan of the first two Bourne movies.<br /><br />This movie has great chase-action.<br />But, the story is old and, now, boring.<br />Without revealing the events, here is the story:<br />A government official decides to close a secret program.<br />To accomplish this, he has to kill its agent.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore wrote the most memorable film score for the LOTR trilogy and so it was with apprehension that I listened to this score, expecting so much from his previous effort. I was not disappointed at all! I have yet to see the movie, but the music from this 2-disc special edition score is without question my favorite score of the year. The masterful way that Shore captured the feeling of Middle Earth is repeated here in this score and it makes me even more anxious to see the film. While not as heavy sounding as the LOTR trilogy, this makes perfect sense since the story of Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit is indeed lighter fare. There are just enough moments that he repeats his classic themes from LOTR to satisfy the fan of those scores. There are also innovative and unique moments that, in my opinion, make this the film score release of the year. I might add that the musicality that Shore demonstrates here is unlike anything we heard all summer. While the scores for \\"The Avengers\\" and \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" serve their respective films adequately, they don't come close to Shore's musical masterpiece for which we waited all year. Highly recommended!
B00138CYD4|5.0|While I've always been a fan of Mr. Santana for a number  of years it was always hard to find that perfect collection and Amazon now has it.  A must for any music collector.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Please do not let this be your only recording!!<br /><br />This CD is meant for Les Mis fans.  If you are not familiar with this music, you need the Original London Cast.  You will miss soooo much beauty in your lives if you don't have the OLC version.<br />First, I've seen the musical over a dozen times and I have every recording and know the lyrics back and forth.  I've read the unabridged version and listened to two versions of the unabridged audiobook.  The best musical/music/poetry/voices ever recorded.  The best book ever written.<br /><br />The main English recordings are the studio versions.  (A) OLC - Original London Cast (B) OBC - Original Broadway Cast (C) CSR- Complete Symphonic Recording.<br />The live versions are the 10th and 25th  anniversaries and this Motion Soundtrack (although the music is studio, the voices sound very much live).<br /><br />Perfection is the complete version of OLC, but that does not exist.  Next to perfection is the OLC version.  Jean (Colm Wilkinson) and  Javert (Roger Allam) are heaven to listen to.  Everyone from Eponine to Marius to Fantine are perfect.  The most beautiful recording of anything you will ever hear and is a must to own!!!<br /><br />OBC, is great, but not as good as OLC.  CSR is what you need if you have become a fan.  Jean (Gary Morris) is excellent, but not like Colm.  Javert (Philip Quast) is as amazing as Roger.  An excellent recording and complete.  So many additional beautiful songs and the musical story is uncut. (I actually spent hours and hours cutting out audio from CSR to OLC.  Embedded lyrics.  So I almost have a complete symphonic version of OLC)<br /><br />I'm reviewing this a few hours after the music was released, so I am uninfluenced by the multiple Oscars that this movie and performances will win.  So I'm judging it by only the music.  After seeing Hugh on 60 minutes, I know he will win.  I never knew he would be this amazing.  The acting will be amazing.  The singing is very good if you'venever heard previous versions.  If you have, it is an okay version.  But once you hear Colm and Roger/Philip and the rest of the cast, OLC is perfection.<br /><br />The live 10th has a perfect cast.  I can't wait for the Blu-Ray version.  The 25th is good except two characters. Javert is not a good singer and Marius is horrendous. He's from a boy band and is so painful to watch/listen to that these two choices have tarnished this recording.  10th is superior.<br /><br />If you are interested in the book, you will not be disappointed, but it is 1400 pages.  There is a new audio book version with George Guidall (best narrator ever)and I actually preferred that since there were so many French words/names/locations.<br /><br />Robert Oshana / AssyrianMe
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This is a rare film these days. It gives these actors an extraordinary opportunity and they run with it. It is the screen writing that is the basis for the unfolding of the various personalities of these men. Kudos to both the actors and the script.  Ginny
B002UM5BXW|2.0|I thought I would like this from reading the sample, but found that Mr Bourdain went on and on about his and his coworkers' immature exploits in restaurant kitchens, involving drugs, alchohol, and a lot of bad behavior.  I usually like memoirs because you understand what made someone grow and change.  Not much of that here.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking Up Married - this book is a fun, quick, read.  Light and entertaining for those days when you want to complete a book in a day and take a break!
B0098TL4YU|5.0|I've always admired Jimi Jamison's vocal ability which is right up there with the vocal powerhouses like Lou Gramm, Steve Perry, and other greats. To rock out solid and strong at this age is just so...I've got the word....\\"refreshing.\\" Please aspiring singers: Listen and learn from singers like this!<br /><br />The songs are great, filled with so much passion, emotion and wisdom. Loved it.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This was an item on my grandson's  birthday wish list.  He LOVED it.  It was his 14th birthday.  They started playing with it immediately.

B009G78EE2|4.0|Fresh tracks that are very entertaining! Thrift shop is so good and the video will make you go pop some tags.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Another birthday gift for my grandson.  He was happy to receive all his Lego requests, and shopping was easy for me.
B00845MRKE|5.0|It's a piece of art. It goes deeper than the acting or the action. You have to be a thinker and read between the lines on this film. This is a great set, it has the spinner car and a booklet. I own the movie but I bought it again just to get the extras this set has. It has so much underline meaning to it. But if you are just looking for an all action, C.G.I. generated piece of garbage that Hollywood puts out now a days and everyone rushes to the theater to see it,  this movie is not for you,Hollywood today makes a movie then its forgoten as soon as the next big piece of garbage comes out thats made from a popular book, then everyone goes ga,ga, over it when really its just Vampire crap, hobbit doo doo, oo7 stink , and Hunger poo, This is a classic and will reamain so...... Twilight and all the rest will be forgoten in a matter of there are no more sequels coming out.... Its only popular because they force it down your throat and make you feel like you have to like their parts 2,3,4,5,6,7, of a film... just my opinion.... They dont make them like this anymore and its a shame. .....
B008NN8IVY|5.0|this will be the perfect christmas gift for my lego enthusiast.  It was easier than trying to find in the toy store or mall - perfect.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have been a Kate Morton fan from the first page of The House at Riverton. I anxiously await her books.  The Secret Keeper was hard to put down, the characters were well developed, the story was interesting and kept me guessing until the very end.  I gave this book 5 stars and I am recommending it to all of my book loving friends.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Another disappointing remake. Not a bad film just no comparison to the original. Even Kate beckinsale couldn't save this film.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|First off, take it for what it is; two young artists just beginning to find their niche and taking their first steps with their gifts.  Jonathan is destined for a stardom that only a handful have attained.  As he continues with classical voice training and perfecting his pronunciation he will one day be on par with the greatest who have ever sung.  He is only 17 years old; judge him accordingly.  Charlotte brings her own qualities to the partnership.  Although she may choose a path other than opera one day, this effort is stunningly good for a first effort.  Her pronunciation is rather good and her tone is crystal clear.  She lacks the power of Jonathan, but that isn't her role in this pairing.  The complimentary duo will draw immediate comparisons to Boccelli/Brightman and some will unfairly judge these two youths.  However, I for one have room in my collection for both of them, and Jonathan and Charlotte earned that space not because of youth; they've earned my hard earned money because of their talent.  I feel blessed to witness the beginning of their journey, and I hope they continue to record and share their gifts with the world.  I can't wait to see them live somewhere, someday.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book is a must read. i read it within three days and I could not put it down. I will go back and reread this many times.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I like to carry quite a lot of camera gear with me when we go on vacation, and there is never enough room for it, and the other stuff that my wife wants me to carry as well. This time I decided to go the back pack route and began investigating my possibilities a few months before we were to leave on our cruise. Well needless to say, after reading a gazillion reviews on Amazon and other sites, and being shocked by the prices of some of these products, I was about ready to look for an old feed sack rather than mess with this thing. But after a lot of thought, this simple Amazon basic backpack seemed to fit all the requirements that I had for it, except a pocket for bottled water, and I figured I could make do without that. I have a friend who has one of these so it gave me a chance to see how his gear fit into the bag which further convinced me. But it wasn't until after I had toted this little gem loaded all around the Caribean that I gained a full appreciation for just how nice it really is. I must say as a guy who has done my time toting back packs over the years, this bag is well balanced, well padded, and darn comfortable even after my wife loaded it like a pack mule and all my camera gear as well. This bag was splendid and for the price I can't imagine a better buy. It seems well constructed, and after 2 years of rough treatment, my friends bag still appears to be holding up well. So yeah, I'd have to say I would buy it again, and would recommend it to my friends as well if they needed a product of this type.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I must say I really like Where's My. Perry?  I find to be a very good challenge,  as I work to figure out the. puzzle,  and maximize my score. I recommend Where 's Perry. to all!
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Without question, this is the nicest collector's edition of any presentation I've ever seen. Far nicer than flashy Terminator Endo-Head or Titanic, way classer than Casablanca, West Side Story or even The Stanley Kubrick Collection and I'm a Kubrick nut. I'm not talking about the film (which is 9.8 out of 10 in my book) but the collector's set it, it's beautiful.<br />If you ever wanted a crown jewel in your collection you won't find one better (or at least not yet...).<br /><br />If you buy one film, even if this would be your first collector's edition THIS IS THE ONE! [[ASIN:B0017O1MIM Lawrence of Arabia (50th Anniversary Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />BTW: I've gone back and looked at my reviews on other box sets, this presentation is even better than the Amazon Exclusive Titanic Collector's Edition; though the Titanic set is also \\"Top of the Line\\" [[ASIN:B008KOMMTA Titanic Collector's Edition (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / Digital Copy) (Amazon Exclusive)]]<br /><br />Remember in the beginning of season 1 of NCIS Gibbs was the movie buff, not DiNozzo......
B0063GORYU|5.0|I can play this game every day and never get bored.  This particular version works really well was priced right.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I was able to easily download the app. for my yahoo e-mail.  It works great and I am satisfied with the results.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This book is well written and has a lot of detail through the book. Well done!!<br />I think people who like problem or detailed books should probably read this book.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the app, however, it tends to freeze a lot on kindle fire.  Other than that, I love it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I admit to being a &#34;fanatic&#34; of Streisand's, and this CD is wonderful.  Hope she puts out new ones like this every year!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Purely on a great way to the beginning of the best possible thing to happen to a great book. I loved it. The new features in the books make it a great way to get the next one started. Ms. Collins should keep up the good work. Thank you. Mia Hay
B008JGSM6G|3.0|There are LOTS of puzzles on each level so you won't run out of puzzles quickly but I also get bored playing this game after about 3 or 4 rounds.  It's just that complex or challenging.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you like the coin doer machines at carnivals when you were a kid this is the game for you. It doesn't take hours to play so doesn't,t get boring.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This was a ver great movie, this movie had also shipped very fast as well. I had it in two days!
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I am a fan of the creator already, and this movie puts it all into perspective. This movie came on time and in excellent condition!! Thank you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this game! so much fun!!! passes the time away. the only thing is you have to earn points but still way fun
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Highly recommended for any admirer of Cohen's work. His stage presence<br />is as gracious as ever. You will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great. I love that each game is unique and takes a different skill to complete the game. you should really get it.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This album is suprising! It's crisp and clean, nicely done. It is fresh and enjoyable. Rod has never sounded better
B008M721MS|5.0|Love it. So great and great way to connect. I recommend this product to everyone I know. You will have a blast
B0066W1AZK|1.0|As you close in for the win, the program calls a draw. No point in playing this game. There are other apps much better than this one.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is the best zombie movie I've ever seen I love that they made this series. I also bought season 2 and I cannot wait to see season 3.
1452110581|5.0|As cat lovers, my wife and I found this to be heart-warming<br />and amusing. It re-enforced everything we already knew in<br />a very entertaining way. The pictures, too, are awesome.
B007JGAR6U|4.0|Aesthetics and size are wonderful.  Great for indoors where the very bright X-series lenses need a little nudge, and perfect for fill flash as well.  Slightly funky on-off with auto camera coordination (I like that it turns off with the camera body, but should turn back on as well when body comes back on), and while I love the big manual control for flash exposure control, I wish it had a zero bias notch so it could be controlled without viewing it (e.g. from the viewfinder).
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Have this app on my phone too.  Worked great this last few days when we had Winter storm and blizzard warnings, as I have it set to alert me.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I was mostly bored watching this movie, I felt it was just too predictable, the plot too light, it had potential to be better but apparently the writers decided to just do the minimal they could get by with.
0670026182|3.0|I will agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a visually gorgeous tome.  I've followed the author's blog and am an admirer of her style and taste.<br />And I've tried one of the recipes (sticky chicken with sesame and chili) and it was both simple and delicious.<br />My one dissatisfaction -- and it's a big one -- is that this book is produced in China.<br />For some time, due to China's abysmal human rights stance, I have boycotted all products made in China.<br />The author professes her concern for animals and urges readers to use only free-range meats and eggs.  Too bad her caring attitude does not appear to extend to human beings.  By doing business with China, she becomes part of the problem, in my opinion.  Each person should decide for himself or herself how much importance this issue deserves, of course.  It pays to be an informed consumer, at the very least.<br />I borrowed this book from the library and didn't learn of its origin until reading the very last page, which kind of ruined it for me.  Had I purchased it, I would certainly have returned it.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I love the Blu-ray/DVD Combo packs. Also, I love Amazon. Prompt, consistent shipping, and it always arrives in good condition when you buy it through them. You almost can't go wrong when they are the seller. Also, great movie. This is the one that I would have guessed to be lame out of the first individual Avenger movies, but it was great.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil still has GOT IT! The ability to write lyrics that hit home, and will be timeless.<br />Ramada Inn in particular epitomized sea change moments in my own life.
B004TL3R24|5.0|Perfect match for my wonderfully light and durable Manfrotto tripod.  Clips on and off easily and is very comfortable over the shoulder.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|If your putting out a demo call it a demo! My grandson really enjoyed playing but we will not be sucked into buying a game that was to be free! Might have been different if we were told that from the beginning
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Everyone kept telling me that I had to watch &#34;Homeland.&#34; I even know people who pay for Showtime just to see this show.  Now I'm not going to run off and order Showtime but it is a good show.  Compared to most of the crap on TV right now it is fabulous.  I would recommend &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; and &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; also.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|OK, by reading the title of this post you can tell I like this book.<br />Ken Follett is a new author to me.  Like most people, (I assume) I find an author I like, then read everything they have.<br />Then agonize that I'll never find another author that good.<br />Well, I just finished reading Vince Flynn for the second time. Every novel. At least twice. So I was looking for a new author.  Saw a Ken Follett novel in Costco and took a picture of the book for a possible purchase.  (I only read on my kindle now).<br /><br />Ok, the book. Riveting. Multiple intertwined stories within this novel. Follett easily transitions from one family / character to another; from one part of the world, to another. You won't be lost wondering who he's talking about when he does transition. You will be waiting for him to get back to the next character. Whomever it is.<br /><br />As I'm reading this novel, which takes place around the period of the Great War, I keep referring to Wikipedia and Google looking for more insight into the story. Looking at period pictures of people, places and general life. I've actually taken an interest in the Tzars of Russia and their history, reading a number of Wiki pages. I keep checking to see if he's basing his characters on real people. Fascinating.<br /><br />So, to sum up, give Mr. Follett a chance.
B004GYY714|5.0|I really like this app. I am able to listen to all areas of music. I went to Florida for vacation and there was a radio station that I loved down there. Anyways when I found this app I was happy to learn that the radio station was able to be streamed and from my device. Love it.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My 3 year old loves it, asks to play it daily and does not get easily bored with it, lots to do
B00338QENI|5.0|The ethics discussions and scientific discoveries that have been folded into the story of this unfortunate woman made for riveting reading.
B008458O3S|5.0|This game starts so easy you would think it a child's game but in the end it gets so hard you have to work it out slowly. Each of the final challenges took me more than a few hours each. I would not give in to the urge to use paper an pencil but kept all of it in my head.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|My nine year old loves legos and got this as a gift. He loves it.  It is still together so I am a happy mommy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Okay, up front let me just say, Colleen Hoover is a goddess. She has no written 3 of the best 4 books I read last year. Considering she only wrote 3 books, not a bad track record!!<br /><br />This book had me bawling my eyes out, wanting to ravish my wife, wanting me to choke someone, and wanting me to hug someone sometimes all in a chapter or two. I love this book, it is easily one of the best novels I have ever read in any genre.<br /><br />I'm not going to ruin anything by telling you anything, but I have a huge book crush on Sky, and cannot wait until Colleen writes her next book. Promise us you will never stop writing!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved the book!!  Was very well written, took you on the tragic journey with Pi! Enjoyed the movie version as well!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app lets me know how much battery I have left in my kindle and that's great cuz my kindle only shows me a little picture at the top.:)
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This movie had the right amount of suspense and I loved the action.  The actors were great! The writer has a lot of talent.  Looking forward to more.
B009ETZNIC|5.0|I tell you Mel Gibson comes up with some doozies. His acting is real. I wonder if he's ever been in prison?
B002RPR6DU|5.0|Few movies touch on a human condition and our relationship with nature as does &#34;Silent Running&#34;.  It is as touching and timely now as it was to me when I first saw it as a teenager when it was first released.  It is a sad commentary on humanity that we have slid closer to the reality depicted in the movie where the barest existance of nature, is as, a fickering candle about to go out.  Well worth watching!  A great Bruce Durn vehicle!  His portrail of the leading character is sympathic, understandable, psycologically torn, unhinged, & inspired.  For all intents and purposes he provides an emotionally moving solo proformance, with very limited exchanges with the other three human cast members, where most of his social interaction is between Durn & three small droids/robots that do not talk helping him save the last fragments of &#34;Nature&#34;.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game works flawlessly on my kindle Fire and the fractal puzzles in 214 Pc mode are a real brain workout
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are definitely a great read. Suzanne Collins did a great job of telling the story of Katniss and her struggle with the Capitol. It had great action and a great story line. I would highly recommend.
0062202081|4.0|my daughter is in love as many girls are with this boy....lol...she loved it...great gift christmas gift great on time delivery

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This is a pretty funny movie. I would suggest you buy it if you are looking for a night of laughs at some funny jokes. A little to family guy for me, but still pretty solid.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Never thought I would like Angry Birds when my kids asked me to download it. the birds were cute but what was the point? Now I love to play it. it takes a little strategy and careful aiming but it is a lot of fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game for the kindle fire.I have never had a problem with it.it is the funest game I have.
B00000IQCZ|5.0|If you like musicals...then you will definitely love this one.  Judy is so wonderful in this and so are the others.  Judy's rendition of HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS is one of the greatest songs ever.  I love Judy Garland movies and would recomment this one to everyone.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game involves fruit flying up through the screen and you use your finger to slice it in half which earns you points, while you must avoid slicing a bomb.  There are different ways to play the game.  One keeps score on how many fruit you slice in a period of time, getting penatlites if you slice a bomb.  Another is slicing the fruit while avoiding bombs or it ends the game, or if you allow 3 pieces to leave the screen without slicing them you lose.  There are other special fruits you can hit to make other things happen.  My kids like playing this game too.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|We have watched this movie so many times, it is so well done and I cry each time I watach it.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|We love most of the Liam Neeson movies and this is another fast-paced, thriller movie. people who like this type of movie will enjoy this one.
B005HSL626|5.0|love slicing fruit in half. lots of fun for everyone who has tried it. will recommend it to friends. thanks
1781163243|5.0|This is one of the best art books I've picked up this year! Stunning concept art littered throughout this book, you won't be disappointed.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|It is surprising that as good as Brandon Sanderson last books were that he is actually getting better! He is honing his short story telling skills and this book is well put together telling a complete story that doesn't leave you unsatisfied.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This was a great read! The story just gets more and more outrageous for a 100 YO man but it's so entertaining that it fits well!
B000KQGP2G|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />PoS's sixth album, Scarsick, is easily the band's crowning achievement. Everything their previous albums have succeeded or, in the case of Be, failed to do, is solidified and perfected here. This is easily the band's angriest album and it is also accordingly their heaviest. The album is actually an unannounced sequel to The Perfect Element Part I. The concept here is fantastic, as Daniel utilizes his considerable lyrical prowess to issue scathing social commentary on topics such as commercialism, consumer culture, modern popular music, religion, politics (Daniel's distaste for the Bush administration is seen in very clear aspects here), and the apparent downfall of society as we know it. This is done brilliantly, but an album cannot be considered good wholly for it's lyrical content (if that were the case, every PoS album would be a 5/5), the album's music is easily some of the strongest PoS have ever written. Dark and brooding yet unabashedly melodic and progressive, the album is definitely the most Metal album they've released. This increase in heaviness is a much needed shot in the arm after the overblown cheese of Be. The opening combo of the title track and Spitfall are heavily FNM influenced, showcasing Daniel's incredibly impressive rapping over pulsating riffs and time changes. Cribcaged, a very obvious attack on MTV Cribs, is more reminiscent of early PoS but still has the very modern spark that this album so uses to it's advantage (Daniel's swearing on this track is how swearing SHOULD be done in music: it's powerful and actually seems to serve a purpose. It's not just there because it can be. Daniel gets a cookie for this one). America is where Daniel rips the Bush administration a new one over decidedly catchy rhythms and choruses. Disco Queen is a true standout. Almost seeming like something Devin Townsend would put his name on in a heartbeat, the song matches bouncy disco beats with PoS's regular proggy sound while managing to not take away from the very focused anger and frustration of the concept. Kingdom of Loss is a more somber ballad, with some excellent spoken word from Daniel. Mrs. Modern Mother Mary is one of my favorites on the album, attacking the Catholic church while being catchy as all hell, if I were going to sing along with any song here, this would definitely be the one. Idiocracy features some impressive time changes and great drumwork on behalf of Johan Langell. Flame to the Moth finds Daniel using a very effective scream, almost, in very loose terms, a death growl, that totally caught me off guard (in the best way possible). The album ends with the more laid-back Enter Rain, whose very Pink Floydian midsection is a very fitting ending to this turbulent but beautiful album that I feel is PoS's ultimate achievement, both musically and lyrically. A masterpiece through and through.away from the very focused anger and frustration of the concept. Kingdom of Loss is a more somber ballad, with some excellent spoken word from Daniel.

B009K0P10K|5.0|Loved this Series! Was able to watch most of it from Season one up on Netflix and then catch up on the few episodes I would have missed here.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book goes on and on without going anywhere.  The conflict is forced and feels fake.  The book asks you to suspend reality just a bit too far.
B009IF82SK|5.0|So many funny twists and turns... Makes me wonder if there are real people like Sheldon, Howard, Raj, and Leonard... I have to admit, NASA is a good sport in all of the crazy things the gang does and its implications... Hope the show continues for many more seasons!!!
0544045203|5.0|This was bought for a step granddaughter that said she would like to read the book before watching the movie....got it for a Christmas gift for her.  Thanks
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I bought two of this, one for a gift for a friend and one for my collection. The price was perfect.
B000003N89|5.0|Wow!  Krall truly shows her piano and vocal skills on this one.  She really is a genius when it comes to melding jazz and the blues.  I hope she'll do more stuff like this CD in the future.  I'm so glad I got this one although I'm a bit late to the party so to speak.  But, for me, this one is truly a keeper! I love to play it while having friends over for dinner.  My guests have really enjoyed listening/discovering her music and talent.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love 'em, love 'em, LOVE 'em!<br />They have a website, Facebook page and you can receive new numbers as they are produced.<br />News, features, etc. This is a great group with a great mission - check them out.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My third read and I cannot get enough. I am finding so many details I had overlooked. The author has done a great job of weaving a richly detailed fantasy world.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|Don't have HBO but love the books and therefore the series.  Season one was great so I've been waiting out for two.  I'm disappointed in how long it's taken and the price point seems steep.  I'm actually turned off by both HBO's delay to get the DVD out as I am of the author for the next book to come out in probably 5 years.  I rather see an series made from A Wheel in Time books at least that finally will be complete in January.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Never a disappointment. This style never loses its appeal and story telling that can't be put down. As always their are gaps in the believability of our heroes and the plot, yet Clancy takes us through it all because we want to believe. That is his talent in writing and our love of his stories.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|When I first heard Bruno Mars first album I was blown away, since hearing of his new album I wondered would it be half as good as the first, and I must say WOW! Bruno Mars has done it again, excellent track listing and his smooth melody makes this a great listen for all ages a definate must have album.[[ASIN:B009IRVSVQ Unorthodox Jukebox]]
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Got a BOB jogging stroller as a gift but it didn't have a cup holder. Since BOB accessories are super expensive (along with their strollers) I decided to look here and found this little caddy. It's perfect and even more perfect for the price! Well made and sturdy. Works just as well if not better than the over priced BOB accessories. Totally happy with this purchase.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My husband and I look for different season's of TV shows to watch and we waited and waited for this one not expecting it to be so entertaining....it's like a long zombie movie only better because it actually has some really good acting. We are looking forward to Season two.
B008N1V11U|1.0|I bought this app and when I'm about to play it saids I don't own this app WTF?!? waste of money
B000002AGN|5.0|This CD came in good shape at the predicted time.  I was very happy to have it as I have the original record album.  Dave died shortly after I received it and we lost a genius.
B000NPXMTS|5.0|Sure, most, if not all of it is b.s., but who cares? This book was a whole lot of fun and a super quick read. I liked it a lot.
B000JRYOPG|4.0|Ky Mani Marley is a natural actor. Outside of the movie I believe he has a pure heart. the movie is my guilty pleasure, a little bit of dangerous life.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Worth every penny! It's a show I can watch over and over again and always discover something new in the story line.
B00631VJIC|5.0|My husband absolutely loves this cd. He is a big fan of Harley's and a big fan of Son's of Anarchy....he listen's to this on the way to work because he finds it keeps his mind mellow so he can think and plan his day. There is only one song he doesn't care for so that's a bargin for sure. I know it's hard to find a cd where you enjoy all the songs. If you are a fan of Son's of Anarchy you will love this cd for sure, but I think it will apeal to many
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Loved the books and I love this movie! I am looking forward to the next ones. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank definitely came with power on this release his lyricism metaphors storytelling they are all on another level. A must buy.
0525953728|5.0|This book was very intense and detailed. It allows the reader to see and experience through the eyes of the participants the actual take down of a world wide terror. The story tracked nicely and the prose was appropriate.  A very good book and a must read for anyone that is interested in what really happened on that fateful day.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 3 year old loves this movie! It's colorful, entertaining, and I love that it shares the message of treating the earth kindly.
B005974CDU|5.0|Great Songs...Every track has a beginning and end and a great melody. Chorus is powerful and full! DT is an awesome band!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|A solid port. Works just as well as mobile verzion. Syncing between website and app can be a little slow.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed  this book.  It was a fairly quick read because the story kept you engaged. The second book was great too. Now just have to wait what seems like forever for part three.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The acting and story lines are wonderful and engaging. Characters are well-drawn and I have learned a lot about the history portrayed here. Love this series!
B001AIRUP4|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic. It will continue to amuse people until the end of time. It is the classic tale of someone trying to kidnap Christmas. The appearance of Oogie Boogie is classic. Jack bumbles his way through life and eventually gets it all worked out,
0060254920|5.0|Classic must have book. I think all kids should read this and I will enjoy sharing it with all 3 of mine.
B0047C2IIE|5.0|My husband grew up with this as an album. He loves it and so do I (even though it's a little before my time)
1603427244|5.0|Haven't had time to do a great deal of in depth reading in this new addition to my knitting library.  However, from what scanning I have done it seems like it will be a great reasource.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I think this game is very fun and exciting.You just cant wait untill you food is done. But let me tell you this you could axcidently spend your gems on something you never wanted and you cant get your gems back. There is a limited supply of gems but you can buy more gems but for real money.HAVE FUN WITH RESTAURANT<br /> STORY!!!!!???!!?!?
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|This movie was actually funnier than I thought it would be.  Worth the watch. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could
B000JQU4TW|5.0|What can you say?  This book was as good when I read it this time as it was when I read it twenty years ago.  Oscar has it going on with this one.
B001AKTZO6|4.0|Somewhere along the line, my vinyl copy of this album disappeared or wore out.  While I have Chronicle, the other CCR albums and John Fogerty albums and cds, the cuts that weren't on other compilations were missing.  So good to hear the original version of Born on the Bayou again.<br /><br />The live cuts are OK but the sound quality is not great
B0058SNI58|3.0|These are okay, but really not as comfortable as my other crocs have been.  Would not want to wear them all day as I have with my other crocs.
6304806418|2.0|I take responsibility for not realizing this DVD was in French, I wish there was a clearer area for me to see that it was not in English.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great calculator for an awesome price! How can you beat .99&cent; for a basic calculator that's right at you fingertips!
B004RLPTT0|4.0|For those of you who have not seen the movie, this is a great sound track. It is a mix of tracks that are slow and soothing and some that are fast paced and energetic. Good for the gym if you set them up in a way to wind you up before and cool you off after a workout.<br /><br /> One of the things i really like about this CD is that it doesn't have silly dialog mixed into the tracks like some movie sound tracks do. Just good tunes.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This is a wonderful book and a great story. I can totally see why they made it into a movie. It is full of suspense. It is really nice to hear a story about a war hero. The relationship between Joey and his owner is magical and a heartwarming tale. The way all the people work together to help them is a true testament to the human spirit.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|After a slow start, once things get going, it's a page turner.  I also found it a a bit educational.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|When I downloaded this game I never got to play it because it kept on messing up while downloading, and every time it didn't download so......
B008WOULPK|4.0|The book is  interesting to the people familiar with the fashion world.<br />It gave me some insight into the&#34;editorial&#34; material etc..<br />Grace is obviously an incredibly talented lady.Her sense of style is unique.<br />I am not sure Ms. Wintour could do anything without people like Grace.Work of many done be few.<br />The book also confirms that fashion world is similar to the court of the French kings..full of envy, jealousy, back stubbing and favouritism ... delicious....<br />What would life be without these people? Boring.<br />The drawback is that many pages are filled with names and names of various people Grace worked with but nothing of her..How she felt about things,what did she think. Almost as if she is too shy to talk about herself.
B00005OM4K|5.0|Found this today at an FYE for $60.  It appeared to be in new condition. I think it's a great buy! All of CCR's works in one box. HIGHLY recommended!!
B0098460O4|5.0|Wonderful, love the harmonies, Jonathan you are the best keep it going you<br />both make this world a better place to live.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Season 5 is, in my opinion, the best season of the series thus far. From story to execution, I think it nailed the character in a way no season has before (except perhaps Season 1) or since (including all of season 7).
B0085YNML2|1.0|I use Galaxy S vibrant. This game Never worked. Every time I open it, it crashes and laggs the phone.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book. It was unusual, intriguing and beguiling. Just when you think you have figured it out, it flips on you again. Interesting character development and interplay.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I have an Ultrafire 502b and have gone through many holsters until I found this one.  This is the best quality in my opinion for this type of flaslight.  It holds it very steady , easy to put in an remove and holds it in place.  From now on I will use only this brand of flashlight holster.  Finally a superior quality holster at an affordable price.
B00005B1W7|2.0|I had high hopes for this after having read the other reviews, but this is very cheesy.  I realize it was an early mini-series, but wow. Perhaps if I had seen it when it first came on I would feel differently, but as it stands I can't recommend this at all.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|What can I say she is the best and this album proves it!!! What a surprise to have Donny Osmond he is wonderful.
030759565X|4.0|I love this cookbook. I have already used 4 recipes and all were delicious.  The cooking tips are helpful. I find the recipes to be easy to follow.  I would recommend this cookbook.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Once again Ryan Murphy has done the impossible; made horror a viable genre for a weekly serial. Lets hope for several more seasons of this. And let's keep Jessica Lange!!!
0547391005|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER ... MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS BOOK ... WE READ A FEW OF THE STORIES EVERY NIGHT BEFORE BED TIME ... THIS BOOK IS ONE OF HER MANY FAVORITES &#60;3
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Did some reading on this release, I enjoy the alien series of movies. Amazon had it on sale, very excited and happy with this purchase.
1616960922|4.0|If you like Brandon's other books, you will also like this one. I'm looking forward to many more books from this author.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This movie was better than I expected. Two thumbs up, great actors, great scenarios, and overall I recommend this movie.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is one of the kids favorite movies. That laugh out loud and have really enjoyed it. This is the one they wanted the most.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I purchased two of these watches, one in black, one in blue.  For some reason there is a $100 difference in the msrp, according to the price tags attached to them.  Same watch, different color.  Based on the brushed aluminum case appearance, I expected a light weight watch.  Pleasantly surprised it's brushed steel.  The watch is actually fairly heavy.  After a week it's kept good time thusfar.  The band takes a bit of getting used to.  It's a little scratchy compared to leather, but looks appriate.  The watch is fairly thick, giving it a retro look.  The minute numbers on the outside ring are unusual, but actually make more sense than hour indicators (which are in small numbers on the inside ring).  The watch band is fairly long (7.2 inches is near the start of the band).  The size of the watch is medium.  If you want or need a large showy watch, this is not for you.  It would look sporty on a woman's wrist, but does not have a metrosexual appearance.  The watches arrived in retail boxes.  Each had a different instruction booklet, one of which was for a different type of watch.  Neither booklet was specifically for an automatic watch and determining the setting of the date took a little trial and error.  I purchased these watches fort travel in a tropical climate.  They're inexpensive, reliable and sporty.  At about 60 bucks it's a great deal, especially since the blue one supposedly retails at $285.  Pleasantly surprised by the quality of these watches.  If you can purchase one for under $75, you get a deal.
0307887448|5.0|Just awesome.  If you grew up in the 80's/90's and are a video game / 80's nostalgia person, this is the book for you.  It's so damn good.
B001NEYO8Q|4.0|I show this to my students after we've read a McCarthy novel in order for them to see a classic western movies I feel this has all the classical elements and characters of a western and it features John Wayne. What more could one ask for?
3421045453|4.0|Solid scientific foundation for his claims.<br /><br />I love how he opens up with how reporters and politicians reacted to his book with hyperbole after hyperbole on how terrible and wrong it is, when it is evident that most of them never read the book since it wasn't even available yet.<br /><br />It just shows the sad state of journalism where plagiarism is rampant, actual research rare. It also shows that politicians who in Europe are supposed to know better than regular citizens also known as commoners don't even bother to form their own opinion, but rather just parrot whatever the party and mainstream media is screaming.<br /><br />It is a dry read.. And if German isn't your native language it can be a bit of a challenge. Why isn't there an English version of this book anyway?
B0068THAGY|5.0|Great suspense, great story. Now on my top 10 list. The characters are well defined, and the story line well developed. Easy to follow for a sci-fi film and lives up to the reputation of JJ Abrams. I highly recommend this film.
B00A4CHZ2K|5.0|This a a great album.  I have been waiting for this release since he won American Idol.  Great music, unique sound, awesom lyrics.  The trifecta
B007HACDLK|4.0|Great book, have read all of vince Flynn books.  Do not want to do this after every book , I should have a choice.
1400067820|5.0|Having just finished book VI (of VII), I find myself reflecting on the day I came across 'The Black Swan' (a chance event). It was almost four years ago when I was browsing through a bookstore and bought it on a whim, never having heard of the book or author. Less than 100 pages in I knew that it was a special book. It spoke to me. And I am having a similar (though different) experience again with 'Antifragile.' Nevertheless, this book provides some peace of mind to my almost constant thoughts, struggles and the multitude of emotions that I experienced, thinking about his idea.<br /><br />It's like living in a 2D world then waking up to random flickers of a third dimension, the number of flickers growing exponentially with time. You will have lonely moments living in this new world, but you cannot bare the thought of living without it's (random) discovery.<br /><br />Like becoming human all over again -- being human will have a deeper more significant meaning this time 'round.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It was a show that kept me on the edge not knowing what's coming next loved it can't wait till next season
0765365278|5.0|It starts a little slow, but that is because Sanderson is clearly setting up a new enormous universe. I am currently rereading the book, I never re-read books, that's how much the characters and universe have captured my imagination.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Gives woman hope when all hope has seemed to vanish. Sparks truly hits the feelings and actions of a battered soul dead on.
0061992860|5.0|It is just great, it is way smaller than i expected but it is filled with great stuff!. The info in it is on point and very good stuff. I would recommend this to anybody. Prepper, camper, hiker, boyscout, or just somebody who wants to survive if you have to. I love it!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have Evernote on my Smartphone, PC, laptop, and now my Kindle Fire HD. I'm stil trying to tap in all the features aad facets. I like to use the Clearly app for reading and  processing articles.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? I'll start out by saying something nice. This book is better than the second one. And the beginning of it is actually kind of hot. You know, the parts before the sex actually starts. The tension between Ana and Christian at the beginning of the book, where she is constantly blushing in his presence and sensing \\"electricity\\" between the two of them is pretty decent. It's all downhill from there.<br />The two of them have a horrible relationship - they never communicate! It sounds like a high school relationship, not one between two adults.<br />Also, the book is a very inaccurate portrayal of BDSM (so I hear), so if you are intrigued enough to try some of the things in here, please go do some additional reading to make sure you know how to go about it safely.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|It's exactly what's in the picture, for the price you can't go wrong!<br /><br />My only con is that it's pretty easy to topple over due to the feet being smooth.
1610660242|4.0|Not anything groundbreaking. this is the comic version..which just means it is very much to the point.<br /><br />Money only motivates up to a certain degree. People want to feel part of something bigger. Like delivering the best customer satisfaction, being part of a team, having the ability to further develop oneself.<br /><br />I like it.. I wouldn't mind working for Zappos..
1452101248|4.0|I realized this had a lot of cheese recipes in it when I bought it, but couldn't resist the beauty and creativity that went into this collection.  As a vegan, really hoped for some vegan options as many of the newer of vegetarians books are offering.
0812992784|5.0|I enjoyed the book after only reading Midnight's Children, but now I feel compelled to read all of Mr. Rushdie's work! With much emphasis put on the question of value of one human life over another (e.g. he was not worth protecting to many), I'd be interested to see his take on the criminal justice system in America.
B009MFHFP2|5.0|I am enjoying this album on my Amazon Cloud.  Of course I will by more music this way! Thank you.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I trudged through the first Fifty Shades book because my friends all love it, and some folks give it credit for bringing kink into the mainstream. Although the writing was atrocious, that one at least kept me reading to find out what was going to happen next. This second installment is so horrible I gave up about a quarter of the way through. Where to start?<br /><br />First, some of the awful myths at the center of the first shades get even more focus here:<br />1. People are kinky because they are broken. If they can only be \\"fixed\\" with love, they'll be \\"normal.\\"<br />2. Jealousy is a positive sign of how much you love someone, including jealousy about things that happened long before you came into the picture.<br />3. Love is a form of ownership. Hence the annoying use of the word \\"mine\\" over and over again.<br />4. Stalking is endearing.<br />5. Sulking, pouting, stomping off, and other passive aggressive techniques are effective means of communication within a relationship. Just do it over and over again!<br /><br />I'm sorry, I know there are a lot of die-hard fans out there. But the relationship between the two of them reads, to me, like one between a couple of petulant teenagers. I've outgrown the idea that that garbage is romantic or sexy. And for people who are ostensibly so deeply in love (after knowing one another for a relatively short time) Ana and Christian are certainly bent on changing the other person.<br /><br />The story is extremely repetitive - lots of passive aggressive fighting, followed by lots of basically vanilla sex. The sex scenes got so cheesy and repetitive I started skimming through them. Then I realized I was skimming through all of the \\"relationship\\" stuff because that was equally annoying. Once you're skimming through the whole book, it's time to quit.
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|ah this is a fantastic item for any maiden fan. superb content, and really well presented. i thoroughly enjoyed it - and being at one of the gigs on this tour made it even more special! perfect set
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|i added this app to my kindle fire hoping to add more apps to it. unfortunately, you cant use google apps on the kindle right now. maybe someday?
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Best action superhero movie I've seen. I enjoy how well put together this movie is.  Great job.  I am a little super hereo'd out of it.  But.  Awesome
6304457383|5.0|I know not much story but the acting was well done and Audrey Hepburn is good actress that helped make this movie better.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I've seen the movie before and loved it. It teaches women and girls they can do and become anything they want to even if it was meant for a man.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I've considered getting this game for a long time as this is my favorite type of game for my tablet and I really like the way that Alawar does them but I think I avoided it due to the questionable ratings.  Well, I finally caved because there are only so many of these out there and most are sub-par and over-priced  (the only other game-makers I consistently like are Big Fish and Mumbojumbo--unfortunately the later is not compatible with my tablet) and I'm completely satisfied and glad I did--it's really fantastic!<br /><br />The biggest complaint appears to be the additional charge halfway through the game, which I admit was a bad move on their part.  I'm pleased to say that it seems they have listened and reacted favorably--when I got to that point, it still stopped the game (yes, right in the middle of an activity, definitely annoying) and took me to a &quot;purchase&quot; page, however the button said &quot;free&quot; and didn't cost me a dime.  Kudos, Alawar--I think the game is easily worth 2 or 3 dollars if not more but I think they are doing the right thing by keeping it at $ .99 to get the rating up where it belongs.<br /><br />Second issue--large, slow download.  True, it is huge--605 MB-- and, expectedly, it takes a little time, but I didn't have any issues with disconnecting or starting over that others mentioned.  Both of these things were completely worth the end result--top-notch graphics with video cut-scenes and smooth game play.  No frequent loading after every chapter or inane dialogue between unappealing characters (ahem, Nevosoft).  It was a satisfying length, too--I kept thinking it was almost over but then would open up a whole new area.  I did get through it all today but we had a blizzard and that's pretty much all I did.<br /><br />Lastly, I read complaints of freezing up and starting over--I had no problems like this whatsoever on my Samsung galaxy tab.<br /><br />All in all it's a fantastic game if you like point and click/hidden object adventures.  Built in hints with the ability to skip puzzles after a fairly short wait (I actually used this more than normal since a lot of the puzzles were related to a type I'm just not good at, but there was a pretty large variety of them).  Most of the one stars can now be disregarded and I hope people give it a chance and bump the overall rating up where it belongs.  I'll be patiently waiting for more of these.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Boring. Long and choppy story and where were all of Batmans cool toys? Batarangs and stuff.Missing- Bad acting too-my recommendation is Miss This Movie
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i could not put this fantastic game down having just completed the casual level i will try the next level up.....the graphics are very clear and display great detail.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I haven't given this to my dad yet. But I must say it was a really good price for the set. He loves this movie so much. And looks forward to it coming on each year around Christmas time when it does. Now he will be able to watch it when ever he wants to.
1401322786|4.0|Mitch Albom is my favorite author and I always buy his books as quick as I can and read them as quick as I can.  I think I finished this one in 2 days because I was so anxious to find out how it turned out.  It was great!
0399157565|5.0|This author is one of my all-time favorites.  Absolutely love the &#34;Kay Scarpetta&#34; character.  Will recommend this book and author to my friends.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|EMMA is one of my wife's favorite tales and this version is perhaps the best on film.  Highly recommend this movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I'm a huge Vince Flynn fan, but this is definitely a &#34;can't put down&#34; thriller.  Flynn reintroduces the reader to some old characters and creates new plot twists that will keep the series going long after The Last Man.  I loved it!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Having the actors and actresses sing live during film does make a huge difference on the emotional impact that their performance can inflict on you. Some songs are painful to listen to, blurring your vision with tears in your eyes- especially 'I Dream A Dream.'<br /><br />By far, some of the songs were the best I've ever heard (Comparing to seeing it live, listening to many different variation of musical albums- Broadway, London, Anniversary, and Complete Recordings). Maybe it's because the songs were much more emotional and gut-wrenchingly performed- but I really like this version. Hopefully the movie will be just as good once these songs are intertwined with the imagery.<br /><br />'I have A Dream' and 'On My Own' are the best I've heard.<br />'One Day More' feels even more larger than life!
B004M8AL6E|5.0|I really enjoyed the entire series.  I love westerns, but generally, I am not a big fan of miniseries.  Lonesome Dave was excellent.  I can't believe I had not watched it sooner!
B0086700CM|3.0|My granddaughter downloaded this one. She loves it, me, well, not so much. But it keeps her happy while I get other things done.
0374533571|5.0|well written, great insight into the mentally ill mind, with enough humor to keep it from being depressing.  i love pat peoples!
1401310672|4.0|I saw a segment on one the talk shows that had sampling of 'autocorrect.'<br />It is good for all ages.<br />Entertaining, you will laugh until you cry.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My grand daughters loved this game so much. They play it together. Thanks so much.<br />Kindle Tablet Edition. to good.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it's a good app.  It gives me the weather accurately, and in an easy to read format.  I alsolike the update bar always available in the notification bar if I need it.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|A very different kind of story but I really enjoyed it.  Worth the read, I think.  I will look for another one by the same author.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I was not real pleased with this app because it always seems to time out or you can only get through a couple of pages and then it just spins and won't download anymore content. I find that I usually will just go to the web and get on that way.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I placed this item in my cart and then somehow forgot about it.  The price went down after a month and I got it for a great price and it came in 2 days.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Pretty good but not as good as the first. Some of the characters got a little boring. Can hardly wait to get it on DVD though.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This game is fun if you actually get your friends to play with you. If not you will be sitting there unable to play the game
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This has to be one of the best apps!  So many colors to choose from, so many brush and pencils to select, and my daughter is going to love the elephant stickers!<br />Great for Kindle For HD 8.9!<br /><br />UPDATED  REVIEW<br />My daughter does indeed love this app!  She's done many drawings already, some simple, some more complex.  I love playing with this one too.  The drawings are very smooth, and it is very responsive.  I guess the only thing that it's missing is pressure / thickness sensitivity.  But for the price - who cares?  it's AWESOME!  Download this if you want to have fun drawing on your Kindle HD.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This DVD came still in its original wrapping.  I'm very happy with this purchase, as it's one of my favorite movies of all time.
1608871088|5.0|Loved the movie! This book makes you appreciate the movie more.  I read from front to back this one.  Beautifully presented by the different domains of the different characters.  Love this Book
B004FK8RKG|1.0|These are a total waste of money.  They are overpriced.  They are cheaply made. They are not loud enough and very flimsy.  Cheap product, overpriced, can't hear product.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is hard to believe that there are still naysayers after reading this incredible true story.  Although much of the medical jargon was beyond my comprehension, it was necessary to prove the legitimacy of the severity of the illness and ultimate miraculous recovery.  I felt such a sense of comfort, and peace, after reading this book.  It reinforced what I already knew, that God loves each of us for who we are and in spite of our flaws.
0062200909|5.0|The pictures are really beautiful and very well done. My son will love it. Would recommend to any art student.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I asked, and I received! I had questions about formatting for Kindle, and this book answered those questions as well as many others in a clear and easily understood manner.<br />J. Deelstra, Author of Escaping the Chrysalis, Blessings in the Mire, Shadows Attached.
1476719071|5.0|I.LOVE.THIS.BOOK!  Awesome story, great characters. I have read this book 3 times and can't wait till the second book comes out!  Jamie is a awesome author!!!
075669812X|5.0|My kids love their Ninjago Encyclopedia...and the bonus Lloyd was a plus! It WILL make a great Christmas gift if you are undecided. A must have if you are a Ninjago fan :))
B0052UZIFA|5.0|ive played the crap out of this game.<br />my favorite game to play when i have time to kill.  some stages can take awhile, but the game picks up where you left off.
B003ASLJK4|1.0|waited to long to view - and it was damaged - can't return it - don't order older dvds on line
B008P1EWIM|3.0|thios app is ok... fa la la la la la la. use it some use it a little la la
B009CGAZGW|3.0|The black face totally turned me off. I enjoy Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire but seems very dated. I've been hearing how great this movie is for years. Didn't do it for me or my 92 year old father. We'll watch &#34;White Christmas&#34; or &#34;Scrooged&#34; any day.
B000V63BN6|5.0|Great collection, great price! Love Stevie Wonder... his music just puts you in a good mood and you can sing right along.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Although I haven't had the pleasure of playing this on my Kindle Fire HD, I do have both the online and Deluxe versions, and I have to say that this is an amazingly fun game!!  I'm puzzled at the fact that it's not available for Fire and Fire HD; The BTD5 facebook page has a picture of it being played on each of those devices.  At any rate, Amazon's excellent customer service cheerfully refunded me the cost of the app.  Here's hoping it gets released for the Fire family!!<br /><br />EDIT- As of April 18, this is available for Kindle Fire HD.
0762188618|2.0|I was expecting a full copy, not the Reader's Digest condensed version.  The (full) original book is of course excellent
B007SGM084|3.0|I purchased to read what all the hype was about.  The first book was pretty good, as far as shock value in the idea that it's not something most have ever read about.  I liked it.  Then the second and third were very redundant, same dialogue over and over, yes, some of the story-line was there and that was good, but the interaction with the couple was the same, lost it's unpredictability, found I could skim through and not miss a beat.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I like Brave because it's funny.  Because when her mother was a bear she ate poisoned berries.  I like how it's animated.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am looking forward to the day Colleen Hoover decides to take a little break from writing \\"New Adult\\" and decides to write an adult, contemporary romance, WOW! I bet it will be heart shattering... I can just imagine her ability of writing emotional, well-developed characters combined with a mature, sexy, steamy relationship... It would be the perfect storm!!! :) but the truth is, whatever Colleen decides to write going forward, I want to be reading it...There are not many romance authors out there that can take me on this kind of \\"reading high\\", like she did with Hopeless.<br /><br />Hopeless is indeed a very intense read. I would like to quote Maryse (Maryse's book blog) because she describes it perfectly:<br /><br />\\"This is one intense book. INTENSE I tell you! Intense subject matter, emotionally intense, romantically intense, and intensely stunning. Gut-wrenching, dark, and even occasionally panic-inducing. I found myself trembling as the revelations were slowly coming to light.\\" (maryse.net)<br /><br />There is no much more you can say about Hopeless, without compromising the reader's experience with details. Just read it, just give this gift to yourself, you will not regret it.<br /><br />BTW: There is no cliffhanger and no waiting for part two. Lately, this alone gives the book some extra stars!!! :)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It is an awesome tale.. I loved it and it made me cry.. I almost had to leave the room..
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|Great cast, scenary, sets and story. I'm not sure if it's 100% historically correct but it's one of those movies I watch over and over.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|Well written, honest. The book says many things with the reasoning to back it up, that many people are afraid to say. I had always questioned Marilyn Manson and his beahvior, not really understanding the view point for his actions.  I agree with many of his concepts of christianity hypocrisy and I guess we all express ourselves in different ways. A great read!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|needs better directions.  Difficult to figure out.  probably  could have a good time but not able to get the overall &#34;how to do&#34; down.  Think I know how ...then a big flop.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I am loving this album just didn't realize its not the extended version :(  Really loving the song with Blake!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|VERY ROMANTIC. The back and forth of present to past and back was a bit disconcerting in the beginning. But in the end it all came together nicely.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Really enjoyed reading the story the way it was meant to be enjoyed. Loved seeing the illustrations included in the book.
1439102813|5.0|Finally a novel that portrays Alzhiemer's disease for what it's actually like to live with both as one afflicted with the disease and for those around them. I highly recommend to anyone who is trying to come to terms with this disease. It really helped me put my mother's disease into perspective
B005IQ39AY|5.0|somewhat addictive, sometimes the game does not act the way you would like but it is a game and is still fun to play
B0050DIWFC|1.0|The story is slow, slow, slow and repetitive.  I don't care about any of the characters and its easy to skip pages at a time and still known what's happening.  Which isn't much.
030758836X|5.0|Very good plot..A little scary at the end. but it is a book that you can't stop reading. Can't believe the creativity of this author. wonderful reading.
B00008976Y|1.0|I had the misfortune of seeing this movie in the cinema and was deeply moved. So much so that I begged some complete strangers who were inspecting the movie posters outside not to see it at any cost.  I like difficult movies and I don't mind films where nothing much happens for a bit, but this was just a pointless waste of time. Binoche's husband dies and she spends the film looking expressionlessly at various things, driving around a bit and having a sexual encounter which is about as sexy as cleaning linoleum.  Just look at the dvd cover for two and a half hours and you've got the movie experience for free.

B00A8ECU24|3.0|Super fun game. My kids love it. Biggest drawback is how long it takes to get heart stones and gems if you aren't up for purchasing. It's a kids game. Otherwise no complaints.

B00ACFL69C|5.0|Basically I love this movie cause it's simple and crazy. Matthew McConaughey finally in a great role he deserves and carries out with magic and the other actors did well too.
0547884591|5.0|I have learned a lot from Tim's previous books, and was eagerly looking forward to this one. It fulfilled my expectations.<br /><br />In addition to a cooking course, from no knowledge to master chef level, the book has excellent advice on how we learn anything. From shooting baskets to butchering a deer to memorizing a deck of cards, this book teaches you how to learn, so you can apply the principles to learning anything.<br /><br />The cookbook section is pretty good too. I know I'll use the 4 pages with over 100 shorthand recipes from around the world.<br /><br />Warning: this book is not for teetotaling vegans.
0517548232|4.0|This book is a very good read for anyone that wants to learn how economics work in the real world. It talks wages, unions, price fixing and any other thing that the government has done to manipulate the conditions of an economy. This book though written a while ago and updated still paints a picture of our current issues and problems and how they got the way they did.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like about the book was that there were some grammatical errors that were annoying.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|We are such fans of these characters.  Watched them all when they were on out local PBS station. On a whim, as we were remembering the show, I looked to see if anything was available on Amazon. We were so excited to find it available. Now we can watch it as we want, and when we need a good laugh. We are thrilled with our purchase, thank you.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love it! Recommend it to teenagers and adults. Kind of like Cafe World on FB. I would even recommend it for kids that are 10 years old and up.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|Item arrived in protective packaging and worked perfectly. The movie was enjoyable and is good to have in the collection of ones to watch over again.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have to say it is a great choice for star wars fans, the person i got this for... loved it.. it is very complete and there´s nothing compared to the Blu-ray quality
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy does not disappoint. Just another excellent book from a great writer. I will continue to purchase every book he writes.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book about two people finding love after marriage. Would recommend this book to people who love a good ending.
B001LM1456|4.0|I grew up with the Hulk TV show and loved it, however cheesy it seems now. These days, I have a comic book aficionado for a best friend and usually get his opinion on comic book movies. He wasn't a fan of the Eric Bana version, but had said that he was willing to give this one a shot before writing it off....I didn't have a chance to ask before we watched this, but I must say, I was impressed with the special effects and with Edward Norton. If you like superhero movies, this is worth watching!
B00002N9ER|4.0|Product works as advertised, while plastic they are quite solid in construction.  Needed to mount a mag to the garage wall...perfect solution.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book I could read it a million times and it will never get old it has so much action and romance at the same time and the end keeps you wondering and wanting to read  catching fire
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|Just don't like it.  Not for me. Looking for something to pass the time away, but this certainly was not it.  Maybe for a very young child...
141659521X|3.0|A bit tedious at times. The characters seemed dull. Plot was was hard to accept. If asked I would say save your money.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Maybe not up to some of DeMille's other novels.  Some parts of the story seem drawn out, especially toward the end, but John Corey a great lead &#34;character&#34;.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Well I gave this as a giftto one of my friends, she loved it. I didn't get to listen to it , but from her she says its amazing with all the songs! Very good, it came 1 day before it said, good condition, packaged good also. And for the price it was cheap compared to bootleg or going to stores
B000JCSBU0|5.0|This was a really good movie. Strong story, great acting. I really felt for these character and the devastating effects of legal and illegal drugs.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am really enjoying this game.  First thing I downloaded on my new Kindle Fire HD.  Instead of learning how to use my Kindle, I keep playing this game...:)

B003B02O0U|5.0|John Grisham is our favorite author, one my wife and I measure others against.  Great, suspenseful story...as are all his novels.
B006IRQULM|5.0|I love this movie!  Love the story and music and Jennifer Hudson alone is a reason to watch this movie!  She should have won the &#34;Best&#34; Actress not supporting, as she is amazing.
B006VA3ZEG|5.0|What else can be said about a masterful series exploring social and gender norms of early 20th C England. And to be able to get it streaming with Prime is icing on the cake! Just a great viewing experience of a great series.
0385737947|5.0|This was the first book in a while that sucked me in and made me lose track of time. From page 1, the reader is plunged into an exciting, suspenseful adventure. Every chapter ends with a cliff hanger, as does the book. You'll want to have The Scorch Trials ready to go after finishing this book.<br /><br />The series follows an adolescent boy named Thomas. He awakens in a small dark box one day, not remembering anything other than his first name. The box eventually opens to reveal a grassy area full of other boys his age. They call the area The Glade. He soon learns The Glade in smack dab in the middle of a huge maze, and that they all awoke to the same phenomenon that Thomas did. A day later a teenage girl arrives to The Glade--something which has never happened before. As the boys sort through the confusing event, things throughout the maze begin to change drastically for the worse. It is imperative that they find a way out of the maze before it's too late.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Looking for something to watch without having the bu-geezus scared out of me I found season one of AHS and was hooked.  I fully expect season two will be just as captivating and it is off to a good start.  If you want drama and suspense watch AHS.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Like many here on Amazon, I was very excited to acquire The Beatles vinyl boxset and found the mixes & mastering levels to be excellent, especially when comparing them to some of the older Capitol era releases. However, I also agree that the vinyl quality of the boxset is very sub-par. Some records played great, while others sounded too noisy in spots or had other issues.<br /><br />Here are the pressing defects and related issues in my vinyl box set:<br /><br />* Non-Fill Issues: Noise (slight distortion, static/scratching sounds) is present between many songs, and in some cases, is even continuing right into the track as the music begins.<br /><br />* Visual Flaws & Blemishes: Some of the pressings have defects in the vinyl that look like \\"stitch marks\\" or \\"string of pearls\\" - where the vinyl looks like it didn't mold itself completely to the master or stamper. The defects are easy to spot when holding them in adequate light. FYI - I did not use fluorescent light either as it does not always offer an accurate visual on flaw detection. I always use a regular halogen or incandescent type bulb to be sure. Also, the cut on the outer perimeter of the vinyl is not consistent from record to record. Some have flat spots, others have cut marks and indentations, thus causing the vinyl to be slightly out of round.<br /><br />* Off-Center Pressings: Several pressings were pressed off-center and are mildly warped in some cases. The off-center pressings pose a multitude of problems - the most critical being what I call the \\"sway effect\\" - where the tonearm moves in a side-to-side motion, thus causing pitch modulation and non-fill issues all at the same time. Essentially, the stylus (needle) shifts from one side of the groove to other, thus increasing the non-fill noise tenfold. This also increases the risk of damage to your stylus, as well as, the vinyl itself since it is not centered properly. The records also have very slight warping spots (peaks & valleys) causing the tonearm to move in an up and down motion, adding to more fidelity loss.<br /><br />I'm not going to mince any words here: This is a crap job by RAINBO RECORDS!!! WHERE IS THE QUALITY CONTROL?!?!?<br /><br />After going through my box set thoroughly, I decided to go to the record store down the street and buy separate LP's to compare them quality-wise to the ones I wanted to replace, but I didn't have any luck going that route either. The same EXACT problems happened as above. I immediately returned them!<br /><br />What a total letdown this vinyl boxset has been. The jackets, packaging and book are all terrific, but the vinyl quality is crap! BUYER BEWARE!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|keeps me in touch with my family and friends and what is going on, Like all the pictures and jokes
B000N2HBSO|5.0|What I liked especially was the fact that, like Candice Millwood's Destiny of the Republic, this is a quadruple biography.  Each chapter traces the evolution of Lincoln, Siward, Bates and Chase toward the  election of 1860 and beyond into cooperation.  We get what seems to be a deep portrait of each of the rivals' qualities and ambitions (though Bates seems considerably less ambitious than his competitors).  Whereas most Lincoln studies tend to deify the 16th president, Goodwin humanizes him and makes a lively case that his greatest skill was engaging former rivals as allies in a great cause.  In our time of fiscal cliffs and gotcha politics, when congresspersons and senators don't speak to one another and demonize the 43rd president, Goodwin's portrait of Lincoln evokes nostalgia for a time when politics was possible.
0385742886|4.0|Prequels are always interesting. This book, although it takes place before the other three in The Maze Runner series, must be read after the completion of The Death Cure. It answers those lingering questions that remain after reading the other three books. I am not going to go into detail because it will ruin things for those who have not finished The Maze Runner. But, be sure to read The Kill Order. Though it's not as suspenseful as the other three in the series, it is important in order to complete the series and find closure.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Without going into a lot of detail, Boston is one of the tightest bands I've ever heard. They just do it right! I can, and do, listen to them for hours. If you are fortunate enough to be near a stop on their tour, go for it. If not, kick back, get mellow, put on te headphones and enjoy.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I appreciate all of the game features but not the annoying pop ups. Better than my phone solitaire. Thanks for the features, Cronnells
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This purchase was for a friend.  She is enjoying the trilogy  I recommend it to all.  Amazon is an excellent source to buy the book from.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. It's so cute and has a love story that everyone can relate to. I consider it a classic at this point. I don't know why I waited so long to purchase it!
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Love the movie. Hate Mel Gibson. Action is good. Characters are one dimensional. The Master Sergeant is the best. Fairly accurate action. One of the best scenes is the group of wives talking about the military. Spot on for the time period.
1553655427|4.0|I am currently in the business of delivering aid in the form of personal light to the 1.5 billion people on the planet living in darkness.  As a result of reading this book, I have embarked on a path that is completely different from the standard process of raising funds and providing free products.  The new model provides training for female and other entrepreneurs to sell the products and services that are needed in the cities, towns and villages throughout Africa.  Very often we think we are doing good when in reality we are hurting the people and economy of the countries we wish to support.  Excellent reading, well researched and wonderfully controversial.
B005QPMB2Y|3.0|Although it doesn't really list my camera model, it sort-of works. It's better than anything else out there for the price.<br />Skip the others and start here before spending real $.
0345803485|1.0|The only way I was able to read this was as a joke, out loud, to my mother, and drunk. It's so blatantly a Twilight fan fiction. Also, the character acts about 10 years younger than she actually is. She's about as knowledgeable about sex as a small child (for instance, she didn't know it was possible to have sex dreams). And yet she takes up a stranger's offer to be involved in BDSM? It's easy to tell the author has never involved herself in BDSM in the slightest, since she makes it seem like a game of total power control, which it's not. Grey's character is possessive and controlling. The erotic scenes made me laugh. You can find better things online written by people half her age. Don't waste your time if you expect good writing and dynamic characters. And, if you hate Twilight, don't touch it with a ten foot pole. You'll only find yourself angry and upset.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|I gave it a 4 star, because let's face it, it was not as good as Notebook!!! They say it was the sequel to it. Loved the actors, but it didn't make me burst out in tears as much as Notebook did.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is a realy fun gams to play and it is a little annoying that you need 2,000 gems to get the sun or moon dragon and that could be changed but otherwies it is a lot of fun
B009329Y30|3.0|Zac Efron is hot - no doubt - his co- star- forget her name but she's a Leo ;-) is beautiful as well and it's really nice to in my bed where I view my movies pretending that this could happen to me.  The only thing i could see as a likelihood with be having a dog named Zeus.  It's predictable, stereotyped and cliched BUT? It's heart - the movie's heart is in the right place - of course the book was written by Nicholas Sparks..(aka The Notebook) is a romantic soul and he can afford to be.  Bottom line? If you have the money? It's worth the time to watch it. If not? NO big losss.

1455502758|4.0|I was reminded of this book when I saw a comment about AIDS research in [[ASIN:1844676722 Comments on the Society of the Spectacle (Third Edition)  (Radical Thinkers)]]: it is better to give people false hope than no hope at all. Hitchens got radiation burns from experimental protons moving into his body at two thirds of the speed of light. That was painful, but his treatments for pain became part of what Hitchens could write about. The AIDS researchers released news about the progress in the search for a cure for AIDS a few hours before the patients that were the data base for that study died. A lot of people are resting in peace now. Some of this is beyond the comprehension of people who thought a community of believers was the only immortality we could look forward to. Reading Mortality after the death of Hitchens is typical of literary life as I am familiar with it from the point of view of [[ASIN:1903517664 The Dedalus Book of Literary Suicides: Dead Letters (Dedalus Concept Books)]]. A certain lightness sustains the existence of some bodies that no longer have any possibility of longevity in the physical world. Modern medicine has been learning how to think like the hospice that never gives up hope.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|What a great movie!!  It will keep you on your feet.  It is exciting, and a great story line.  I own all the Boune Movies and enjoy all of them but this one explains so much more and makes this group of movies even more enjoyable.  Watch and see for yourself.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a great way to end a Trilogy!!! If you've read books 1 and 2 don't stop there! Book 3 is great!
B007NU54H4|5.0|The Movie (Plot, Characters, Music, Etc.): I was skeptical when the first Tinker Bell movie was released, but since then my 4 year old daughter and almost 2 year old son have fallen in love with this series and have collected each installment, including this latest addition, Secret of the Wings.<br /><br />The first thing I love about Wings is that it's another expansion of the Pixie Hollow universe. This is the reason &#34;The Great Fairy Rescue&#34; is my least favorite, because the fairies and their world, not just Tinkerbell's antics, are what I love the most. Wings does not disappoint here though! We get to see the world of the Winter fairies which has plenty in common with the &#34;warm fairies&#34; as they're called in this movie all of a sudden, but also plenty of differences! It's a new magical world for Tink to explore with new fairies to meet and adventures to be had.<br /><br />The animation seems to keep getting better and better. The music is magical and the voice acting is spot on as always. We don't see much of Terrence in this one, but we see plenty of the other characters, including a short side story with the Queen herself (I forget her name...)<br /><br />I especially enjoyed this one because of the introduction of Tinkerbell's sister, Perriwinkle. They have an instant bond as sisters that is animated very well and is very real. The love is there and it warms your heart to watch the siblings work together to overcome obstacles and never get into a single tiff along the way. I was waiting for the usual &#34;We meet, we love each other, oh but now we have a fight, and the climax of the movie is we forgive each other&#34; plot but that, thankfully, never came. These leaves kids and their siblings only with kind thoughts and the inspiration to work together and be there for one another which is great.<br /><br />As an adult, I kind of saw the real ending coming even so and wish we hadn't had to just add some action in there at the end for a good climax and no other reason, but I also didn't mind the ending. It was a nice conclusion and I can't wait to see the next Tinkerbell adventure.<br /><br />Special Features: The special features are the usual fair, with music videos and whatnot. My daughter and I enjoyed the short bonus clip featuring Tinkerbell and a Halloween Jack-o'-Lantern. I am also now kicking myself because the 20-some minute long &#34;Pixie Hollow Games&#34; movie is also included on both discs! I bought this by itself on Amazon instant video for 2.99 before Secret of the Wings had been released.<br /><br />The Pixie Hollow Games features the garden fairies with Rosetta being our lead character for this feature. Think the Olympics with fairies, and the garden fairies have a pretty embarrassing losing streak. But it's Rosetta's turn to compete and she's happy just dropping out of the first round to spare herself the humiliation. She ends up being paired with a newer garden fairy who is anxious to compete and aim for the gold.<br /><br />It's a really refreshing watch with the same Tinkerbell Pixie Hollow world and fantastic music but a new lead, and I think a lot of kids nowadays can relate to not wanting to compete in public, even when they do have a great chance at win. I knew plenty of kids when I was in school who would fail gym for lack of participation, simply because they were afraid of trying and failing. So this is a really great theme to share with little ones!<br /><br />I don't have much else to say but... If you buy this, here's a tip. Do watch the included music video The Great Divide by the McClain Sisters. Not because the song is great (it is, I like it), but because it is hilarious. One of the sisters, being a new up and comer of course (you'll know her when you see her, I promise), is not super awesome at controlling her facial expressions for the camera. Throughout the whole music video, she shoots you looks like a lion on the prowl about to jump on some fresh meat and it had melaughing with my daughter having no idea why.<br /><br />So don't be afraid to give Tinkerbell a shot with this one! Even my son loves the sense of adventure in every movie, especially this one. Definitely a must watch for siblings!laughing with my daughter having no idea why.<br /><br />So don't be afraid to give Tinkerbell a shot with this one!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book 1 got me to reading book 2! Read it at the same time as a friend and discuss it! That's what I did! It was great to share the triumphs and tribulations with someone else who knows what you are talking about! Can't wait till book 2!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|This is a nice reworking of  the Sherlock homes stories.  Making him a recovering addict with Watson as a former surgeon that has to put up with his wacky behavior.  I would like to see how they handle the time limit since Watson will only be with him for a month or so.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am still reading this book. I have to read in snatches - when and where I can find a few minutes. I love the flow of the book because it gives an honest appraisal of what is going on in the nation leading up to the nomination and election of Abraham Lincoln as president. I was not aware of the other potential men vying for the various political seats and utlimately the presidency. I like the way the author delves into the personal lives of these men in additon to giving timely political news of the day. A fascinating book. I will look for other books by this author. Well worth the money and time to read.<br /><br />Thank you for this opportunity. Merry Christmas!
