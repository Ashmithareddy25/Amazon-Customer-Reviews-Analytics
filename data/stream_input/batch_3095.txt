B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really good read. Could not stop turning the page. Author painted a great love story. Definently recommed for male or female.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I am a rather long-term fan of Malcolm Gladwell's work, and immensely enjoy the connections and conclusions he makes about why things happen they way they do.  When I read his work, I begin to think of how other occurrences can be analyzed along the same lines, and everyday problems overcome with creative thinking.  I highly recommend his work to everyone I know.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|my cousin hand this game on his phone then I got it for my kindle.it worked and it was awesome for about two or three days then it keeps saying it needs to foreclose and it goes back to the main screen of the kindle not worth 1.99
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book clarifies the era in which Jesus of Nazareth lived.  It also makes plain how the Bible was actually written, and probably by whom.  Saul of Tarsis (better known as St. Paul) is shown to have played a major roll in the establishment of the Christian religion, although he never actually met Jesus.  Language also had an effect in how Christianity was perceived and proliferated, at times creating confusion or used by copiers of the biblical texts to change the direction of popular thinking.  I enjoyed this book as it coincides with archeological information closely, and seems to come closer to making sense of what can be known about Jesus----without all the frills.  He still remains a remarkable being.
B002RI99IM|4.0|I liked the book absolutely. I received one in hard copy so I do not have it on a Kindle anymore but will buy again it for sure. the book describes a lot of interesting views which give you a lot of thinking and a lot of reasoning to do.
B0028MBKVG|3.0|Mr. McDougall's book is an enjoyable and inspiring read. It tends toward the polemic, and is clearly tendentious, but recognizing that, you're left with a good read that makes you want to go out and run.
B00902AKK4|3.0|A NIFTY game with Cool Graphics and Nice puzzle challenges. Great Music and Sounds. Controls work well. However (as stated by others) it tends to FREEZE or SHUT DOWN on occasion! I bought the Original Beyond Ynth version a long time ago and had problems so I DELETED it. I decided to try this UPDATED version and it has improved in the Gameplay, Features and Options. It is Engaging, Challenging and Enjoyable.  Too bad it Freezes and makes you lose your progress!<br /><br />I have a High-End 32 gb Motorola Xoom Tablet and No other apps do this on it!<br /><br />Overall, a Pleasant, Challenging Puzzle App with Smooth HD Graphics and Good Controls. It is a Worthy app and worth the price.  JUST NEEDS TO BE TWEEKED to stop Freezing and Shut Down problems that many people are experiencing. Hopefully the Developer will take heed and work on a fix so we can all enjoy it.  Still worth a try for those of you not familiar with it... a Truly Great game otherwise and you might not have these problems on your device (if you are lucky).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's like a good novel you can't put down. I can't stop watching but I don't want it to end.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read all the Jack Teacher books and this one is as good as the others.  I have a hard time putting them down and this one is no exception.  Very interesting and suspenseful.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Good game. Real easy. And any body can play graphics are nice and easy get folds unlinked these other games where you have to repeatedly spend money with this you still do but not as much. And I like it that it is a different kind of BOXING games dents I play slot of them
B001DUGOWY|5.0|A man is judged by his actions and his word. Ethan Allen Hawley is struggling with how he has been raised and wants to be, and his desire to be what the new world order sees as successful. A book written over fifty years ago,but the same dilemma for the honest man.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|It is nice and bright but the screen is sort of strange to turn it on and off but overall it is good.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Just what I've been looking for...nd yes it's very easy to work with. Thanks for this app. I love it. I'm looking forward to tomorrow at 5am. That will be the first alarm...but the weather update will also be fantastic this winter.
B00F031X62|5.0|Out of all the live Jimi cd's this one brings me closer to imagining what it would have been like to see him in person.  Every emotion is picked up from the band...a little joking, a little frustration, and a lot of fun jamming.  It's true Janie Hendrix continues to churn the cash box with \\"unreleased\\" songs...some are hidden little gems, others are for the completist. But who cares..it's Jimi! This show has a lot of unknown history to it, from Michael Lang using this as a launch pad for a bigger event (Woodstock,) to Jimi writing the lyrics to \\"Rainy Day\\" for Electric Ladyland because the Sunday show was rained out...not to mention the fact the City of Hallandale Beach actually allowed an event such as this to take place is a mystery all in itself. Keep in mind, in 1968 Miami was a very conservative place and not even close to what it is today.  What this show allows the listener to engage in is everything Jimi became famous for...from improvisation, to loose jamming, to locked in the pocket precise playing with Noel and Mitch. Whoever designed the packaging, nailed the Miami theme perfectly.  First the cover...blue sky and Jimi wearing a white ruffled shirt and deep red velvet pants...it screams Miami.  Then the pictures inside...which to me are worth getting the cd for those alone...never before seen cool candid shots....and finally the music. From the crazy, blurry beginning of Hey Joe...to one of the hottest versions of FIre I've ever heard.  Eddie Kramer's experience shines through on the mix...considering this was outside in a wide open area, with no acoustics and a South Florida breeze blowing, the sound is amazing. Bottom line...as whole, this package works and everything fits perfectly together....Miami Pop Festival...Experience it...you won't be disappointed.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I am not a Doctor Who fan, in general.  I have been aware of the series for years, and have a great deal of respect for it as the longest running series ever.  That is also why I tend not to like it, overall.  When you develop a mechanic that allows you to replace the cast every few years or so, yes the series lives on, but you have new people.  What if the new people don't click?  What if the newest doctor doesn't grab your attention?  New companions' dynamic are not believable?<br /><br />That has been my trouble for the longest time.  I knew of the series, had a grasp of the various races and plots, but... I never clicked with actors.  So, I couldn't get into it.  And then, they stumbled upon Matt Smith and I finally found a doctor I could grasp, one that actually grabbed my attention.  More than that, his companions didn't bother me.  The Ponds worked, River Song made sense, even the cameo companions (like Roy's Dad) played out well.<br /><br />When they change up the cast, I catch a few episodes (recently through means like Netflix), to give it a chance.  If they cannot grab me in 3 episodes, they never will.  Matt Smith and his gang hit the mark and, after the 3rd episode, I instantly ordered all the series that portrayed him as the Doctor (as well as ordered the &#34;day of the doctor&#34; special out in Dec).  They did THAT well.  Never owned any Doctor Who before, but it landed so well, I went all out.<br /><br />That is what I recommend to people that do not know, or are curious about, Doctor Who.  Find a few episodes, on Youtube, Netflix, or whatever.  Each new Doctor is a different taste.  See if any of the land with you.  There are 11 (soon to be 12) different doctors and all are a hit or miss, if you ask me.<br /><br />You might find one you enjoy, or love them all.  But, give it a shot.  The show has been around since the 60's.  It must be doing something right, maybe even something you can get into... if even just for as long as the span of one Doctor.
B002BWP49C|3.0|I like the Twilight Saga.  However, I feel the books are better...not a fan of Kristen Stewart. emotionless, boring and just plain bland. Love the behind the scenes stuff.

B00EEPFRGE|5.0|The most instantly likeable songs on an album since To Hell With The Devil, the best musicianship yet - surpassing even Agaisnt The Law - and even more heavy riffs than the song choices on The Covering.  Sections of this album reminded me of vintage Maiden.  And the production and clarity are great- the separation of the guitars, the mix, the punchiness of Timothy Gaine's melodic bass playing combined with Robert Sweet's drumming.  Michael Sweet's voice sounds better than ever, and both Michael and Oz Fox move seemlessly in and out of the most complex yet intuitive solos since To Hell With The Devil.  Monster album.  Probably their best (and I didn't think they would ever beat Against The Law!)
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app does work on the Kindle so l cannot use it.  I would like to return it.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />I called customer service and they told me how to use this app and it works just fine so I am changing my  opinion here.

B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Many parts of this book and Allie's blog caused me to laugh out loud and made the cats move off my lap so I could make it to the bathroom in time to prevent a dire accident. Also vastly enjoyed seeing and hearing Allie read at Powell's on November 7th. Allie I think that you would probably kick butt doing stand up after watching you do Q&A. Oh...and love the pain chart...even if it isn't in the book.

3527406018|3.0|The present review is not about the book; it is about the Standard Model.  The Standard Model is a patchwork; it is a collection of theories under a single name.  Its best part of is the Electro-Weak synthesis, but recent experiments show that neutrinos have mass.  In the original Eletro-Weak Theory, the Nobel-Prized one, neutrinos ( electron, muon and tauon) were massless.  So, something had to be done to cope with the new facts.  It is easy: the solar neutinos have mass, but the Electro-Weak ones do not have it !!!  One kind of neutrinos is a \\"rotated\\" version of the other.  If you can not detect quarks, no problem: they are confined inside the hadrons; if you try to separate them  you simply create new hadrons.  Standard Model particles are said to have been experimentally found: the six quarks (never found alone) and even a Higgs-like boson, but several physicists are already speaking of a beyond Standard Model Physics.  Well, it seems that there is, still, a lot of work to do to fix the present theory.  Karl Popper criterium for a scientific theory requires that it must be falsefiable: the theory must predict a result  that, if not found, would reject it.  The way the Particle Physics is being done is no longer a scientific one: no matter what result is experimenatlly  found, it will not cause the rejection of the theory.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|It does what it's supposed to do for a great price. My hard drives mount and transfer quickly, so does my Leap Motion (which according to the manual, you're supposed to plug through a hub).
B001TH16DI|5.0|It's like watching these movies all over again because of the hi-def. Sound is awesome too! Live long and Prosper.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|Gotta love this classic!  Brad and Tom at their finest.  Shocking and beautiful.  A must-see, this tale of despair to resolve goes deep.
0316228532|1.0|I didn't like this book. Not because it wasn't Harry Potter--I didn't like this in it's own right! Too many points of view, too long, not enough likeable characters, and damn depressing.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Good sound but there is no &#34;On&#34; light so it is incredibly easy to blast through the battery. Bad design on that end but the sound is good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to this smart and clever series.  The dialogue is witty and creative.  The story line sucked me in immediately and I can not wait for the next season to be available!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like these games they are apostle challenging but they keep the mind going great game good game good game good game good game
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|HEADLINE!<br />Expected it to facilitate bringing video from computer files to television set - You Tube nice, but not enough. What headline?
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|I don't like these games that are just exuses to make you pay more for the actual play of the game.  This is merely a front to get you to pay to play.  I don't mind paid additions if the game itself is great.  This one demands so much of you that it wasn't worth it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I finally read it!  I'd heard about this book for years and it was pretty hyped up, so I had cautiously high expectations for it.  It didn't disappoint.  I see why it's a classic.  I'm so glad I finally dove in.<br /><br />But what's next?  I guess I can go see the movie now.  What about the rest of the series?  Is it as good?  Maybe I should try a few other sci-fi classics I've been putting off.  Neuromancer?  Dune?  Snow Crash?
B00867HDTA|4.0|Fun game.  Yes, it is simple and there isn't much to it, but when you want to just waste some time, it is a fun few minutes.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Aside from the utter ridiculousness of &#34;walking dead&#34;, which I akin to the Democrats and Republicans in America, the show studies human interaction on gut levels we take for granted. Also, the personal dynamics between characters is well cast and well written. Overall, an excellent show to stimulate your dormant will to survive.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Really fun and funny game. Cracks me up when I play it. Adults and children play and enjoy it on my kindle fire.
B00338QENI|3.0|A very interesting look at the cell line, but deals almost more with the family of Ms. Lacks versus the science.<br /><br />Now don’t get me wrong, I think it is horrible that this family lacks any real compensation for what happen to their mother and it is very sad that they live in poverty and can’t afford healthcare.  That being said, I want a book that talks more about the cells, the science, how the cells were used.  This part is roughly 1/3rd of the book with the rest detailing the family and the author learning about the family.<br /><br />If you are looking for a narrative of how a woman meets a family and learns all about it with a little science thrown in, this is it.  If you want the history of the cell line, keep looking.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|And that is how you close a beloved series!  Thank you JLA for putting to shame other YA authors who've attempted to conclude what once started out as great series to only have it end in compete disaster.  Yes, I'm looking at you Veronica Roth.  And you Lauren Kate.  Ally Condie, Lauren Oliver and Lauren DeStefano?  Guilty.  And don't think I've forgotten about you, Suzanne Collins.  You and any other writer out there contemplating a series need to learn from the master that is JLA.  Sensei Armentrout can show you the way- can lead you on the thou shalt not disappoint the fans path.  Congratulations Jennifer!  I don't care what name you write under, just keep doing what you do!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Short Non Spoiler Review:<br />Fast paced, action filled (towards the end), answer fulfilling book.  You will be nervous, you will be mad, you will be devastated.  Prepare yourself. Still read it.<br /><br />Long Spoilerful (I realize this isn't a word) Review:<br />What to the what just happened.  My heart is broken.  I am devastated.  I feel empty.  Why Veronica WHYYY?!?! *Tears and ugly sobbing*<br /><br />Ok so that was what was going through my mind upon finishing Allegiant.  Having been able to think it over for a little while I get why Veronica killed Tris.  Well I get what makes sense to me, whether it's what Veronica was going for I don't know.  It's a dystopian book, things are dark.  It's not a fairytale and although we wish for happily ever after we don't always get it.  Veronica kept it real by killing off Tris, she showed us that sometimes in order to get to the good you have to go through the bad.  I'm not happy Tris died and I can think of all sorts of ways things could have gone so she wouldn't have had to, but its not my story.  Moving on.<br /><br />Up until the end I was very pleased with how the book was going.  It really answered a lot of questions.  In fact the book was mostly informational compared to the action packed Divergent and Insurgent books. It was also different from the first two books because the story was being told from both Tris and Tobias' POVs.  (That should have served as a warning really)  I didn't think I would like it, mostly because I don't go for books told from a male POV, but in my opinion it was nicely done.  Others seem to think the POVs were too similar too each other, basically that Tobias seemed a little feminine, maybe that's why I was ok with it.<br /><br />I was angry with Tris and Tobias pretty much the whole book, ok I was angry mostly at Tobias, for letting their relationship fall apart.  I hated Tobias for not trusting Tris and for making dumb decisions.  Of course he eventually smartens up and the make up(and more possibly).  I think that helps to make me more sad about Tris' death.  They had just gotten back to good and were looking forward to planning their lives together then BAM it gets taken away from them.<br /><br />Overall I don't regret reading this series.  Divergent was my first dystopian book and really is what turned me on to the genre.  That being said, Allegiant really makes me think twice about reading another dystopian.  It really opened my eyes to the fact that authors really hold the power to break your heart and that there is no rule stating they have to make a book end happily.  Looking back I wish I would have waited a little longer to read Allegiant, just so it would have prolonged the sadness.<br /><br />I fell in love with him.  But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me.  I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other.  I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.<br /><br />-Excerpt from Allegian by Veronica Roth<br /><br />*Tears in my eyes*

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It takes a lot to get me  to like a game and candy crush saga did that and tons more
B007T8BYWE|5.0|great game,can be challenging. I am a fan of this type of game. I have several other sets all are equally good.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not really related to the movie more of a study in how the world and governments react to the zombie war.<br />Lots to think about. Stuff i enjoy pondering. More like a Rise and Fall of the third riche history book then a narrative. That makes it more interesting.
B000QCTNIW|5.0|Very well written and organized by a clinical psychiatrist who knows what he's talkin' 'bout.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is about to embark on a teaching career, especially anyone who will work with developmentally disabled children or grade school children with learning disorders.  It is also very informative for &#34;old folks&#34; 'cause it tells us why we never (should never) stop learning.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I'm hooked! This is a great Bingo game.  The best I've found, by far.  It would be nice to win a little more often, but other than that I have no complaints.

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Another amazing album. There aren't many artists who have what it takes to remain relevant for so many years. Some people have their moment, but it takes true talent and dedication to stay for the long run. Get this album.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good quick read and I loved the final chapter.  Would recommend this series. The first book kind of drags, second one is better and third one has a good closure to the series.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|It just never gets old. I dont know how she does it but she hooks me deeper with every book. Jamie and Claire are like no other couple in literature. Their love is so deep it defines the phrase soul mate. This is the best book yet. Cannot wait to start the next one.
B005HSL626|5.0|Awesome! I love this game. I had trouble putting it down. it is amazing how far game have come in 30 years.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Absolutely, love this album.  It rocks!  Michael and crew have outdone themselves again!  This is an awesome follow up to To Hell With The Devil. Thank you so much!
B00C74SHRK|3.0|There are two ways of looking at this book. One, it is an interesting story - with enough twists, turns, surprises and suspense to do someone like Jeffery Archer proud - padded up to nearly 800 pages with a lot of psychological and philosophical stuffing. The other way is to see the story as the scaffolding on which the author builds a profound literary work going deep into the inner lives of its characters and shares her reflections on the meaning of life.<br /><br />Donna Tartt obviously would like us to take the second approach - as is clear from the concluding part, which is a long reflection by Theodore Decker, the main protagonist, on the significance of all that has transpired. She doesn’t, however, lose sight of the importance of the underlying story to hold the reader’s interest and skilfully uses techniques like giving tantalizing glimpses of what is to come to keep the reader plodding through the often rambling psychological detail. There are places in the book where Theo finds himself in a tight corner with no easy way out of it. On the next page, however, we find him getting along with his life quite comfortably a few weeks later and need to read on for another one hundred and fifty pages to know how he got out of that tight corner.<br /><br />Tartt succeeds in holding the reader’s interest enough to let them complete the book. She doesn’t however succeed in using her philosophical reflections and painfully detailed descriptions of people, places and situations to raise the level of the book to a great work of literature. Despite all the details the reader fails to get under the skin of the characters. One doesn’t feel happy and sad, elated and frustrated with them. The philosophical musings also fail to trigger the reader’s own thoughts on the larger questions of life. I am no expert on the art of writing, but I can't help feeling that it would be possible to flesh out the characters and to make the reader feel and think with them with farfewer words.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy I read this book, but I wouldn't rank it among the best I have - despite all the praise it seems to be getting.
B001P4ESGC|4.0|I stumbled upon this series by accident.  I do not watch much prime time TV, so I did not realize this was such a hit with several seasons already complete.  The drama and suspense are fatastic - though I did not like this season quite as much as the first, it was still addictive.  Watching these episodes is like eating potato chips; it is hard to stop after just one.  I love the format -- jumping back and forth in time.  The season begins with the viewer having a little (though a sensational) piece of the puzzle.  Then, just like a legal case/investigation unfolds, so does the rest of the puzzle.  As the flash backs (and flash forwards) get closer and closer together, the puzzle resolves.  I'm not typically a fan of legal drama, but these are great.  I've recommended this series to friends.
B00ESNE696|5.0|So interesting and exciting that I am able to put in hours on my recumbent bike while watching on my iPad
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I found this book difficult to read as it had 3 totally different stories going on which were only tied together by a very thin thread found at the end.  Before even realizing it was coauthored I felt it was written by two different people.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Best show ever!!!! Everyone needs to watch you will laugh your butt off. I hate this is the last season!
B0083Z614S|4.0|A well written children's book for adults. I thoroughly enjoyed it's simple yet in depth characters and it's plot was something we must all think about daily.
B007EC27QM|4.0|This calculator app.  is better than others out there that I've seen so far,,,  and no obscene permissions.  Thanks again guys.
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|it's a good game for kids but slow paced and takes a long time between action. cute graphics but time is spent watching the game then playing the game
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is an awesome movie with a lot of action. It's right up there with the Iron man series, Batman and Avengers plus the fact that Mr. Thor is a hottie.
B00544L9EI|4.0|Fast, potent, freaky and hilarious. Dark, brooding, punchy and downright bizarre. Catchy, wicked and cool. If you dig Em at his most poetic and pumped, this rips.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|What a fun, exciting and entertaining read. This is not my typical genre of fiction, but needless to say a week after finishing this book, I bought and read the next two Jack Reacher books and thoroughly enjoyed them too.
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|Simply one of my favorite movies. Love anything delving into human nature. Johnny Depp, too...need I say more:) A great feel good movie.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My daughter loved this toy. When she wasn't mobile she played with it in the flat position and then she started to get mobile. I swear this toy helped her start walking early. She started at 9 months by walking behind this toy. The wheels should lock but we solved this by chocking them with other toys. Love this toy. She still plays with it!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|The author died tragically trying to cure his buddy's PTSD. That by itself explains what is wrong with this book and the culture it glorifies.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|Arrived quickly! product was as described. I know my husband will love this for Christmas and I was glad to get it at such a great price.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Really puts you inside the failing mind of the developing Azheimer's patient. A beautiful and sad story at the same time, keeps you engaged til the end.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The ending was so abrupt and awful.  I had expected so much more details but there were none.  The Pollyanna in me wanted them to live happily ever after but I felt as if they were so scarred by everything that they just went through the motions of existing and being married.
B002SZAU1Y|3.0|A decent story and different in terms of narration...no twists in the tale but a simple and sweet story.<br />Think the movie is decent enough and if you have seen it you will not miss much
B00BI745AA|5.0|This movie is a great history lesson and teaches us that we should not judge people by just what we see.  We can all do with a little more compassion for each other.  Not for young kids.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Loved this album, and the price for a digital copy is so cheap.  Vampire weekend changes their sound a bit in this album - drawing from some African beats and soulful melodies.  The lyrics are even better than the sound with a very reflective feel ranging from pondering death in Diane Young to questioning the old testament in Yahey.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I hesistated at the cost, but now I'm glad I invested in them!  The Sony MDR7506 is the closest thing to a open studio monitor I've ever found in a set of headphones.  The clarity and definition and presence, solid bass and punch allow me to hear darned much everything in my audio now!  Thanks to Sony, I finally have a $300 dollar pair of studio grade headphones with only an $80 price tag!  I'm also hyper-sensitive to the phasing of headphones.  Many sets I've tried over the years seemed lacking in punch, volume or clarity because they weren't in phase with my eardrums.  Now the Sony MDR7506 has lifted the &#34;audio fog&#34; and the set reveals the true audio tone to me.<br /><br />They work great in front of my AT4040 microphone too, which is ultra sensitive to the presence of the &#34;cans&#34; on your head.  The Sony's are barely audible in the vocal mix.  The only way to do better is step up the price tag about 4 times to get a perfectly sealed ear cup.  But for the money, the Sony's are technically superior to anything else I've tried in the &#34;under $100 dollar&#34; range!  If you're on a budget but want superior cans, get them, you won't be disappointed.  The only beef I have with them is the fold up design.  I could live without that and find it a handling nuisance, but for the performance it's a small quirk to put up with.  I wish the fold out design would &#34;soft lock&#34; so they will stay in position while putting them on.  Then if you wanted to fold them, then you would have to push them together in a certain way so that they go in their nice leatherette carry case.  Nice touch, but since these headphones are in my studio all the time, I'll use the carry pouch for some loose camera stuff in my camera bag.<br /><br />Good value and professional performance is the bottom line here.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love the portal, how it has many challenges which makes it plenty of challenge. No need for annoying or underhanded in game purchases.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love, love, love this app. It's 1 of the main reasons I opted to get a tablet. Use it all the time to read on the go, Bible study in & out of church, online recipes and cook books.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|This game helps my brain get a little nerdy of how smart and intellegent I really am I think this is a really game
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|I really liked this movie.  Brad Pitt does not disappoint; as usual his acting was great. The visual effects were very well done - in my opinion.  If you like creepy action this move is for you.
B004LUS390|4.0|Excelent aplication, I neves has used similar program and didnt have problem to understand and use good results for a begginer
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|A well told story also reveals the horror of WW 1. It use to be any story about a horse or dog was good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|No many thinks to say.... Its candy crush!!! A lot of fun in nice resolution and excelent sound. Good app
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|extremely addictive. much better on kindle's big screen. no problems and no complaints so far. not glitchy at all. awesome!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Posting a review with stars and  my review of this book is actually feeding into the premise of this book... I'm The Circle
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't do these often, and I'm not great at them, but I've spent several enjoyable hours working through these puzzles. I looked for help on line only once. BTW, I'm a grandmother and this is the best dollar ninety nine I've spent.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This an excellent well-written and well-researched book on the history of nuclear weapons and their control since 1945. The book opens with details of an accident at at MInuteman missile silo in Arkansas and the author skillfully weaves in stories of near accidents, mishaps, and the rigidity of war plans over 5 US presidencies. Mr. Schlosser writes of ambiguities in the US policy of control od nuclear weapons, the passing of control among agencies and military and efforts to prevent accidental detonation. . The book was suspenseful enough that it became a quick read on my newly purchased Kindle paperwhite. Highly recommended book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have played this game to the 70 level.  It has been fun some of the time and boring other times.  When it feels like you are trying<br />to cause me to buy lives or other things (which I can't afford) it gets uncomfortable.  I find it is addictive for a while but sometimes not<br />worth the effort.<br />I appreciate your gifting me the opportunity to play what I can.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It is perhaps uninformative to choose 5 stars because I think that ANY King novel ranks 5 stars, when compared to most, if not all, other authors. This time, however, the 5 stars is warranted even when compared to King's other work.<br />Doctor Sleep was a riveting and entertaining story, with just the right touch of nostalgia, and a ample smattering of hair-raising creepiness.<br />As usual, my only criticism of this book is that it was too short.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|One you read his books then watch your world news reveal his stories as shocking. He is always ahead of the game.
B005V5WBFG|2.0|14 Day Trial membership ... didn't realize that's what I was getting.  (last line of the description)  I wouldn't have downloaded it onto my tablet had I seen that.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun game but you have to pay $.99 every time you want to go to another level or get help. At least on an iPad you can't earn rewards.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I enjoy playing games to keep my mind sharp.  This is a great collection with a good number of choices.  Great choice!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Great product! These stickers covered more wall space than we had expected and are very bright and colorful.  Our little daughter loves them!
B00FX8EY60|5.0|Rarely do I buy an entire album anymore.  I usually end up buying just one or two songs.  However, after previewing this album on Amazon, I bought the entire thing.  I love the diversity of the songs on the album.  I can't say that there are any songs on it that I don't like.  Katy Perry did a great job with this album.
B002BVYBC4|5.0|Nothing more to say about The Fast and Furious Movies. This movie adds not only trucks but muscle cars for races.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|The hub works.  No problems with it at all.  Would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a usb 3.0 hub
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It's fun and addicting if you like puzzle and skill games. I think I'm going to beat it about a week or so.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|It's final fantasy at it's best, before it became a preteen melodrama about spiky hair and who had the best summoning spell.  It's towns, and weapons, new armor, and a hack fest against monsters that aren't scaled to your level.  If you are nostalgic about the original NES final fantasy, this is an excellent update and a must have.
1451666179|5.0|Got 3 copies, just in case I needed to find some friends to give them to. Hilarious read - with or without having read her blog.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Not his best work. A little bit thrown together to try and fit the theme, IMHO. Try his other books first
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|Cute cute cute, I'm not sure what else to say beside keep on saying how adorable and cute it is.<br /><br />I want to cuddle this book.<br /><br />On a second thought- I am not familiar with Pusheen, but I loved her!<br />and so many things are true, my cat does them too!<br /><br />Copy was kindly provided by the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review, Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
B0091XICM0|4.0|OK, I am  the sixth, almost seventh decade of life.  This movie, made before I was born, still delivers the goods.  I suppose, that after seeing it so many times in my life, I would tire of it.  Well, not yet... yes, I know the story, the characters, etc... buy I am still amazed at the stop'action (I think they call it) of the-out-of-this-world figures,,, Kong, the dino's, the snake, the mayhem...wow, and a very hot Fay Wray...  this movie still works, at least for me...an Ageless Wonder, unlike me...;-)
0307476464|5.0|I've been led to this masterpiece by his previous novels. What can I say? Nothing.<br />All that is left to say is this with someone who has<br />read IQ84.<br /><br />Me: Did you read this book?<br />Other: Yes, I did.<br />Me: What a book, huh? So Murakami.<br />Other: Yes.<br />Me: Wow. What a masterpiece.<br />Other: Yes.<br /><br />And this is all we can say, it is that magnificent a book.<br />His cat story appeared in the New Yorker  so I felt at home when I came to that story.<br /><br />I see why he was mentioned as a strong contender for this year's Nobel Prize for Literature.<br />This book belongs on my shelf along with his others.
B004I9G486|5.0|Worked immediately on 2012 Jetta Sportwagen.  Plugged iPhone 4S in, started charging, car recognized phone just as before. Identical to factory cable.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|This movie in the series of 6 (which I have not seen) seems to be a little more developed than the others.  They give you some storyline, some sentiment and romance, and the car action as well (even though it seems rather ridiculous to go racing for a car in a foreign country while being chased by police who should know the area well enough to catch them). Never-the-less, I always enjoy looking at Paul Walker, The Rock and Vin Deisel--a triple treat!  Since I have not seen the 6th movie installment yet I would have to say that this is the best of the other four so far.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Like it!  I play checkers while waiting to pick the kids up from school  Even find myself going early just so I can play it.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book is a fascinating revelation of an obscure topic.  It tells the whole story without being intolerable graphic.  Well worth the purchase price.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Does a terrific job.  Cleans as advertises - junk files, temp files, cache.  Also cleans up tasks and has a privacy and an app manager.  It will clearly give you an up to date percentage of remaining device storage.
1451666179|3.0|Brosh excels in her drawing, and I found the book most compelling when I stopped bothering so much with the words, and just skipped to the pictures. I found the writing to be superfluous, overly embellished, self-conscious, unnatural and rather stilted. Brosh has not learned (in writing) to show not tell, and I often thought when I encountered a paragraph that another picture would have done a much better job than words. Because Brosh is so, so good at depicting hilarity, complex emotion, dogs' unique facial expressions and characteristics, and (most enjoyable) the reckless joy of being a child.<br /><br />My favorite pieces were those already found on her blog--the cake story, the dogs adjusting to the move story, and the birthday party/tooth story. I laughed out loud at many (most!) of the pictures in these.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|[...] is the same? what is the point? I dont get it. i dont ne ed an app for that. only useful if you have no browser
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A great way to relax. Some directions concerning the boosters would be nice. It can be a little frustrating on some levels.  Overall it is highly entertaining.
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|This is the first book by Elizabeth Gilbert that I have read. Taken as a whole, a truly wonderful book, beautifully written, even though there were sections of it that I found just a bit off-putting. It is extremely wide-ranging both in subject matter - from biology to spiritualism; locality - from Philadelphia to Tahiti to Amsterdam; and characters - from explorers to missionaries, spiritualists and scientists. Almost inevitably the wide ranging nature of the book will result in some sections appealing more than others. Having said this the various strands eventually come together in a most satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Running through all the varying strands is the continuing theme of Alma Whittaker's quest for the answer to the question of the origin of life and the development of species over the millennia. Alma has a brilliant, questing mind and the advantages of wealth and a huge library. Her passion is the natural world which gradually focusses down on biology. She becomes a world renowned expert in mosses. Her meticulous observations lead her to develop a theory of evolution by natural selection. Although she does not realise until much later, two other great biologist have, almost simultaneously, developed the same theory - Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace (I had never heard of Wallace but now know that he, independently of Darwin, came to the same understanding of species development as did Darwin.)<br /><br />All in all, a brilliantly conceived, beautifully written and thought provoking book. I highly recommend it.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Simply incredible.  Live recordings usually disappoint, but not this one!  I've always been a fan of Joe Bonamassa, but this is a whole new level of passion and talent.  Don't worry about Clapton aging.  Joe will be there to fill the gap for a long, long time.
B00CVPB966|3.0|Due to the many liberties taken and equivocations. During the 1940's ,50's and 60's there was not a large presence of minorities on the police force. And there never would have been a Black and Mexican on a special squad of Police. Mickey Cohen was a lousey Boxer losing the majority of his professional bouts four(4) by knockouts. He was sent to prison for income tax evasion twice. The last time he recieved retribution for one of his murders. he did not kill Dragna. However Dragna made several attempts on Cohen's Life without success On  February 23, 1956, Dragna died of a heart attack in Los Angeles. Street shootouts did not take place thatis a result of recent gangs in Los Angeles.The Real Cohen was nothing like that. A shrewd political calculator and sharp dresser who reportedly did not smoke or drink and held progressive racial views, Cohen endured as a force in L.A. society long after his fictional demise in this movie. These facts have been published and written about for Years. There was a much better story to be told from both sides. The Gangster Squad was a necessary Evil Of the times.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|The graphics are all right, it's pretty cute, and it can be a fun game. But personally, I was disappointed. I was hoping for something similar to FarmVille (Guilty pleasures coming to light), but this game, from the moment you begin, gives you a lot of tasks to do at one time. The farm is already set up and with the amount of things it wants you to do at one time, it's hard to remember what the original goal was. It just felt, to me personally, that I did not have much of a choice in what I could do. It was more like I needed to do whatever was already set up. Which is why I deleted it from my Kindle shortly after downloading it. Maybe other people would enjoy it more, but it's just not the game for me.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful book I found this to be. I was wary at first, never read a book told through a dogs eyes. What a touching story. I cried near the end. Beautiful.
B002KV4NTQ|5.0|It's a 5.00 stones album and one of there best. I own it on vinyl and cd if I have to say more I'm preaching to the choir.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Typical celebrity book. Cute, full of positive energy and advice. Nothing too special, just a fun read if you are need of a good pep talk.
B001NZ3DY6|5.0|All the songs are great I only bye albums just a cheap skate I guess.<br />Love the work she does
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I read it in two sittings, what a page turner. There were times I felt the story was getting a little to repetitive - however it was probably necessary to hold the storyline.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it. Third time I read it and I will read it again. Love love love did I say I love this book?
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What an amazing novel.  It will take me a long time to find another novel that will move me as this one has.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Great game great graphics<br />I do know that they have done good here can't wait till next year for the next version
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Great movie to show that success comes through hard work, persistence and constant improvement. It shows that attention to core activities are more important than fancy tools, offices or other modern life accessories.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|I feel like a piece of my childhood was missing because I hadn't seen this one all the way through, now in my later years I understand. This movie is full of great music, and is a beautifully executed idea. The idea of having worlds where holidays live is so genius, thank you Mr. Burton.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Well written and entertaining. You will find yourself in Alice. This book was an easy read and it kept my interest from cover to cover.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I'm hooked can't wait to get home to play.I get up in the morning get my coffee and get back to it. Can't wait for more .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you like having a sweet fresh games this game is just for you. I highly suggest getting this app and there is nothing to loose, its free
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Absolutely fantastic! I couldn't put ot down. The only sad thing is that the dang sequel is not put yet!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I was really disappointed with this one. It did not stand up to the first at all. Just dragged on and on and never seemed to get anywhere. Took me forever to 'make myself' finish it...and then I felt cheated at the end and stupid for making the effort.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Fun game for kids and adults of any age.  Ignore this part, Amazon requires a minimum word count so done.
B000UD08HW|4.0|Gorgeous music, gorgeous interpetation by one of the best guitarists of all time in my opinion<br />Unfortunately the quality of the picture for a Bluray is far below the one of the music....<br />There are many DVDs with a higher picture quality than this double Bluray.<br />This is the only reason I give only 4 stars.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|We have been playing this on an ipad for some time but just got it for the kindle.  a little slow and hard to see without zooming, but so far so good.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Excellent quality footage from the 70s and 80s.<br />Even the short extras from an old concert has an image quality which is better than some Blurays from our days
B004GJIL34|5.0|This is a great story of man's inhumanity to man. It offers a look into the very soul of power.
B00G9U7R2O|3.0|IT IS A FUNNY MOVIE BUT I DID  NOT LIKE HOW THEY MADE SULLY  IN THIS MOVIE  HE IS NOT  A VERY NICE PERSON AT FIRST BUT I GUESS IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW A PERSON CAN CHANGE AND HOW A PERSON CAN ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS , FUNNY THOUGH CAUSE MIKE HAS NOTHING TO DO HOW HIS CHARACTER IS ON THE MONSTERS INC MOVIE  ON THAT MOVIE HE IS VERY DIFFERENT
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|It was good for a while but now all of a sudden it's crashing every time I try to record something
0307476464|4.0|I very much enjoyed this novel, but it is too long.  The length itself (in paperback it runs to 1157 pages) is not what I object to, rather it is the use of the length--ideas are repeated so often, as are conversations and details, that I found myself skimming and wondering why I had to read the same information again and again.  I also feel like it started out as one book and ended up as another and I really enjoyed the first half of the book much more than the second half--the last three hundred pages in particular didn't seem to move forward intellectually.  This disappointed me.<br /><br />That said, the book is wonderfully imaginative. The best part is in the small anecdotes that various characters relate. I love that Murakami is never predictable and that his characters do not react in predictable ways.  There are many aspects to this novel top make it highly recommendable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This. Game is a very fun  and addicting.  Game to play.  Always a different.  Challenge at. Every level.  Very. Enjoyable.  Would recommend. To my friends
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I really enjoyed this show.  It is very well done.  It keeps your attention at all times.  The music is awesome.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm late to the party but glad I came. Saw the film but never got around to reading the book, till now. An easy and engrossing read- so much so that I read 280 pages of the 370 in a few hours during my transcontinental flight to Ireland! I'm a grown woman probably well outside the age group for whom this is written for, but I loved it. I'm ready to start Catching Fire and see what happens to Katniss and Peeta next!
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Once again, Gary makes the Course (A COURSE IN MIRACLES) crystal clear.  And once again, it rocks your perceptions of &#34;reality&#34;.
B001B9BEF4|5.0|I bought this for Seven Nation Army but this is the album that made me fall in love with the White's.  I wish they hadn't broken up.
B00915G6SU|4.0|I can't imagine me not giving this show a 5 star but here it is a 4 star.  I have always faithfully watched this TV show but I am beginning to pull away from it.  Jeanne Tripplehorn does not seem to fit in.  Doesn't give the feeling the show once had, that the whole group was like a well oiled machine and worked  well  together to solve cases.  Season 8 was good but was still disappointing to me.<br /><br />Seems the scripts are also lacking not the quality they used to be.  I have a feeling  if they don't pick the pace back up  and start providing some outstanding scripts they will be off the air in another year or 2 at the most.<br /><br />This has always been one of my must see shows but now I don't go out of my way to make sure I'm home on Wed. evening to watch it.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|I would love to give this a perfect 5 - and I would, except for the poor quality of the Season 2 DVD.  Amazon made it easy to return, but I would have preferred a replacement of quality product.  Am not sure if I should re-order as it seems from reading reviews that  this is a common problem.<br /><br />Regarding the Series itself - awesome and so addicting.  Cannot wait for Season 4 to begin.<br /><br />Some confusion here as to whether the UK version or the US version has missing scenes.  Looking for a definitive answer.
B000N5F6PG|5.0|It Captured My Heart. At The End Patrick Swayze says Its Amazing The Love You Have Inside you You take it with you. My Heart was so moved a tear or two came to my eyes.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Really love this more in-depth version of a favorite movie.  I will continue to enjoy both this version and the more recent US version with Keira Knightly.
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|Beautiful Movie Heart Warming From Begging to End. You know the expression Time Will Tell. This movie explains it very Well. For Love Truly Conquers All.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I can not get over how incredible this album is...this is one of the best albums I have ever heard, period, and definitely the best one Stryper has EVER put out. And that is no disrespect to the classic Stryper albums, such as Soldiers Under Command, or To Hell With The Devil, which as Michael Sweet will tell you, is the predecessor to this album. The bottom line is these guys are 50 years old and they look and sound better NOW than when they were in their prime!! How is that possible?? This album is heavy, melodic, has killer riffs, blistering guitar solos, trademark Stryper harmony vocals and the even more trade mark high pitched screams of Michael Sweet (yes, he still hits them pitch perfect and with no problem)..it has EVERYTHING! Best songs on the album are the title track, Revelation, Marching Into Battle and Te Amo, but there is really no weak song on here. Even their cover of The Doobie Brothers, &#34;Jesus Is Just Alright With Me&#34; is awesome. Buy this album, and buy it now..you will NOT be disappointed!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Possibly the best story I've ever read.  It's an honor knowing that there are such brave and dedicated Americans like Adam out there. I only wish there were more.  This should be required reading.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like it but I hate the fact that some of them just take too long and you have to buy five moves which are not enough to help you win. If it wasn't for friends sharing lives I would probably delete the game.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good performances, quite violent but they did a good job with that considering the subject matter. I read the book, and the movie did not disappoint the way many book adaptations do.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Such a crazy concept but touching on people vanity is always interesting. I loved how this story played out and how tally grew throughout it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|After waiting so long for this book, I was very disappointed. Without giving out spoilers all I can say is I wish I had not read it as it spoiled the story line and characters for me. The resolution of the big issues was too fast, too easy. It doesn't flow the same as the other books and it feels thrown together, no continuity with the rest of the books. If you love this story avoid this book.<br /><br />I would have preferred to leave it at the end of Insurgent, imagine my own future.<br />I reject your reality and insert my own.<br />Thank you very much.
B00499NHLC|4.0|a bit far-fetched, but then isn't that Sherlock?  I like the interplay between the two main characters, and the way Sherlock's powers of observation are highlighted in the stories.
B008Y5T5ZE|4.0|Johnny Depp and Roman Polanski - great combination.  Depp really pulls off the main character; an introverted rare book appraiser and authenticator.  Polanski's wife, Emmanuelle Seigner, plays a quasi devil character and was clearly the weak link in this film.  The film is adapted from the novel &#34;The Club Dumas&#34;, written by Arturo Perez-Reverte, a very worthwhile read.  Overall, it's a fun Devil/Book mystery.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|3 Stars for this dvd is due to foul language as well as some scenes that were unacceptable to us.  We first saw this movie (A Good Year) on the Sundance Channel...we really liked it...scenery is beautiful as well as the love story. We are appalled with the dvd.  The tv showing left out these particular scenes and language. Therefore, I do not recommend this dvd.  Someday....maybe the film producers/directors will get a clue and leave the smut out...because it just isn't needed.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Well from the very first episode, Kevin Spacey had me, I was watching it on Net Flix and I stopped and purchased it from Amazon because I knew I would want it for my collection. It is definitely a winner. I have one more disc to go and I'm sad because I don't want it to end. It's better than the BBC version. I loved it.......
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Excellent package deal for the Iron man enthusiast. The dvd copy eliminates the headaches of not having a blue ray player.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So annoying but it is very addictive, you play it once and you cant stop its really good, the challenges get better with every round
B00BL9860K|5.0|Once again David Baldacci shows that he is a consummate author of popular thrillers in a page-turning adventure featuring two of his most popular characters, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell - former Secret Service agents turned private investigators. This book will undoubtedly become a pre-Christmas bestseller.<br /><br />King and Maxwell are driving through a storm when they nearly hit a teenage boy, Tyler Wingo, wandering the highway in the dark. They find that he has fled his nearby home after hearing that his father has been killed in Afghanistan. When they take him home it is clear that Tyler is on his own as there is no love lost with his stepmother.<br /><br />Next day Tyler contacts them directly and hires them to find out more about his father's death. He tells them he is concerned because he has been told by the Army that there will be no casket as his father's remains are not recognisable. What Tyler doesn't tell them is that he has received a carefully worded email with a coded message from his father - sent after the time he was said to have been killed.<br /><br />King and Maxwell start to uncover an international incident that begins with the loss of an unknown cargo of 4,800 lbs (what could this be?) in a remote part of Afghanistan and the disappearance of Tyler's father. They discover a cover-up that implicates the Pentagon and even higher and become part of a chase to find Tyler's father, uncover the truth and the conspirators. The chase will put their lives at risk many times and claim many lives before it ends in a deadly showdown .<br /><br />In this book Baldacci explores the special relationship between Sean and Michelle, and Sean's reaction when she was in hospital with serious gunshot wounds from their last adventure. This time Baldacci also introduces us to Sean's ex-wife Dana, in a more than cameo role as the wife of a 2 star General at the Pentagon. He explores Sean and Dana's past life and their relationship when they meet again.<br /><br />One of David Baldacci's great strengths is his ability to create and ring the changes between a number of compelling characters (including The Camel Club, John Puller, and my recent favourite, Will Robie). It is great to see the return of King and Maxwell after a break of a couple of years. Their adventures with the Secret Service and as private investigators have been some of Baldacci's most successful thrillers over the last 10 years.<br /><br />PS. I was browsing next year's pre-orders on Amazon recently and was excited to find that Will Robie (recently featured in \\"The Hit\\") will be back at the end of April 2014 in [[ASIN:B00EHMFC78 The Target]]./>One of David Baldacci's great strengths is his ability to create and ring the changes between a number of compelling characters (including The Camel Club, John Puller, and my recent favourite, Will Robie).

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book as I love all of Stephen King books He has a great mind filled with suspense and horror I can't imagine the masterfull mind of that man. Ever time I start reading on of his books I can't hardly put it down . I look forward to start reading Another one. He is by far my favorate Author.
B00DE76PM8|1.0|Not at all what I was hopeing for. I needed cities of all sizes in the US. Mostly Minnesota towns and cities with easy to read streets and roads.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Linked mine to Facebook so that could have progress I had before plus link to friends. Levels are frustrating, though!! Barely on 30. It states to have all ingredients drop. Fine. Well, would be fine if the ingredients actually dropped!! I'll get 2 out of the three to drop but third never shows in the screen. Run out of moves and only option is to buy more because moves sent to me are inaccessible. Remembering why I stopped playing before!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent writing makes this show a pleasure to watch.  It totally draws you in!  I know why it has been so popular!
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|I love how the kids can interact. It keeps my 2year old grandson busy for awhile. Need more books for free
B00C5R8364|5.0|Lots of very very good action.  Great plot development.  Suspense.  Meaty story.  Strongly recommend.  Forsyth is a master.  Read it.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|The best album these guys have done to date...As good as any of their best work. The musicianship is superb! Well done STRYPER!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game and very addictive.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that you have to pay to move to different levels.  It's also very annoying that you have to wait for long periods to regain lives and continue playing unless you pay.  In other words, it can get quite expensive if you want to play for very long at a time.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|He's certainly has written better. Somewhat far-fetched. Still cannot beat &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; Based on this review I will research the topic before reading another.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It was ok, I know it's sci-fi but they could have done a few things better. I guess if your into zombie stuff it's worth a look.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|The best book by Kate and on top of that one of those rare books i will not forget after a week or two. A must read for all who love exceptional, forget-me-not books. The twist at the end will leave you breathless...
0385351399|3.0|I am a fan .I have read almost all of Dave Eggers books.I think he is an important talent a \\"Heartbreakingly,Staggeringly\\" great writer.That said,I did enjoy this book.It's a great story and it can be very funny<br />and smart.....at times but the he writing itself is not wonderful at all.He can be such a wonderful writer but not this time.I still enjoyed the read for what it was but because it's Eggers it difficult to ignore what it could have been. Not his best.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is a gripping and enjoyable series with complex plots and characters. My family and I are absolutely obsessed. Plus amazon instant video makes it easy to watch and enjoy.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Excellant!! American Horror Story really comes into it's own this season.  Much better planned out than the first season.  Great to watch during a binge viewing (you almost have to.. you're not going to wait for what happens next)

B009G41CG2|5.0|this is a real mind game.  It stimulates the eye/hand coordination and helps keep a person young in mind.  Ist is fun in the process.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good show, interesting drama and likable characters.  A refreshing change to the many different crime/drama shows out there to choose from.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I never got into the Star Trek series, but this movie definitely picked my curiosity so i decided to give it a chance. I loved it. The Graphics were amazing and the storyline was definitely captivating. However, i thought that the ending was a bit anti-climatic.
B00F031X62|5.0|I'll make it short and sweet. We heard all these songs before, Trust me this Hendrix  release is worth your time. This might be my favorite live hendrix. The band is in sync in a loose way. You get the feeling jimi is enjoying himself, I got the feeling I'm right their with jimi on stage or in the front row. Early hendrix yes and this recorded show lets you hear  Jimi young and new,  playing like he had to prove himself, that's what makes this cd  such a special listen. Hey Joe, Foxy lady, Red House along with a couple of blistering  jams make this release one incredible  listening experience. Eddie Kramer did a really awesome job recording this show on May 18th 1968 with the limited technology for the time. Again Bernie Grundman did a great job mastering this release. Oh' and the vinyl is like so cooool... I liked Pop Festival so much I even picked up the new 200 gram double vinyl lp. Great cd/vinyl release a nice classy 24 page booklet with photos and liner notes. This cd/vinyl sounds incredible for  live hendrix, now I have my pick to listen, cd or vinyl?[[ASIN:B00F031WKE Miami Pop Festival (Vinyl)]]
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|How can a long awaited album surprise like this? Stryper can. A must have album for every rock lover. One of the greatest.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Hey, a sort-of old-school King book after many years! I enjoyed this one moderately. It moved along OK at the beginning, picked up speed in the middle, then I hit that classic King can't-put-it-down point about 2/3 thru. Haven't had a King book like that in a while, at least for me.<br /><br />Ending seemed kind of restrained, compared to his late-middle years where the climaxes of the books destroyed the entire building/town/state of Maine. But I suppose after you've pretty much nuked Derry and Castle Rock, well, you better tone it down a notch or two.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Good brain candy. Fun movie for the family and friends to watch together. Nice surprise seeing the Hulk with a sense of humor.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is my third life proof case. And not because they've been defective, but because in upgraded from an iPhone 4S to a 5 and my wife just got a 5 song had to get her a life proof case also. I actually went swimming with my phone in my pocket for an hour without realizing it was in my pocket. When drying off, I realized my phone was in my pocket. I took it out and it worked with no problems. Awesome product and worth the money.
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|I don't know what I expected, it is just ok.  I suppose it might be fun for kids, but I found it to be fairly boring, and after playing once or twice, haven't opened it since.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! Keeps your nails naturally short at all times . Gets your pulse elevated, and it even penetrates your dreams at night:)
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I found it hard to put this one down. I flipped back and forth between rooting for Dorian and despising him.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book in high school an have remembered it to this day and with the movie  Being release felt it would be a great time to reread it.  I would recommend this to anyone that loves a great story and who is open to new ideas.
0545626382|5.0|it great for  movies goner and i could not put the books down. i had to know what next in books
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game!!!!! Full of surprises every level you go on, action in ever level, this game is the best :)
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I loved this series. I also liked the way Sentinel tied everything up in a nice bow. I am sad to see it come to an end, but it's the spirit boat I needed to move on.......kinda. I will think of the characters from time to time, I am already hoping for cameos of Alex, Aiden, and the gang if you decide to give Seth a spin off series. A series where he finds happiness and someone who loves him with everything and, chooses him first since no one ever has, not even his parents. OMG, look at me, I just finished the book and I am already wanting you to create a new series. Please, please, please do a story for Seth, but before you do that, I gotta know what is happening with the Lux series! The way it ended has me a little worried Katy and Bethany.....and soooo excited!!! Oh and I really like how Hunter and Serena's story (obsession) entwines with Daemon and Katy's story (lux Series). More of that please! It is so cool how you have two different series going on at the same time about the same thing from opposite perspectives, and then have the characters meet at times along the way....I think YOU may be a Demigod! I found myself loving Hunter as much (if not more at times) as I do Deamon! Anyway, thx for this ending, it feels completed and I'm looking forward to more!! -tssg
B002EXADG2|5.0|It gets better every time I watch it. One of those rare films where the cast, acting, script, cinematography, and location gel perfectly. A true modern classic.
006202406X|4.0|Part 1: My Short History with Divergent:<br /><br />I guess you can call me a fan of the Divergent series though I’m not quite as enthusiastic about it. Each book has been engrossing enough to keep my attention through to the end so I guess that’s something. I only tried the series out as it was recommended as a good replacement for The Hunger Games. Its definitely no Hunger Games, not even close, but Veronica Roth managed to carve out something great while capitalizing on the success of The Hunger Games. Despite having read the first two, I really had little intention of buying Allegiant until it released as a cheaper, paperback copy. That is, of course, until the large amount of negative reviews started flooding into Amazon. As a result of these Amazon Warrior Whiners’ actions, I accidentally had Allegiant’s ending spoiled for me by some reviewer who blurted out his dislikes without a spoiler warning. Wanting to know more about the ending and why people were so pissed off, I went and bought the ebook version of Allegiant. Here is my review.<br /><br />These following paragraphs will have no spoilers so feel free to read on if you want. I will put a spoiler warning when necessary.<br /><br />Part 2: My Review of Allegiant:<br /><br />I find the story to be just about as appealing as Divergent and Insurgent’s stories, or the little I remember of them anyway. I sold both copies soon after reading them. Having said that, it shares some misgivings with them as well. My big issue with this series seems to be the excessive, with emphasis on EXCESSIVE, use of love scenes between Four and Tris. Yeah, yeah I know they’re supposed to be dating and all, but really? Do we really need to read about them kissing every other page? Really? Maybe its cause I’m a guy and girls like this kind of stuff, I don’t know, but I find myself speed-reading through any passage that overdoes that crap.<br /><br />While first reading Divergent, I remember thinking that the idea of Factions and how each person in each faction was completely and totally committed to their way of life (being honest, being ‘dauntless’, being smart) was kind of stupid, unrealistic and totally against human nature, but Allegiant’s explanation for this was very, very cool.<br /><br />I’m no writing-virtuoso, but I can’t help thinking that some arguments between Tris and other passages in Allegiant  were ‘phoned in’ and sloppily written. Take for instance this; nearing the final conflict, it is revealed that someone very close to Tris volunteered to take part in something extremely dangerous, and despite just being made aware of this fact, 5 minutes later she’s undressing and making sweet YA love with someone. That particular section seemed very rushed. These areas are few and far between. And as you have no doubt heard about already, Roth chose to write this book from two perspectives, Four’s and Tris’. It mostly works out great but I occasionally found myself unable to remember whose perspective I was reading from. This actually happened more than I would’ve liked, but story context usually resolves it so it isn’t really that big of an issue for me.<br /><br />As for the much talked about, infamous ending of the final book of Veronica Roth’s Divergent series goes, I loved it. The way that particular moment played out could have definitely been better written as it felt like too cliche a way to die, but everything that took place afterward was great.<br /><br />Part 3: SPOILER WARNING: The following paragraphs will contain major story spoilers:<br /><br />In case you completely skipped the above warning, these paragraphs WILL contain spoilers:<br /><br />Well, that important character to die was.... Tris. Like I said, I thought the way David killed her was just so extremely cheesy. Even though he has her at gun-point, she runs to input the code, is shot but enters the code, is shot again and then with the last of her strength, she is ableto press the green button. Then we’re treated to a nice vision she has of her mother who takes her up to heaven and blah blah blah. It was just ultra lame. That’s about the only thing I disliked about the ending. As I already said, the rest was awesome and emotional. It was almost as if Roth was trying to make the reader let go of someone precious to them by killing off Tris. After all, we spent two entire books and a large part of Allegiant reading from Tris’ perspective, and so we got to know her very personally, and to just have all of that snuffed out has got to suck and I guess some people just couldn’t handle it. Still though, this is one of the biggest fandom melt-downs I’ve ever seen.<br /><br />As for the complaints of Evelyn’s ‘sudden’ change at the end after Tobias’ ultimatum. I didn’t feel it was sudden at all and there were hints throughout the book that Evelyn cared more for Tobias than leading the Factionless. I thought her turn from Factionless leader to regular person was well-done.<br /><br />I honestly don’t understand why the ending has evoked such a giant negative response from fans. Its not like there was going to be a 4th book so killing off the main character doesn’t really hurt the overall series.to press the green button.

B00DJYJRHG|5.0|A quick, easy, bullet-point review for people wondering what this set actually is:<br /><br />*29 discs (ie all 88 episodes/7 seasons) housed in a \\"double-spindle\\" set (this is the set's biggest flaw, but considering the price point it's certainly not a deal-breaker)<br />*Plastic spindles are fairly sturdy<br />*Nice, solid cardboard box that shouldn't fall apart on you<br />*Cardboard inserts kept the discs from shuffling around during transport, no scratches at all (and yes I checked them all)<br />*As far as I can tell thus far, all the extras from the previous set<br />*One of the greatest TV shows ever<br />*Amazon was selling it for less than $40 at the time I bought it (November '13)<br /><br />So there, I hope that helps anyone on the fence about this.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Liked the book. I could have done without the self conscious and inner goddess.  Overall not a bad read, I just think I'm a little too much of an independent woman to understand the relationship between the two characters.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book!  It's amazing how the families in this story are so entwined.  It kept me wanting to turn the pages to find out how it would end.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is awesome and I love it SOSOSOSO much. Cuddos to RJ Palacio. I even almost cried at the end. This is an amazing story!
B003V4AK8E|4.0|Good feel and position of controls. Left thumb stick tends to stick a little but not bad. Battery last a long time.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Awesome! But I noticed there was an update for A8 with the Renault Clio RS, and more. Well, where is it?
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|A wonderful Christmas story with magic and love. Highly recommend! I start watching this November 1st and it never gets old
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game is very addictive but enjoy trying to solve. I can't wait until I have my 5 chances to play the game
B00E9ZATVW|5.0|I'm sure you all know the wonderful story that Pixar created already, so I'll cut right to the chase and talk solely about the 3D quality and how everything stacks up.<br /><br />When I heard about this releasing in 3D I was beyond excited, so excited in fact that I made one of only a few blind buys I ever partake in when purchasing 3D movies. I've already witnessed firsthand how high quality 3D transferred Disney Pixar animations are, so I was confident. I can officially say with all of the energy I can muster, it is EXCELLENT! Well worth the 2nd dip buy (I already own the 06 DVD and have seen the Blu-ray). I own quite the collection of 3D movies and I feel as though this is at least in my top 6 favorites.<br /><br />3D quality:<br />There are three different forms of 3D, pop-outs, depth, and dimension. This movie pulls off depth and dimension without flaw. It compares directly to the amazing Monsters Inc. transfer that blew me away, sometimes even pulling off an even better 3D image. As soon as Lightning leaves the stadium to head to California, depth is extremely evident. That highway scene will have you in awe the entire time. The image just goes on for miles and miles into your T.V. screen. At one point you see the backdrop of a city at night and it took my breath away. I've never seen an image go so far and accurately into the screen before. I literally felt like I was right there. The amazing depth doesn't stop there either, it's consistent across all scenes, cramped or not, it's there and looks incredibly realistic and breathtaking each time it opens up across the countryside or pans out over the racetracks. Everything looks beautifully dimensional and realistic as ever. Take a look at each individual piece of confetti as it flutters to the ground, each having it's own individual sense of space and size, look at the extra roundness of the front of Lightning McQueen, stare endlessly at each individual fan watching the Piston Cup race, immerse yourself in thenew found beauty that is overlooking the town of Radiator Springs, examine the fine details of anything you can lay your eyes on. It's all very impressive and a step way up past 2D blu-ray quality.<br />The only thing holding the 3D back only slightly is the lack of pop-outs. Originally being designed for 2D well before the 3D content explosion and knowing that Disney Pixar films completely lack that effect to begin with, this came as expected. So, even if you think some scenes have great potential (the massive crash at the beginning) for some pop-outs, completely forget about it. The image almost always stays safely tucked away into the depths of your screen. Every once in a while you'll spot a possible couple of leaves or water droplets exiting your screen slightly, but it's really nothing to completely ogle over. This is really not much of an issue at all in my opinion. I prefer depth over pop-outs any day, depth is always there, pop-outs can only happen every once in a while during any movie.<br />I caught no hints of crosstalk/ghosting on my system viewed with active shutter glasses and any other \\"uglies\\" are kept to a bare minimum if there at all.<br /><br />Video quality:<br />Video quality itself for the 3D and 2D Blu-ray alike are phenomenal. Colors just jump off the screen in a beautiful rainbow of contrast and vibrancy. The animation lends itself extremely well to high-definition. It is definitely the right mix and is very nice and pleasing to look at. It's always a pleasure to state that this is never lost in the least when 3D is on.<br /><br />Audio quality:<br />This is the same great 5.1 audio we've heard from the original 07 Blu-ray. Not too much to comment, but it sounds great coming out of my T.V. I hardly have the setup to take advantage of audio as I favor picture more and spend the money there, so I'm not the best one to ask. All I can say is, \\"sounds excellent!\\"<br /><br />Overall:<br />The 3D rerelease of Cars comes highly recommended by me whether or not you already own the 2D Blu-ray. It boasts amazing 3D visuals that will leave you wanting to take the road trip all over again after reaching your final destination. It ranks right up there as one of the best 3D Blu-ray animations at least. The overall package technically gets a 4.5/5 from me, but I have no problem whatsoever rounding it right up to a 5/5!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is one of the best!!!!!!!!  Great way to pass time &amp; not as messy as a real puzzle
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Gigantic monsters, with equally gigantic human driven mecha.  Hero's saving the day.  Impressive CGI, coupled with an amazing soundtrack... Pure entertainment. What's not to like?!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Good plot and story but the book was also very monotone. Some characters I did not get or like although still a good book that I would recommend
B000W91RUG|1.0|Meh. I don't understand why guys like this show. Well, actually I probably do. The fantasy that any guy, no matter how inept, can get a hot girl.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Danny Torrence meets his equal Abra, and together they are out to stop a group of  life suckers called the True,who pray on children with the shinning. Reading it is awesome from beginning to end.  King is a master  \\" He Rocks\\"
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great follow-up to the first book. Still a little confusing with so many character all over the world but a fantastic stroy. And it's a great way to get the history of the 20th century. Really look forward to the final book in the trilogy.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I love this movie. It's very scary. It's one of the few horror movies that actually scare me. It's also one that I would watch more than once. Daniel Radcliffe is good in this.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I like because it is has a lot of surprises in it.  I like the actors.  All around a good show.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|Not only is it clear that the screenwriter has no understanding of the difference between Elizabethan and Regency English dialogue, but it's also clear that everyone involved in this production (except maybe Morven Christie) holds Austen fans in extreme contempt.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Eminem delivers a lyrically gifted spit on the marshall mathers 2 and I got say that it's a definite must have for em's true fans. It seems like eminem evolved so much more since his first few albums and has chilled out a bit yet still showcases his crazy side on this lp.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|you wont be dissapointed. online and campaign give 5 stars as well as the only game I will ever play. truly amazing.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A finely written novel, which will stay with you a long time.  At times I found it was necessary to set it aside because I would become so enmeshed in his life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use love it on my kindle no need to buy a calculator just download this app you won't regret it..
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I enjoyed it, but would have liked it to be longer and more in depth.  Having read a great deal of recent presidential history, I was able to fill in areas which were less detailed, but overall worth reading.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|Overall the product works as advertised, the problem is that  you are going to loose it.  The design of the belt clip (and the lack of any other accessories) is loose and over time as the case breaks in the tracker will simply fall out and disappear.<br /><br />To add insult to injury if you look for support they do not have a direct customer service number on their website.  I wanted to let someone know and a month later, I get a cursory, mispelled half english customer service response from the manufacturer.  I would strongly advise you get something with a band that won't disappear.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I always enjoy the G5 games. Easy to learn but still enough of a challenge to keep my interest. I am enjoying this one as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first but I still loved the book!!!! I can hardly wait to start the next book!
B00785P2QC|5.0|If you download this game, never will you regret your decision about doing so. With me I think the most fun part about this game is making it to where your city is just awesome.
0670026557|5.0|just so well done and meets my needs for a fresh look at our successes and misses- easy to read and synthesize with my other learnings
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Breakneck action, several interesting subplots and loose ends neatly tied up by books end. Highly recommended to fans of Pendergast and Agosta. Perhaps the most complex novel from Preston & Child to date. I couldn't put it down.
B00FN811SY|5.0|amazing Bible.  Easy to use.  It is so easy to navigate.  So many other features, comparing other translations, footnotes & cross references.
B00FP1NNJY|5.0|Pitbull and Ke$ha could this song get more of a beat to it. I doubt it. love it to death.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is a great game for free! there is so.much stuff you can do, all the while having plenty of fun
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It's a decent book just a bunch of interviews thrown together . You can't develop feelings for any characters good book for .99 cents if it ever drops
6305508550|5.0|Off-center look at 90s office culture.  Ron Livingston excellent as uptight programmer transformed into guerrilla warrior against soulless software company.  Terrific supporting cast including Jennifer Anniston, and Gary Cole as the ultimate passive-aggressive tyrant of a boss.  Funny flick.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|If you are a fan of Neil Gaiman, then you will enjoy this book. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of Neil Gaiman, then you've read similar books to this one before. It follows the formula of &#34;normal person gets dragged into a fantastical world&#34; that he's used often, with a main character that is rather passive, though this doesn't matter because all the characters around the protagonist are so colorful and interesting.<br /><br />This isn't one of Gaiman's best works, which isn't to say that it's bad - again, the book is quite entertaining. Just be aware that if you are new to Gaiman's works I'd recommend starting with something else (Neverhwere, American Gods, Sandman, Fragile Things, Coraline). If you ARE a fan of Gaiman's works you're going to read this book sooner rather then later, so I would just advise you to not go into this expecting his masterpiece.
B003VANOFY|3.0|+ Comfortable after long use.<br />+ The mic is great: Up is off and down is on. It's also flexible so that you can better position it.<br />+ The wireless option is great if you hate the cord bothering you or to get up and grab something<br /><br />- Battery life seems to fade quickly, but the battery itself can be replaced (wish more companies did this)<br />- Construction seems flimsy. Don't rock out to music in these.
B008M9PHWM|2.0|Not Bob Dylan's best.  You have to get use to this album and I just never did....it's like Dylan is out of his element.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is simply amazing. I watch John Green's vlogbrothers on YouTube and his voice perfectly reflects his personality and is incredible how easy it is to understand yet, widens my vocabulary. DFTBA
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I like this movie and I got my daughter into it so I needed to find a dvd for car rides!
B0030MM68O|5.0|Hurt Locker is an amazing movie that brings you into the action and allows you to feel the experiences the solders have experienced while in the war. Hurt Locker may not be too accurate but you get the idea of how dramatic the personal experiences of the war can be.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I purchased season one of the original series when it was first released on DVD back in 2004 and was very pleased with what I received. When I was watching the trailers at the beginning of J.J. Abrams Star Trek Blu-ray from 2010, I saw the trailer for Star Trek TOS on Blu-ray. I was impressed with the apparent upgrade that the trailer showed. Little did I know how much of an improvement the Blu-ray would be over the standard definition of the 2004 release. At first I was hesitant about the CGI changes to the external shots of the ship, planet and space background, but after watching only one episode, I am convinced that the CGI shots are an improvement over the old shots of the model, planet(s) and background. Admittedly, I hedged for two years because I don't really like the artificialness that CGI is. As long as the technology serves the story I'm fine with it, but to use technology first and put story-telling second is lazy and an insult to the viewer (think Disney's Pirates 2 & 3).<br /><br />I digress.<br /><br />All the changes to the special effects serve to make the Star Trek universe as real as possible. The planets look like actual planets rather than just a planet-like disc with a model moving about it. The biggest change I noticed beyond the altering of the special effects is the picture itself. Instead of the graininess that is so apparent in the Columbia House VHS series and the 2004 DVD version, this high-definition version has been painstakingly remastered from the original film with all the damage and dirt repaired and cleaned, frame by frame into a pristine visual orgasm of its former self. Additionally, the Star Trek theme has been re-recorded using the same orchestral set-up and sheet music that Alexander Courage used back in the 1960s right down to the Soprano singing. I can't wait to get seasons two and three and neither should you.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome. If you are a Google fan you will love this. Good HD quality and you can take it wherever you go. Cheapest way to turn your TV into a SmartTv.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this little app has provided me with something to do while confined in bed.  even though it is repetitious it is addictive.
B006QKJQM6|4.0|Great production quality, but not as engaging as the original. Wished for a story that captured a new topic, instead of drawing upon older ideas.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|I like to read the first book in a series to get an insight into the  lead character, then when i read subsequent books, I know how he likes to work to arrive at his conclusion. This book is also a bit of a travelogue for Sydney, and and Australiana.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|I have had this bag for 3 years and after many overseas trips that included stuffing it to capacity some of the blue area stitching started to give out.  This was expected as the zippers were typically pulled very tight.  I really enjoyed the bag and never ending capacity it seems to have so I ordered the same bag again.  There have been some minor changes to the bag including a reduction in size of the small pocket at the top that is perfect for passport, wallet, keys, and anything you need quick access to.  I wish the size of the pocket had remained the same as the old version.  I was disappointed that within a week of receipt of the bag the black plastic rivet covers at the main handle broke.  It was only the black plastic between the rivets which is more aesthetic than anything but I was disappoint that it broke in such a short time.  I checked my old bag and they were still intact.  If that is all that goes wrong then I still love the bag.  I would recommend to anyone that travels a lot and needs to carry more than just your computer.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout in only 25 minutes! The different levels are challenging and the 3 2 1 interval training principle gets results. Nice to have both beginner and more advanced moves to choose from.
0812993292|5.0|I really enjoyed the story. So much so that I have shared it with all my friends and relatives.  A worthwhile read.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great device. Simple and easy to use. Just wish there was more compatibility for other devices. Just compatible with google music, youtube, netflix, and google play
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Great movie. He is such a good actor. Love everything he is in.<br />Don't know why I missed it in the theaters.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|GREAT, GREAT, EPIC, EPIC!! He has done it again!! The older he gets the wiser he gets too!! One of the GREATEST lyricists of all time, a true gift to be able to rhyme and write like he does. Therapeutic way not just for him but for all his fans and even new ones/generation, the lyrics are REAL & not fake/made up movie story lines like other artists out there nowadays. I HIGHLY recommend this album!! One of his greatest accomplishments yet!! BUY IT NOWWWW!!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movie is filled with twist and turns that keep you guessing.  Slowly the facts are revealed.  It's fun flick with a great cast.
B004YXE438|5.0|It's a great game.  I've played it quite alot and have found no glitches.  Very entertaining.  Hard to put down if you like puzzles
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|Let's see... where to start?  I'm first going to rate the aspects of this show on Blu Ray, then I'll get into more details later.  The band's performances are 5*, the sound quality is 5*, the video quality is 5*, the video presentation is 3.5*.<br /><br />First of all, if you are a DT fan, you already own this or have ordered it... enough said.  If you're new to DT or thinking about checking them out, this is by far in my opinion, the best place to start watching them on video.  The setlist for this Blu Ray is 26 songs, including every single song from Dramatic Turn.  It includes a very nice assortment of classics, spanning most of their albums and touching on both their harder and softer stuff alike.  My wife and I saw them on the Dramtic Tour of Events tour for four different shows in 2011-12, and loved every one of them.  Ok, on to more specifics for this show...<br /><br />The band's performances are absolutely top-notch, in my opinion they do not look or sound better in any of their other recorded shows, including Budokan.  Major props to all DT members for being the amazing musicians that they are, their talent and performances are very moving and inspiring.  While my favorite all-time band is admittedly Rush, I will say that you cannot find better musicianship outside of Dream Theater ANYWHERE!  John Myung is his typical amazing self on bass... very quiet and unassuming, shying from the spotlight in spite of his ridiculous chops.  As always, he sees his part as supporting the rest of the band most of the time, and he does it flawlessly.  Jordan Rudess never fails to amaze on the keys, and his stand-alone \\"piano\\" solo will astound you with it's breathtaking beauty.  John Petrucci is an absolute BEAST on guitar as always, and shines especially bright in what has become my favorite guitar solo of his at the end of Breaking All Illusions.  If you haven't seen Mike Mangini on drums for DT yet, you're seriously missing out!  While I was a huge Mike Portnoy fan, I have become an even huger Mike Mangini fan.  His raw talent is unexplainably ridiculous (he is faster with a single hand than plenty of drummers are with both), but his love of his bandmates and sheer joy of playing with them is always apparent and an obvious blessing to the rest of the band after Portnoy's noisy departure 3 years ago.  It is apparent that while they lost a brother in Portnoy, they found a musical soulmate in Mangini and the chemistry is just amazing.  Finally last and NOT least, I must proclaim James LaBrie's vocals to be stronger and more powerful than ever.  His voice has gotten so much stronger over the years, he actually seems to have found the fountain of youth!<br /><br />The sound quality of this Blu Ray recording is also top-notch.  It has crystal clear sound, with excellent high, mid and bass tones.  The microphones seem to have been placed and set near perfectly for all band members, as I feel that both vocals and instrumentation were covered flawlessly.  This seems to be a very hard thing to do, because so many rock (and especially metal) concerts have at least some instrumental distortion; and the vocalist often gets drowned out.  Not here though, James' singing is as I mentioned earlier, very strong, and the mic volume for him is higher than most vocalist's volumes would be which results in actually being able to hear him and understand many of his lyrics... GAH, who'da thunk???<br /><br />The video (picture) quality is equally impressive.  It is 1080p on Blu Ray, and gives you very clear coverage, wherever the cameras chose to be.<br /><br />Now for my single gripe on this presentation, and I admit that it is a matter of personal choice/opinion.  I feel that the director chose to move around too much for most of this concert, with too much camera switching.  Considering that the main setlist at Luna Park is two hours and forty minutes, I feel like more patience should have been exercised in choosing when to switch cameras, allowing theviewer to absorb a little more from a given camera angle before switching to another.  When cameras are switching as quickly as they were in much of this show, I feel a bit unrelaxed and nervous at times.  For reference, Rush's Time Machine 2011 tour on Blu Ray shows much better direction in this area as I felt the camerawork and editing for that show were top-notch.  However in the end, this shortcoming at Luna Park can be overlooked in light of how good all the other aspects are, and is not enough of a gripe to lower the overall 5* rating.<br /><br />In closing, I am thrilled to finally own a copy of such an epic concert performance from a tour that my wife and I so thoroughly enjoyed in person.  DT does not disappoint here in the least, this should be owned by all fans of anything progressive or metal!viewer to absorb a little more from a given camera angle before switching to another.

1250038820|5.0|Stunning photographs, beautiful stories. There is NOTHING about this book that isn't amazing. It's a must have, not just for lovers of the city, but for lovers of people and photography as well.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Great love story without the traditional sappy boring stuff. I would definitely recommend this book to young adults as well as adults.
B00ESCJG1U|5.0|Very easy to use.  great quality.  has all the basics plus a one click fix option.  Great for when you just want to get through a lot of pics and want them to look great as well.  O would recommend this app.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book was awesome and confusing can't wait to read what happens next!!!<br />I would recommend this book to my friends and siblings!
B00G32OMF8|5.0|As long as you know going into it that this movie isn't your typical romantic format, you'll really enjoy it.  Out of the three movies, this one is probably my favorite. It's got fantastic writing and the two leads are great-Ethan Hawke is especially funny in this one
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|This book was silly.  The free thinking, rebellious, iconoclastic,  go-your-own-way Silicon Valley types would not put up with this degree of mind/life control.  This is almost science fiction.  I quit 40% of the way through this book.
B001NHNG64|1.0|1/2 star.  Written for 12 year olds. A huge disappointment. Can't imagine why this author has any following at all
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Probably the best show ever on television, better than Carol Burnett - and that is really something to be better than.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|An excellent album. The songs are tight and really well played. You can tell the band members are possibly perfectionists. Singer has a different singing style and a unique voice.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I was facing my own resistance to write an appropriate review. I was scared of being judged for my lack of eloquence. I wondered whether it was going to be read. Then I pushed forward and say what the heck. I enjoyed the book. It went straight home. Here's my opportunity to ship. So here I go. Thanks keep bringing it..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hallelujah! Now I don't have to take my laptop with me! I can play while I ride down the road.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|This movie's a lot of fun. Love the cast.  Cumberbatch is a great villain in this one, so they fixed that problem from the previous movie.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Wow.  Widely considered the Stones's best album, with what has to be the Stones's best bonus disc.  Great tunes, with a great countryish vibe on many of the songs.  I do agree with Mick, though, that his voice is often buried deep in the mix.  Still, a great purchase.  I won't go into further detail because so many people have talked about this album before, so, there...
075666733X|1.0|This is book is excellent in most respects but does not cover the complete human body.<br />The title may even infringe the Trades Description Act.<br />All illustrations of male genitalia do not show the prepuce.<br />The foreskin is an important part of the male anatomy. It is the natural state of the human penis.<br />Circumcision, other than for therapeutic reasons, should be referred to as genital mutilation as it is for the same operation on females.<br />It has no place in a book on general anatomy.<br />For this reason alone this book cannot be recommended.<br />On consideration I think my 1 star rating is over generous
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Don't let the movie fool you. They should have made a series out of this book. I'll read it again.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was an awesome game. I just wished it would have lasted longer. These are my favorite types of games. I am hoping they will be making more of them. This game is like others in the idea of it, but this game goes far beyond others. It's intriguing, it's difficult at times, it had me stumped a lot but not for too long. Just the perfect amount of everything. My problem was I finished it too fast. Would love to have many more games like this.
B0081KZ20E|5.0|It was fun reading about the '60s and how they got things done without modern technology...  For example, it took over 20 minutes for a phone call to connect?!?!  :-)
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|This program is ok, but I thought it was going to be more like I could write on the surface with my finger and it would convert it to text. that would have been more beneficial for me. Might be just what others want but it did not suit my needs or wants. The program did seem to work, although I was having trouble finding where to save something and then recall it up. I suppose if I played around with it longer I could figure it out, but it just didn't hold my interest.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I loved it!  I couldn't stop watching it and couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  Definitely a good watch.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|This game is very entertaining. My kids love it as well and makes them really think. It can be frustrating at times, but those are the times when I need to remember to &#34;think outside the box&#34; and try something a little out there. That usually works. I like that. There isn't one set way that things will work, you just have to keep trying a little different things here and there.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great book and the Netflix original series was good too! My husband enjoyed the book and I would recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Some times it is less than obvious what one is to do and the order one should do things or if steps are necessary when returning.<br />Generally works well. Disappointed that it does not have a kindle app.
B00AGH7K7I|5.0|One of the best Christmas films of all time. Hilariously funny and heartfelt, Kevin McCallister is the king of New York.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|In general, this book does a terrific job of telling a complicated, growing story about a complicated, growing company. There are no doubt minor errors in timing and recollection, as one would expect from a collation of over 300 interviews on a topic spanning two decades.<br /><br />My main observation is, funnily enough, predicated by Bezos in the prologue. He asks Stone the question &#34;How do you plan to handle the narrative fallacy?&#34;, the idea, he explains, that &#34;humans are biologically inclined to turn complex realities into soothing but oversimplified stories.&#34;<br /><br />It is very easy for corporate biographies to paint the protagonist almost as an evil genius, a visionary so driven towards a goal that they, as a consequence, fail those around them. I think the book is guilty of this in parts, and as such, fell victim to the narrative fallacy.<br /><br />Despite this, it is a story that needed to be told, and an inspirational one at that. Stone should be commended for his efforts, and encouraged to review this work in a few years time. Who knows what Amazon will look like then?
B009AMANBA|5.0|Entertaining and Enlighting<br /><br />A mostly accurate and well portrayed account of this  very important period in our history. Very important
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|The new album by Stryper, 'No More Hell to Pay', is the best of their 30 year career, in my opinion. Previously, my favorite Stryper albums were 1990's 'Against the Law' and 1986's 'To Hell With the Devil', and while I like all of their albums past and recent, 'No More Hell to Pay' just hits all the right notes. It's a hard driving rock/metal record with the catchy hooks and great harmonies Stryper is known for, and it sounds fresh without trying too hard to be \\"modern\\". You also get one mellow song and a great metal version of the Doobie Brothers classic \\"Jesus is Just Alright\\".<br /><br />Lead singer Michael Sweet's voice is still incredible, and I don't think I've heard any of his '80s metal/rock vocalist peers sound anywhere near as good as they've aged.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I give this about a 4 star.  First of all, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed this story.  Not that it was bad, but more like I am a woman nearing my 40's and I liked reading about these teenagers.  It surprised me.  This was my first read by Colleen Hoover and she definitely has a way with words and knows how to tell a story and create characters that you care about and want to know more about.  With that said, I did feel like Sky's history did need to be dealt with more.  I mean, it was great to see Sky and Holder's relationship (although it seemed quite intense for such young \\"kids\\") and how much they were connected, but I wanted to see how Sky dealt with her history a bit more.  Overall, a good book with great writing and I will definitely be back for more of these characters!<br /><br />\\"It's real, Six.  You can't get mad at a real ending.  Some of them are ugly.  It's the fake happily ever afters that should piss you off.\\"  - Sky<br />This line really says it all.  It wasn't a pretty book that had everything tied up in a nice bow, but had some serious issues that were addressed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although I’m not much for sci-fi or survival stories, I got caught up in the story of Katniss and her fight, not only to survive in a brutal world, but to define who she was to become as a person.<br /><br />The story is excellent and the development of characters and the colorfulness of the Capitol are brilliant. Once in the arena, the action is non-stop and it’s hard to put the book down because each chapter ends with a cliffhanger making you want more. The violence however, is a little disturbing and toward the end of The Games becomes more and more graphic as Katniss is desensitized to all that happens around her. The first book can stand alone, but leaves enough of an opening that it’s not a surprise there were other books to follow.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Absolutely love it. Can't put it down. And for the record, I absolutely love Amazon and the products they have. They have never let me down in any purchase I have made. They have a loyal customer in me for as long as they are around. Thank you.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|for all the topics that made me squeamish and the long-winded explanations that made me go cross-eyed, one thing stuck out to me. Yann Martel is a creative genius. I would get bored when Pi was bored floating on the water without much to do or look at. I was squeamish when Pi was apprehensive about trying a new food item such a turtle guts. I was excited when Pi was excited and flew through the pages of him on an island full of lemurs. I was sad and would tear up when he reminisced about his family that had apparently gone down with the boat. And just as Pi was ready to give up on life and die in the ocean, I was thinking “Man, I wish he would hit land soon.”<br /><br />I give Life of Pi 4 stars. It was very well written, but I’m not much of a survivalist and so some pieces of the book were hard to read. I also had a hard time reconciling the fact that Pi professed to be Hindu, Christian, Jew and Muslim with equal devotion to all religions. It seemed a bit blasphemous to me.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|His work is thought provoking and inspirational.  A quick read that makes the reader think.  Worth reading if only to take a moment to think &#34;what if&#34;?
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|This past weekend I chose to watch John Grisham’s The Rainmaker starring Danny DeVito and Matt Damon. A favorite book of mine, I hadn’t actually seen the movie straight through so I thought it would be a good chance for me to see the film version of a classic John Grisham story. This is definitely a 5-star movie and a “plane safe” choice for those wanting to watch something while others are looking over your shoulder.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is so fun to  play because it's candy who does not like candy .it is great.  I would recommend it to other people total:)
B005O7PXNS|5.0|A fantastic show that twists and turns until you don't know what to expect. Especially liked the last episode. Watching Season 5 now!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't watch enough of it.. Great insight into the social values of the upper classes in especially British life in that<br />historical setting.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Inspiring story telling. I just love the banter back and forth between Kate and Castle. It's gonna be hard not to watch all of Season 4 in one sitting.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|but, there are other, better written young adult books, of which &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is one. I thought the general idea was not as well fe
B001K3K5MO|5.0|This movie will always be a favorite of mine. Although not based on a novel, Top Gun is the classic story of the triumph of the underdog.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|This is a very nice kit! The bits are well organized and the case is great. Only complaint is that some of the security bits arent deep enough to accommodate the peg in the middle =/ If this wasnt an issue i would have bought another kit or 2.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This story is a series of fragmented stories that eventually overlap with one another through connections between the main characters of each story. Some of the main characters of the stories are left hanging. For instance, we don’t know what happens to the son of the drug lord or the plastic surgeon’s childhood friend. Some stories don’t seem to fit at first, but keep reading because eventually you’ll see the connection. It’s a complex story, but what family isn’t a little complicated? I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to anyone who enjoys stories about cultural roots or family issues.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a very inspiring novel. I recommend it to everyone. Malala is just the start of the movement for women's education and she has played a significant role in Pakistan.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I give The Hunger Games, 5 stars! It was excellent. The pace of the movie was good, the most pertinent information was covered and it left a bit of a cliff-hanger so we can anticipate the next movie. And fans must agree because this movie had the 3rd best debut in history with $155 million in opening ticket sales according to Fandango.<br /><br />I give The Hunger Games, 5 stars!

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Saw the movie first, read the book second (knew there was a difference goin in)- each has its own merits and there are some minor cross overs (and I mean minor) that make the book and movie have a hint of being tied together- other than that the book is a powerful piece on survivors of war (even if it is a fictional zombie war).
B003TH14H4|5.0|Love it!! I'm more hooked than I was last season. Can't wait to start season 3 and see what else can happen.
B006RXQ800|3.0|It was ok. It was not what I had expected.  I will not likely watch it again. Not my style.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|Cumberbatch and Hall are incredible and deliver truly human (and terribly flawed) characters rather than caricatures.  Not enough &#34;happy&#34; and the ending could have been longer but then, perhaps, it wouldn't resonate as much.
B00F6Y3FKW|4.0|Nearly perfect, their are lyrics missing from some releases but, if you can't understanding what he's<br />saying you probably won't buy this...  Box is big enough to allow easy access to CD's and even add<br />more if you want.<br /> The problem is that Backtracks doesn't seem to get the same re-mastering that the rest of the set got<br />and the extensive notes from Biograph are missing.<br />  Also, if you have every Dylan album you only get one new song &#34;George Jackson&#34;,<br />but if you haven't bought any of the remastered discs it's well worth owning.<br /><br />  I'd gladly buy future sets, preferably a singles box and a Theme Time box.<br />Sony's going to have to pull out something really special to get the Bootleg box to sell.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|A fantastic set of outtakes, live cuts, etc. I love Dylan & if you're a fan, you should pick this up. The sound quality is awesome and there are some wonderful moments on this collection. People bash on this period of Bob's work & I really don't get it... perhaps I myself am in my own &#34;Self Portrait&#34; period albeit without the fame. It's homey music (for a guy likely craving homeyness) & much of its very from the heart - whether its country or folk-blues or rock n' roll. Hell, I'm gonna listen to it tonight... while I paint my masterpiece.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|VERY ADDICTIVE GAME AND FUN TO PLAY FOR ALL AGES...<br />I love it and would recommend it for anyone to play.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Fun game and the grand kids love it too! Like the changes from the original game. Very entertaining. No getting board quickly with this game
B00B22ASUM|2.0|Sweet story, but it could have been condensed down to a short story. Just not all that compelling a read.
B00902AKK4|5.0|you would think there would be bugs because he is a bug but for me there's none at all I love this app!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003B02O14|5.0|Kept you on the edge of your seat.....amazing different ending....not expected. :).  Would recommend to read...can be done in 2-3 days.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl strayed undoubtedly encapsulates a feeling for those who have both lost someone so very dear to them and have also struggled to find themselves in the process. Beautifully written and always honest.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Really like to play the game, it is entertaining and gets potentially more difficult. It engages your brain cells a lot.
B0016JBCJW|3.0|Definitely not my favorite Wes Anderson. The relationship between the brothers didn't appeal to me as much as the relationships between characters in other Anderson films.
0307944689|4.0|I'm happy with my purchase. The book was in perfect conditions and it has a CD Room. I totally recomend it
B002361MLA|5.0|Powerful, deep, life-altering brilliance! I may have highlighted more words than not. Thank you for this reminder of who I truly am. Thanks to my bestie for \\"making\\" me read it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game has great graphics and once you start playing you'll understand why it is one of the best games out there.
B0018OIK0E|4.0|A hilarious commentary, very well done film to the very end. The way in which people exist as zombies within a zombie film, t a semi-spoof on the past and present dilemma in culture, great cast wonderfully done!
006202406X|1.0|There's no word to describe how disappointing I am. I tried so hard to like the book, I even read it twice! But no, there's too many imperfections. Yea I know that books are not suppose to be exactly how I want them  or how we want them. But they shouldn't be this of a disappointment. Some of the main problems that have been circulating in the past books we're like basically overlooked! Like Evelyn wanted to give the death serum so there would be no factions and Tobias is all like \\" I'll love you if you stop being a monster\\" \\"Okay\\" LIKE WTF!The relationship between Tobias and his mom was a problem in the past book! And of all the deaths, Trish had to die!<br /><br />I mean I knew someone was going to die. We all know that Trish has been selfless and would give up her life for people she loves and for what's right. But when Caleb became a traitor, he could have redeemed himself by taking the bullet. Trish didn't have to die. I guess that was my biggest disappointment. I'm not going to lie, I expected a happy ever after. I love romance books and that's what I expected. But this book was a total waste of time and money. Here is some advice for those who havent read it. MAKE UP YOUR OWN ENDING! It's better like that. As for me I'll just wait for the \\"Mortal Instruments City of Heavenly Fire \\" to come out hopefully that is a way better book and perfectly written.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is such a fabulous writer!  She is thrilling and a great cook all in one book!  As usual, she spun the tale with all the technical details that detectives, medical examiners, police and others must use.  If you can't deal with a bit of gore, then don't read it.  But the premise of the story was brilliant.  Bravo Ms. Cornwell!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's got soooooo many different entries I love it. The first of all the best words I think is: A.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was extremely disappointed at the ending.  I hate people who get away with bad things and this is what happened in this book.  I didn't need to get to the very end to find that there was no punishment for this horrible woman.  I suppose the punishment could be that they are now tied together for life, but in my mind, that's just not enough.  I am deleting this from my Kindle.  It doesn't deserve the space.
B00C2IGQBA|4.0|Excellent movie. Keaton is still the best Batman so far. Great job, great story. Other Characters like the Joker were great as well.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|This game would have been fun except that it kept crashing my system. Samsung galaxy 3. I had to remove it. If you fix it I will reload it.
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|I had this apt for 2-3 days and invested about as many hours into it. I was almost the first division champ but all my stuff got erased. IT has a FB link to save your stuff but I like 2 keep my stuff away from my FB stuff.<br />I gave it 2 stars instead of one in hopes that if u do play this link up w your FB and hopefully don't lose your data.
B00EVW013E|1.0|We first saw Olympus Has Fallen... twice.  White House Down wasn't even a cheap copy of OHF.  The acting was marginal, the story line thin and frustrating.  America deserves better than WHD.  Save your time and money and see OHF... twice.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This is terrible I was hoping that I would be able to delete this but I can't :( I give this book a 1 star
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|Amazing story of courage and hope amid a world gone mad. The bravery exhibited by Malala, her Father and her family are inspirational. She reminds us to appreciate the blessings of freedom and a government relatively free of corruption, and to stand up against injustice, hateful intolerance, and ignorance, even when no one else stands with you.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant is my favorite Doctor and Catherine Tate is great companion.  One of the best seasons in the series.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|So, ok, it was funny. Some great lines. Please Bossypants generated great discussion in our book club. We debated what makes a book funny. Is humor different for men and women. Do men really keep jars of pee around in there office! Everyone agreed that Tina's accomplishments were impressive! None of us could imagine sitting down and writing anything the least bit funny, let alone keeping up the hours to run her shows. Our member from Youngstown suggested if she had stopped at the ice cream parlor, Youngstown would have gotten a better rating.<br />And yet, ad the book club fission leader, I was in a quandary. I was out of the Country from 1977 until 2000 and was clueless of the characters she mentioned. It wasn't until Sarah Palin did I even remotely get it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I own each of the Columbo seasons from this box set individually and let me tell you, this is AWESOME.  Columbo is one of the great TV characters of all time, and Peter Falk is simply amazing in this role.  He's so frumpy, and comes across as goofy and clueless to the criminals until they realize he's completely on to them...and it's too late.  The murders that take place at the beginning of each episode are so well set up by each criminal \\"mastermind\\" that it seems unsolvable, until Columbo comes in and unwinds the clues while driving the criminal batty with his constant questions.  My favorite TV series ever, by far.<br /><br />The funny thing is, when I started buying this series a season at a time, my wife couldn't believe I liked Columbo, and even called me a nerd for it.  However, as she started watching them with me, she became just as addicted to them as me and even went out and bought some of the subsequent seasons on her own.  Columbo is just plain amazing.  My highest recommendation!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|What a great move and how quickly we got it.  I use Amazon.com for more and more things.  I've always been completely satisfied with the service!
B000FC130E|5.0|Fantastic story. Gaiman seems capable of writing only stories that are at the top of the literary heap. This is the 4th of his books I have read, and have yet to be disappointed.
B00BQ4NLC8|4.0|Beautifully constructed and believable plot and characters. A terrific book that shows what fate can do to people's lives. Quick but clever ending
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is such a great game I can not even put it down it is that additive I am glad that they finally got it for kindles
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Its a consistent quality program with great writers and a superb cast.  Watch when you have downtime, its a great way to relax.
B000002PCS|5.0|This is a soundtrack you could play anytime, anywhere, with anyone you want to sit back and relax too all day long.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|James use of history and current astro science belief to weave a novel of hate, hope, love and death that most readers expect in a Rollins story. Read and enjoy.
1419853058|5.0|A movie about revolution, tryanny, justice and love. The Guy Fawks mask worn by V, beatuifully played by Hugo Waeving, has become a symbol of revolutionaries around the globe. Truly an inpiring film. One of my all time favorites.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is a pretty darn good for tv show with good acting as this plot allows the actors endless range to explore their ability. Very bloody at times and not for little kids. I have watched 40 or so episodes that continue to twist so you need to pay attention or you are lost.
B008602KQI|5.0|I have seen this movie twice and read the book twice as well. The movie follows the plot of the book fairly well, but the portrayal of Katniss by Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding. The movie does not disappointing.
B006PTNQGU|3.0|Saw this movie years ago and it was nice to see it again.  It is still entertaining.  I rented it for my 4 year old niece and she enjoyed watching the movie .  The movie resembles the cartoon where a young rich boy has an adventure with his dog dollar and his scientist friend.  The scientist creates invention and Richie rich uses them on these adventures.  The movie shows kids that friendship and family is more important money which a nice message for kids these days.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Incredible tale of the difference one life can make. A must read for those who would like to gain perspective on our troubled world.  Maybe there is hope for us after all.
1476747016|5.0|Awesome condition =3 It was so shiny ^ ^ Very satisfied though I wish it was a bit more cheap~
B00AC8ZIXO|5.0|This movie I like, but it was a little slow in getting to the action.  Once the action started, WOW!
B000TENGSA|5.0|The album cover clearly shows Scofield and Metheny's names, do I really have to say more? Well, it says four more words are required so, here it goes. The only question that I could think of before buying is whether or not these two truly meld together in the music to make a great album, or will there be some kind of conflict within the two? Both are unique within the Jazz genre but in their own different way, so I think that it's a valid question without ever hearing the album for myself. I'm glad to say that I have no disappointment with the album and never really expected any. I highly recommend it to anyone that is either a fan of Scofield or Metheny and if you are a fan of both, then you most likely already have it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is another game I like that is similar to the game play of Candy Crush Saga.  You will love to play this game.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This was such a unique book. It was a saga of a family that covered history, science, and the story of a family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and the many sounds it makes while playing it.  This is a game that you will enjoy time after time even if you are not a gamer.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very good read!!! I enjoyed it very much. I love the emotions they have for each other. Love me some Christian Grey!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love to play this game so much fun to play the game!!:);) lol I hope u have fun playing it to have fun!!:);)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It works great, no problems. Woke to music and went to sleep with it to.<br />Easy to use. I recommend it.
0316228532|2.0|Too &#34;verbose&#34; for my taste. I may have stopped reading too quickly, but after about 20-pages, I gave up and started something else.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  It is just like playing it on Facebook and I am addicted to doing that.  Love, love, love!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|One of the best series I have ever seen. Can't wait for the next season to come out. Nothing better than Zombies and popcorn.
B009ME47H2|5.0|Perfect for my needs. Playback with clarity. Easy to use. I use it to record my husband's sermons every week.
B00D6DVSAE|3.0|I was really excited about this album from Sting - I haven't really LOVED anything from him since &#34;Mercury Falling&#34; - yeah there were some good tracks here and there, but still... not a good solid album.  I had heard that this album was written in correlation with a play he helped write.  Unfortunately, it sounds like it.  The songs aren't of the caliber that I expect from Sting, in fact none of the songs really caught my attention.  It's really too bad that he basically molded these songs for the stage instead of just sticking to what he knows best.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|If you are on a diet and easily swayed one way or the other, the sight of sugared sweets may not be appropriate for your begging eyes. This is not a program for a Diabetic.
B00ELE8D4Q|4.0|Yeah, maybe it doesn't cover any new ground.  And yes, maybe it is not as great as Believe, Living Proof  (or even It's A Mans World) - but you cannot deny that some of the songs are pretty great.  It is quite a nice gift from Cher being as she really had no intention of giving us any new recordings.  Honestly, there is not a bad track on the disc, but the tracks that shine are &#34;Womans World&#34;, &#34;Dressed to Kill&#34;, &#34;Red&#34; and &#34;I Hope You Find It&#34; as well as &#34;I Don't Have To Sleep To Dream&#34; on the Deluxe Edition.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product for the price!! It runs very smoothly and is extremely portable! I recommend this product and a great alternative to apple TV!
0812982622|1.0|This book about survival in corrupt and cruel North Korea is called a 'political thriller,' a 'wild ride,' and I was looking forward to reading it. But I could stomach only small sections of it--enough to commend the quality of the writing and the author's imagination, but nothing else. The story is depressing and grueling and I found nothing uplifting about it.  I didn't like the protagonist and found it difficult to sympathize with his ordeals. How fact-based the story is might also be questioned.  This isn't a book I would recommend to anyone unless he finds reading about brutality and torture pleasurable.
B00E9PMML2|5.0|This is great for kids and they will love it. Who dose not like Star Wars! Every movie is exiting and cool.
1781162646|4.0|I definitely enjoyed reading this book, although the &#34;bad guy&#34; was a little bit predictable.  I'd recommend it for somebody looking for a light read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Clever. Compelling. Thanks to Niel for another adventure. He keeps writing. I keep reading.  Enjoy the special fun and the word play.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Rarely does a second game in a series or theme live up to the first. Oftentimes, developers will try to fix what isn't broken. Thankfully, Ironhide managed to avoid this pitfall. Frontiers retains the feel and playstyle of the original, yet builds upon what the first did. There are distinct improvements, especially where the heroes are concerned, and the upgrade system is similar but also adds in a few interesting twists. If you enjoyed the first, you will enjoy Frontiers.
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|It's okay. I would  not pay for any episodes. there not enough story.  Best part of the show  is Zane.  She isn't so contrived.
B00000IQW5|5.0|If aviation is your thing then this movie is for you!<br />Great story line with a great message surrounding by aviation.<br />This is going in my library.
B0026S1XD2|4.0|I've always like Mike Oldfields guitar playing I bought this because I had it on eight track years ago and we all know what happened to that tape.
630471193X|5.0|Great movie!<br />I love John Travolta in this.<br />It brings home so many messages.<br />Love of a person.<br />Your right of how you want to die.<br />And the spirit of the human psyche.<br />Brent Spinner is great as the doctor and I love the &#34;test scene&#34; between Brent and John.<br />A library keeper!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love! This is challenging and fun fun fun. Totally addicting and absolutely fun. Did I say I love this challenging game?
B009GX6SSK|5.0|NCIS never fails to provide intelligent entertainment! There is not one character I don't enjoy watching- hard to pick a favorite!
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Did not download,I guess I ordered the wrong one because it was for a droid and I have kindelfire so dix not receive my game.
B000FC12L4|5.0|I love the trilogy. The story catches you and it won't let you go until you are finished. Starting the third book in a minute
B0043X1FL8|5.0|This Academy Award Level film, based on a true story, provides the highest visual and acoustic quality. The poignant, heartwarming story of how a clinical psychologist, superbly played by Robin Williams, discovers a cure (albeit temporary), to awaken his patients from a frozen, catatonic state that they have been in for decades, brings many a tear to the eyes of the viewer. Especially touching and riveting is the understanding, empathy, and compassion that the doctor shows his first patient whom he treats with an experimental dosage of medication, Leonard Lowe, powerfully played by Robert De Niro. The developing rapport and friendship between the two is an unparalleled hallmark in cinema history. While the doctor opens up a whole new world to Leonard, who knows the real meaning of how to appreciate life, Leonard, ironically in turn, wakes up the doctor from a cocoon of a life, teaching him that life is much more than just work and sleep. In addition, this remarkably insightful patient is the catalyst to awakening the doctor to his own lack of social skills in relationships of the heart. A myriad of wonderful performances by well known stars (Julie Kavner as the case nurse, Anne Meara as Miriam, another patient), by the brilliant actress who plays Leonard Lowe's mother, and many more, only serve to heighten the emotional impact of this gripping drama. The DVD is a must have and must see !
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's work is always so interesting! I start reading - then can't stop. You end up looking at the world anew after reading his work.This book had me riveted too, but I did have one small problem: I wasn't quite sure what the &#34;unifying theme&#34; was. In &#34;Tipping Points&#34; the unifying theme was tipping points, and I could see how that might relate to what I do at work. In this case, although the analysis and stories were interesting, I was less clear at the end on how I could use the ideas. But well worth reading!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All the books are amazing!<br />This is a great series for women and men to read. I hope SO James writes more.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|Very cute!! I love Jhonny Lee Miller. It was better than the movie, incorporated a lot more from the book.
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Good action, great remake of an original. Great cast and the story was a supurbley updated for this time. Brilliant
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love love love this show, and I don't have cable so I'm glad I can watch it on amazon prime!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|This review is for the unrated version.  This was a surprisingly good movie!  Once you realize that the zombie pandemic is a metaphor for anything that can take over humankind very quickly (disease, politics, religion, etc) it become very intriguing.  Edge of your seat action throughout with fantastic effects and some very good acting.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It helped me to understand certain things. I am in a much better space after reading. I am enlightened and enriched.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|Thundering bass. Pounding drums. Scorching solos. Crunchy rhythm guitar. Soaring harmonies. Urgent vocals. Piercing lyrics. Holy Spirit. Sheer perfection. Stryper hasn't recaptured former glory. They have gone to another level of glory. This is what I expect from master musicians working under the aegis of God's Spirit. Thank you Stryper for representing Jesus and blessing so many for so long. This album might be their Magnum Opus.
B0057F869U|5.0|This is absolutely the best film version of the novel I have ever seen. The acting is great and the cinematography is gorgeous.  Truly excellent!
0061900656|5.0|My 3 year old grandson loves this book and wants me to read it to him every night through Skype. He had the whole book memorized within the first week. It makes him feel very special and important being a new big brother.
B00AZNSG0I|3.0|Weak plot, but Henry Cavill manages to earn 2 stars himself. Steer clear of this one unless you are a huge fan of the actor.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|love it,  great show.... can't wait for the next show each week.  I'm addicted and can't stop!  Love it loveit!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I am really enjoying this series. This is normally not the type if books I would read, but a friend recommended them and I love it. Can't wait for the last book to come out.
B00A2H9P98|1.0|Bad Die Hard wanna-be. I don't know what was worse, the plot or acting. I would not waste my time or money on this.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|The show is compelling, engaging, entertaining and has a lot of heart. It's really good TV and well worth watching!!!
B00F031X62|5.0|I figured I'd pick this up as I already had a Barnes & Noble coupon and I'd only be out eleven dollars at worst.  I dare say this may be the best live Hendrix I've heard yet.  It's 1968, so the drugs are still fun at this point, and it's still early enough in the arc of Hendrix' career that he REALLY feels like he has something to prove.  Indeed, this was the first festival at which he was the headliner.  The versions of Hey Joe, Foxy Lady, and Fire are faster and ruder than on some of the later, more ponderous live recordings.  And speaking of ponderous, even Tax Free is more than just a long, loose jam.  Moreover, the sound IMHO is better than many other live Hendrix albums -- the drums and bass are clearly distinct entities, and indeed you can not just hear but FEEL the impact of the bass drum.  Highly recommended.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Excellent, scary...Vera Farmiga is awesome.  I've never been into &#34;horror&#34; movies before but for some reason this one sounded like it had a story arc that would be captivating---and it does!  It has fabulous characters, a good story plot, it's told so well---with pitch-perfect acting and brilliant directing.  More creepy/scary than horror---so that was very nice!<br /><br />The only thing is...there's a story in the story that could also be told.  The couple that comes in to help rid this family of their ghosts has a daughter who seems awfully lonely and vulnerable.  And even though there's a weak &#34;nod&#34; to mother/daughter affection with each having a locket with the picture of the other, the couple actually seem to enjoy the troubled family's children more than their daughter.  I kept expecting that to be a strong subplot.  Unfortunately this weaker aspect turns the locket idea into a kind of predictable device as a tool of the evil spirit.<br /><br />But I enjoyed the film.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Couldn't wait for this to come out!  Down right awesome and powerful lyrics, music, vocals, did I mention the music??!!??  What's not to enjoy?!
B007HJ8V76|5.0|Incredible. So creative and beautiful it was like watching art come alive off the canvas. The acting was passionate and moving.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The Avengers is finally an action movie where adult material is not blindly and purposelessly included, well done. Waiting for the next few movies to come out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest, it's something that I can do just for me. I find things I love and put in my special places. I can collect with out worrying if I have enough room in the house. I don't have to buy a book, ask to borrow, or find someone who knows how. I can just search boards and pin. I love this. I collect at home, at the beach, in bed, any where my heart wants to. Thanks for designing a most wonderful program, easy to start one pin at a time. C.Baker
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|not many people liked it but I did. :) I think I'll go and buy them all. lol. :) :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's extraordinary how this book had my feelings and my mind at the brink... I don't even have the words to describe it, it made laugh, cry , be angry,feel sad an desolated ...it more to the story than a man with a sexual preference (the trauma of his infant and  beginnings of childhood ) it's so deep I can only say I love it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A great movie based on a true story... a real tear-jerker though so be sure to have the tissues handy!
0307476073|5.0|inspiring, motivational, and beautifully written. Hard to put down! She takes you on her journey through the PCT and it feels like you were there.
B00902AKK4|3.0|Well the game is pretty, great responds on my tergra tablet.  However the game its self is super duper hard with a cliff learning curve... Meaning on level 1 there is no way to get both diamonds, and after that I was done, games like this should allow to you get the hang of it before going in to super hard mode...... And a kid would get bored very quickly. I know after three levels, and only getting 2 of 6 diamonds, I was done....so in a nutshell, great looking game, easy to learn, but incredibly difficult.... So pretty or not,  buh buy :-)  Dev take a hint from rovio, make the game fun as heck for the first 5 or 6 levels then add massive challenge.... Games have got to fun first before the user wants more. If it starts at god mode, then most of us will seek elsewhere, regardless of the quality of the app... You only 3 because if looks darn good and I can the effort in this title. Thanks hope you read this.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I lost count Months and Months ago of how many times I played this album. This album is next to MMLP or SSLP which ever you choose. (Except I relapse since that was an accent, still a dope album). This is one of the best Hip-Hop albums I Ever heard in my opinion. There's so much packed into this album and it's amazing. Nothing can stop this man.
1451666179|5.0|I just recently finished reading this book. If you get the opportunity please check it out! Allie Brosh is hysterical and insightful. I absolutely love her blog and the book was brilliant and witty.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|First off want to say that this album is NOT A SEQUEL. Em said himself it's a revisitation if anything. This album is simply astonishing. He literally rapped his ass off, I don't think he can find it. I hear Infinite to Recovery in this whole album with song choices, lyrics, beats etc. and it's mind blowing. If you are newer fan grab the old to catch up with the new because there's some things on here you may not understand. Other then that buy and listen to this album and listen good it's going to take you a long time to catch everything.
B000MD9UJC|2.0|This device did increase the brightness of my mini mag - doubled it I guess, but there was effectively a total loss of the ability to focus the beam. A better bang for the buck is to spring for a new mini mag led (I have one also) . The Mini Mag LED is easily 10x brighter (than incandescent) and focusable. (I returned it)
0062206044|5.0|It's an awesome book. Even though it's for younger people, I enjoyed it and I'm 20. I like the rough edges the side of the paper has and I was perfectly happy with the price.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Very entertaining, from beginning to end.  Great family film.  i really liked the way the family interacted with each other.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great movie kids and adults will love it ! Made us laugh, totally entertaining. So cute to see Mikey little
B00FN811SY|5.0|Beautiful app. It is so nice to have every thing we need in one application. My 8yr old feels it was made just for him. We were so excited and have been anticipating its release. Yay!
1449305172|5.0|This is the book that put theoretical parts of The Lean Startup into practice for me.<br />If The Lean Startup is strategy; this book contains tactical recommendations.<br />Very useful manual to lean product development. Highly recommended.
B005I548B4|2.0|the ending just left me angry its not the happy ending i wanted.. But i still would read any of his books
B009WUBERW|4.0|Good old school fun.  Watch it.  Not as good as the first one but overall good time.  Love the older guys showing how it's done.
1250030951|5.0|You know those books that are so freaking perfect in every possible way that coming up with a review is next to impossible, because your words are never going to do the author's words justice?  Yep.<br /><br />For every book out there that centers on teens using the internet, for every book that thinks teens use atrocious chat speak online, for every book that warns teens that online predators are going to hunt them down and brutally murder them, this book is the one that redeems them all.  This is the actual story of what girls like me did on the internet growing up, the relationships we built, the excitement we felt, the connection we forged with strangers online.  This is the book for all of us who grew up in fandom and loved it there.  This is the truest experience of my teenage years that I've seen reflected in a book.<br /><br />Thanks, Rainbow Rowell, for understanding and appreciating the innumerable value of fandom.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Very easy to use and to organize documents, really has a great optimization feature that will look like the paper really was scanned / photocopied. I use it every week and it has been a great tool.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is addicting and fun, obviously everyone agrees, but it is so dumb that you have to wait so long for lives.  Sure, you can pay 99 cents, but that only gets you 5 lives, which is definitely  not worth it.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|Great metronome app. Has nice loud, piercing sounds to cut through an in-ears mix. It has presets that can be used for practicing purposes (as well as helpful tips for beginner musicians - very nicely done), but I use them for setting a metronome setting for each song in a setlist. You choose the meter / tempo and save the preset under a custom name, then just select it. It was very easy to do so in the middle of a performance. The only thing I wish there was included is a portrait mode. The landscape mode is fine, but being able to view a longer list of the presets would be nice.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I would not order this again.  I rarely use it, cause the chrome/google will not let you stream any content from your phone/computer to your tv.  They have blocked any content other than their own or netflix.  Sad to see google having restrictions on their stuff, but I think the apple/google age will die soon if they keep this going.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|A good watch.  Just wish it lived up to the advertised part of the movie.  Not all great, but overall a good watch.  Rent first to see if this is for you.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have enjoyed playing. No money spent just takes patience. Excited about new rooms and stuff added.very addictive too! All should try it
B007J4T2G8|4.0|it is what it is, good smut. the writing is just ok. the book is entertaining but i guess that is why I read it in the first place
006202406X|5.0|The third and final book in the Divergent series was a good ending to the series. There were a lot of tying up of loose ends. I'm glad we finally found out what was &#34;outside the fence&#34; - which I won't mention here or it would spoil it for those who haven't read it<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, a group of people including Tobias and Tris leave to go outside of the fence to find out what is outside. They learn some very important things about their lives and the lives those inside in the fence.<br />Tris and Tobias go through a lot of issues in their relationship - part of it due to what they discover outside the fence - a reality that stuns them all.<br />There is still the struggle between factions and the factionless, but there are also struggles between those who live outside the fence<br /><br />I feel as if I'm talking in circles - and I guess I am. I can;t accurately describe the book without giving away the plot. I guess you will just have to read it :)
B00157P6AG|4.0|Pretty damn cool....didn't think I could jam to violins but found my head still bangs up and down like my youth when I listen!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I've read all the previous Jack Reacher books.  They are fantastic.  Real<br />escape reading.  Action packed right from the first page.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it gives u enough of everything money and chips to play I can 'll as y it all day
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Amazing<br /><br />Very interesting and not what you thought tin was going to be.  Love the symbolism of the Sharp objects
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|It is fun.  I enjoy having the different patterns to use for playing the game.  Mahjong is one of my favorite games!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show. You must watch all five a seasons. If you like sci-fi type shows this is perfect for you.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I like it but it can become very frustrating to play.  I cannot be too tired when I play it.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Every episode has that wow factor.  I am hooked. From the first episode to the last it's a must watch. I can't wait to watch season 2.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|When this game finally came out for the kindle I had to get it because so many of my friends had it and loved it and were constantly playing it. I was not disappointed :) The game is fun because it's not a usual match 3. It makes you think and I like that. It sucks that you have to buy extra lives or the wait is a while. Other than that, pretty good.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I was bored, but I love horses. Maybe I missed something  that I  can not see in  on the game. I don't know..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ahhh the status of a lot more than a year ago and death penalty for your life and a lot of money and don't want a lot of money and the status bar in your life
B000SEGMAU|5.0|this book is one i find myself going back to time and time again. i take away something new every time i read it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. It depicts different life experiences in Afghanistan. The hardships, the sacrifices which are made based upon love and circumstance. A delightful novel filled with many individual stories.
B005898CFI|5.0|I am a big John Wayne fan and this is one of his best.  Can't recommend it enough!  Though, most of his movies are awesome!
B000MAOLVW|5.0|One of the greatest auto racing movies ever made.  If you have ever driven on a race track you can appreciate the realiziam of this movie.  You can almost feel every turn.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|App worked fine until yesterday after I updated it. Now it hardly opens and doesn't show pictures. Blah can I go back to what I had before?
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Great new music.  Bought this on a whim and wasn't disappointed with any songs.  I would recommend this if you are looking for something easy to listen to.
1416955070|3.0|The story was told like it was being spoken aloud, you could not delve into the story because you couldn't imagine yourself being there and it was not descriptive. It had many similes and overall though it had a good plot it did not feel realistic.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|I bought the Blu-ray box set yesterday and was really impressed with the packaging.  The photo album style DVD case is really unique and visually appealing.  I am taking note of those warnings from other reviewers about scratching the discs when taking them in and out of the case. I have not previously purchased any of the Twilight movies because I wanted them all at once in a box set exactly the way this set comes so I am totally delighted with my purchase. I have watched the first two discs so far and was completely satisfied with the content of the \\"special features\\" of Twilight so I am confident the rest of the \\"special features\\" will be just as good. Although I have watched all of the movies at the theatre, it will be very nice to watch them back-to-back. Since I bought this set on its release date, the price I paid was very reasonable which makes the purchase that much sweeter.  Enjoy!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|While I felt it was awkward at first how the POV changed between Tris and Four and I wasn't happy with the outcome (I don't want to spoil it although others already have - I'll let them spoil it for you), I can't imagine how else to end this book. The changing POV is necessary so we can better understand how the main characters process their thoughts and to further tell the story... without that changing POV throughout the book, the ending would be very awkward. Of course, a happy ending is always desirable, but anyone who has read the other two books knows that a happy ending isn't in store for this book. I still walked away with a warm feeling in my heart, but at the same time I am left wondering what happens to the remaining characters. I would love it if Ms. Roth could write an alternate ending to the book that doesn't involve the loss of such a dominant character, one that gives us that happy ending we crave. I loved this series enough and was so saddened when it ended (not b/c of how it ended, but b/c my time with the characters was over) that I ordered the other 5 supplemental books. I can't get enough of Tris and Four and I absolutely cannot wait to see the movie (especially considering who they cast as Four!) Thank you for a captivating, keep-me-up-way-past-bedtime read that I just could not put down.
B00G32OER4|2.0|Rented this for my 13yo. She was expecting it to be scarier.  Not that scary, compared to other movies of its kind. Not really worth the money.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Great read. Laugh out loud! it is a very insightful book. It peers into the life of an adult who has high functioning Asperger's. Definitely worth a read.
044024613X|5.0|This is a fascinating story. It resonates with every parent...a thinking man's book. I highly recommend it to parents as well as others. I couldn't put it down.
B00846REIS|2.0|I was happy with this book at the start but a specific scene that happens in chapter 21 of this story really made me sick to my stomach, is not realistic at all, and makes you question the sanity of both main characters. I do not think I will read the rest of the series. I don't get why people like this series.
0446547638|5.0|This is exactly what you would expect from this author. A typical love story with an ending that leaves you satisfied. It's the journey that these two embark upon that has you rooting for them.
B00B1ME11U|5.0|Going back to the roots of rock & roll. Clutch hit the nail right on the head. From fast pace songs like Crucial Velocity to slower paced songs like Gone Cold. It has everything not only a Clutch fan would like but anyone who loves Rock!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great film, the acting was good. It shows how one can be incarcerated by personnel addictions. Yet at the end, as you'll see in the end, Whip is set free. Great flick.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was laugh out loud giggle to yourself delight. A supremely satisfying, summer beach read. I can hardly wait to read it again. The type of book you want to read aloud to someone so you can share the fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow, this game has everything, gorgeous graphics, intelligent puzzles, and a bonus &quot;epilogue &quot; game. I only wish there was more. Super fun, if this game expands I will be the first on board. Well worth the price. I play on Kindle Fire 1 and the game play was flawless.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Had this video on VHS years ago and I would highly recommend this to everyone, it is a mezmorizing video that helps give the viewer a greater appreciation for the earth and all the people on it.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I found this movie enjoyable in a &#34;Men in Black&#34; sort of way. A fun weekend watch. The special effects were good.
B008MM9630|5.0|For once I actually enjoy a good fairy/gardening game. The game itself is addicting with its awesome graphics and cute little animations. I find it to be a relaxing fun game anyone would be proud to play
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I will not work at all. So use desktop after all and I think rather a waste of money to buy something to carry for handy use and can't use.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to set up and use! Will purchase  several more for the other tv's in the home. Awesome product.
6305428387|5.0|I been looking for this movie since I went in mexico specially to buy for my cousin & we liked
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game.....very addicting though. Only thing is that you get stuck on some levels too long. I have been stuck for 2 months on level 125.
B00EO10M54|5.0|So, I waited a while before getting this because I, like many others think Miley has simply been doing WAY too much lately. I finally gave in though, and boy am I glad I did! This album is amazing!While I really wish this talented young girl would stop trying so hard to get attention in every way possible, her music really stands on its own. Yes, there are some silly songs on here that make you think \\"What the heck am I listening to?\\" at first listen, but even they are enjoyable and fun if you let them be. Other songs on here are off the charts fantastic like \\"Someone Else\\", \\"Drive\\", and \\"Wrecking Ball\\". Miley has a fantastic voice and while I still firmly think she is absolutely ridiculous, this album both shocked and awed me. Guess she is doing something right.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Have been a Stryper fan for 30 years and have a music library to show but No More Hell To Pay is the best Stryper music in my library! Their other stuff is great, the new stuff is AWESOME! This is a must own album for not just Stryper fans but rock fans. For me, it stirred my spirit up like Christian music hasn't been able to since Yellow and Black Attack. Congrats guys, you got a winner! May God continue to breath on your music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy this finally came out for Kindle. When people say it is addicting, they are not kidding! Thank God for only being allowed so many lives over a certain period of time because if not I think I'd never stop. It does stink that you can only go so far without linking it to your Facebook and asking for help, paying for the levels, or waiting to do quests. They know what they are doing because I went ahead and paid to unlock the next levels, a few times, and I don't usually spend money on games or apps at all. I'm hooked!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Oh my gosh, this series is fantastic. Addicting. Well-cast, great directing, and everything gels. Not too often do you get a perfect cast; Breaking Bad characters are all viable, believable and you think, which one could be taken out of the show? None of them... each character adds to this series. Bought this as a gift for my step-father, can't wait to give it to him. And, for each holiday and birthday will add the next season.<br /><br />Fun to find a clever, well-acted, well-written series that moves along fast. Excellent.
B003H4I4JU|1.0|The first book in the series was great. This story sucked. I am sorry it was long drawn out and an absolute bore. I am unsure if I will continue the series after this book. The piggies the tree who cares. Is this really where the speaker of the dead lands. I do not understand how an author can come of such a high to make such a boring book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Fast and simple. With Kindle on my Android makes for easy on the go reading enjoyment. Highly recommend the app.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|One of my all time favorite movie series. I only wish the final installment was included. The box set is beautiful and I have watched first blood too many times.
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|When It fails I have to reload this app from the internet store. I do not always have an Internet connection available so when the app fails I have to wait until I can downloaded again to make it work.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  I've seen most of the recent horror movies, and most give you a few jumps, might not even set the mood properly or sustained.  The Conjuring did a great job at building the tension, not making it seem too unrealistic, and maintained that sense of dread and anticipation.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|This app does not make sense - why do you need a google email app when the email app on the kindle does the same thing in a better format?
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|4 Stars because it works so well with Netflix, which is 75% why I bought it.  I was hoping for a better experience with the Chrome browser, and it's taking longer for more apps to be added than I would have expected.  Hopefully it will be at 5 star levels soon.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very addictive i could hardly put it down the day I downloaded it. now i make sure I have free time to play it. This game has great graphics and is easy to play yet challenging.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|My kids loved it and watched it 3 times before the rental expired. I don't think I need to say much more.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|This is a useful product for our family because the kids can charge their ipods while I charge my phone or android tablet.  It saves the fight over the charger.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|BARBARA EDEN! You need only to see 10 seconds of her, and you are hooked. Oh yes, there's a pre-boozed up Hagman, showing off his comedic talents, and a ready-for-game-show career Bill Daly. The best scene, IMHO, in the whole series is stolen by guest star Paul Lynde and Hayden Rorke. Those two have a scene in Dr. Bellow's office where Lynde, as a &#34;Horrible little tax man,&#34; grilles Rorke. I have to replay that scene every time I watch the episode.<br />It is a classic series because it is funny!<br />Look for Michael Ansara, late of Lost In Space, who was Eden's real life husband, and Don Rickles.<br />Lynde should have been a regular, as he stole so many scenes.
B00DWFQ2N4|1.0|Greatly disappointed! It is messy and quite hideous. I wish I could send it back for a refund.  I have been a loyal fan, but am not buying another JT album unless I've been able to sample it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I use this all the time and like it.  I have some problems with closing out things I don't want to see and not that it's bad just not what I want on my wall.  So I don't want to file any complaints and it won't let me hid these things.  Also it keeps telling me to up date and when I try it tells me to use my google log in.  I don't have a google log in, and it won't let me log in under the my FB log in.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game. It is addictive. The only negative I would have about it is, you have to depend on you face book friends and I did not want to go on face book. The only way to get around that is just to play the games up to where you have to call for help. I would suggest this app to anyone. I have it on my Kindle Fire and my IPAD. My daughter has it on her IPHONE.
B009C7JS14|3.0|I don't use this much but am satisfied with the convenience of just looking on my Kindle Fire HD.  So I really don't have much to say.
B0013ARLRQ|5.0|Another thoughtful album from Jay and his merry band that just wants to make you move and groove. I find myself humming the songs and of course 7 days is one of my all time favorites- I also highly recommend you watch the video which reinforces Kay's star/ humble appeal.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It isn't as fun as I though it would be on a kindle.  It seems to move slower than it would on the computer.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Arthur Darvill are the best Doctor Who team. This was one of the best seasons ever! I was sad when Karen and Arthur left and am even more sad that Matt Smith will soon be leaving. The 11th Doctor is my favorite.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Good and entertaining with plot twist. Seeing good guys in bad guy roles was a stretch though. Overall it held my interest.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a really great workout that doesnt take a lot of time. I tend to get really bored with workouts that are long but this one is short and effective which is exactly what Im looking for as someone who works full time and has a family!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Good family movie but not sure its one that the kids would want to watch over and over.  Pretty simple story line.
B00F9A903O|5.0|Much better than farmville. However do not like how you have to figure alot out by your self. Could use more helps. Also store fills up way to quick!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book was well written and the twists kept the readers' interest.  The Orphan Master's son  was well  equipped by his experiences to survive the pain, deceptions and challenges he faced as his life progressed from one impossible situation to the next.  This book will not let you lose interest or stop reading before you complete it.  While exploring the brutality in his life, it also reveals his compassion and understanding of the human spirit.  It is worth your time whether or not the depiction of North Korea is accurate.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|For all Columbo fans out there who haven't purchased the individual sets, this is an amazing bargain.  I was an early adopter, snapping up the sets as they came out, including the movie series, and ultimately paid a lot more.  If you love Columbo and don't have most of these, you'll kick yourself if you don't jump on this now.  Probably the only reason it hasn't sold out is many of us have all of the series.  It's such a good deal, I'm trying to convince myself to buy it as a gift for someone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite book and this is my third time reading it. I can't get over how amazing the secrets and new things I notice every page. This is just amazing!
B00BAXFECK|3.0|First let me say that I loved her discriptions - of people, art, antiques. The author has an eye for detail-my imagination was given wings with her writing. The big problem for me is that I couldn't get over the first person narration. I just couldn't get past the maurity of the writing - coming from our teenage boy protagonist brain. The beginning was so promising and I loved the overarching themes of guilt, secrets, and loss. Heavy topics, but couldn't a girl have told the story? I lost interest by the second/third of the book and skimmed the rest.  Could be that my expectations were way too high. I am also getting annoyed with female authors who write male protagonists.  Really? Yes, that was so disappointing.  My daughter was told by Rick Riordan that he writes boy heros so that boys will read the books, because everyone knows that girls will not let a boy hero stop them.  I hadn't noticed that before.  Now I am really tired of it.  Seriously.
B002OUT604|5.0|Absolutely entertaining every minute.  Lines and characters worth memorizing.  One of my truly favorite movies of all time.  Non stop action and laughs.
B00E3QJ7ZG|5.0|Aw man...What a cool thing to have my favorite Clint Eastwood Western on restored Hi-Def! If you like Clint...you'll love this!
B009NX1YT6|5.0|Unfogotten movie, Travolta is amazingly bright actor. Love all scenes especially racing.<br />Till now i think this is his best part.<br />Generaly it is very good movie to remember school time.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|First, it was delivered within the time I expected; and secondly, the movies I have watched so far have been of very good quality.  Third, this is one of my favorite characters, and I enjoy watching him very gently and manipulatively get the guilty party to confess.
B00F8MIIKO|3.0|meh. The kids became bored halfway through after the first viewing and went upstairs to play. Don't buy it. Just rent it for the night.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Not only is this movie becoming a Holiday staple, but I purchased this during a &#34;Lightning Deal&#34;! Cannot wait to watch it during the Christmas season.<br /><br />This movie puts you into the holiday spirit. It has something for everyone, every age!
B003M70O5O|5.0|A well written show, very few slow parts and you just never know what direction the episode will end up.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Excellent record. This is how the big boys do it !!! Record labels need to have more bands that do this quality of work, regardless of the trends/fashions. This is what kids/adults need to be influenced by. Go and see this band live and tell me they aren't great or relevant. This is the comeback record of the year!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|One of the best movies ever! Love it beyond funny great jokes seriously a great movie if you get the jokes!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome!I like that it updates frequently with new places and themes.I am 11 years old and love this game!
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|I have enjoyed this app very much. I haven't stopped playing it since I downloaded it.  The only advice I would give someone new to the game is to hang on two those gems as long as you can.  Some levels are very difficult and I haven't been able to get past those without purchasing items from the magic shop.  I haven't used any real money but you will need to spend those gems at some point so hang on to them as long as possible.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I LOVE THIS GAME.It is really cool  and it's free.The graphics are amazing,and very realistic.The only reason I did not give this game 5 stars is because it cost a lot of coins and even gems for some things.I am also11 years old so I do not know how an adult would rate this and I recommend that you check some other review s first before installing this game.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Watch it if you like over the top slow motion violence.  An overall depressing movie with no redeeming value except that it ends.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Love it! Sweet, classic story, perfect casting, and fun music. I thought I had seen this one before but was pleasantly surprised when I watched it that I hadn't seen it before. Highly recommended classic.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|A great book. I'm a huge fan of the film adaptation of this book and it was fun playing out the scenes from the  movie in your head while you read. I liked the epilogue about the author. Gives you some insight to how the book was written.
B00271DNP4|5.0|Love the Harry Potter movies. I didn't read the books but enjoy the movies. We have almost all the DVDs and this will complete the set.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is an enthralling story, I don't especially care for the sexually explicit parts the rest of the story is great am looking forward to more of the story
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Great book, a very fast read. You feel like you're there. War is romantic only to those who've never experienced war. A debt of gratitude to the Old Breed.
0385339100|5.0|When I read this book a while ago, I loved it!  I purchased it as a gift for my attorney, who will soon be promoted to partner. :) I hope he likes it.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Great to be able to go back a few minutes as the plot twists are enough to give you whiplash! Great show and the guys are just so sexy!! ;)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|After watching the HBO series, I decided to download the novels onto my Kindle. I am only a few chapters into the novel, but so far, I am very impress! Although AGOT is a lengthy novel, the chapters are of reasonable length, and each page holds my interests. It is very enticing and I find myself fighting the clock (and my hectic schedule) for more reading time. You won't regret this purchase!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is an amazing show. I wish they would come back for a second season. I recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B004R1Q296|5.0|Extremely well written, and remarkably insightful.  Every teacher and aficionado of history should have and read this book. I found so many parallels in today's current events.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wish I could just click the stars and skip the words. Gotta get back to crushing confections and those dastardly jelly.
B00A4VGUIG|5.0|love  this game, you get to take care of dolphins, and feed them also alot of other things. I do recommend this game.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|The game is excellent!! The graphics are great gameplay is easy and another hit from Fire Maple Games!! Well worth the .99¢
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This is a good movie that I recomend to all people to watch. I really love all the suits flying around scene
B00A8ECU24|5.0|awesome just too awesome for words to describe just how much awesome is packed into this game!......there is not much more I can say just that if you like my littel pony and the Sims, then you so need this game.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Good story and comic delivery. Fantasy story, offers a futuristic look at after death experience.  Did what movie is supposed to do-took me away for 2 hours!
B00F91SCXC|1.0|So boring! We were glad it was only $.99 to rent it! It was very predictable....thank goodness Brad Pitt was in it....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The novel takes up the story of Dan Torrence from &#34;The Shining&#34; as an adult. It is vintage Stephen King. It has all the elements of the Stephen King we've seen in earlier book, terrific story and the depiction of terror in children which King does better than everyone else in the genre. The best novel by him in a very long time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is poorly written. The story could not hold my attention and the whole attraction is just the sex scenes. I don't understand the fanfare associated with this book!
B000002UA7|1.0|Arrived with a large scratch on it.  :/  Right in the middle of the best songs.  I can't fix it, though I've tried.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Just what I was looking for to raise the volume to headphones from my computers!  Can get plenty loud yet adjustable volume to suit your preference.  I don't use the EQ much but at least there are choices.  I am VERY happy I purchased this, especially with it coming with all cords required to recharge it and hook up easily.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|This was an excellent and entertaining movie.  Before this, I didn't know anything about Liberace except that he was a piano player.  I remember seeing his posters all over Vegas promoting the Liberace Museum.  It was before my time and not the kind of music I listen to or followed.  I remember thinking he looked or seemed unusual when I'd see pictures around in the media growing up.  Other than that, I knew nothing about him.  This movie paints an interesting portrait of his personal life which is that he was gay and did not hide that fact except professionally and to the world.  In a sense, I wonder if he was portrayed in the greatest light.  The movie focuses mostly on his long term turbulent love affair with a much younger guy.  He courts him in the same way older men with money court younger women.  Although, he and this guy do have a connection that lasts indefinitely.  What made this movie entertaining and so good were really the performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.  They were both incredible and assumed these two people that you couldn't help but be mesmerized.  This Liberace guy was a very interesting and odd person.  Definitely worth seeing if you're open minded.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|The new album is awesome.I can't stop listening to it. Can't wait to see them live.  Keep on rocking stryper
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it!!!  So addictive!! When I start to play, I never know when I 'm gonna be able to stop!!!!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I was so looking forward to reading tonight and disappointed to find out its over<br /><br />I can't wait for the sequel<br /><br />one of the best books I've ever red
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|One of the best products ever, but the full PRO version is even better with it's ability to actually create and edit..
B00BD99JMW|3.0|When I received the book, I stayed away from all reviews, posts, blogs, and fanfare because I wanted to have a truly honest read.  After finishing the trilogy I can say that this was the weakest book of the three.  I LOVED Divergent and found Insurgent THRILLING, and I wanted the same experience with Allegiant.  I'm afraid that I am coming away from Allegiant with the feeling of underwhelmed.  Here are some reasons why:<br /><br />1- It took a while to get used to the different chapter POVs.  Since the other books did not use this style, I had to keep referring back to which character voice I was reading from.<br />2- The plot seemed to drag out for too long and lose momentum as the book reaches its climax. That was the biggest problem.<br />3- The bases for the factions was weakly thought out- I mean REALLY????<br /><br />I am going to give Veronica Roth the benefit of the doubt and re-read it again in another month and see if my opinion changes.  I think that she has a purpose for ending the trilogy the way she does and I will read the Four Short Stories to be released early next year.  I am a Divergent fan and I have enjoyed the overall ride.<br /><br />Maybe the reactions all of us are having are because we are so invested and care so much about these characters.  There may have been no way to end it and please all of us.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Although more disjointed than most of the series by necessity, Sanderson does a masterful job of weaving the multiple story lines of the saga to a gripping and desperate conclusion.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|I have been counting the days until this release after hearing an early preview of Bonfire Heart.  I was not disappointed.  If you are a James Blunt fan you need to add this album to your collection.  I think it's the best one yet!<br />This music makes me SMILE...........
B001JYIZVW|5.0|The whole family enjoyed both these movies. My three year old granddaughter watched Jumanji three or four times the weekend we got it. I sent The Indian in the Cupboard DVD home with them and they watched it several times. Great movie for kids and adults alike!!!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Love love love love this new album! Every song is fantastic.Eminem is truly a rap god in which no other compares!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|everyone should read this book at least once. I can't wait to see the movie & while I know it could never be as good as the book I'm happy more people will have a chance to hear liesel's story & hopefully learn from it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is so addictive and I love to play the game; however, I do believe it is ridiculous to have a person stay on a level for weeks because the level is so hard to win. I know a lot have stopped playing because of this reason and I'm thinking about finding another game for the same reason. Staying on a level for more than two or three days is crazy and makes playing the game not fun.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works fantastic in areas of good wifi reception.  Drops out if signal is week.  It is a good product at a good price
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|It was entertaining but not as funny or endearing as the first one in the series. This book is just light reading but you dont really get into the charactor enough perhaps because of thr first book.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Yes, the universe works the way the author describes. No, it is rare that we can test it and demand results. While the background is valid, I have serious doubts about how people will react when their demands on the Universe (prayers to God) aren't answered the way they want and within the time frame they establish. Arrogance at its highest.
0307476073|1.0|A labor, if not a painful read, especially when you begin to sense that the book missed the mark, not by a little, but by a lot.  The author is unsympathetic and in all likelihood, a challenge for people that actually read books to relate to.  Her obsession with her history of drug use, infidelity, indulgent behavior and bad decision making go completely unresolved.  It is the absence of any meaningful resolution that was the most disappointing.  Doesn't Lost to Found imply an evolution in a person's mindset, behavior, understanding of purpose?<br /><br />I was left with the impression that she would continue her life after the PCT as she had prior to the PCT, aimless, inconsiderate and self indulgent.  In other words, still Lost.  I finished feeling discouraged and wondering if we should all rationalize our worst decisions and acts to the point where we are free to repeat them over and over again.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|Paul Simon does it again- beauitful melodies coupled  with thoughtful , sometimes poignant lyrics.  Oh- and a sense of humor!<br />  Can you live without music? Certainly. Will  your life be as rich ? Never.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Rip roaring FUN! I'd have watched this group of characters for years had they kept going. A great spin on the future.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I decided to buy this when I was bored and sick in bed and I played it for 4 hours that day. It's a great game and its not super easy. It's hard at times.and it has great games like a mustang contra jet and the Audi R8 V10. Buy this game
034580404X|5.0|Okay so, I just finished the trilogy and I loved it!!!!!! Most of it you don't expect which is fantastic and totally amazing. Greatest series I've ever read. Can't wait for the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002J0B|5.0|At one point, Houses of the Holy was my favorite Zeppelin album.  Although Physical Graffiti has recently edged out that distinction, Houses of the Holy will always have a special place in my heart.  What it comes down to may be the fact that Houses of the Holy is one of their most accessible albums, yet is trailblazing at the same time.  While Led Zeppelin III and IV may have been somewhat murky-sounding at times, and challenging to listen to at first, Houses of the Holy is bright in both production and general attitude.  The darkest-sounding song here is \\"No Quarter\\", with its mix of psychedelic keyboards and low-key doomy vibe; yet even this song manages to avoid being oppressive.  The opening \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is relentlessly open-sounding and driving, and, in my opinion, may have had some influence on U2's open-plains, echoing hopefulness (it doesn't hurt that U2 themselves have admitted a tad of Zeppelin's influence for at least a couple of their songs), while its sister piece, \\"The Rain Song\\", channels orchestral prog-rock influences.  In addition to channeling funk (\\"The Crunge\\") and reggae (\\"D'Yer Maker\\"), the band electrifies South Asian influences (some of the micro-tonal South Asian influences in \\"Dancing Days\\") and creates straight-forward commercial hard rock with \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\".  To top it off, the album closes with one of the band's best songs, the relentless positive \\"The Ocean\\", which ends with a guitar rave-up backed by doo-wop vocals.  Physical Graffiti's sheer variety and scope may give that album the edge at the end of the day, but Houses of the Holy deserves recognition for providing a fantastic, energized introduction to the uninitiated as to why Led Zeppelin is so well-loved.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|lamest writing i ever read. A five year old could come up with a better story line. Send the author back to school.
B0010HA68I|5.0|I bought two sets for a trip a friend and I were taking to Nepal in October 2013. One for him and one for me. They worked perfectly as we trekked 18 days to Everest Base Camp and back. Our cameras were handy, but not in the way. It took a little personal retraining to remember to unhook them when we were taking our packs off, but other than that they never made the camera feel heavy or awkward, as a traditional neck strap would. There was no banging back and forth, as a traditional camera strap would have done. It's almost like what I was designing in my head for the past year. I liked mine so much I gifted it to my guide and am purchasing another for myself.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It could have been a good game but they Bush to get you to buy to much so I can't give it 5 stars
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Great app. Lets me browse thru a direct search or with a click, you can pull up the full Amazon site home page. You can link it to Amazon MP# and to your home computer.
B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|They got worse with every one very predictable. I hope they do not make another one. First one was the best.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Fun, well acted movie, like any &#34;zombie&#34; movie out there it has plenty of &#34;who in their right mind would do that?&#34; situations.  Overall though we enjoyed it and I do not regret the rental.
B00B2166BS|1.0|Two months later and the plug does not work. It may even have ruined my new Google Nexus tablet, which I have to send back to the manufacturer since it does not work!!! What a waste of money.
B00004WQ3R|5.0|If you want a breakdown on this brilliant album read the other gushing reviews. I'm here to tell you to buy this on Vinyl. It was recorded old school, through an analog board, onto analog tape. Much of the distortion and crunchy vibe on this recording was a result of over driving the board. It is just a brilliant recording of some great songs. Just that. Nothing more. Brilliant. The real payoff, the bit you will never get from a CD, is dropping the needle on side 2 after listening to side one.<br /><br />The volume is up, your energy is up and you are in sync with what PJH has been putting down. A slight pop leaves the speakers as the needle falls into the groove. The pop is followed by near silence, disturbed only by the black hiss of the needle in the lead in groove. PJH lets out the sexiest 'Mmm Hmmm' to ever grace a recording and the guitar immediately follows hitting you square in the &#34;@uck YEA!&#34;<br /><br />Long Snake Moan indeed.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|works well on the tablet easy to navigate lots of bonus boxes you can get to earn more game points

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I recommend cut the rope to any one that doesn't have a problem with thinking. When I first started the game it was awesome I couldn't believe how awesome it was. I have like puzzle games since I got my kindle fire.
B007R6UWN0|4.0|Jason Isaacs what else is there to say. I enjoyed it, shows him helping older  people  along with his other cases.
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|Interesting take on the aging Batman and his relationship with Superman.  Wish there was more like this. Guess getting old happens to everyone.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel. I Was hooked in easily from the beginning. It's not your typical super hero story by any means.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put it down! It's amazing how our lives are all intertwined and life happens to take us where we are today.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great entertainment for my 6 year old. She loves it. So much going on at once. she loves all the activities and challenges.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is an noble act on part of Amazon to make available Kindle software as a freeware. & open gates of vast information & entertainment to all android phone users.E books available on your site in concessional rate is a boon to book readers.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Well, it is OK. Pretty flat role for Brad Pitt. Amazon instant video quality is very good. Not bad for an action movie.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all times.  I've lost track of how many times I have watched it.  The acting is superb and so is the story.  In addition the movie is also amusing.
B0053FANRC|5.0|i love this movie!!<br />if your like a fan of fast and the furious<br />you should differently pick this one up!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|It was an interesting insight of the foibles of old age. It was an introduction for me to what I call classical music played by those who had made it their lifetime interest. Kudos to Little Big Man.
B00E8JZILA|4.0|I am not a zombie flick fan. I watched the first episode of Walking Dead and did not like it and watched no more. Lots of folks recommended this game though and it is good, however. The zombies are an external hazard and the game is really about building human relationships in a hostile environment - I was very surprised. It is a very guided storyline, you have some choice as to what to do, but for the most part it is a choice or two in tough situations, not like a free-roaming world of a GTA or Midnight Club where you can truly make your own storyline. I'm really old (40) and I think a lot of the old time Infocom adventures gave you a lot more choice about your own adventure and due to lack of graphics (where this game delivers, really, more like a comic book or a cartoon TV series, not like the cinematographic gore of the TV series) where your own imagination is king. I really got sucked into the game though although the gameplay is only about four hours long. I don't watch any horror genre or play intense video games any more and I have to confess I had a nightmare about this game the first night I played it - it is that intense. The main character is very likable and you end up wanting to make smart choices for him. This is a weird media experience that is perhaps best explained as a mixed media interactive art animation and your should do it, but don't expect traditional interactive gameplay of more than  a few hours of entertainment out of it - but those few hours are good.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I loved this book.  The story is beautifully written and obviously well researched.  I could see and feel the characters and it was a treat to follow them through history.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Gives off a great amount of light and definitely comes in handy! I would recommend this light to my friends to use!
0201633612|2.0|The concepts are hard to understand. The sample code written in Smalltalk doesn't help much. Now a days there are many web sites where you can find these pattern easily explained and sample code in C# o Java. I do not recommend this book.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Can't go wrong when you're a Grey's Anatomy fan!  This completed my collection of all seasons...to date.  Bring on Season Ten!
0307352153|5.0|Excellent book. Some fascinating research on the physical aspects of introversion, and I enjoyed the history too, charting the relatively recent rise of the Extrovert Ideal.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|When you hear this, you're instantly taken back to the 80's when Stryper ruled Christian hair metal. The band has released a CD that easily fits with their old sound, and that suits me just fine. While other bands reinvent themselves and hope their fans follow, Stryper has given their fans exactly what they want: good music. It doesn't open as strongly as some of their classics, but they easily find a groove at about the third song that will get you rocking. I'm definitely putting this as their best in recent years and probably one of their top five of all time (&#34;In God We Trust&#34; will always be my favorite). Thank you guys for continuing to give us great music!
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|The Conjuring was a little disappointing. There is nothing new that you haven't seen in other horror movies. It's sort of The Poltergeist meets Rosemarie's Baby meets The Exorcist. Nonetheless, it was suspenseful in parts and was fast paced.
B000FA675C|5.0|Love a good well researched, well written thriller!!! Brown keeps you intrigued until the very last page. A definite page turner that you will not want to put down.
B002VECM4K|5.0|I sat down to watch this unwatchable film months ago and could not watch it, however, a couple of weeks ago I tried it again.  This time I totally connected.  I don't know if it's Gabourny's likeability or her talent, but I totally got her and it.  It is now one of my favorite films and she is and has been one of my favorite new actresses ever since &#34;The Big C&#34;.  Forget the physical, its her spirit and her chutzpa that get me.  I could not believe how good Mo-nike was (ok, probably misspelled her name) and I have admired her for years also.  Mariah Carey without glamor was another thing that affected me.  Now if she would just try doing something like this more often maybe I would have liked her a long time ago.  This movie was funny, heartbreaking, brutal and had many things to say about the gay folk, straight folk and respecting yourself.  Gabourney Sibidne or whatever, I probably misspelled it, is the soul that lights up the screen for the time she gets on it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved that trilogy and I hope that movies don't suck too bad, but whatever. Great read, good for any age.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I thought this was a great book.  I always knew that SEAL training was rigorous, but it was enlightening to get the inside information regarding how seals are trained.<br /><br />I was amazed at the heroics that each of those men on the mountain displayed on the day they were attacked by<br />The Taliban. The bond between these men and their willingness to sacrifice for their fellow SEALs make me grateful that we have such great warriors preserving our way of life.<br /><br />I was very concerned that these men were under such Rules of Engagement that they were worried that they would be tried for murder if they eliminated the herders that discovered them in their hide. Without these concerns I'm certain that the decision they made about the fate of these herders would have been different
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am totally addicted to Downton Abbey. Well done show that never fails to entertain me. The  plot lines are good but they are not dreary.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|Santana is probably the greatest guitar player ever. Several of his greatest music is on this CD. What more could you ask for?
B000I3UMKM|5.0|Whoever thought the 60s were boring has obviously not watched Breakfast at Tiffany's. It makes you cheer for the little guy!
B00D9PUXQY|4.0|Really enjoyed this CD/DVD combo but the DVD is missing 3 tracks that are listed on the packaging. Kind of disappointed.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|Eggers begins with a timely and provocative theme and I had high hopes for a story full of imagination, suspense, and entertainment--but The Circle never gets rolling.  You'll hate the creepy characters, resent the plodding narrative, and wonder how a guy with Eggers' reputation could deliver something so lifeless and trite.  And don't plan to bull your way through, expecting the last act to justify your investment of time and money:  the climax reads like something brainstormed in a junior high school lunchroom.  The Circle is a three-ring flop.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I read this for book club. The characters were strong and believable. The story moved along nicely.  Definitely a lot for group discussion.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I thought it was dull and lacked a plot. I also thought the editing was poor. Gilbert does not understand the use of the subjunctive which was distracting in a book attempting a 19th writing style.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Good product is one of the best free applications avaliable for social media guru like myself. Also it is free!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Great book r u sure she isn't a man because that felt I like a man was telling the story for sure. A great read u love him u hate him you root for him all the way. It wasn't a fairytale it was a true life kind of story. Loved the characters and could not put it down had to make myself go to bed. The sex was smoking hot fan yourself hot. Bye the book worth every penny. I will be looking for more of her work for sure.
B00A2H9PLG|2.0|This movie was a very disappointing movie.  I almost bought it first but decided to rent it first and I'm glad I did!  This is a one time watch.  The story is lame and boring.  I forced myself to watch it all.  Jamie Foxx as president is even more lame.  The storyline has been overdone.  Tatum tries to give a Die Hard act but it fails.  The special effects were also pretty lame.  More like a made for TV movie.  If you want to watch a good movie, watch Olympus Has Fallen or something else.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's because of the BBC and their vast and excellent programming. The production company is commended for the show's period costumes and authenticity.
097747609X|3.0|Nice book. It's hard to read. Almost like a job I felt I had to do. Try it. Glad Hitler lost and was discredited and died. He was a nasty man.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Amazing book full of action and grudges. We find Percy as he faces the giants for the first time ever
B00EP0SIOG|3.0|***** Update 12/30/2014 ********  I switched to a Windows phone and noticed the Sphero app, so I took this out again. I really enjoyed the new app, as do my sons. One game is like \\"hot and cold\\" where you find hidden depots with the Sphero beeping faster and changing colors when you get close. The other part of the app has a video with Sphero's origin story and a game that successively builds skills.    I teach and some students had some fun recently playing with the APIs.     I wanted to update the review to recognize that this product is getting better and more fun with time. I appreciate the extras put into the new app. Unfortunately there is only the one app for Windows Phone (there are others, but they are just drive control pads.) I'll break out the iPad and see if any of those apps (or new apps) provide a significantly improved experience.    ********************************  As an engineer, I can't help but be enamored by the technology and design of this wonderful little orb. Sphero is amazing to watch as it maneuvers on your command and the designers have put some features in (a tail, little tricks) that make the toy a bit more endearing, almost like a pet. There are some clever apps to let you drive Sphero around the house or over zombies. Or you can use Sphero as a controller to shoot down aliens and ingest energy pods. The color and movement are put to good effect.    But I don't use it. My 16 year old son has lost interest. An my 8 year old boys lost interest after just a few tries. So I can't recommend it.    First off, the control is very cool, but not good enough for the space we have. I think our home is about average in size with mostly hardwood floors. Perhaps we have a few patches of open space that are 5'x8' or 6'x6'. These spaces, however, are not large enough to control Sphero easily. Typically he (our is named Sphred) goes out of bounds and ends up under the couch or hitting the furniture. When he bounces, the calibration on direction gets off, so you have to readjust his tail to continue. Perhaps it is meant to be part of the challenge to account for the momentum, but it is a very frustrating learning process.    When the virtual reality features kick in, it is doubly frustrating because Sphred is always leaving the screen. I go to shoot a zombie on the side and off it goes, I then have to align the tablet (I'm using an iPad), find him again, and then line up the next shot. I tried being closer and further and lowering the speed, but I've found it more frustrating than fun or challenging.    The best use so far has been as a game controller. In one incarnation it controls yaw, forward, and lateral movements of a space ship. The spaceship is always firing, so gameplay is mostly moving and aiming. The other case is color grab, where your reflexes are tested to see if you can pick up the Sphero when it is a particular randomly chosen color. It is fun for a short while, but not captivating.    I tried adjusting the power, and that helps control a bit, but it still remains very difficult. I tried him in a carpeted room and the carpet was too deep for him to start (although he could keep on going if he was already rolling.)    I still plan to use it and play with it to see if there is more to it with the ramps and such; I just haven't gotten around to doing it and think part of that is the excitement has dwindled substantially.    I feel bad about this review because it is a remarkable device and I have the highest respect for those who developed it. However I can't recommend it because just being cool isn't enough in this case.
B00ESF285S|5.0|Mom read it to me when I was little. I LOVE Dr.Seuss. I grew up on Dr.Seuss, Clifford, Madeline, Jenie B & Little witch stories.

B00F2HW20M|5.0|For those of us disappointed that the 2007 Genesis reunion tour did not include Peter Gabriel and Steve, this show is the next best thing. The playing by everyone is marvelous, with Nad Sylvan sounding eerily like a cross between Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. Gary O'Toole's drumming and vocals (Especially on \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\") are perfect, Lee Pomeroy is spot-on, and Rob Townsend adds excitement and color. Roger King deserves special mention for capturing the style and sounds of Tony Bank's vintage keyboards. The guests give it their all and add a nice variety to the long show. My personal favorite is \\"Shadow of the Hierophant,\\" which always gives me goosebumps.<br /><br />This is the finest filmed presentation of a rock concert I've ever seen, with the cameramen and director setting out to faithfully capture the exciting performance. None of the usual rock concert film nonsense here: no extraneous inserted footage, silly special effects, out of focus/rapidly zooming in and out shots, extreme close-ups, or cameras that look like they were mounted on runaway roller coasters or held by people with Parkinson's Disease. Shots are long and varied and you get a nice feel for the band interacting with other. I wouldn't be surprised if the production team has worked on classical shows before. Bravo!<br /><br />The concert is presented on CDs 1-3 and the first DVD is as follows:<br /><br />1: Watcher of the Skies<br />2: The Chamber of 32 Doors<br />3: Dancing with The Moonlit Knight<br />4: Fly on a Windshield<br />5: Broadway Melody of 1974<br />6: The Lamia (featuring Nik Kershaw & Steve Rothery)<br />7: The Musical Box<br />8: Shadow of the Hierophant (featuring Amanda Lehmann)<br />9: Blood on the Rooftops<br />10: Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers...<br />11 ...In that Quiet Earth<br />12: Afterglow (featuring John Wetton)<br />13: I Know what I Like<br />14: Dance on a Volcano<br />15: Entangled (featuring Jakko Jakszyck & Amanda Lehmann)<br />16: Eleventh Earl of Mar<br />17: Supper's Ready<br />18: Firth of Fifth<br />19: Los Endos (Medley)<br /><br />The CDs clock in at 2 hours and 31 minutes, and the DVD (which includes more applause and banter) at 2 hours and 41 minutes.

People tend to divide Genesis into the \\"Gabriel Era\\" and the \\"Post-Gabriel Era,\\" but I think Steve was more of the driving force between the progressive Genesis and their more pop-driven later catalog, as the music in this set proves.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|In a time when regular tv is stupid with reality shows and HBO is overflowing with porn and gore, it is a joy to find a series that is captivating because of the content, relationships and character development. The hours I have spent watching Downton are as well used as reading a great book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game. just wish was more than 10 levels. towards the end actually had to think about how to escape.
B00CIP57Z8|4.0|Really enjoyable follow up to the previous film. A terrific central performance which is a portrait in grief embraced so fully. Sexy supporting players in the final's second half. A painful love scene. Who could ask for anything more?
B000PKG7TI|5.0|If you  like the early Night Wish this is a DVD of there tours with the First female singer.  She is opera trained and makes an excellent combination.

B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|Honestly, it really didn't make much sense. I guess a good/decent plot is optional. I should have stopped after the first movie!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I really enjoy this game it is very fun and I really recommend it for anyone. I really cant stopplaying this
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Follows the show well and even does well on character development and over all an magical game love it !!!the fun has been doubled.
B00ABMZRVO|4.0|Good work by all involved, even if the story - like the relationship - pulls the boundaries of 'why not just leave?'
B00G32QIEG|4.0|It may be similar to other movies as others have stated.....but it was FUN!!!  I have already recommended it  to friends with minor preparation.
B008E374PO|3.0|Adam Young's album The Midsummer Station is by no means awful. Young collaborates with many songwriters and producers to create catchy pop tunes that hold their own against the other pop giants who currently rule the radio. One thing that worries me is the way that the album is a departure from the Owl City style progression. Young has stated that he hasn't wanted to make the same album twice and I applaud him for that. However, there is a progression from Of June all the way to All Things Bright and Beautiful that The Midsummer Station takes no part in. Many of the surreal lyrics are gone, instead replaced by shallow almost cheap lyrics filled with &#34;oh's&#34; and &#34;whoa's&#34; that makes it very clear that Adam did not write many of these lyrics. In previous albums, every song had a definite message and The Midsummer Station seems to lack that conviction that made Owl City both endearing and moving. I have to wonder how much truth there is to the statement in the song &#34;Silhouette&#34; on the album where Young sings, &#34;The fire I began is burning me alive, but I know better than to leave and let it die.&#34; I'm expecting the next Owl City album to be a step forward for Young, with a return of the surreal, meaningful lyrics that made us all love Owl City in the first place conveyed in a brand new way. I'm glad that Owl City had a chance to make a &#34;pop&#34; album, but for me, Owl City isn't just pop. It's Owl City.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is awesome. It has all the fun of 132 games in one easy and simple to use app.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|a riveting story flowing through historical events of the 20th century.  can't wait for the last part of the trilogy.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting premise.  Well written.  Makes you think about what you would do in that situation.  Characters were well developed and very human.
1932100385|5.0|THE CHINA STUDY:  THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF NUTRITION EVER CONDUCTED  I appreciate this book, recommended to me by my nutritionalist sister, because of the extensive research.  The bottom line is that it elicits from any reader a more conscientious attitude towards what goes into the mouth for nourishment.
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|I just got the blu-ray release of this concert and finished watching it. I can't compare to the DVD quality on sound and video but from what I just experienced it is one of my top favorite concerts on disc I've ever seen. The sound is very clear and some of the shots are just amazing!<br />The setlist will not disappoint you. There's a good mix of styles. If you're a fan of Dream Theater you should definitely have this in your collection. I even showed it to some friends that were not familiar with their work and they ended up loving it as much as I did!<br /><br />There are three solos (guitar, piano and drums) and I had to rewind a couple of times for each one just to appreciate a little better the quality of the sound and the incredible skills of these musicians.<br />[[ASIN:B005JJSGBW Live at Budokan [Blu-ray]]] I believe is a better once, at least in my opinion. I think this one might be a little bit longer but for some reason I think it doesn't reach those heights. Both are amazing and if you can, definitely get them both. But if you're thinking about getting only one, the other one is probably a better option.<br /><br />100% recommended!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Timerlake ROCKS and he does it with style on this one, for sure. A do not miss to buy on this onr.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I loved it, it wasn't predictable and it made me almost want to cry towards the end. So sad that its over though I'm happy with how it ended.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|Fun but not as great as the other two. Glad I waited for it on tv. Great couch movie though
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this app is a lot of help to clean and get rid of a lot of junk on your device that take up space without having to uninstall everything you have and love on your device I have a lot of things on my device that I didn't want to lose but struggled to keep my memory from being filled once I used this I was able to keep everything but able to knock down my memory to more than half I could not believe how much junk hides in your device that everything I had wasn't even he problem its what comes with it. if you love a lot of apps and cached videos and music then keep them coming because this app will help make room to store more.
B000ME5B30|1.0|It is shocking how many people still believe the propaganda and false statistics but forward in this turd.  Idiots like you are going to force me to pay carbon taxes to Al Gore because that will somehow magically cool down the sun.  Lemmings, please go to scienceandpublicpolicy.org
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely loved this series! Great characters and great stories. Loved the intensity and that I had to occasionally look words up.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game it's fun and great to play. Will to everyone I know to play it<br /> AAAAAAAA+  please make it easier to get animals.
B00FKAA3MA|1.0|I knew he would do this again.  Straight off the bat...understand I like Eminem.  I have every CD he has dropped.  Well, the last 4-5 albums were extremely weak.  Nothing but emo rap that only his white crowd can enjoy.  How can Eminem have Dr Dre as a producer (as well as Dre's minions) and be as popular and rich as he is...have such poorly produced tracks?  He needs to stop making his own wack beats and pay producers who would die to make a track for him.  And now, the lyrics and hooks.  This is why Dr Dre's last album, Detox, is going to fail.  Eminem is on this EMO rap tip that appeals to mostly white kids.  Real talk, no other race would play this in their car or MP3 player.  His topics are either:  his mother, his baby momma, or his emotional crap about dealing with it all.  After 5-6 albums, this thing gets old.  I read somewhere that he was going to go back to his old lyrical/battle type rap so, I really couldn't wait.  First 2 albums, straight genius.  This failed so badly.  That track with the Door's sample (which Necro did a better track with) was sad.  It truly sucked.  This type of Eminem's rap is going to poison Dre's Detox (don't believe me? go listen to 'I Need a Dr')<br /><br />Eminem needs to fire all of his yes men that told him any of the tracks were worthy of being on this album.  And Eminem, shame on you for the horrific beats you used.<br /><br />I recall 50 Cent and Eminem laughing at JaRule for singing on his hooks.  lol  Funny thing, both 50 Cent and Eminem do that ALL the time now.<br /><br />One of the worst purchases I made.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I had heard from a number of people that this book was good, so when I finished my last novel I quickly picked this one up. From the opening pages, I could tell this book would affect my heart. The author dies a wonderful job of pulling beauty
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|When I started this book I was really surprised as it's not the way John Grisham normally writes....my opinion.  As I got into the chapters and people in the story, I just couldn't put the book down.  What a blockbuster of a story.  Every type of emotion is on these pages, making it just burst thru.  I sure do recommend this book and you won't be sorry. Get ready to loose a lot of sleep BUT....it's worth it.<br />Sam A.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|very well written book about slavery.  Very realistic and believable. Used this book for book club discussion and had many events and characters worth dissecting in a group.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved this series! Great characters and great stories. Loved the intensity and that I had to occasionally look words up.
0525478817|5.0|\\"My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.\\" This book is about Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16 year old girl, living with stage 4 Lung Cancer. During one of her visits to support group for cancer kids, she meets Augustus Waters. Augustus Waters is a 17 year old boy in remission of osteosarcoma. She meets eyes with him and doesn't really know what to think. Throughout the book they become closer and friendlier.<br /><br />They both liked to read, so they switched favorite books for the other to read. Hazel was unsure about reading anything but her normal book, An Imperial Affliction. Although she was reluctant at first she read Augustus' book and he read hers. She ended up liking it in the end and Augustus liked his. There were many questions for the writer of An Imperial Affliction, Peter van Houten. They both wanted to find answers.<br /><br />As a cancer kid, you get one desired wish through Genies. Hazel had used hers on a trip to Disney a few years earlier. Augustus hadn't used his though, and it was still eligible. They both use the wish to visit some place they really want to go.<br /><br />This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is so great and it really touched me. I cried at the end of the book because it was really sad but beautiful at the same time. I would recommend The Fault in our Stars to anyone.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I downed the latest version of Kindle on my Notes II.  I cannot open the books I downloaded for Kindle (from Amazon).  It tells me to update and I tried and I already got the latest but I still cannot open it.  I downloaded the Kindle app on my IPad and it opened my books fine.  Kindle app dev team needs to focus on the compatibility issue.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|any I love this movie. like the voices and story. gets a little dark with the evil guy towards end was a little shocked my 3 your old nephew didn't care for that part. also would of been even better if it didn't keep pausing, that's an amazon thing I believe.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Truly creepy and frightening.  Well acted And since based on a true story (allegedly) has a bit more creep factor.
0385537131|5.0|Just finished this book...........LOVED IT!!.........LOVED,LOVED,LOVED IT!!!......Mr.Grisham has once again written a killer book.......I couldn't read it fast enough.....He's the best.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Great girl movie. Love the Christina, Cher combination. This movie makes me wish that I could sing and dance like that, as well as put on my make up in this style.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  The setup was simple and trouble free. The results were and still are amazing..., no more adds. Wow!!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, give it a try.<br />It is one of my favorites because it is fun, quirky and entertaining. The music is correct to the period also and is available on CD.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|fun great movie the first is still my fav...but this is great family movie. I am grown and liked it :)
B00F91SCXC|3.0|While I liked the movie, it never really gave me that suspenseful feeling that makes these kinds of movies great. It never really felt like Brad Pitt was in danger of losing his life.  The effects were awesome though, but did not make the movie, better direction and more character development would have helped.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is as good as I remember A Time To Kill.  I am glad to see Grisham writing more like when he first started.  I really enjoyed this book.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is the best show currently on television. Season one while, rough at times, is a great season with plenty of dark humor and drama to go around.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I always get a little nervous when bands say \\"this is the best we've ever done\\". Doesn't every band say that with a new release? :)  This is one of those rare times where it is absolute truth! This is one FANTASTIC album. Likely the closest they will ever get to the \\"old school\\" stryper sound. This could easily have followed To Hell with the Devil. I cannot see how any Stryper fan would be able to skip this album. I would give it more stars in the rating if I could. If any members from stryper read this, you guys have outdone yourselves! Bravo!
B0030B621W|5.0|Sam Rockwell nails this. Great acting, show a lot of human emotion in the plot. Rare to see this kind of thing anymore.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first two books were good.  This one was not.  I now feel like I wasted my time reading all three.  There are so many things wrong with the story (holes, bad plotlines, underdeveloped characters, etc.) that I just don't feel like typing it all.  The book was such a let down.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Still love this show!  The fourth season keeps continues to entertain as well as surprise!  I didn't know how they were going to keep the Alicia/ Peter story going without boring the audience (or becoming very unrealistic) but I find myself always wanting more.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Just goes to show that even us old folks can relate to teenage problems. The same stuff happens now andthirty years ago! Same situations, same problems with boys and friends just different hair styles and clothes. Believe me....I remember it all. Great show..I'm hooked
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved this series! Great characters and great stories. Loved the intensity and that I had to occasionally look words up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so cool. The levels ate hard, the power up combos are cool, and it is just fun. I do not have Facebook because I am 10, but I love this game!!! Almost as fun as Minecraft!!! Lol:)
B0037QO8XE|3.0|There didn't seem to be a point to the movie other than people in the ghetto have really hard lives and it's possible to rise above it.  The positive outcome didn't make up for being such a depressing movie.  Some good individual performances.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Can't stop watching, all characters are believable and flawed, cases are good.  Equal time between firm drama and cases and they have surprising guest stars (Michael J Fox, Elizabeth Reaser) on multiple episodes.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|It is a really great game. I loved it. If u loved the first game you will love this one
B00459EZLW|2.0|Not worthy of the name stargate.  Mostly a soap about a bunch of petty egos.  very little to do with good  sci fi.....  Got better toward the end of second season but  I had to keep asking &#34;who writes this crap&#34;
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Very entertaining movie, Constantly makes you think. This is not your average ballerina movie, talk about craziness. Portman becomes the perfect Black Swan.
B00AG473GE|5.0|I went and seen this movie when it came out in the cine.  I went with my sister.  That was so many years ago.  So being to purchase this movie and watch it was truly a blesing.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I got this set on an amazon black friday deal and couldn't be happier! The price was amazing and the movie is SO CUTE!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I've read it at least 3 times and also have seen the movie about 3 times.  It is a girl's coming of age story, with her tenderly<br />told relationship to &#34;papa&#34;.  The story was close to my own life.  I cry every time I read this or see the film.  A spunky little<br />heroine. One of the best books I've read in my entire life.  A treasure.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I downloaded this game in the hopes that i wouldn't run through another hidden object game in a day and wind up with nothing to play. This game has met my expectations its fun and there is always another quest to sink my teeth into. Rechargable energy limits playtime, but i feel that way about every game that uses it so I'm working on patience.
B002UWH8P6|2.0|Not worthy of the name stargate.  Mostly a soap about a bunch of petty egos.  very little to do with good  sci fi.....  Got better toward the end of second season but  I had to keep asking &#34;who writes this crap&#34;
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, I have recommended to others.  A challenge to solve with just enough clues that you don't become frustrated.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great book with lots of twists and turns.  Keeps you guessing the whole way through.  I read Flynn's 2 other books and didn't like them nearly as much.
B0053O89WY|5.0|My husband and I have all of the Big Bang Theory seasons and love them all! They seem to get better and better! We purchased this on an amazon black friday deal and couldn't have been happier. We have watched these episodes over and over! Buy this! And the others! You'll love them too!
B000N2HCM4|3.0|I bought this when Obama was running for office the first time, in the &#34;honeymoon&#34; phase.  I never finished it.  Nevertheless,<br />it is well written and gives me insight into why he has difficulties with the &#34;touchy feely&#34; part of being a President.  He is a high<br />achieving man, and I admire him.  This book helps me understand his story with more compassion.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A fantastic series in all ways.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys beautiful cinematography, wonderful writing, excellent acting, and intriguing story lines.  One of the best things I've seen in a very long time!
B009LDD590|5.0|Amazing series, everyone needs to be watching!  !!  The actors depict the characters in a way you think you are right there with them, back in time with the Mob and prohibition.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game.....it certainly is addicting!  At first I thought &#34;What is everyone talking about, this is certainly a dumb, mindless game&#34;......But, after I played it for a while, getting to the next level is what drives you onward......Love it!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I could not watch this second season in tv. This is the perfect solution. Besides I am passing it to my daughter an her husband.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I've been a Stryper fan since &#34;Soldiers Under Command&#34; and was blessed to see the original lineup live on their 25th anniversary tour in 2009.  I've enjoyed their more recent albums &#34;Murder by Pride&#34; and &#34;The Covering&#34; but this album is even better!  If you've ever enjoyed even 1 song by them, you must buy this album.  Great production, great music, incredible message.  May God bless Stryper as they continue their metal ministry.
B0036SUQWA|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever.  Since I am a practicing Clairvoyant, it feels like a spoof on my profession.  It has<br />every metaphysical cliche you could imagine.  The fact that its based on fact makes it even more enjoyable for me.<br />If you want to know how your hard earned tax dollars have been spent, this program was probably not as much a waste of time<br />as you might think.<br />  See it for yourself and then you can decide.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I so thoroughly enjoyed this book, I just had to keep reading. I own most of Mr. Grishams novels and can never hardly wait for the next one.
B003INBNXO|5.0|What a man, what a life story! Every martial arts fan should see all 3 films about this amazing person. As for the guys who sold me these DVDs, my pkgs arrived in a short while in new condition.
1451666179|5.0|Other folks have said how funny this book is, and how accurate the descriptions of events and even depression are.  Brosh has a ability like few others to put into words things that everyone thinks.  The \\"Identity\\" chapters are like using a mysterious foreign device for years, sort of figuring it out, and then being given a manual that describes in detail all the ways you've been using it and how its internal bits work.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book, and you should buy it immediately.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved the way the different family stories all intertwined.  Ken Follett is a master of detail, but keeps it interesting.  I learned so much about WWI than I ever knew, especially from different perspectives.  Read the second book right away, but I'm disappointed the third one won't be out until next September.  Can't they speed it up?
1250038820|5.0|What an amazing group of photographs and all of the warm, wonderful people who have chosen to share themselves.  The book was a little smaller that I thought it would be (7.5&#34; x 9.5&#34;), but it is a really nice size to hold on to - not too big and not too small.  If you haven't done it already, follow Brandon on Facebook.  He's one of the reasons that I still have FB account.
B000683VI4|5.0|James Garner nails it.  The actors are superb. The story is involving and bitter sweet.  One of the best love stories of our<br />generation.  Another tear-jerker unless you're made of steel.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|I think the movie would of been great but the first 15 minutes were nothing but swearing Swearing Swearing Swearing
B00992CF6W|1.0|Crashes all time cheap not worth $7 my friend says it should be worth 10$ stupid I know but still this game sucks
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I've really become a fan of John Mayer with his last 2 albums.  The &#34;country&#34; twist works for him !  And me as a listener :D
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is so addictive!! Fun you can be playing this for hours! Been waiting for it to come for Kindle Fire and it finally did!! Love it
B00F880BWG|5.0|This show never gets boring. You never know what's going to happen from season to season, and of course, zombies are friggin scary! :)
B000001E21|4.0|Good CD that contains good music that I enjoy listening to when the stars at night are big and bright.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|SO hard to put down! Dark and twisty but really really enjoyable.  Unlike anything I have read before. Can't wait for the next book!
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|It's hard to imagine that frontiers is better than the first one. The hero selection and upgrade system is a big step forward for Iron Hide and its gameplay was so fun. Maybe 2.99 was a little pricey at first, but when you get farther into the game you realize it is totally worth it. Kingdom Rush: Frontiers is a great game.
B007SGM084|5.0|Yes it is true its an out there love story but besides all the sex stuff its a really good story, kinda of like Pretty Woman in print LOL
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never fails to amaze me with his romance. What a beautiful story! Every time I read one of his books I feel like I'm in a fantasy world letting my imagination fly away with the story!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Your book was one of the best books I have ever read. I can't wait till the Movie comes out and I can read the next one. I wish that there were more so I can read a lot more. Thanks for writing the best books of all time.<br /><br />  Sincerely,<br />  Miller Arnold
0307730697|4.0|Good book that contains factual information of a tough time in a tough place that I have enjoyed reading when the stars at night are big and bright.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books.  They were easy to read and highly entertaining.  Were they masterpieces?  No of course not.  But they built a world that you could become lost in.  I was excited for the third book to come out.  Finally an end to the struggles of the first two books.  Man, was I disappointed.  It seemed like Roth was trying to cram too much into a book.  Things happened that didn't need to happen, characters were introduced and then forgotten about.  It seemed that this epic fight that was going on in the first two books were meaningless. All this build up for nothing.  Now, there were some good parts but overall I did not like the ending to the series.  It is the mark of a great author to finish a series just as strongly as they started and this did not happen.  Not even a little bit.  Luckily I have far better fantasy novels to keep me going.
007174889X|5.0|I like it that the book consists of two parts and that some chapters are on a dvd. The basics are well explained about almost any disease
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|I enjoyed watching this, but it's probably not one that bears repeating.  Most of the character &#34;development&#34; occurs early in the movie and after that we are just along for the ride, fun though it is.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have alway loved reading military books. But this one takes the price! I couldn't get enough! I didn't want the book to end!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|it is an awesome game! It is almost life like! I could play for hours and every day! just get it is free
B00979CS50|5.0|I've been playing this regularly since release and have not been able to make up my mind about it until yesterday - having not heard it for 2 weeks I then put it on in the car and it sounded like an old friend. It you're struggling, all I can say is give it time, best things come and all that.
B000I9S668|5.0|Excellent film... Inspiring loving listening to that small inner voice. A family film. Hope love and a longer to right a wrong.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|There's really isn't a lot to say.  It's candy crush saga and it works well.  What more do you need to know?
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Very interesting and informative documentary about the famous recording studio.  It was unbelievable how many famous albums were recorded there.
140006922X|5.0|An eye-opening view of Jesus' life that makes sense of the nonsense usually found in the Bible.  This book is very scholarly and well researched.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works perfectly.  I am so pleased with this USB cable.  If I ever need another one, I will order this one again.
1449305172|5.0|This book has literately changed my life. Starting a business for the first time is extremely difficult, and if I didn't have this guide, I might have given up. I might have kept building products nobody wants thinking I don't have what it takes.<br /><br />But thanks to Ash, I knew better, and even had a step-by-step road map detailing exactly what I needed to do. The book is packed with great and actionable advice on how to validate a business model, but it is really easy to read.<br /><br />If you are a first time entrepreneur, this book is a must.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Peter Pan meets Harry potter. Magic, fantasy, and current lives mixed into one. Didn't like the action scenes.  Not for me
B009CVRQLY|5.0|I love all of Celine Dion's albums and am not disappointed with this one either.  She is my favorite female singer of all time and she also finds the most beautiful songs to record.  I love Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstad, Wynonna, Cher, Karen Carpenter, Katrina Elam's voices and many others, but Celine is my absolute all time favorite.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I am glad I tried the app, it's by far been the best...most thorough and user friendly cleaner I've found.  Also had some pleasant surprises if you know where to look.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved this book and am anxiously waiting to see the movie.  The tale was moving and believeable - very moving and tough<br />to imagine what these people went through in the days of Hitler and the Nazi regime.  It also tells the tale of how one young<br />girl has such strength even after witnessing such cruelty in our world.  I would recommend everyone to take time to read this<br />one.
1591841666|5.0|The Dip is a book not unlike a life jacket: it will save you when you need it and be extraneous, perhaps rubbing you the wrong way, when you don't.<br /><br />I picked up The Dip when I was drowning. It saved me. I felt like crying tears of joy reading through this small book, because it gave me exactly what I needed exactly when I needed it. I was in a big long steep dip. I'd lost sight of the end goal. I was reading other things and wondering whether it was time to quit, and what that would mean practically, financially, and psychologically.<br /><br />Seth Godin so clearly articulates the problem and all of its solutions. I found mine over and over again: quit tactics, but not strategy. Quit dead ends. But don't quit because you're in the hard part of something that's worthwhile.<br /><br />This is a book you need to keep on the shelf and pull out whenever you're either getting complacent and need a quitting strategy, or when you're getting panicky and you need a staying strategy. Both of these are borne out of planning rather than complacency or panic. I first checked The Dip out from the library but found I needed to highlight and mark too many passages, so I've bought my own. And I'll be reading it again.<br /><br />Some of the negative reviews had me puzzled, but then I realized: those reviewers didn't need The Dip at the moment they picked it up. If they had, they'd be writing a 5-star like I am.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I love Apple products, but they drive me a little insane with their constant change in products, plug-ins, etc...  So, my external hard drive wouldn't plug into my new Mac.  I had to get this thing to access my external hard drive.  Pain in the ass - yes.  Worth it to access my files - definitely.  Good product for what it's used for.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|This grip is exactly what was needed to complete the camera, both in terms of ergonomics and use. Now, I feel like a pro, plus I never run out of battery power. It is the most useful accessory I've purchased for my 7D.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great for visiting my ebay to check on watched items on my Kindle and even makes placing bids very easy.  I don't use it to pay for won items, but that's okay as everything on the app works just fine!
0071636080|5.0|Bought this a couple months before a make-or-break meeting and presentation - I knew I could do better than I'd done previously, but needed some coaching. This really helped me understand the process, and gave a strong confidence boost as well. It didn't turn me into Steve Jobs, but helped me deliver a good presentation that accomplished our objectives, and drew praise from our customers and my superiors as well.<br /><br />Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs clearly outlines the elements Jobs used so successfully, and (key for me) takes the emphasis off the slides and puts it where the rubber hits the road: my interaction with the audience. Planning and outlining, thinking through what I need to get across, engaging the audience members - I was able to do all those things much more effectively. I still keep that presentation and review it occasionally before doing a new one, as a sort of shorthand for all the lessons I learned from Gallo's book. I've re-read the book as well.<br /><br />Very good purchase - returned in results much more than I paid for it. I'd recommend it to anyone who realizes that they can do better in their presentations, but isn't sure how to go about it. Much more thorough and effective than the occasional articles about presentations you may see in various places, with hands-on advice and examples. And a pleasure to read as well! 5 stars.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Entertaining...intend to read the whole series..not sure how Jack travels so light..not realistic but he always smites the bad guys..
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Very intriging, challenging.  It starts easily and builds on the tasks: more to remember, especially which type of house to build, how many happinesses are required, etc.
1594744769|5.0|A very different  story...very thought- provoking. I like a pager-turner! I borrowed this book to read and then bought it for my daughter to read.
0316219266|5.0|I think Jeff Bezos deserved recognition to create the first digital bookstore and eReader. Unfortunately that great cultural venture became as the review mention a super market where books are sold with coffee makers, Pampers and in some places lettuces. Title of the book reveal the transformation of the Amazon I miss
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|This game is very fun and very easy to get into.... only had it for a few hours and have gotten pretty far....everyone will have fun if they got this game
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This weather app is usually pretty close to what local weather channels predict. 36 hour and 10 day particularly helpful.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is the second one I ordered - to keep in the kitchen. I originally order this for my RV/bob. When I received it I sharpened all my house knives. It did such a fabulous job I ordered another.
B005PK56TA|4.0|If you like freaky, quiet horrific stories this is the show for you. Interesting love affairs, murders, loss, and semi-suspenseful
B004IYISSK|5.0|It doesn't get much better than Amy Tan.  This is a fantastic read!!!!  In this book the complex relationship between mothers and daughters and between different generations is presented with a universal feel that transcends race and culture.  The amount of self introspection and learning this book offers a reader to explore is second to none.  This is a book I read every few years!
039916409X|5.0|This book explains and walks you through the releasing of old issues through self reflection exercises and tapping. Most helpful are the scripts that the author provides, every step of the way. She also provides a follow up support video for each chapter. Brilliant!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|The ingenuity, faith, endurance, and yes, civility and respect for his fellow creatures makes this book an inspiration.  The brutal death fights were disturbing, but necessary to theorem of the book.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|The walking dead figures are absolutely fantastic, this will make a wonderful christmas gift for my son! Arrived quickly, I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I have read Enders  20 years ago,  the new version is way shorter than the original,  what a shame,  not good
B00DJYKFXG|2.0|I am tired of sending money to Robbie when he has spent a life-time of not sharing.<br /><br />There is nothing amazing, historic, or otherwise noteworthy about this box.  Buy a Rick Danko or Levon Helm album instead.  Even Garth and Richard have product you've likely never heard.
020530902X|5.0|This book is indispensable as a writing tool. I can always tell when I read a writer who doesn't own it.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Every time I listen to this album, I like it more and more.  His flow, lyrics, and rips from various different songs is fantastic.  BUY IT>PERIOD.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|These guys are sourcing deep currents of meaning.  If you listen carefully, can you hear a little resonance in your soul?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun, addicting game. It gets frustrating when you have to wait for lives or buy or beg friends to send them to you. Also passed first 30levels and can't continue unless I pay or have 3 friends help me.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I was so happy to see candy crush on this platform. Bigger screen makes it easier. This is one of my favorite games, so addictive.
B00A2V2SS4|5.0|The classic. Campy special effects, outdated sexist attitudes spark good conversations. Fun family friendly entertainment. My kid loves to look for the red shirts in every episode.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|Excellent book! Anyone wanting to understand a bit more about human interaction and even negotiation should read tihs book. Plenty of things I felt I already knew them, as some kind of instinctive knowledge, but it's always good to have them all in one place. The examples and pictures are also great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy Candy Crush.  I play it on my computer and now have it on my Kindle.  It's an easy game with strategy.
1616550414|5.0|Reading through this, I found out so many different facts and things that were right in front of my face but never processed before - like the front cloth on Zelda's skirt, all the symbols have meaning.  Definitely get this if you're a Zelda nerd (like me)!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Have for both my android and kindle it has problems loading data quite a bit. But still use because I need the weather.
B003XNTTYY|5.0|Simply couldn't put it down. A great story. one of my favorites in the Fantasy series.<br /><br />Will constantly advise others to pick up the whole trilogy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait till the next season starts! Needs to come soon.<br />This show is well made and has great cast.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book and have been reading it to my kids since I was pregnant with our 1st child. Hormones or no hormones, if you are a mom, it's probably going to make you cry. I understand how some people who are analyzing this book might say this book is creepy, but I think people get too caught up in the little details. Should the mother be breaking into her son's house/bedroom in the middle of the night? NO. But that's not the point of this book. The point of this book is to express the love a mother and child have. The love that a mother has for her child is unexplainable to anyone other than another mother. I'm not saying a father doesn't love their child, but there is something about growing another human inside of you.<br /><br />If you are the kind of person or have an older child who analyses everything, then maybe this book is simply not for you. BUT if you can just relax and feel how much love this mother has for her son, then this book is highly recommended, but fair warning to all mothers, you will most likely be fighting tears or weeping by the end of this book.<br /><br />Hint: I sing the song to my son every time the song comes up. He love's it!
B001NHNG64|3.0|Good tale.  I would compare it to a decent &#34;made for TV&#34; movie.  I read the book on a long airplane trip.
1616551607|5.0|If you have ever loved any bit of the Amano art, you will buy this.  It is worth *every* penny.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best balance of difficulty and hints. The puzzles are not too easy and the hints give you just enough information to get by when you're stuck.
B005PM3YII|5.0|What an end to an amazing trilogy. Characters you learn to love, and hate. with an ending that couldn't be done any better.<br /><br />Good job Brandon, Good job.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|What a fascinating young lady Malala is! She is so strong and worldly! I learned more about the Taliban and Pakistan by reading this book. I found this book to be suspenseful and so very informative!
B00FPM4IRO|3.0|My son had fun playing this game, but he finished it in a day.  To be fair, he is a clever gamer and picks up new games easily.
B006678VWA|5.0|I had to replace my copy of this movie and was scared that I would not be able to find the exact one that I had originally.This was exactly what I wanted and it arrived at an appropriate amount of time.
1449410243|5.0|This book is a great read, and you can only truly appreciate it if you've owned cats.  A great gift for a cat lover!
1931559317|4.0|Great charts. I love the way the atlas is organized by right ascension. Spiral binding is nice so it sits flat on a table, and can even be folded back on itself to easily hold in your hand and look at just one page. &#34;Pocket&#34; is a bit optimistic though, unless you have very large (7x10 inch) pockets. &#34;Handbook&#34; is more like it. Mine came with its cover on upside down, which was strange, but thanks to the spiral binding, I was able to easily pop it off and put it back on right-side-up.<br /><br />Stars are shown down to magnitude 7.6, which is perfect for most casual observers like me. People with very large telescopes and/or those working at very high magnifications might want to reference fainter stars, but that would require a bigger atlas.<br /><br />This book, along with &#34;Night Watch&#34; by Terence Dickinson are the two books every beginning astronomer should have, and both will be useful for many years.
B004N622EY|5.0|What a beginning, A Great introduction to such a damaged, and scary world, and the first in a trilogy i simply couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />An Excellent story. worth every minute of your time.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very good book.  A serious read to say the least.  It's a bit graphic, but the raw descriptions were needed to convey the real story.
B003R50FRI|1.0|Missed chance of good, possibly, great novel.<br />Good story lost in an orgy of inappropriate, frequently inaccurate & vacuous use of adjectives. Simply letting the story tell itself would have produced a better read.<br />Frequent creation of potentially good characters who remain two dimensional and who eventually drown in the adjectival swamp that is Shantaram.<br />Shame Ian Rankin didn't ghost write it then it would have been a potential classic.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Wow, this was really something. It was recommended by some women I work with. If you want an easy reading book, have at it. I'm glad I have it on my Kindle. I am not sure I could carry this and sit at the bread co. And read it. But that being said, I did have to read all three. Just don't tell my son.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is a long time resident in my CD player in my car.  I actually had some dude on a scooter pull up next to me and ask me to blast it when it was on &#34;Trouble&#34;.  Hilarious!  These songs all remind me of my 20's.
0316204366|5.0|Totally satisfied! I was happy when I received my produscy and now I'm a happy customer. I have no complaints whatsoever!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|OK so this isn't wound up tight wholesome, but wholesome.  Community and life lessons coupled with good costumes makes this a winner in my book!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Good game to play when you need to pass some time...My kids seem to like it a lot...but they also get mad
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Exceptional 3D, really immersed me and the sequel was even better than the original \\"Star Trek\\" also directed by JJ Abrams.<br />The action was relentless and the only thing I wanted to do after watching the movie for 2 hours and 10 minutes was to start it up again ...Benedict Cumberpatch is definitely one to watch for future movies, Chris Pine was another solid performance as was Zachary Quinto but I truly hope JJ Abrams continues to make this HIS franchise, anyone else has huge footsteps to fill and I doubt they will be as masterful.
B0053O89KG|5.0|As I have reviewed Castle DVDs before, I love this show. The price of the DVDs was good if you think about the amount of shows you get in one season. Most shows don't have this many.
B001O1O71C|5.0|It was a very sad inspiring story thar leaves you thinking about it for a few days it was a 5 star story
B002KJX4IE|3.0|Beetlejuice was fun, but a bit dated.  I thought I would enjoy it more.  I've never been a Tim Burton fan.
B001NA6096|1.0|I read the reviews for this series of movies and they were highly rated. The acting is good, but I found the story boring and stopped watching about a third of the way through.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|Absolutely Amazing!! One of the best albums I've ever heard. Loved them since 2007 And still do to this day!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I and my 10 year old son both read this book and we both really enjoyed it.  It is a great story for children his age that teaches about differences, kindness and everything in between.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|This is a great movie, movie by Queen, costumes, actors. This is such a fun, entertaining movie. I will email a quote to kids to see what I get back and it is always another good quote. See it for a night night
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show!  Love the cast.  Julianna Margulies & the rest are marvelous!  Watch it nice & you'll be hooked! Yay.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Hooked on this series. Watched Seasons 1-4 on Amazon Video Prime, now am spoiled and really don't like the commercial interruptions. This has great character development and surprising twists and turns in the plot.
0385350864|4.0|I was unsure about Bridget in her 50's at first, but about half way through the book it captured me.  I loved the finish, and can't wait for the movie!
B0037TPMOA|5.0|This book is a perfect example of why Stephen King is one of the best talents of his generation, hands down a great read
1439102813|5.0|It was very enlighening about an important topic that I can relate to.<br />An emotional story that could happen to anyone.<br />Well written and hard to put aside
B00DQQSD2W|5.0|This is a book that I had to have. I ordered it for my Kindle. The only problem is that I have one of the first Kindles and can't get the video input that comes with this book. As a Star Wars fan, I was very pleased to see new info on the making of the movies. I am curious to see what the actual book has to offer. I liked the info from the people in the backgrounds, computer techs, artists, sound people. I will probably get the book for my son, but the price is putting me off at this time
B005ZKYXZI|3.0|I honestly don't see how anyone over the age of 21 can find this movie satisfying. The kids acting leaves much to be desired as a lot of his dialogue seems unnatural and over-the-top. Sure the robot fight scenes draw you to the screen, but there's just too much overused plot mechanics and been there, seen that imagery to make it a must buy in my opinion.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|Watched Episodes 1 and 2 and decided I did not want to watch it anymore. Too much graphic violence and the feeling this could really happen and perhaps....has already has happened or is happening in our country and the world. Don't need anymore fear in my life.
B005PK56TA|4.0|It was a good storyline, you didn't know how it would conclude. It takes you a few episodes to figure out what is going on so it keeps you guessing and trying to figure out how it will go and end.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I recently purchased Chromecast due to a favorable review from a friend. It works quite well when I cast Netflix or Youtube videos from my iPhone. However, HuluPlus and Amazon Instant Video are not currently supported (I would give it 5 stars if they were). I haven't seen any significant drainage to my phone battery when using it to cast and I love that I can still check emails/facebook/etc while streaming.<br />The one other complaint that I have is that when casting from by Chrome browser, it tends to be a bit choppy. The audio and video do not always sync perfectly.<br /><br />All in all, if they offer Amazon video and Hulu casting, this will be one of my favorite products out there.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Yay! Very entertaining. I watched it with my kids (young teens), they enjoyed it as well. If you like Zombies watch it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Well, I read the other books, but this one went a bit far with risqué. The story(kidnapping,etc) was meh. At least the ending was ok.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I'm recommending this series to all of my friends. Great drama.  Excellent writing, plot twists, and character development. Watching this series is the highlight of my evenings. The dinner dishes cleared away, on these chilly fall evenings I take to my chair, fire up the iPad, and escape to view The Good Wife. I highly recommend!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game seems easy at first,but as you continue; it becomes more and more difficult. That's the challenging part! Gotta love challenging games. However, having to wait to pass an area is whack.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, love the ending or segway to book three. Congruent and in line with the first book and can't wait for the next movie.
0312983867|5.0|Another wonderful book in the Janet Evanovich series.  This one is as funny as the rest of them and I am on a goal to read them all!
B008J05EL8|1.0|I wish I had seen the reviews of this before I bought it. Won't open. Unusable, I want my money back. First time something I bought from Amazon has not been good.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I have always been a fan of Julie Andrews. And Sound of Music is a magnificent film. I give it my highest rating
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Great movie for anyone who likes action and comedy. Although some of the camera work is something to be desired it is good from start to finish
B00E0F9J44|5.0|STACEY KENT HAS GROWN UP!<br />HER VOICE HAS MATURED, AND THIS ALBUM IS SUPERB!<br />SHE HAS RELEASED ANOTHER CD ALMOST SIMULTANEITY WITH THIS ONE, ONLY IN BRASIL, \\"AO VIVO\\" WITH THE FABULOUS MARCOS VALLE CELEBRATING HIS 50 YEARS IN MUSIC.<br />HER HUSBAND ON SAX, MUST BE GIVEN THE SAME HIGH CREDITS AS THESE TWO!<br />\\"THE FACE I LOVE\\" IS PERFORMED ON BOTH CDS AND STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT.<br />WOW, STACEY ..............I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND WHICH OF THESE CDS ARE MY FAVORITE FOR 2013!<br />IF YOU LOVE STACEY'S BRASILIAN INFLUENCE ON HER TWO NEW CD'S, YOU'LL ALSO LOVE KARRIN ALLYSON'S \\"IMAGINA\\", NOMINATED FOR A GRAMMY IN 2008.<br />LOVE YA STACEY!<br />DAVE EBERSOLE
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It kept me interested throughout with its psychological and legal aspects but a few things didn't sit right with me.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|Fantastic Box Set...47 CD's with a deluxe box and hardbound book...At the time I paid $179.99 for this item and honestly I am delighted.  Sound quality is PERFECT and for the price you cannot beat this deal...period!
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Helen Fielding does not disappoint with her third novel in the Bridget Jones series.  This fun, light hearted read takes on parenting and being, \\"a woman of a certain age\\". Highly recommend for a good laugh!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. The book was recommended by my son in law. It was very graphic and I could &#34;see&#34; the horror that was taking place but it is not the kind of reading that I like. I am going to try again sometime, but never at night
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great watch! Very interesting and entertaining. The history of that studio and how things worked out is amazing.  Watch if You have some free time.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|All that needs to be said is ELTON JOHN will always be 5 stars and more with me even if this product came broken and totally unusable (Which it didn't, it was the exact opposite) . It was just as perfect as I hoped for and (wouldn't have it any other way :) I bought it just to have the CD and make any sort of contribution to my absolute Favorite musician and brilliant lyricist Bernie Taupin and everyone else who assisted with the making of this wonderful CD. I would recommend buying anything and everything about Elton John just from my opinion and from the overall buying shipping experience through Amazon. Also the free Autorip MP3 version was awesome being able to listen to all the tracks right when they were released instead of having to wait for it to arrive.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Sad this book is over. What a great read and to have perspective from the German side also. One of those books I can't stop thinking about.
B001CTUI8M|5.0|Let's face it. If you want one of the GREATEST concert experiences you will EVER have, GET. THIS. CONCERT!!!! Whether you are a Metal head, Classical fan, Symphonic fan, Gothic freak, Musician, or a self-proclaimed \\"Music Snob\\" (like me), you will NOT be disappointed. I discovered Within Temptation in 2003 and have been a massive fan ever since. This concert DVD is as close as you can get to experiencing the real thing. The orchestra, Gregorian choir, the guest vocalist and the band make this exactly what it should be...an EXPERIENCE!!!<br /><br />(*****)<br /><br />**NOTICE** I had this concert on the standard DVD and ordered this blu-ray for the best possible quality. Although, it states \\"All Regions\\" It DOES NOT play on Region 1 devices, which SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE CLEAR!! BOO!! on the seller!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Build more rooms please!  I really like this game and so does my family.  It's challenging but not so challenging that you give up.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love this show and I believe this is my favorite season so far. Anyone who likes detective, fun tv shows should give it a try. The price was good. A lot more episodes than I got with Bones
B004G7UTXG|5.0|Compelling story beautiful cinema photography. Very well portrayed.<br />Worthwhile movie to watch , exposes the<br />aravice extreme cruelty and hypocracy of the 18th century Spanish and Portuguese imperialist perpetrators and slavers.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|OMG best game ever. Just try it for once. Some people get one app and say it's bad. But not me.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Excellent writing, very good dynamic amongst the cast.  I only wish it didn't die. The worlds of Joss Whedon never disappoint, and simply amaze.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I LOVE this album.  I recently saw them live and they put on a fantastic show.  I brought a few friends that hadn't heard much from the Lumineers and they are now huge friends as well.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A delightful book. The characters are wonderfully flawed and complex. I felt Don's rational and logical thought processes, and watched as the story unfolded in a most unique way.  Funny and heartfelt, definitely an enjoyable, light read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Its a nice game. very time consuming and addictive. sometimes the game steals your extra lives though. The game also blocks your moves sometimes so be careful.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This one of the most superb shows on television.  Everything about the show is near perfection. Looking forward to the next season.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I don't have much to say about this product, it came in a nice boxing, clean build and the performance is good enough for whoever wants to use such adapters, haven't had real problems with it but I've noticed a drop in my internet speed, not significant but noticeable.<br /><br />In general if you are looking for a secondary networking solution its the thing to buy.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|We all search for ourselves. But for some it is hard to find the path and love we are all meant for. This is a lovely story of two people finding each other.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movied.  Overall I was not disappointed nor did I lose interest during the movie.  I thought Reese Witherspoon played a larger role but all in all I enjoyed this movie.
B003G94BZC|4.0|Matt Smith enters the picture. It takes some time to get used to the new Doctor.  Other than a few outlyer episodes, this season was GREAT!
B008KE3960|5.0|Very entertaining game, and challenging. You will have hours of entertainment. The graphics are very good and it can turn to be addictive
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Great show, second season is better than the first.  Entertaining and funny with a reasonable amount of wit.  I do like White Collar a little better but this is close.  Some of the plots are not very developed and don't make much sense.  Lots are little things are not thought through, one cut he is riding a bike with a helmet and skids up to Jane without one.  It kind of makes it fun to find all the little faults.  Some of the acting is quite good.  All and all an entertaining program that my wife and I enjoy no matter how unbelievable it is.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I Ilke. the game but I'm clueless on how to actually earn the last few stars of a level without paying.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I purchased this as a present for a friend of mine. She absolutely loves it and the fact that the screen can rotate :)
B004LROUW2|2.0|Well written, but when I finished the book it struck me that the main characters are a pedophile and a murderer.  Murakami cleverly manages to make them into heroes.  Interesting writing techniques, but a bit bizarre and sex-obsessed.  The book really is over-hyped.
B008KGPEQG|2.0|Beautiful prose & at times lyrical. However the flow of his thought I found distracting & often pulled me out of his story because I would need to go back  to reread a passage because I couldn't follow his convulted thought process. This may not bother others, but it was a big negative distraction for me to the point of not caring about his journey.
B00000ITOY|5.0|My 2 year old plays with this puzzle everyday. This product teaches dexterity, and helps children to learn their colors, and their shapes.  This toy is durable. I would buy this toy again, and I am buying it for my sister's three year old daughter for Christmas this year.<br />  It is amazing how much improvement in dexterity that my two year old has after working on this puzzle everyday for 4 weeks. It is a must have educational toy!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Time stopped for me when I took the time to read this intriguing story. Unlike any book I have ever read.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|An insight into the frailties of human nature in very diverse environments. The quest for Abdullah to re-unite with his sister Pari, who was gifted when young, to a wealthy family leads to strong character development by the author of all those who touched the lives of the brother and sister throughout decades. An engrossing read
B00C7607BC|5.0|This classic Disney is remastered well :) Love this story! I sing every song of course much to the dismay of my husband.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|This was amazing.  Just wonderful.  Beautiful cinematography, wonderful cast, humor and drama, a real love story.  I highly recommend this.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|BOORING & Rambles on & on. I did finish the book but don't know why! The ending was POOR & incomplete.
B004DF3S7A|5.0|such sweet songs to make my day ... love love love rod stewarts beautiful voice ... wish i had more
B00G32TD98|1.0|The movie was voted on by my cousins and I. It lost to &#34;The Purge,&#34; by a 5-4 margin. So i saw it later on with free rental credits from Amazon Instant Video.  There are two families that you'll follow during the story. First, a couple that I'll term &#34;Ghost Busters&#34; and a family of seven.  This film is filled with cliches. You know what is bound to happen from Point A, to Point Z. There are no twists or turns.  Don't buy this film under any circumstances. Don't even rent it.  Just watch it on HBO/Starz/Showtime, or even Netflix/Amazon Prime (if and when it comes out to streaming.)  I still regret losing those free credits.
B00E66QPCG|4.0|I have just read it.It looks interesting. If on trial I find it to be good I will upgrade to 5 stars
B0098QBEXO|3.0|This movie is decent, but sad.  It's a story of a dying man, and his final days.  I tend to enjoy films more when there are men and women together, and this was a boy's trip to the sea.  I enjoyed Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, as always.  Just would have liked it more if females were present.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Simple. Smart. Funny. Read it all in one day! Makes you look at things from a different angle. Loved it.
B005MLOOJA|3.0|Good show.  I cannot get into the whole &#34;Will/Alicia/Peter&#34; love triangle.  Think it weakens the show as a whole.  I like her being on the fence of her marriage but I think Will is to tv cliche. Michael J Fox raises the show every time he makes an appearance.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Totally hooked on watching this show.  Almost caught up to the current show. My husband and I love it. Great show!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Had such a description of the games and the setting and characters<br />In my opinion it was the best book ever
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This such a great show!! It is funny, exiting and the cast is so good. It's like XFiles and Buffy's love child.

B00EAM8RR2|4.0|My 8 year old has been begging for a TSimulator for years!  He takes immaculate care of his models and I finally gave in.  He specifically asked for this simulator after watching many a YouTube videos.  He absolutely loves it & I had to download &#34;Big Boy&#34;, his favorite Steam engine.  Works great on our old Dell Comp.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Celine is amazing as usual,she really delivers on this one... she puts so much feeling into this album her sound is fresh yet familiar... no wonder she's the biggest selling female artist of ALL TIME!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|WARNING: this book will make you cry.  It's worth it. You may have to read the first couple of chapters twice.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Awesome ending for an awesome series.  Kept you on your toes the entire book!  Perfectly written and executed!  I enjoyed each and every book start to finish!

B001BC5HXG|5.0|East of Eden follows the story of a family that covers four generations, starting in New England and ending up in the Central Californian Coast. Steinbeck does a masterful job of painting a complete and visceral picture of the Salinas Valley in the early 1900s. The gorgeous pastoral landscape. The way of life, from the farmers who tilled the fields to businessmen riding into the fields in their Fords. Even the detailed steps it takes to start one of those old Fords is written with such painstaking detail, that you really get inside the heads of his characters, hearing their voices and experiencing the world through their senses. In a lot of ways, the Central Coast still looks the same, and to read a book like East of Eden gives a rich and poignant perspective of what it was like a hundred years ago.<br /><br />Two of the characters in the book especially stand out to me. The first is Cathy Ames. Cathy represents some of the ways that Steinbeck falls short. In many ways, she represents what men fear. She is murderous and uses her sexuality as a weapon. She ends up running a brothel, where she takes photographs of powerful men in Salinas in compromised positions that she saves in a safe deposit box in case she ever wants to blackmail them. As she grows old, she's painted less as a person and as more of a caricature, she spends her time sitting in a room with walls that are painted grey. Her hands grow knobby and grotesque with arthritis. She's difficult to relate to, she doesn't have any redeeming traits that help us as readers understand why she acts the way she does. And when she drinks, Steinbeck goes a little over the top, putting her in an uncontrollable rage where she hones in on the specific fears of the people she's with, destroying their character from within. She's less less than human, foil to everything that's honest and hardworking in the book. A manifestation of evil.<br /><br />On the other hand, there's Lee, a Chinese-American with an incredible back story, also steeped in Californian history, as he's brought over from China as the son of railroad workers. One of the amazing things about Lee is how carefully Steinbeck crafts his character at a time when a majority of the American public would not have been so sensitive. This book was written in 1952; because of the Chinese exclusion act of 1882, Chinese immigrants weren't given the same opportunities as other immigrants until 1965. What's more, Steinbeck explores what it was for Lee to live in his own skin as kind of a paradox, illustrating the idea of double consciousness from a uniquely Chinese American point of view. The people around him as an uneducated Chinese immigrant, when in reality he's an American Citizen and a University of Californian graduate. As a Chinese American, this is something that even today I can relate to. Lee is portrayed in a fair and believable light, and in many ways is the moral backbone of the novel.<br /><br />With a two-part movie on the way staring Jennifer Lawrence, I'm curious to see how this 700-page novel is going to be condensed into several hours of screen time, and what they'll omit in the transition from page to silver screen. Whatever the case, East of Eden is a beautifully written book, that despite it's flaws, captures a time in California's history that's gone but not forgotten.tory, also steeped in Californian history, as he's brought over from China as the son of railroad workers.

B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The movie was put together well, however it doesn't leave much for replay value. Great flick for the guy with the know it all complex.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Was wonderful!  Looking forward to the next one.  I didn't realize Anthony Hopkins was in it.  Makes it an even better movie!
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I loved Khaled Hosseini's other books but was so disappointed in this one. I am two-thirds of the way through and haven't picked it up in 2 months and, frankly, I don't care. I usually am a trouper and believe in persevering and finishing a book. But I can't bring myself to keep going with so many other great books out there waiting to be read. I usually love books set in cultures/countries different than my own, but I did not relate to the characters and found the plot to be disjointed. I expected a powerful read and am totally underwhelmed.

B00F91H666|5.0|This movie is exciting and grimly cruel. With the circumstances the writing leaves for certain scenarios this story could make a good zombie video game for once.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book. The unholy alliance between the giant food producers, the government overseers of processed food, and the financial sector has led to an epidemic of obesity--as well as poor nutrition--that not only will destroy the health care system of the USA, but also is being exported to the rest of the world.  When the British minister of health can say that he is not worried about the rising costs of health care because British people will begin to die earlier as a result of their awful diets (and binge drinking and smoking--which are problems in the USA as well), so it is counter-productive to develop wellness programs designed to wean people off of the kinds of processed foods that are killing them, it got almost no press in the USA.  Well, the same goes here--even more than in the UK--because the government is clearly expecting a cost savings as the morbidity rate (very expensive) is replaced by a mortality rate (cheap) and therefore has few incentives to get people to eat healthier food that is better for them.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Awesome!!! I love the plot twists and turns. I enjoy how it keeps my mind wondering, trying to figure out who's behind what!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A wonderful escape from the ordinary, I want to read more about the adventures of the peculiar children. Very well written.
B003GQM52Q|5.0|Very good quality.  The streaming quality and content was excellent.  Th efilm was high quality but a bit too long.
B005544V6A|5.0|Silly concept, but I LOVE this show! Please bring all of them to PRIME! The show is clever and witty, with this unique relationship.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I just started this book and just want to keep on reading it.  Very good characters and interacting with one another.  I enjoy his writing and will read the next one in this series.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It was a chore just to get through this book. It was unsatisfying and at times boring.<br />The author took this series in the wrong direction after Divergent.<br /><br />The characters have been developed in a way that I don't like most of them, I find some of them annoying, and others I just want to go away.<br /><br />Wheeewww...glad to be done with this series and move on to something new.<br /><br />I doubt they make a movie for the complete trilogy. I just don't see it happening unless they rewrite the story completely.

B00D3Y1C8Y|3.0|The reason why it give it a 3 is because of the assembly was nothing less than troublesome. I can only speak for myself but i encountered 2 problems with one of them being serious. Firstly, and may be negligible for most is that the figure doesn't properly attach to all its pegs. For my i'm able to attach his back foot and plastic side pieces into their pegs but when i try to muscle his front foot into its pegs the figure fails to maintain itself on the pegs.<br /><br />The second and the potentially troublesome problem is the deal with attaching the swords. Upon first attempt of attaching the swords i struggled trying to fit the swords into his hands because it at first seemed as if they don't fit since i was having a hard time. Bottom line it takes a little muscle/force to get the handle into hands. when i got the general idea i was able to get one of the swords into one hand but when i noticed i put the other sword incorrectly i tried to remove it but that too required a bit of force to remove which ultimately lead to me accidentally breaking my sword. I will admit it is partially my fault cause i found out a much easier method of removing swords but the assembly is simply not user friendly in my opinion. They should have some how limited the assembly like what they did with luffy and what i can assume in the upcoming sanji figure. All I can say is handle with caution.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|Very enjoyable music but the LP version sounds like a mp3 mix. 4 stars for the content, 0 stars for the sound quality (flat, lifeless and over-compressed). If you are a vinyl convert this is one to stay away from.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Haven't had a lot of time to get into it deeper. It is challenging and a good mind worker.  I appreciate that!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Maybe I'm just easy to please, but I really don't understand the bad reviews! I loved this!<br /><br />I've loved this series since I first tore through Divergent, and I really felt the last book in this trilogy did not disappoint.<br /><br />I love the turn this book took and the explanation as to what is outside the fence. I had my own theories too, but I like how the changes forced some of the characters to evolve. Four is no longer the bad-ass he was in the first two novels... but that is ok! It's more realistic to me. All of the crap everyone has gone through... I think some of the twists that made people mad are some of the things that made the story more believable, to me. In a dystopian novel, the ones I love the most are those that seem somehow realistic and like something that could actually happen. All of the GD/GP things... hello, things like trying to create the perfect race HAS HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE! The events in this book were not that much of a stretch for me.<br /><br />End rant.<br /><br />In  Allegiant, the characters you've come to love are all there, yet things have changed so drastically the things that used to  be so important to them, like factions, aren't anymore. I think the twist was so relevant yet surprising, and I love some of the deeper meanings that came about. \\"...But now I'm wondering if I need it anymore, if we ever really need these words, \\"Dauntless,\\" \\"Erudite,\\" \\"Divergent,\\" \\"Allegiant,\\" or if we can just be friends or lovers or siblings, defined instead by the choices we make and the love and loyalty that binds us.\\"<br /><br />Come on. That's good stuff.<br /><br />I'm struggling writing this review because this book was so multi-layered. I don't want to give too much away and spoil it for anyone.<br /><br />I'll end with this- I love reading trilogies, and some trilogies leave a lot to be desired by the time the last book in the series comes around. This is not one of those books. The story does not fizzle away, it is not a stereotypical fairy tale ending, yet all of the loose ends are tied up. I'll concede, I would like to have known more about certain things, like how the conflict ends, more about the Bureau, and more about the aftermath. But I think that's just my being greedy. For me, this is truly one of those books and series that I didn't want to end, and I'll end up coming back to read this again and again.<br /><br />Well done! I can't wait to see the movies.ereotypical fairy tale ending, yet all of the loose ends are tied up.

B00E97AZZK|5.0|A fun movie that will keep you guessing  until the end. It's just as good to watch the second time around.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|The free preview contains the only good scene in this movie..... I too was climbing the wall; for the closing credits!
B00000IQW5|5.0|Have loved this movie for years and am very pleased to find my own copy of it to enjoy whenever l want to...thank you!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Highly amuseing and extremely cute. I enjoyed it for awhile but then sadly became kinda boring once you used all your gold but of course I still check on my adorable dragons occasionly
0316219266|5.0|A fast paced page turner. This is a MUST read book for any amazon customer.  There is a cost to the con inane and low cost of buying from amazon. One day you will wake up and have no other choices.  We perhaps walmart will stil exist...  But who wants to live in a world with only two retailers?
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a fun game to waste some free time with.<br />Its doesn't cost you anything to play which is nice for a change.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's a good game to have. It's easy to learn and fun to play! You can hunt many different animals on many different levels. And you can use many different guns so it never gets old!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Lots of fun...great likeness to the movie!!  Will keep you busy with all the fights and upgrades, etc. Adults and kids will totally be into this game.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I decided to read this book because my grandson was totally engrossed in the story.  I found it well written and full of intriguing psychological plots that unfolded into a believable story.
B009949RKC|5.0|This was the older Carrie from 1976. I didn't remember seeing it but wanted to before I saw the remake on Halloween. Not the kind of movie I usually watch so I ever surprised myself realizing it was really good.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|i have ordered these a couple times because i always lose my kindle charge, the are a great amazon product and work amazingly for a android phone if you have one. it charges them really fast. the cord is durable and long, but i gave it four stars because it doesnt come with a wall plug in.
0345404475|4.0|Bought this book for one of my classes. It's a good read. I would recommend it to anyone interested in SciFi
B007T8BYWE|5.0|so cool try it it has math and it is just fun I really think that you should get it and it is free so everything works out I love it and.you will to
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love this app... I've read a lot of negative reviews but those people are crazy lol ... because this game is awesome. Don't pay for tokens stupid u can replenish within an hour and or if you actually win... It's classic uno and it's great
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|But couldn't stop reading. A page turner start to finish .  I love the sense of visiting with characters I've met before. John Grisham easily my favorite author.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just as good as the first if not better I can not wait to read the third
B00BIPCY14|5.0|Very smart, well written show that never does the same case twice. It is always interesting and often catches me off guard. A must see.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. Having read the book, I was skeptical that a movie could do it justice but I was wrong, it was fantastic. Definitely worth watching again!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Once again another solid album from the mighty Stryper. I'm a first day buyer and I'm not even into the jesus thing. I simply think Stryper rocks and love their sound. They do a great cover of The Doobie Brothers 'Jesus Is Just Alright'.
081099741X|4.0|The book was wonderful and the shipping was very fast. But the packaging was absolutely pitiful. The book was rattling around in a box far too large for it with a few large plastic bubbles thrown in offering only minimal protection. I'm amazed that the corners of the book's cover weren't more badly damaged.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive!  I now have it on my Kindle HD, my ipod, my smartphone, and my Samsung tablet.  They are all on different levels.  Sometimes if I'm really into it or want to occupy my mind, when I run out of lives on one, I pick up one other one.  Someone had posted they would like a undo button - I agree.  Just to be able to use it at least once  on a level.
B00BIPORC8|5.0|Very smart, well written show that never does the same case twice. It is always interesting and often catches me off guard. A must see. The dynamics between the characters gets better the longer the show goes. Introducing new characters each season keeps it fresh.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this story from the beginning of Divergent to the end of Allegiant.  The relationship between Tris and Tobias was very believable and it was easy to get caught up in their story. Love, friendship, tragedy, struggles, sacrifices and finding forgiveness....this trilogy has it all. Definitely a series I will be reading again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's fast paced whth lots of things to unlock. It even has daily and weekly challenges. It's a lot better than the first Temple Run. I recommend it to any and everyone.
B005K17RU0|2.0|This app was better before it was condensed. They show all the information on one page in such a way that you are not always sure what you are looking at. It used to have little notes on what types of activities were not advisable and warnings, but not anymore. There attempt to streamline it ended in disarray. There have got to better weather apps than this.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I was addicted to this game almost instantly! The graphics, the guns, the controls, and just about everything is FREAKING AWESOME!
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|with that aside, I do like the general functionality of the app for the most part. the first bonus listed on the go premium is that u can see your notes offline, but as far as I could tell, you can anyway. which is good; if I cant access my info offline, I wont bother using the app at all.  In comparison to springpad: evernote has cleaner, easier to use features. springpad's notebook page is better looking and u have a social feature where u can follow other notebooks; I did not see that on evernote.  evernote has a few 1ups over springpad, but I wont use it anyway because I don't see why it would need access to so Much personal information.  I find it absurd esp when they just published in TIME magazine that they wont misuse or sell your info or ever flood us with ads... so why do they need our contacts and private info?
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I loved all the historical aspects and an explanation of the time.  What I found difficult was the jumping around in dates.
0316204366|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Gladwell. This isn't his best.<br />First off, most of the &#34;coolest&#34; ideas in the book are well - if not better - explained in free videos online as Gladwell is captured providing speeches (most notably, at Google).  Alternately, and this is not entirely unusual for Gladwell, some of the best stories to bring the concepts to life were already told in The New Yorker - and available free online. It made me feel cheated that as I completed the book, I didn't feel like the experience of reading it had added much to my learning.<br />The core idea - that Goliath can often be beaten by reframing or challenge at hand - is powerful. But the book did not advance this argument as deeply as I was expecting.<br />Further ideas advanced were not as compelling as I expected.<br />Overall, Gladwell has furthered the conversation in the area of advancing causes and ideas by changing the mental model in which they are addressed. He provides us compelling and engaging stories to provide us examples and motivation to use the ideas ourselves. You just don't need to buy this book to get everything you need to make that happen.
1846573785|5.0|this book is very misleading you have to get further into it and then you are stuck there is more to the story then just dominatrix it's a love story and this isa great trilogy
B0066WJLU6|5.0|works consistently: excellent brightness and has multiple options for the type of lighting that you can use for different situations.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I played this game for a while, not doing very well and having problems with the app freezing. I was jealous of my friends who had Candy Crush Saga and were having so much fun. Well I fixed my Dash app and began to see progress and more fun as I advanced . I would give it 5 stars if it could better explain how to play.the game. I finally got Candy Crush, but I think I enjoy this app better.
B00EYE0ECW|1.0|This app was not good even though it was free, the app sucks on the Kindle and I deleted it with in 5 minutes of downloading it.  Stay clear of this app
0316219266|2.0|Well, such a kerfuffle! I've even been sent a copy all the way from London to review in my lotus-eating paradise of Prospero's Cell, Main Street, Corfu.  I suspect the editor wants me to feign a few beans to spill from my six years as a rep/Quality Assurance hack but I never saw nuffink as a mere galley slave down in the bowels of the Good Ship Bezos. Speaking of which, one thing this Stone book brouhaha has exposed are the wide-spread and varied mispronunciations of his name. Also, living in Greece, I meet many a preening son of Homer claiming JP as their own. Stuff and nonsense, except as the saying goes, We're all Greeks.<br /><br />Stone has his agenda and his research and few writers have the balls to jettison painstaking homework merely to tighten their tale and smooth the flow for the reader. I found it great fun to read from hindsight perspective what had been going on above the salt with the toffs 'upstairs': the 'Zon may be tight-lipped with journos and the snoopy 4th Estate but we worker ants lived with a vibrant grapevine jig-saw of what was going on or coming down the pike - we just didnt know where all the pieces went at the time, and nor were we that interested. Too busy on the road to World Domination under our Glorious Leader.<br /><br />Where Stone's pen falters - not surprising for an outsider - is in failing to capture the team spirit and camaraderie. In the early days, of course, it was the Wild West and I wish I was back there with the finest bunch of loose cannons that e'er ran a bad book or took a cold escalation ~ I'd trade the clear lagoons of Palaiokastritsa any day for one chilly Christmas shift's packing and rubbing shoulders with the real heros down among the shelves. Concocting those woolly replies under the stern lash of the Blurb Goddess as those wizard leads and boffins wrote tools on the fly to hack solutions literally to order.<br /><br />Damn'd good PR from Bezos' missus, of course. Let a thousand orders bloom! Let the Bezosian coffers bulge!<br /><br />La Mackenzie knows *her* facts from the Horse's Mouth, and Stone knows his for what his publisher ordered. Who cares if the Stone purple prose is a bit wonky here and there? So, after all, is the Amazon he's probing and exposing.<br /><br />Anyone wanting to know what goes on in the engine room or has vented on some hapless rep, \\"Where's mah stuff?\\" - this is the handbook for you. For me, it brought back glorious memories of trysts and tantrums, love among the Unix, bonding and back-stabbing ... as unrobotic a time as I'll ever be privileged to enjoy. Aye, lad, the sort of mates you'd want in a tight spot; eagle-eyed managers, piratical leads, wingmen who lacked only the cloaks. We shall not see their likes again.offers bulge!<br /><br />La Mackenzie knows *her* facts from the Horse's Mouth, and Stone knows his for what his publisher ordered.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Good writing and therefore good read, I guess.  I liked the Hunger Games and Catching Fire better. I am not impressed by the last few chapters. I am trying not to give too much away with my review. I am not disappointed  with who she ended up with, just the fate of Prim.
B003YCIE68|5.0|Love how truth meets with magic and wonder that loves on for those who looks and desire it. Something for all to share.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|To be honest, while I overall liked the direction Eminem was starting to go with his last album, Recovery, part of me didn't like the fact that his flow didn't seem as multi-dimensional as it once was on his early albums. When I heard about this new album I wasn't sure Em would be able to live up to the expectations and hype of pulling off a \\"MMLP2\\"... But I am here to let you know that not only does this album live up to its hype, it blows the hype out of the water. This album is amazing, both lyrically and beat wise. I was pleasantly surprised with how great of a mixture it was musically/lyrically. Multiple flows (Rap God alone!) and I have to say that this album truly cements Eminem's legacy as, easily, one of the greatest rappers of all time.

B00E9HML1Q|5.0|Peter Jackson delivered the first film of THE HOBBIT trilogy to a great deal less acclaim than was received by any of the films in the Lord of the Rings cycle. When I first saw THE HOBBIT (in digital 48 frame per second projection), I did not understand the disappointment. I thought the film fully delivered. And the Extended Edition delivers even more. Without doubt, I can say that this will become the version I look to when I wish to screen the series. This film down not have as much new material as was added to the films in the first trilogy. Undoubtedly, Jackson has the confidence of the studios and can now create and deliver a &#34;Tolkien film&#34; of virtually whatever length he wants. There's no need to leave out a story line to save time. I can't imagine a studio executive getting nervous over Peter Jackson (and Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) working with this material. Consequently, there is less meat to pack onto the bones. What's there, though, is at least pleasing and at best thrilling. I never thought I'd get LOTR or THE HOBBIT on film with such care...or that the films would become such popular successes. My son (to whom I read &#34;Shelob's Lair&#34; at age 5) and I agree that this is a multi-million dollar fan project and everyone else can just come along for the ride. Thankfully, there are millions of fans.<br /><br />I have not yet completed the Appendices, but what I have viewed gives me full faith and confidence that Team Jackson is packing in detail far past the ordinary &#34;Making of...&#34; featurettes. The package also includes this little statue (little, hah!) of Gollum regarding Bilbo from above just before starting their game of Riddles in the Dark. It's lovely and worth the cost of the item entirely on its own. The video and audio (viewed on a 57&#34; DLP screen with 7.1 DTS-HD Master sound) is delightful. The package is a total winner and makes me even more eager for December 13 and the next film in the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! I love playing it. I have been waiting for it to get to kindle fire. oh yea baby!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works OK for my NEXUS 7 Tablet. But My laptop PC (Aspire 5740, Window 7) cannot find the Chromecast device, it doesn't work as claimed.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game. The levels keep getting harder but it is a fun game and I could play it fir hours.
B001BANK32|4.0|I just read The Shining for the first time in thirty years in preparation for Dr. Sleep. The first time I read it, I was twelve, and no - I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR TWELVE YEAR OLDS. You know your kids - you can figure out what they should be reading. But I digress.<br /><br />I found a few things really interesting about the experience of rereading, each involving either the success or failure of my memory. First, I was amazed at whole passages that were emblazoned on my twelve year old brain and consequently recognized by my forty-two year old brain. Second, I've read a bunch of Stephen King since then, and my opinion is that he gets better as the years roll by. So when I revisit one of his early books, I'm surprised at how accomplished he was even in those first few offerings. My biggest complaint about Stephen King is that his great strengths - his imagination and describing the inner lives of his characters - are often undermined when it is time for the story to be driven by events rather than characters. The Shining is no exception. So I marveled at his literary descriptions of Jack's regrets and struggles because in my selective memory, The Shining was just a book about a haunted hotel and a crazy person. Which brings me to the third thing. Like many people, I've seen the iconic Stanley Kubrick film version of The Shining a few times, all since my first reading of the novel. The film tainted my memory of major plot points, including who lives and who dies. So it was very interesting to contrast what happens in the novel that doesn't in the film and vice versa. Kubrick succeeded in making a great horror film, but as an adaptation, it's a failure. It was nice to return to the source and set the record straight in my own memory.<br /><br />One final note - I enjoyed Dr. Sleep immensely and unless you have read The Shining in the last few years, I would recommend rereading it before moving on to the sequel.
B0087DIEGE|4.0|Much more convenient than the standard lens cap and only mildly dorky looking!  ;-)  It seems well made and it is easy to replace if one of the flip out panels does become damaged.  I just threads in so you do have to take a tiny bit of care to get it lined up correctly if you care about that.
B004WKI204|4.0|I hadn't really seen any of Tina's work, but I found this an enjoyable read. It was entertaining but also poignant with her family relationships. I wanted to know more about her work.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think is a very fun and chill game. I think you should diffently try it if you are thinking about it.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Great read as always. Just wish it didn't have such bad language in it. Would be just as good without it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Cool app! You get to design his or her hair however you want, not how the game tells you! You can design many styles, too.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|There was no question that in this book David would fight Steelheart. The only question was would we have fun joining David on his quest?<br /><br />Megan and David where the only characters I connected with. Though Prof.s background, despite the fact that I guessed it early, was well written, too. The other characters were stock and I never got a good picture of them.<br /><br />It was obvious from the start that David would fall in love with Megan. But it wasn't obvious whether she would ever love him back.<br /><br />When the Brandon Sanderson hinted some truths about Megan, it made me wonder how he would handle his direction. Would he be predictable? He ended up not being only half predictable (but in a good way) and half unpredictable.<br /><br />I also wondered who Brandon Sanderson would kill off and was a bit surprised there.<br /><br />I liked this book and will read the next one for sure.
B00CHVIAS4|4.0|We watched this movie with 5 adults and a 6 year old child.  All of us were thoroughly entertained.  Lots of humor, both for the adult and child.  Top notch animation, especially in 3D (at one point there were embers from a fire floating around and one adult said: \\"don't let those burn the carpet\\").  I highly recommend this to adults and children alike... especially in 3D.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Tell the real weather wether its cold or hot. I really love the views and the real time map during the day.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Great read as always. Just wish it didn't have such bad language. It would be just as good without it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|A great app. Easy to use and has good information. I would highly recommend it. A good price for a good product.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|The book is fine - typical Grisham.  My problem, however, is with the editing of the book: the word y'all is repeatedly misspelled as &#34;ya'll&#34; throughout. It's ridiculous, especially for a book written by a Southern writer and set in the South! Y'all is a contraction of You All and the apostrophe takes the place of the &#34;ou.&#34; So irritating to keep seeing this, at least in the Kindle edition.
B0011U5E1S|5.0|This is definitely one of their greatest albums!  This is a compilation of all their greatest songs on one album!  What's not to like?
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I am using it, but find it a bit fussy.  Simplifying the settings would be an improvement.  Simple is always best.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I absolutely love The tudors season 1 series, and I am now hooked and half way through Tudors season 2
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|Too much.there was no need for 3<br />Melissa even couldnt save the movie. ......... Get the identity thief instead. U're welcome.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I'm quickly becoming a huge fan of Ian Fleming! Once again I had planned my week to read this each night and once again I could not put it down.  There is some interesting irony in this thriller involving Hitler.  Stevenson's words make you feel, hear and experience all of the action. Simply awesome.<br /><br />This is another must read for anyone...you'll enjoy all of it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm about 45% through 11/22/63. Soo far its a good read, not your typical spine tingling, scared of the dark Stephen King novel, but the story is very interesting. We follow Jake AKA George through &#34;the rabbit hole&#34; back in time in an attempt to change the past for the better of the future. Problem is the past doesn't like being changed....hoaa-hoaa-hoaa (evil laugh).<br /><br />Puts me more in mind of Shawshank or Green Mile....hmmm...bet it would make a good movie too. Overall I like it and can't wait to see where the other 55% of the book takes me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|There are no problems with this app. It's my favorite game not only because I'm a lonely person(lol) it's a game that doesn't have any problems in any way. It's a really great app. I love it!!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|i thought this book was AMAZING! it was action packed, and made me lol! it was like a book of things that you would never believe! action, adventure,and sickness in one! how brilliant, right?!?! so join Casey and Carter as they go through some pretty wierd change and cool surprises. i hope you like this book as muchas i did!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I really hate this game. I do not understand why everybody loves it so much! it really is a waste of seven good dollars.  The graphics are.pretty bad and there really is no use for this game... I would understand if this was free or 99&cent;, but not $6.99. This really is not worth it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|very fun game a nice way to pass the time. Gets challenging after a while. this is something that even I like as an adult and kids with love.
B001LF3YQK|2.0|The red slider does not seal and the wipes dry out. I had to duck tape it in place to make it functional.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I wish you didn't have to pay real money for crystals.or maybe not so much money.its kinda of crazy.I don't think I'm going to get very far in this game.I did pay for some crystals then the game started to act up.I was told to reload the game  and lost all my ponys and crystals that I played real money for.not happy.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Quickly shipped, Just what I wanted. Now I can enjoy the world of star wars on blue ray and relive history.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Overacting, boring storyline, I gave it two stars just for colors and beauty. They didn't connect you with the main characters enough, so I didn't feel sad when bad things happened.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|This is another great album from Arcade Fire, they have a different sound, but still that same clever song-writing and social commentary. I think this is another contender for Album of the Year for sure.
B0047SHEAK|5.0|This made me want to be a predator. But we are already. So, in my professional opinion, this movie is about our animalistic behaviors we are endowed with and how they conflict with our desire for humanity in our actions
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Too Addictive! I think the developers relied heavily on players getting &#34;stuck&#34; and desperately spending the few extra coins to proceed to the next level. However, with patience, all levels are eventually passable.
B00G32PQNA|4.0|Well acted and polished.  Real emotion on display by credible couple. Fast paced with few cuts.  Classic installment in a classic series if not as uplifting as the predecessors.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is easy to use, educational and fun. I'm telling everyone to try it!<br />Whether you're trying out a new language or just want to brush up on one you used to know, this app is for you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful witty humor and tragedy so this season does not dissappoint the many fans of Downton Abby and the last episode leaves you curious about Season Four.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I am so glad they got this working on the Kindle Fire HD! I love how this app works! It has such cool filters for your photos that most of my other apps don't!
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|My nephew was very pleased with his gift. He was going to purchase it with if birthday money. But, when he got it for his birthday, he couldn't stop smiling.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Best movie EVER!! My kids can watch it over ane over again!  And I'm not gonna lie so could I!!!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I agree about the requests about buying apps for this game, you barely get a chance to play and they want you to buy the apps. Rather boring game , there are better ones
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|AMAZING album.  A true Classic! You will NOT be disappointed....  Stryper Rocks! Great songs, great tone! Go buy this album now.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|God I missed this man's music. Excellent album. Lyrically Em surpasses everyone in the rap game hands down. I highly recommend this album for any true hip hop head or even for a novice. You will not be disappointed. I bought the clean version for when my kids are in the car and the dirty version for when it's just me and Slim.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I was a little sceptical at first. I loved Paramore's first three albums and I wasn't sure I was going to like their new stuff especially after I heard their first single. However without knowing I was one, I proved myself to be a die-hard Paramore fan. Not only do I LOVE this album. It is, in my opinion, their best record yet. It's personal its raw and its got such honesty. All three musicians shine and I could not be happier. Money well spent. I bought it two more times for friends birthdays. They loved it too!
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I love action and it hits the floor running.  I have read 5 or 6 of Lee Child books and they keep you up reading.
B00004TWZF|5.0|I have watched this movie about 30 times, and I guess there will be more times to come. I love the plot and the scenery: the beautiful breathtaking greek islands. I also have to say that I pretty much love the films by Luc Besson and the music by Eric Serra, so this movie is a product of both wonderful artists. A must for me.
B00DJZ06DO|1.0|The story line isn't that good, and the main character never gets his stuff together.  Not cool.  They could have done a much better job of it.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|Fun game.  It's been years since I've been able to play it.  Controls are OK but you can't get much better for a touchscreen version.  I don't think I would recommend at full price unless your hardcore FF nut.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Interesting alternative world....help my attention fully, wanting to read more rather than less...<br />never bored with the story line, clearly Hugh Howey is a gifted story teller.
B000UIVRXG|5.0|This is movie #1 for me. I love the humor, and the scenery from the English countryside. I love also the other movies that go with the &#34;Cornetto Trilogy&#34; as they have been called, and this being number 2 from the trilogy is the most hilarious for me. For instance, the scene with the farmer and the way the whole incident is treated starting with the guy's dialect and how Pegg needs translation from the oldest police officer up to the incident with the mine. It is a must for me to have it in Blu-ray and of course in my kindle too...Thanks!!!!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|In my opinion, this is Eminem's best album since The Eminem Show, but i'm not sure where to place it among his first three albums yet. This album is more lyrically sophisticated than any album he's released and he's back to his tip top form when it comes to telling great stories. He's also able to create a great amount of diversity throughout the album, provoking almost every emotion possible. I just think it's funny how some people can't be satisfied with anything from Eminem lately. I understand why people can hate on Encore(obviously), Relapse, and Recovery for certain reasons, but this album is one of the best rap albums to come out in a while. If an up-and-coming artist released this album it would receive much more appraisal from critics than it is right now. He'll never be able to recapture the sound of the MMLP because it's a different time and situation. When Eminem's career is done for good, this album will be considered a classic.
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|Cant believe a teenager accomplished so much! It was an inspiring story of aspiration, boldness, conviction, determination, effort, faith and greatness!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book all though I wish she would of released more info about what all happens when she got married to help her memory
B009YN2M7S|5.0|You won't be able to put it down! I read this book faster than any other book I've ever read before.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It's a awesome show. I hope never ends. It getting better and better every time I watched. And it awesome that Amazon have it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Took this one couldn't put it down. The feeling's been the same all these years. First read it as a highschooler, still find the story inspiring and magical.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Of all the weather apps out there, this one is the most accurate and user friendly.  I highly recommend this one.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Treatment of lives with differing needs about time are handled deftly by the author. His concept of Father Time is sensitive and clever.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Excellent! Screams, screams, and more screams! Guitar solo's galore. And harmonies everywhere you turn. Now for more precise details. lol<br /><br />I'm absolutely shocked and surprised by this record. I'm a classic Stryper fan. I believe the best record of all time was Soldiers Under Command. Yes, I said was. SUC, meet your match! lol Truth is this one rocks as hard, if not harder, than SUC.<br /><br />I really don't see the comparison to To Hell With The Devil. There is no comparison. This record is way heavier. This record actually sounds the way In God We Trust SHOULD have sounded. Can you imagine if they gave the same production to \\"Come To The Everlife\\"? Instead it ended up way to poppy. lol<br /><br />It's impossible to say,\\"That's my favorite song!\\" I have this baby on replay since I can't stop listening! Every time I think a song is my fav, the next one comes on. lol But I will say I'm not in love with \\"The One\\". I would be perfectly happy with no ballad on this record.<br /><br />It's kinda of weird to start out with the very dark \\"Revelation\\". But it's so compelling you are forced to start the journey. Stryper should OPEN their current tour with this followed by \\"No More Hell To Pay\\". Screams MUST be included though!<br /><br />Once \\"Saved By Love\\" kicks in, the album KICKS YOUR TEETH IN!<br /><br />\\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\" took my completely by surprise. This has turned in a favorite. The pure heaviest, bold lyrics and aggressive chord changes are phenomenal. It has a thrash feel, followed by a slow, relaxing groove.<br /><br />\\"Legacy\\" is an instant rock radio classic. It gives you Michael Sweet \\"gritty\\" voice followed by trademark Sweet high pitched vocals in the chorus.<br /><br />\\"Marching Into Battle\\" is an automatic addition to the Stryper live show. Straight forward heavy metal.<br /><br />\\"Stick & Stones\\" is much heaver musical version of THWTD's \\"Calling On You\\", both musically and lyrically.<br /><br />\\"Water Into Wine\\" is an in your face rockerabout Jesus, duh.<br /><br />Signature vocals on \\"Sympathy\\".<br /><br />The crushing \\"Renewed\\" ends the album....leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />I'm amazed by both the musicianship and lyrics on this album. I never tired of listening to it.<br /><br />Bottom line: every Stryper fan must have this one. But I suspect a lot of new fans are gonna say,\\"THAT'S Stryper???!!!\\" Yes. Indeed. Buy this CD, and get a free mp3 download with Amazon. ;)
B004G6TD3O|5.0|Well, everything does eventually end/crumble/rust...disband; but it's nice to listen to one of the all-time greatest concert bands ever conceived. This well put together \\"best of...\\" concert performances make for a great listen and an even better time capsule for those who loved their AOR music so popular in the 70's. This is just truly great live music. One of the very few bands that \\"didn't\\"  go back into the studio and \\"touch up\\"/overdub their performances. ELP didn't have to, they were that good. So, it's time to dance the \\"Hoedown\\" with \\"Benny the Bouncer\\" while riding the \\"Tarkus\\" to the \\"Karn Evil 9\\" where the  show 'never' ends. Oh yeah!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|This app is way better than the first one . Keep up the good work.I like the way you see all your pages.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love this series - I believe it should be mandatory viewing - so good - I can't wait for the next season
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Excellent series, once again Fox doesn't know how to handle a good sci-fi show. Interesting stories well told by the ensemble cast.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Fiction that seems real. Or seems that it could be real. (I was given a prompt. Nine more words. Okay.)
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|awesome movie, packaging came perfect, 3d is amazing, felt just like being back in the theatre. growing collection for 3d
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Loved it! I've watched it 4 times! The costumes, and music are fantastic also. Great true love story.  Rent it if you are cautious.
0385351399|5.0|Interesting theme. Good detailed observations about current life and how young people think. Thoughtful in the details. This is not great literature but thoughtful social commentary. Having said that I found the book to be a page turner. The book is a bit philosophical in its implications so if you are looking for action and very likeable heroes, you should avoid this book.<br /><br />Some reviewers note that the book is not realistic and that Silicon Valley types are too libertarian for any kind of control society to take root. Those reviewers are not very bright. Writing this review I see a piece of news of a married woman losing her job because of one photo on facebook. In the photo, her husband puts his hand on her covered breast. If this can be judged to be past the limit of acceptability by some local municipality in the US in 2013 who can tell about the social climate in 2020. I think the book deals intelligently with issues of privacy and control.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the future of work and social life should definitely read the book. If you are just looking for action or romance, naturally you shouldn't even read this review! This is a clear five star book.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|bought back a lot of memories from when I was younger. this may be a simple game but will get your mind working. would encourage more parents to let their kids play this game, nothing gets killed
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|What else can you say about the game, except it's finally on the Kindle. The Kindle had some other Candy games but none were Saga.
0151003084|5.0|How could you not adore this morbidly fabulous book!  I've bought several copies to share with my friends, and we are all big Gorey fans!
1452101248|5.0|My favorite of the Ottolenghi books. These vegetarian treats make wonderful entrees too. Recipes are easier and less complicated than they appear at first glance. The food is UNUSUAL and delicious. The eggplant dish on the cover is a must. The description of the proper way to expel pomegranate seeds has made the eating of that fruit a real pleasure.
B005V5WBFG|3.0|so far so good, but will have to wait and see if it keeps doing what its supposed to, cant give a good review till I have had it for a while
B00G25VQFA|5.0|what a great album.  was anticipating this one for a good while and it is fantastic.  been listening to it non stop for the last 3 hours.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was such a let down! Horrible, depressing ending that dragged on and on.  Not to mention I didn't know which character was narrating half the time.  Deleted the trilogy from my kindle and won't be watching the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a really good read that I could not put down. I think a lot of people get stuck in marriages in similar but not such extreme ways.
B000GOSVEW|5.0|An intriguing tale with a lot of twists and turns in the storyline. All of the actors do an excellent job in presenting their characters.
B004B32532|1.0|This is a horrible movie, not horrifying.  Acting, directing, sound.  There really isn't a place to start or stop.  I had hoped the visuals would be compelling if the story was bad.  Nope.  All I can guess is this goes really good with... crank?  Dunno, never really dabbled with that or other stuff, so I am just guessing based on the stories I have read.  I really have to believe this is a drug users' cult movie.  Or for those who think unicorns make tooth faeries in a shop in the burbs of Chicago maybe?  I love horror, or used to a bit.  This isn't it.  I don't even know how to classify this.  Buyer beware.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was a good read about dealing and living with cancer.  It was a 16 year old girl who had cancer that became involved with a boy who also had cancer.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I heard good thing about this series but having just finished these 4 I'm not impressed. It drags in places and and tries to be too big for its own good. I don't think I'll be picking up book 5 and I only made it through 4 because I already bought them.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I have really enjoyed these puzzles and the increasing challenges that it sets at each level. I was a complete novice but am a convert now. Really enjoyable.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King is such an eloquent writer. He really makes a story come alive. Doctor Sleep is no exception. Wonderfully written entertaining story. Kept my interest all the way through. If you like King then you will love this book.
B0031RSA24|5.0|Richard Dawkins takes a neutral look at the state of the secular and non secular worlds. It'll convert or unconverted you. Easy to read, east to comprehend but if you sit and ponder upon the depths and multi bottomed aspects of this book it's tricky. The author sets belief, faith etc on their heads.<br />A must for any religious fanatics and atheists.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Love this album!! I have listened to it so much since I received it!! I think it is her best!!!!
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|We had to but this movie because my daughter is in love with it. Very cute movie with great message. Love the music!
B00459EZLW|5.0|Best acted, best produced, well written Scfy since Star Trek. We are very disappointed that their are no more seasons. A petition should be started!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I hate that on devices it is hard to save pics from facebook, otherwise very few problems I have encountered.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I look forward to visiting with my &#34;friends&#34; each evening.  It's a taste of home, though removed by time and location.
B00480OHWK|5.0|guys are having fun at the moment you know how I am not going out tonight but I'm just saying that he was not a big fan of my room for the movie and then you can see the new version is available at least you can do it by ear infection and radio stations are you can get a new version and then I can get a new version and the best part of it is that
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a wonderful book to read. To follow the life of a little orphaned girl who is telling her story from 7years old to 91 years old. At first you don't realize that the whole story is being told by the 91year old to an foster care girl by the name of Molly in 2011. Vivian ( her given name from her last adopted parents Mr. And Mrs Neilsen ) tells about the train ride to New York and the families whom she lives with through the years. The ending will surprise you but warms your heart. I wish it had' t ended so quickly. Loved it.
B008J05EL8|5.0|The font app is a must to have for the office suite. Though I have not purchased the full suite yet, I was thinking when I get back into school it would be helpful to have on my kindle if I get put in the hospital since I? have heart failure so much less bulky than my gaming laptop, as well as weighting less and small enough my mom can put in her purse if I have testing done.
034580404X|5.0|Books are in perfect shape! The package got here in less than 5 days! Books are amazing! I already finished the first one and I've only had it for a little over a week and I'm a college student so I'm always busy, but I make time to read these books!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Enjoyed this very much, a was challange.  Just wish it had more rooms to go into.  I like it alot.
B000I55YV2|4.0|Wanted to see this again.  I like this movie and it again.  if you haven't seen it you should.do it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Just as easy and user friendly as the IOS version on my phone. But much easier to read on the kindle screen!
B001AFF25W|5.0|Until one recognizes their faults/flaw they willl always remain in conflict with themself. The cycle is repeated over and over.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|Great book that really changes the way that I think about money and how my family and my business need to think about money.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although the book was great, I wished the ending was different. You should have made it so Tobias comes back and proposes to 'Tris. She shouldn't have died, especially not for Caleb.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I would expect no less from our unsung hero,  I cannot put one of Child's books about Teacher. Non stop action from the first to last page. As I have read all of them, I cannot wait for the next one!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent story, the characters truly well written and played well. It took no time at all to fly through this season and I cannot wait to see the next. I hated the ending, but one does hate to see a good man die.
B00BEIYGQG|4.0|This is a charming romantic comedy with a message: value your life, family and friendships.<br /><br />It's another movie from Richard Curtis, who specialises in this kind of feel good romantic comedy- \\"Love Actually\\", \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", \\"Notting Hill\\", \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" were all written by him, and he directed \\"Love Actually\\" as well.<br /><br />He is an expert in developing these types of stories in an engaging manner, as well as having a message.<br /><br />What gets this story moving is a father's revelation to his son that they have the power to travel through time.<br /><br />There are some comedic moments based on this plot device, but the story moves on to be a conventional romantic comedy- including the element of \\"boy gets girl; boy loses girl; boy gets girl back again\\".<br /><br />There are several subplots to keep things moving along.<br /><br />The performances are generally good- Domhnall Gleeson is convincing as the time traveller, and Rachel McAdams is charming as his girlfriend. Bill Nighy puts in another good cameo as the father.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable \\"feel good\\" romantic comedy- ideal for a date night DVD at home. It has a happy ending, with a Richard Curtis life message for you (akin to the ending of Love Actually).<br /><br />Is it a great film? I don't think so, but it is a charming light entertainment. I doubt you would regret seeing it.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|This cable does what cables are supposed to do as long as it works, but I had to replace the first cable after a couple months of use, when my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 suddenly stopped charging or acknowledging that it was plugged in. I was afraid at first that something was wrong with the unit itself, especially when it also wouldn't charge on an off-brand charger I went and got from Best Buy. But I found it WOULD charge, albeit very slowly and seldom completely, on the less powerful charger for my old, original Kindle.  Not sure of the cause of the problem, I ordered new rapid charger (it comes without the cable) from Amazon.  I used it with the old cable.  No good news.  I ordered a replacement cable then. When it arrived, I compared the end of the micro-usb connector  that plugs into the Kindle Fire 8.9 with the older cable, and I could see the difference. The tiny pins were mostly obscured inside the older micro-usb connector, and clearly bright and visible in the new one.  I attached the new charger to the new cable, and charged up my Kindle Fire. It works fine, and I'm once again able to fully charge my Kindle Fire 8.9 in reasonably  short order. My only questions now are why did the first connector go bad, and will the new one also go bad after a brief interval.  The connection is badly placed on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. lf you often have to plug the unit in while you are using it --say, to watch a  Prime movie -- the delicate little micro-usb connector is exposed to the possibility of damage due to accumulated stresses over time.  The Kindle Fire should be designed to protect the connection better, and the cable itself should be designed to better withstand expectable stresses.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A great read. Definitely recommend trying this series out. It is the Harry Potter for adults and anyone who likes a book with surprises all the way through.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|A good friend of mine had bought this on his IPad and we were playing it nonstop after school one time. Great app in every way.
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|Making movies about sport, particularly car racing, is difficult. Rather like participating in an auto race, it's a risky business, fraught with the possibility of failure, despite deploying the best resources available- just think of \\"Grand Prix\\"' \\"Le Mans\\" and \\"Days of Thunder\\".<br /><br />Rush succeeds, on a variety of levels, and for several reasons:<br /><br />- Ron Howard is a sympathetic director, with long experience with docudramas: \\"Apollo 13\\",  \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" and \\"Frost/Nixon\\" attest to this director's remarkable ability to tell a true story in an engaging, sympathetic yet accurate manner.<br /><br />- For most Americans, Formula 1 car racing is unknown- a real challenge for the people involved in making the movie. Yet, they have drawn out the engaging true story, in a manner which transcends the car racing story background.<br /><br />- For many people, the story is past history - it's about another era. The period has been recreated faithfully and sympathetically.<br /><br />- The real life drama has been presented accurately and without embellishment. This is a testiment to the skill of the writer and director. And, while being historically accurate, the movie builds genuine tension and drama.<br /><br />- This is not just a car race story- it's about the triumph of two men against adversity, and in that respect, it is genuinely inspirational.<br /><br />- The storyline is multi-layered: there's the lives and distinctive personalities of the two protagonists, their rivalry, the racing, as well as the main characters' romances. These layers are masterfully blended, and related in an engaging fashion.<br /><br />Before I saw this, I thought Rush would be a specialty interest movie. But, it's more: it is a genuine inspirational story- about real people.<br /><br />Well worth a look.
0891419063|5.0|This was a great read about combat as it truly was with all the gore and disgusting experiences as saw & felt by the author. A must read for teenagers who think going to war is glorious.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|Hilarious.  Awesome  this is classic Downey jr.  Keeps you laughing all movie long.  Great night  time movie  Val Kilmer  is in his funniest
B003VANOFY|3.0|11/4/16 Another Update..............<br />after sitting in the Broken Tech heap, it seemed to have revived itself and is now charging again. This is the last I will update this. Leaving it as a 3 for overall quality. When it worked, it was a 5, but often was unreliable.<br /><br />8/24/16 Update..............<br />It finally crapped out after a long slow death. I might have been able to revive it, but got tired of dicking around with the stupid thing. When the unit worked, it was great. However, as it became increasingly unreliable, it was obvious I was spending more time fixing it than using it.<br /><br />Oh  well, it was fun while it lasted. I will store it in a safe, plastic container by the curb.<br /><br />4/2/15 Update..............<br />2 years on and it is still working well. Some of the negative reviews are understandable. When I see reviews like that, I tend to think it was a Quality Control issue on the manufacturing end for a period of time. I have bought many Logitech products over the years and have had issues with items from time to time. So it is not just limited to this headset. One does have to be careful about the micro USB connector, but it has not been a problem for me - and I have accidentally pulled hard on the cable several times.<br /><br />The wireless range seems to be about 50-60 feet, but is affected by walls and such. For example, I can use it in my office, but when I wear it outside on the other side of our small house, it cuts off.<br /><br />Some of the settings tend to wander, particularly the sidetone adjustment. I have to re-set it after every time the unit is turned off or sleeps.<br /><br />I use the headset mostly for Skype calls and some gaming. Overall, I am still very satisfied with the purchase.<br /><br />So there you have it.<br /><br />***************<br />Overall, I like this thing. The big drawback for me (and it is not like I knew it would be this way) is that these things are like wearing a beaver on your head.<br /><br />Now on one side, that is great. The earphones really clamp you head and keep out external sound. On the other side, it is like wearing a C-Clamp (with cushions) on your head.<br /><br />As far as sound goes, they are good. Decent highs and solid lows. The Logitech software has a reasonable EQ to futz with. There is also a sound processor if you want to mess with your voice. Regarding surround sound and such, well it sort of works, but when you get right down to it is a 2 speaker system so the surround is faux. It sort of works.<br /><br />The mic is good and has a mute feature when you push it up. When I make calls, people tell me it sounds great.<br /><br />Finally, the wiring that comes with it is a little stupid. There is a single wire that comes from the computer that goes to a round item that allows you to wrap it around. For my part, I ditched that thing and just used a basic USB cable to cut down on clutter. I mean, it is fine for what it is, but for my needs, a simple cable is sufficient.<br /><br />Overall, a good set. Maybe a little pricey, but it delivers. Gaming is great with it and it is a very comfortable item on the head.other side, it is like wearing a C-Clamp (with cushions) on your head.  As far as sound goes, they are good.

B00407PNY2|5.0|Bullitt is an extraordinarily influential movie, which is still entertaining.<br /><br />It is rated as one of the best action movies of all time, with its fantastic car chase through the streets of San Francisco.<br /><br />Besides that, the tight script and excellent acting make this a rewarding film, even 45 years after its release.<br /><br />McQueen's Bullitt is an anti-hero: a maverick, yet incorruptible. In the day, this was an emerging category of screen character, which has now become commonplace.<br /><br />The superb location photography is enhanced by Lalo (Mission Impossible, Dirty Harry) Schifrin's atmospheric music.<br /><br />A great movie, both for pure entertainment, as well as for the student of cinematic art.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|My mom may have early dementia at 66 so when my girlfriend told me about this story I bought it right away. It was hard to put down at times. I learned a lot. I cried. I also now wonder if I may be predisposed to early dementia.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game....very addictive I am so happy it has started working on my Kindle fire. I can't put this down.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is the best movie of all time.  I watched this in the theatre.  Then I went to walmart and purchased the blu ray knowin I don't have a blu ray player just to support the fiim.  I ordered this one for my dad.  I will always keep this movie on my shelf.  If you know any black man that has ever watched a western.  If you know any black woman that wanted to fought for.  If you know anyone who wanted to get the bad guy.  &#34;Hey yall, watch this.&#34;
B005LAIIGW|5.0|This is a fascinating movie, combining superb special effects, fine acting and an inspirational storyline.<br /><br />The story is one of humans struggling against adversity, rather than being a \\"space\\" or \\"science fiction\\" story.<br /><br />As such, it has broader audience appeal.<br /><br />It's a well crafted movie, with excellent performances from the small cast. In particular, Sandra Bullock gives a fine performance in a highly complex and demanding role.<br /><br />The special effects are not obtrusive, and the 3D effect is worthwhile.<br /><br />I recommend this movie as an inspirational experience.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Absolutely an amazing cd from start to finish.I love all of strypers albums but this is by far their best since to hell with th devil...great job guys!!
B0049J3QAY|5.0|I watched this movie with my daughter when she was a child and with my son now.  It is a great children's movie.  I think it helps the children to not be scared of the dark or what is underneath the bed.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Best calulator app out there. Great app. Easy to use. Percent function is very easy to use and very helpful.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is super handy in all kinds of situations I use it to find things in my bag at night.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|What a brave young lady. Much wiser than her years. Apparently comes from her upbringing. Just shows what can be done when children have interactions from the parents. Many American families, not just the Middle Eastern countries could learn from this young woman's experience.  Shows what the scripture says &#34;If God be for us, who can be against us?&#34;
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I love action and the 24 series does not dissapoint. Sometimes its over the top, but its Jack Bauer and you expect no less. The plots where well in place and established throughout each episode. As any fan you want more, but all good things come to an end and so it did in great fashion.
