0393307050|4.0|Let's see - 20 volumes; average about 250 pages per book. I'm no math expert or anything but I'd say that equals at least...well, at least a lot of pages devoted to Aubrey and Maturin. And after reading the full set, one is really hard pressed not to have developed something of an almost personal relationship with the two principal characters as well as with the commonly recurring supporting cast and crew members. Though I found it hard to get into the first volume (trying unsuccessfully to have it catch fire with me twice before success), once I made it beyond mid way in Master and Commander, I was hooked in for the full 20.    Others have written long reviews of the plot &c. I will limit myself to commenting on O'Brian's style. In comparison to another similar series - the Lord Ramage series by Dudley Pope - O'Brian's style in most notable for it spare, modern flavor - being modern in style even though peppered throughout with 200 year old nautical vernacular. This contrasts with a more florid and melodramatic style of the other writers of such adventures. Worth reading and highly recommended. At least 4 stars - probably 5 but would like to leave some wiggle room to potentially rank any other similar series higher if needed.
0440241588|1.0|Its like the stories you write as a secondary school kid. the first 2/3 are very desrciptive and develop a good plot and then you realise there's only 10mins left of the lesson and you rush the ending to round the story up. You'll be left with the feeling of a secondary school English Language teacher marking a GCSE class's mocks - disappointed. It was also like watching a film where you guess the progression of the story but know you're going to be wrong as its too obvious. This however, followed the obvious pattern and the twist was, that there was no twist. The descriptions of Bologna and its cafes were drawn out, as if Grisham is trying to emphasise the only research he seems to have done for the novel.  The result is what starts out as a thriller, quickly evolves into a brief tourist guide and introduction to italian. This is the first book of Grishams I've read and going off this, he's not in the same league as the likes of Dan Brown.
0930289234|5.0|To Make a long story short, I was a Pro-Wrestler on the Indy Circut Very Briefly, My Gimmick was SUPERHERO a guy in a cape trying to make a difference in a world without Super powers.<br /><br />Needless to say the story of a bunch of guys without powers trying to make a difference greatly interested me.<br /><br />They cause a police strike, go insane, become drunks, and generally make a mess of things along the path paved with good intentions, but at least they try.<br /><br />Then in the end, their greatest victory of all time is due to the fact that they fail. Only the uncompramising Roaurshach (Sure I just spelled that wrong)sticks to his guns, and pays the ultimate price for it. (Saddest part of the Book if you ask me.)<br /><br />Read it, Love it.
B000003TAR|5.0|I'm Portuguese. I never bouth a cd in amazon, but i use to get a lot of information of albums i like or i don't know about. And i like to read the reviews. And the one from Jonathan D. i didn't like...everybody have it's own opinion, but i think you must have more respect for one great band. They mean a lot to so many people, and come on, they sounded great! But why the hell you compare the sadness in Nirvana and Skynny puppy ? One don't have to be more sad than another to be just as great...or greater!I don't need to say more about Curt Cobain, Novoselic and Dave Grohl, you all know who they were and what sound they did together. They're still one of my favourite bands. Songs like Negative Creep, Aneurysm, On a Plain, Serve the Servents...i don't know why you don't like, Jonathan, but i hope you listen to more carefuly and you leave the comparison behind, and if even then you don't like it, then you may declare that  ;)   <br />
B00002SWEM|3.0|Yes this movie is as wonderful as everyone says, but as a WARNING, the subtitles are imprinted in the film, which is somewhat annoying.  I.e. you can't remove the subs, and they are distracting.
6301640659|3.0|I saw this movie probably a couple of years after it came out, and thought it was pretty good. I also bought the soundtrack for some reason (I unfortunately no longer have it) and I have to say it was better than the movie, and actually made me like the movie more. This obviously is a role Pacino has probably forgotten about, and should.
B000002QWD|5.0|Buy this CD. You will not be sorry. Bing sings a great selection of Christmas songs, including the unforgettable \\"White Christmas \\" by Irving Berlin.<br /><br />This CD is sure to bring you many years of  Enjoyment.
B0006399FS|5.0|Well, not necessarily better, but this Grammy-winning album does have some outstanding tracks. <br /> <br />Bono's tribute to his late father Bob, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, took an award in itself, although Miracle Drug is probably my favorite in this excellent set. <br /> <br />It ain't perfect though, and this is a more patchy album than their masterwork The Joshua Tree, but when they shine, they shine, and the good tracks are as good as anything that has gone before. <br /> <br />Every generation has its Supergroup. First it was The Beatles, then it was Led Zeppelin, now we have U2. Let's hope the boys stick together for a long time to come, because they've still got what it takes.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I don't belong to the apparent elitists who despise Michael Bay's filmmaking because he's entertaining for it's own sake.  Michael Bay is what he is the same as Hitchcock directed psychological thrillers or George Lucas directs science fiction.  He makes films that are loud, fast, action-packed and quite frankly, fun to watch. Isn't that what movies are supposed to be about?    Armageddon was probably the most (other than maybe Saving Private Ryan) anticipated movie of 1998. I'd rank it in my top two or three of 1998 (The others being Saving Private Ryan and American History X). It's not the next Schindler's List and it doesn't strive to be.  It stars Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in the main roles.  The supporting cast is underrated, well-balanced and fun to watch, from Michael Clarke Duncan and Steve Buscemi down to lesser know actors Marshall R. Teague and Jessica Steen.    Yes, the plot and premise may not be the most believable. But neither is King Kong, Lord of The Rings, Star Wars or whatever.  These pseudo-critics on Amazon.com whine about \\"poor science\\" behind the movie, or the poor plot or the stereotypical cast.  You know what?  Who friggin' cares?  It's a movie that's made for sheer fun, for entertainment, for bringing your family to enjoy a couple of hours of action, thundering explosions, fast vehicles and a little romance.  Armageddon, despite what the Ebert and Roeper apprentices in here think, is entertainment at its best.  Stop whining and enjoy yourself.    We are all familiar with the story by now. An asteroid the size of Texas is on path to impact with Earth, which would destroy all forms of life on it.  The world only has 18 days until impact. The only way to stop it is to blow it up from the inside by drilling to its core.  For that, NASA recruits the worlds's best deep-core driller in Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his renegade drilling crew.  The crew, along with some NASA astronauts and an unlucky Russian cosmonaut, journey to the asteroid and embark upon the mission to destroy it and with that, save the entire planet.    Along the way, the crew endures despite losing lives, having to overcome huge obstacles, and having to make decisions that will affect not only the world but their own personal lives.  The movie is filled with a few emotional moments that will bring tears to some eyes.  The score is grandiose and is a large part of the film.  The film strives to be patriotic and the cinematography reflects it.  I couldn't help but feel patriotic and moved while watching the movie.  The sound and visual effects in the movie were awesome, which its four Oscar nominations reflect.    This movie is a lot of things. It's fun, it's moving, it's sad and it's romantic.  Above all, it's one of the more entertaining movies I have seen. The cast had a lot of chemistry together and seemed to have a lot of fun which is reflected in the film.  This was Ben Affleck's first big box-office action movie and he gives a good first effort.  Bruce Willis takes on the role of Harry Stamper with ease like the action movie veteran he is.  Liv Tyler is sweet as Harry's daughter and their emotional goodbye is to be remembered.  (Home theater aficionados will also appreciate the visual and sound effects in this movie).    Armageddon was the second-highest grossing film of 1998 narrowly behind Saving Private Ryan.  That might be something for critics to think about, because obviously A LOT of people saw this movie.   All in all, don't listen to the critics here trying to become the next \\"Top 500 reviewer.\\"  See the movie, it's a blast.
0553149814|5.0|I went back to this book, re-read it and enjoyed it again.  The writing, the characters, and the solution are what make this mystery a classic.  I have not read all of Christie's work, and I don't know if I ever will, but being reintroduced to Poirot was a pleasure.  His busy mind, his decisive judgments and his meticulous nature make this diminutive Belgium interesting to know.  Solid armchair mysteries are difficult to find especially since this book is THE standard.
B000BKJ78U|2.0|These are NOT, I repeat, NOT the original films released on DVD.  This is the same Special Edition that disappointed you in the 90's, now with the even bigger slap of adding young Anakin (Hayden Christensen) to the Jedi Spirits scene at the end of ROTJ (sorry, Obi(Ewan).  For whatever reason you're still old!).  MR LUCAS, WE ARE YOUR DIE HARD FANS!  WE LOVE THESE MOVIES!  PLEASE GIVE US WHAT WE WANT - THE PURE, UNADULTERATED, ORIGINAL STAR WARS TRILOGY THAT MADE US THE HOPELESS GEEKS WE ARE TODAY!  We don't want the version with the poorly aiming Greedo, or with the Grimace look-alike Jabba who deigns to come a-groveling at Docking Bay 94 and lets Han walk on him like a fool (like any menacing gangster would stoop so low).  Please give us what we want, and believe me, you can market it any way you like (in other words, charge as much as you want) and the original hardcore fans will pay!  Call it the Ultimate Whiners Edition for all we care!  Just give it to us, please!!
B00005JNEI|4.0|Propaganda or the Truth?   <br /> <br />After watching Fahrenheit 9/11, I was deeply shocked by the matters that were brought to the attention of the world.  It is more of a reality shock which some of us are too naive to realise the actual truth in what is going on the USA.  Moore possesses an incredibly charismatic way of depicting the truth and goes about it by creating a documentary film with all the facts in front of our very eyes.  Moore ironically portrays Bush as a lying, deceitful man who possesses no integrity and would do anything to remain in power.  He also shows Bush as having a low level of intelligence and that he cannot cope in such a high position without his advisors whom he relies on considerably.  He is portrayed as incapable of thinking anything for himself, a view which I think is upheld by most people.  Michael Moore reveals `secrets' that we do not know about politicians and uses documents as proof.  He felt that we all had a right to know and disclosed this to the world.  He shows us what the media may not necessarily show and this is why Fahrenheit 9/11 is truly exceptional in terms of quality and content. <br /> <br />Michael Moore uses many techniques in Fahrenheit 9/11, which work to strongly to expose George Bush as he really is.  He uses cuts to manipulate what George Bush is saying, uses emotive language and shows parents mourning over the loss of their children to gain the sympathy of the viewer and feel a strong anger towards Bush.  An example of how he uses cuts is when he may show the war in Iraq and burnt bodies being thrown in the back of a truck and then cut to Bush on holiday, which leaves people in shock thinking `how could he do that?' and that is exactly what Moore's intentions are. <br /> <br />Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 was released in 2004 before the election with the intention of people voting against George W. Bush.  For those who are opposed to Bush and his principles believe to an extent what Michael Moore is saying is true even before Fahrenheit 9/11 was released, their views on Bush may be now have been further enhanced.  On the other hand, people who are in favour of Bush may be unaware and shocked at some of the material Michael Moore exposes in Fahrenheit 9/11, but they nevertheless remain supportive of Bush. <br /> <br />It can be argued that Fahrenheit 9/11 is too biased, however, Moore is only human and we all are capable of having a biased view on one thing or another.  If Moore were to show the Bush's more favourable side, then perhaps more people would appreciate the argument that he is trying to portray.  Nevertheless, Michael Moore did what he thought was best and expressed it passionately and he certainly did not care what people may think and I respect him for that.  I also respect him for creating such a documentary on the most powerful man in the world and not worrying about the repercussions.   <br /> <br />Huni <br />(Harjinder Khaira) <br />
B00064AM6C|5.0|After basically giving up on modern rock, I was given a copy of Get Behind Me Satan. Having never heard any White Stripes music (although I knew the name)I was pretty impressed by GBMS. SO being a good little surfer, visited TWS website where they have several videos to view. There you will find their cover of Jolene..which was taken from the concert featured on this DVD.<br /><br />Upon seeing this video...I knew I HAD to see the whole show.<br /><br />Blown away, stunned, and instantly addicted to The White Stripes. Other reviewers have attempted to describe what this DVD is like. So I will not rehash. It must be seen to be believed. Powerful, emotional, and a flat out steal at this price. If I could give it 10 or 100 stars I would.
B00000272N|5.0|LISTENED TO THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A FEW YEARS AND IT WAS FANTASTIC. I HAVE BEEN BOMBARDED WITH ALL OF THIS RETARDED NU-METAL AND ROCK RADIO FOR SO LONG I HAD TO FIND IT AND PUT IT IN THE CD PLAYER. REMINDED ME OF HOW ACOUPLE OF BANDS THAT HAVE MAJOR SUCCESS RIGHT NOW HAVE COMPLETELY RIPPED THESE GUYS OFF. I WONDER IF THEY SECRETLY PAY CANTRELL AND CO. FOR THE MAJOR HACK JOB.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson plays William Wallace, the Scottish patriot who leads his people in a rebellion to free their land from English domination.  Gibson also directed the film and did a masterful job of it.  The battle scenes are bloody and disturbingly realistic.  Viewers of Scottish ancestry (such as myself) will be especially affected by this very entertaining, moving and  powerful film.<br /><br />Those who are familiar with the history of Wallace's rebellion will no doubt watch the film with much trepidation, anxious as to the way they know the film must end.  The film ends, however, leaving us with feelings of both extreme sadness and extreme joy.  This film really deserved the Oscar it won for best film of 1995.
B00082IJ08|1.0|They have one cool video with a catchy little song to go with it, MTV plays it twenty times a day and all of the little kiddies go \\"yea this sh*t is tight\\". My brother mixed an album consisting of 9 tracks that sound better than this crap and he doesn't even have a contract with a label. Besides this has been done a few times by a guy named Beck, maybe you've heard of him? So basically if you are into this kind of stuff just buy a Beck album. Atleast it's better.Continued= WOW THIS IS FANTASTIC SO MANY NEGATIVE OPINIONS OF MY REVIEW. I GUESS THIS JUST PROVES MY POINT ABOUT THE STATE OF POPULAR MUSIC IN GENERAL! IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IN 10 YEARS MOST PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK ON THIS JOKE OF A ALBUM AND LAUGH! AND ALSO MAKE FUN OF THIS IN THE SAME WAY PEOPLE LAUGH AND JOKE ABOUT VANILLA ICE, OR WEIRD AL. OH WELL GUESS SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST STUPID OR ACTUALLY LISTEN WHEN MTV TELLS \\"YOU\\" WHEN SOMETHING IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD. LATER SHEEP!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|The movie was tottaly Awesome, it was exactly what i have anticipated, the story line was unique, the actors were amazing and took it to another level. Kate Beckinsale turned to be a butt kicking chick. However the actor who did the (Michael) character needed to embrace the role more effectively. I wont tell you the whole story because it had been already described. <br /> <br />Don't expect this movie to be like any vampire/werewolve story.
B000062YAZ|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM A YEAR AFTER IT CAME OUT AND WHEN I LISTEN TO IT NOW IT STILL BLOWS THE BAGGY PAINTS OFF OF EVERY SINGLE NU-METAL GROUP OUT TODAY. IT IS SO FU*KING FUNNY TO HEAR ALL OF THE LITTLE KIDDIES TALK ABOUT HOW HEAVY  AVENGED SEVENFU*K ARE. HEY IF YOU LIKE THEM THAT IS COOL BUT DON'T TELL ME THAT IT'S HARDCORE OR EVEN HEAVY. I COULD RUN OFF ABOUT 12 BANDS FROM 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO THAT PISS ON EVERYTHING EVEN REMOTELY HEAVY TODAY. I WILL CUT PEOPLE SLACK WHO THINK THAT STUFF PLAYED ON THE RADIO OR MTV IS METAL/HARDCORE/HEAVY ETC.ETC. ENTOMBED IS A BAND THAT COMES TO MIND THAT FU*KING ROCKS, THAT IS UNTIL THEY GOT WEIRD. THE BAND DEATH PUT OUT SOME KILLER STUFF, NUCLEAR ASSAULT'S OLD STUFF IS GOOD, NAPALM DEATH IS GOOD- SOME OF IT ANYWAY. SOME MORBID ANGEL, SEPULTURA UP TO CHAOS A.D. IS GOOD. HELL I EVEN LIKE BANDS LIKE PANTERA, CROWBAR, LOVE BAD BRAINS STUFF UP TO AND INCLUDING I AGAINST I,ROLLINS BAND. OOPS RAMBLING ABOUT BANDS IS NOT A GOOD THING SORRY ABOUT THAT. GOT ALITTLE CARIED AWAY. I DO LIKE NEW STUFF BUT IT IS ALL OBSCURE AND NOT COMMERCIAL IN ANYWAY!
B00004XONN|5.0|After OK Computer and The Bends tought us that Radiohead was a band that was very special and should be paided attenition to in the future becasue what they have basically done for the music industry. This isnt a knock on the music out there today but if you are smart and have paid attention basically all the music that is the \\"popular\\" and most played music is pretty muchh filtered and radio happy songs that are nice but aren't groundbreaking at all. This is completley not the case with Radiohead. <br />        As OK Computer did, Kid A is stripping away all what we know about and have come to know about music as far as a \\"verse chorus verse\\" version of the music we listen to today. At first glance Kid A is so astonishing it dosent sink in until the CD is over and you feel like you must hear that again and see if what you just heard was true. From the first track, the swooping beautiful \\"Everything in its right Place\\" and the \\"Kid A\\" title song both tell that this time around for the band is going to be different then the guitar riffs of \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\". Each song on this CD has its own identity and its own message but really all mold together to tell a story one cant imagine yet. Thats whats so amazing. Its as if Radiohead has found the key to something we dont know yet.  <br />       I myself have heard \\"The Bends\\" and computer many times as well as the nice but missed \\"Pablo Honey\\" and have come to the conclusion that even thought all 3 were intelligent albums with a strong musical and lyrical base they still cant touch Kid A as far as uniquness goes. OK Computer is considered such a class act becasue of its use of noises and strange beats but also because of the tortured lyrics Thom Yorke delivers. <br />       The album really starts to kick off with the beutiful and rock driven song \\"Optimistic\\" which structure and chorus couldent be anymore spot on with a great delivery by Thom Yorke. The magnificent \\"Treefingers\\" pretty much in the samecadegory as \\"Kid A\\" but still like i said earlier its one of the few albums that sound as one instead of different songs on an album. The album ends with 3 songs that pretty much define what the album is trying to do. \\"Idioteque\\" is like nothing ive ever heard and \\"Morning Bell\\" sits well as it serves up \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\".  <br />        This album is in my opinion better than OK Computer but not in the sense that it beats in in quality but it beats in what the album says and speaks. A true masterpiece this album should be a reminder of why we make music and sell it. Because if its not worth buying its not worth recording.
B0006L16N8|1.0|These guys now hold my number one slot for most whinny, wimpy and downright depressing music. I don't care about what they have written before, if it was good or if it was bad. This record is horrid and that is all you need to know. Is it just me or does the lead singer sound like Bono but in a bad way, like one of his little 14 y/o screaming female fans has grabed him by the testy's and squeezed. His voice is so annoying that my 12 year old dog got up and left the room when I was playing and attempting to listen to this self-serving piece of trash. I think these guys recorded this monstrosity just to listen and look at themselves in their videos
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Fantastic live show with Joe in top form, featuring the old line up of Kenny Kramme and Eric Czar.  It's terrific from beginning to end, but to me it's worth the price just for his slide work in The River and Burning Hell.  Great testament to Joe's genre-bending combo of rock and the blues.  Heavy blues never sounded so good.  I had no sound or technical issues with my DVD.  Get it, you'll be glad you did.
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|Some quirky and catchy toons, can see why they don't get the radio play that the rest of those corporate drones get. Sounds like they really make an attempt to create a unique blend of styles, hence less radio play, and believe me people that is a good thing. And this is from one play through, think I will check it out one more time and see if I think it's worth adding to my collection. With all of the crap I have reviewed today this was a breath of fresh air.................
B00005JMXX|4.0|And thats just fine by me.  The scene where the tidal wave destroys Manhattan is enough to make up for the silly plot.  Yes, I said silly.  Not the event of the next global warming / ice age...thats not too rediculous...it's the father trying to save his son part that's stupid.  ANYWAYS!!!  Watch it for the tornadoes destroying LA and the tidalwave destroying New York and the scene with the wolves in the ship is pretty neat.  The acting is sub-par...These actors have done much better elsewhere...just watch Jack in Brokeback or even Good Girl and Dennis in Far From Heaven.  Anyways, like I said, the one reason to see this is for the CGI graphics and 'intence peril' as the box puts it.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|Atleast the mix it up quit a bit. And they don't sound like they are trying to make radio poo. I would have given this a 4 but the music isn't my cup of tea, nothing wrong with that though. They are definantly quality musicians with creativity.
B0000CAQ26|3.0|Everyone says this album is \\"less revelatory\\" than Pink's 2001 sophomore, Misundaztood. I disagree. I think Try This is just as revealing as its predecessor.  <br /> <br />This album has a more mature, retro (60's-70's) sound to me. Pink, at times, sounds remarkably like Janis Joplin, especially on one of my fave songs, Unwind. <br /> <br />My other favorite tracks are Humble Neighborhoods, a great fun rock song. I love it! There's also Walk Away. <br /> <br />My least favorite tracks are God Is A DJ, which I know a lot of Pink fans love, but it's just plain annoying to me, and Feel Good Time I could also do without. <br /> <br />Pink has an incredible voice with awesome range. I'm glad I checked this C.D. out!
B000089RVX|1.0|I don't really know what demographic or mallkid sector they are going for here, but I can tell you one thing this is bad music! Just from one listen through this drudge I can say with certainty that the guitar work is childish and thoughtless, the drums are right on cue with the guitars, and just because you have a female lead singer doesn't make you relevant or even good for that matter. It follows the same imputant formula that every radio band displays in all of its nauseating glory. I know that these two bands don't fall into this particular musical demo, but just the same I would rather listen to a great band like the Pretenders, or Sonic Youth. Two great bands lead by two great female lead singers. And I do encourage people to checkout my other reviews, it only seems fair that I p*ss you off with them as well. Have a great day!
B000002G87|5.0|Am I confused or was a faster more rocking version of \\"Tell The Truth\\" left out?  Otherwise perfection.
B000B0WODA|1.0|THIS RECORD IS NOTHING MORE THAN RECYCLED 80'S POP MUSIC. ANYTHING FROM THE CURE,DEPECHE MODE, FLOCK OF SEAGULLS, AND A DOZEN OTHER RADIO BANDS FROM THE 80'S. I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE GUYS  HAVE AN AUDIENCE THAT IS SO YOUNG THAT THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER. A PRIME EXAMPLE IS SOMEBODY WHO WAS PRAISING THIS RECORD SAID THAT THEY REMINDED HIM OF GREAT BANDS LIKE THE KINKS, THE DOORS, AND THE CLASH. ARE YOU F**KING SERIOUS KID! THE CLASH WERE A FANTASTIC AND CREATIVE BAND THAT CONCIEVED THEIR OWN SOUND THROUGH GREAT MUSICIANS AND WITH LYRICS THAT WERE POWERFUL POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY, WHERE IN THESE GUYS MUSIC AND LYRICS CAN YOU FIND THAT! I  WON'T EVEN COMMENT ON THE COMPARISON TO THE DOORS AND THE KINKS, BECAUSE THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE MOST IGNORANT THINGS I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE! WHEW GLAD THAT'S OVER WITH NOW MAYBE I CAN FIND SOME RELEVANT MUSIC TO CHECKOUT!====== I loved Ginger's review she actually proved my point and at the same time praised the album. hahaha! \\"music for girls to dance to\\" That statement kind of blows away that stupid remark somebody made about this band being as relevant as the Kinks, Doors, or the Clash. I am done the sheep may return to their flock!!!!!!!!! (TO CLARIFY THAT WOULD BE THE LOCAL MALL FOR EMO'S.)
6305558167|5.0|Previous reviewers have already detailed the dark beauty of this film superbly, so I'll simply add my own voice to theirs in this regard. What I would like to note is director John Boorman's grasp & understanding of the mythic vision, both intellectually & viscerally. His retelling of the Arthurian Mythos is steeped in Jungian thought & symbolism -- and deliberately so, as stated in his memoirs. Rather than spell everything out, he uses vivid images & semi-ornate language to make dazzling leaps, which he trusts the viewers to follow & understand, if only on a deep & unconscious level. Everything isn't explained in step-by-step, logical fashion, which would only make the film pedantic. Instead, he presents bold, vivid scenes, which bypass concious logic & speak directly to the psyche. Not everyone will respond to this approach, of course; and those looking for a more traditional or historically correct narrative are bound to be disappointed. But for those of a more Romantic nature, far more comfortable with the language of Symbol, this film will be a revelation. Most highly recommended!
B0009I7NNA|2.0|I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS A 3 AND A HALF STAR, BUT THAT LEAD SINGER HAS GOT TO GO. IN FACT I FOUND MYSELF SKIPPING THROUGH PARTS OF SONGS THAT I WOULD NORMALLY HAVE LISTENED TO BUT THE SINGERS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO HAVE A BOWEL MOVEMENT IN PARTS. I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THE GUITARISTS PLAY THEIR INSTRUMENTS. BUT THE BEST PART WAS GUITAR SOLOS, THAT'S RIGHT YOU REMEMBER THOSE DON'T YOU? OTHER THAN THAT I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THESE GUYS, GET RID OF THE VOCALS AND YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD BAND HERE!................ Well sorry but I just saw the video for bat country and now I know why I gave these guys a two star. They look like emo vampires or something! Or I guess if you wanted to be funnier you could just say they look like GOOD CHARLOTTE!
B0000JCFPE|3.0|I did not see this movie on first release in 1992, but just watched it last night after seeing the scorching trailer for the upcoming sequel.   I figured maybe it was about time to check out the first film.    There are plot holes galore.  Acting that must have seemed very \\"serious\\" in 1992 now borders on camp.  And yet, it is mesmerising. This is one beautiful looking piece of trash...and I mean trash in the most fun sense of the word.   I can see why this film made Sharon Stone a sensation, and not because of the crotch-flash.  She's definitely the best thing in it, other than Jerry Goldsmith's haunting and perfect score.     All in all, it doesn't add up to much but sure is fun to watch and nice to look at.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie at all when it first came to the theaters. The commercials for it didn't really 'do it' for me, and as much as I love Johnny Depp, I didn't think he'd be a big enough draw for me either. So, I waited until it was on dvd when my sister bought it, and we watched it. <br /> <br />I ended up liking the movie more than I thought I would. However, in many respects, I still prefer the old version, maybe because it's what I grew up watching, so it holds a special place for me.  <br /> <br />This new version parallels the old in many respects, and then of course, it doesn't. It's very obviously a Tim Burton movie. Anyone familiar with his work would notice that right from the onset. This version has oompa loompa songs, but they aren't anything like in the old version, except for the particular kid being sung about. These songs were just ok and aren't songs that would stick in your mind, like the older songs did. <br /> <br />Instead of the scene with the golden geese, there are squirrels. I wasn't too keen on that part. It was a little creepy to see a ton of squirrels all over the place, and especially creepy when they carried someone off. I don't mind squirrels as a general rule, but that many all together was strange. <br /> <br />Also in this version, you learn more about Willy Wonka as a child, and get a glimpse into how he turned out to be such an odd character. His father was a dentist. Well, what better way to rot children's teeth than to start your own candy empire? So, that's what Wonka did, in antithesis of his father's life's work. <br /> <br />There are certainly more differences in this version, but those are the few that stood out for me the most. As far as Wonka's go, Johnny Depp's version didn't annoy me as much as I thought he would, and was in fact kind of funny. But, I still prefer Gene Wilder's interpretation. He was just the right blend of an eccentric, slightly mad, smart aleck who still managed to be loveablein spite of being a nut.
B00001OH7G|5.0|Rory Gallagher was from Cork, the 2nd largest city in Ireland. On a visit to Ireland in 2004 , I was at the Cork City Hall where part of this was recorded. Directly across the street is a small store called Tatse, which is devoted to selling everything and  anything associated with Rory Gallagher. Along with all his other work, this CD is on sale there but this is the only one where they can point their finger out the window and say \\"He recorded this one right there.\\" Kinda neat.  <br />If you've never heard of Rory Gallagher, you're in for a treat. <br />He was a fine singer and songwriter but his real ace in the hole was his guitar playing. He could play like a Stevie Ray Vaughan or Duane Allman and this live setiing gives him plenty of space to uncork some great solos. Gallagher came before U2 and it's a shame he never got the recognition that the band from Dublin enjoys.
B0006M4SO6|1.0|If you like the following PM songs:<br /><br />- If I Could<br /><br />- Farmers Trust<br /><br />- The Bat<br /><br />- The Road to You<br /><br />- Night Turns to Day<br /><br />- Distance/In Her Family<br /><br />- Always and Forever<br /><br />- Tell Her You Saw Me<br /><br />- Goin' Ahead<br /><br />and most of the Album \\"One Quiet Night\\", then just pass this effort by. While Pat is beyond brilliant in the above listed tracks, this \\"suite\\" of pedantic fallen architectures is simply Pat at his most unfocused.  Technically the work is excellent, but that of course has little or nothing to do with beauty or art. Pat at his best is a calm flame of storm & pathos. At his worst - you get this album... To be clear, I love this guy's music on the whole, but this creation clearly does not work.  Pat has to know it too... It is a faint spark of a poem that has been revised to death in the studio...  Even the best like Pat can't always come through.  Experimentation brings genius and pabulum. Sometime you can't have one without the other.  \\"The Way Up\\" is the latter.  It is OK. We still love Pat, just not this work...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Well,dedicate some personal 'review' after listening 'Forbidden Love' from madge's new album,' Confession on a dancefloor'. <br /> <br />    There are no entrances but everyone, in the middle of a phrase dangling from the telephone, from the top of the fountain of silence or laughter, from the glass cage of the eye that watches us, eveyone, all ofus are falling in the mirror. <br /> <br />    Don't let the hueristics become the mirrow of your own. <br />Judge not, and ye not be judged. <br />    Open your eyes (mind). What thou see in the dark backward and abysm of Time??? <br /> <br />    Perhaps some of people are blind upon the burden of being and life. <br /> <br />    Like it or not. 'Confession on the dancefloor' is the great album in recent year.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|The \\"Spice Melange\\" extends life and existence as people know it in the year 10191 AD. However, this precious spice is only available on one planet and that is planet Arrakis. Also known as DUNE!<br /><br />There are two families who want to gain control of spice production because the one who controls the spice, will, indeed, control the whole universe! The spice is mined on Arrakis but there are HUGE sand worms that try to guard it for themselves. Be careful of WORM SIGN!<br /><br />The families that war it out over the spice are: House Atreides, home of Duke Leto (Prochnow), Lady Jessica, a Bene Gesserit handmaiden & their son, Paul (MacLachlan). The Atreides reside on planet Caladan. House Harkonnen, comprised of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (McMillen), Feyd-Rautha (Sting) & The Beast Rabban, reside on planet Giedi Prime.<br /><br />On planet Kaitain resides Jose Ferrer as the Emperor of the Universe, Shaddam & his daughter, Princess Irulan played by Virginia Madsen.<br /><br />This story is focused on intergalactic warrior, young Paul Atreides & his messianic rise to leadership by coming into his own, so to speak. Due in part to an old prophecy regarding a man that will be above all other men.<br /><br />The circa 1984 visual/special effects are STILL stunning even by today's standards, the soundtrack is by Toto, and some of the monsters created for this film, like \\"The Guildmaster\\" were by the likes of E.T.'s Carlo Rambaldi.<br /><br />This film heads an all-star cast with the ones mentioned above plus - Sean Young as Chani the Fremen, Linda Hunt as Fremen Shadout Mapes, Brad Dourif as Piter De Vries, Patrick Stewart as Gurney, Max Von Sydow as Dr. Kynes, and even David Lynch makes an appearance as a Spice mining worker!<br /><br />Even a 5 or 6 year old little girl by the name of Alicia Witt from \\"Urban Legend\\" & \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" gets her first big movie role, her SAG card as Paul's little sister, Alia, and one of the best lines in the film - \\"And how can this be? For he IS the Kwisatz Haderack!\\"<br /><br />The alternate 2 hour 57 minute version on the flipside of the theatrical cut was the cut for television. As many fans of Dune know, this 'extended' version was disowned by Lynch, who insisted his name be replaced by that famous Hollywood pseudonym \\"Alan Smithee\\" the name used by directors whose films were taken away and recut against their wishes.<br /><br />PROS: The extended version is FINALLY released in DVD widescreen format. The circa 1984 set design and special effects are still, indeed, SPECIAL!<br /><br />CONS: Lynch's version of Dune is either a \\"love it or hate it\\" epic film. If viewers are expecting the mythic 4 hour \\"David Lynch preferred\\" version that is rumored to be sitting in a vault, don't get your hopes up. This version is indeed, a MYTH.<br /><br />Deleted scenes include the highly debated and much removed Thufir death scene where Thufir is administered a lethal dose of poison by the Harkonnen's and has a kind of sexually orgasmic death.<br /><br />Regardless, if you like Lynch, sci-fi or just weird set design and effects, I highly recommend this film to you!<br /><br />Happy Watching, Unpleasant Dreams & May The Spice Be With You!!!- \\"And how can this be?

0895260131|1.0|After reading some of these reviews it seems that all the people who liked this book are very bitter and angry. I wonder if Jesus<br /><br />(peace and blessing of God be upon him) would have treated his Muslim fellows this way?<br /><br />As it has been mentioned in other reviews, Jesus, virgin Mary and<br /><br />many other characters mentioned in the Bible are very much accepted and believed in by all Muslims throughout the world. Muslims believe in Jesus' return as well.<br /><br />Those who are free of hatred in their hearts should examine the Islam religion from an academic and historical point of view.<br /><br />You will see that Christians, Jews and Muslims have 95% in common. Why don't we focus on what we agree on?<br /><br />Today's problems are not religious based but based on property and land disputes (i.e. Palestinian and Israel issue).<br /><br />Why do you purchase these books where it takes you away from reality and to a zone of hatred?<br /><br />You have to ask yourself as a reader what do I gain by reading this book?<br /><br />There are over One Billion Muslims in the world.<br /><br />That means out of 4 people you run in to in this world 1 of them will be the believer of Islam.<br /><br />Not to mention that Islam is still the fastest growing religion in the world.<br /><br />So, what are you planning to do with this false understanding and garbage that you got from this book?<br /><br />Unless you are willing to put these 1 Billion people in a concentration camp, you have no choice but to understand, accept and get to know your fellow human beings.<br /><br />BTW, to the genius reviewer who said: \\"trinity throws a monkey wrench at Muslims\\" and \\"Christian and Muslim God is not the same\\":<br /><br />Do an encyclopedia or a historical research on Trinity.<br /><br />You will see that Jesus (peace be upon him) never asked his<br /><br />followers to worship Me. Jesus, Moses and Mohammed asked their followers to choose the path of God and only worship God.<br /><br />Muslims DO NOT worship Mohammed. Mohammed was merely a messenger of God. Also, the term Trinity came about 200 years after Jesus passed on. That is part of the 5% difference that Muslims and Christians have. However, and for example Ten Commandments and many other Christian Values are held dearly sacred and sound by all Muslims.rship Mohammed. Mohammed was merely a messenger of God.

B000683VI4|4.0|I think, for me, this movie can illustrate some of the difficulties in creating a romance drama that is very effective.  This movie is a finely crafted and beautiful work of art.  The story and the filmmaking are keen on providing a sense of profound happiness and energy into the concept of love, one that is both healing and outgoing.<br /><br />However, some various problems arose for me with the exposition of the characters.  I was simply not attracted to either of the characters.  They got together too quickly, too loudly, and from there I couldn't really feel love for them even though I could feel their love for each other.  Does this fall into personal taste, or does this fall into shortcomings of the story?<br /><br />Well let's take a look, for a moment, at how they got together, that scene with the ferris wheel.  It was loud, it was out there, and it was pretty obnoxious, honestly.  Does it connect with us, the viewers, at a level where Noah's actions are reflections of what we secretly desire to do, to climb and to jump and to yell and to make sure she promises to notice us at all costs?  Or is it simply brash and contrived, a character that is so outgoing that he represents anybody who is impulsive, albeit completely honest about his feelings and completely persistant in his emotions?<br /><br />Or Allie, is she honestly someone that guys would fall in love with, the person we can imagine as \\"The One?\\"<br /><br />Of course at this point somebody will probably think I'm reading too much into them, or I'm just not accepting the movie for what it is, or anything along that line, but in the nature of film criticism I want to ask, what is the purpose of movies like these?  As an entertainment medium, it connects us with the idea of \\"love\\", the one, the search for that precise person that the two characters find in each other that loves each other and can love forever, something that is needed especially since the world gets so cynical now.<br /><br />So why am I just completely not in love with those characters?<br /><br />It's a good movie.  What I liked especially were the opening shots and that entire scene involving the swans and the rain, which were indeed very romantic.  The story was very touching.  I just didn't like the characters.  I think the real dilemma is that they had too much dialog.  Sometimes they spoke when honestly they should have been a bit quieter; and I'm not talking about the first sex scene.  That scene was actually one of the movie's strongest moments, one that was more honest about the anxieties for those two young lovers and the implications of what they were doing.  I'm talking about moments in the film where all the characters needed to do was share a look, and instead they shared some dialog and it brought me away from the idea that they were truly connected on a deeper level.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB/>So why am I just completely not in love with those characters? <br /> <br />It's a good movie.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|This isn't just a Christmas movie.  In fact, I watch it all throughout the year.  It's a real, funny, touching movie that people can really relate to.  I think it's really great when you can laugh out loud and cry at one single movie.  The music is great, the comedy is hilarious, and there are some really great one-liners in it, too, but above all it's about the invisible, yet strong bonds of love in its many forms (and languages!).<br /><br />My husband and I love this movie, and give it a shot...yes, it's very British, but the theme is universal.  Oh, and watch out, there's nudity.
074322454X|5.0|The group of men in the 101st airborne goes through basic training together. They go through rough things in there. They have to put up with the Drill Sergeant that know every likes. After basic training a regiment is formed called the 506th regiment. They are basically shipped out right away. The men go through Normandy to Hitler's Eagles Nest.  Since the men go through a lot it makes you keep on reading.  <br /> I would recommend this book how is a World War II history buff. I didn't find anything I didn't like about this book. I like how they describe the scenery and the climate.  It was basically cold the how time. <br /> The book is just like the movie Band of Brothers. The movie Saving Private Ryan was based on part of this.  <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|Revolutionary, heart-wrenching, gorgeous!!  I LOVE this CD.  It is one of my all-time personal favorite albums, up there with several of the Beatles' albums.  It think it is Radiohead's best work yet.<br /><br />Exit Music (For A Film) is my favorite song on OK Computer, and it makes me cry almost every time I hear it.  It just seems so painful, so heart-wrenching, yet it is sung so softly and delicately.  My second favorite song is No Suprises.  I just can't even begin to tell you how original and beautiful it is.<br /><br />With all the junk music out there today, this is one quality album you really should listen to in its entirety.  It's extraordinary and breathtaking, and I don't believe you'll regret it.
055380457X|2.0|Here's a book full of uncritical gushing about Page and Brin and Google; 99% of the time it sounds like it was written by Google's PR department. I mean I wasn't looking for a Google-bashing book, but they just poured it on way too thick here. <br /> <br />Despite the snowjob, this book reveals that the story of Google just isn't very interesting, and it seems Page and Brin have as much personality as a block of wood. The title should be \\"The Bland Google Story: How a Couple of Non-Entities who Fell Backwards into a Pile of Money like to Yap About What Good Citizens of the Earth They Are.\\" <br /> <br />I was hoping to rediscover the fascination I've found in the past when reading books about Apple or Microsoft and other such businesss icons. But you're not going to find that here, and Bill Gates is a regular swashbuckling matinee hero compared to Larry and Sergei. You find yourself hoping for SOME kind of anecdote or two about them eating out of a dumpster in the lean early years of Google, or getting into a barfight with the Yahoo guys, or Larry racing to find Sergei, who's drunk in a ditch on a winter morning, before their big presentation -- but no, none of that.

015603008X|5.0|Charlie Gordon's life is about to change.  Born with an unusually low IQ he is about to take part in an experiment that will increase his intelligence.  It's already proved successful on a mouse named Algernon.<br /><br />As the book begins, Charlie is writing down his actions in progress reports.  He'll take ink blot test, and race Algernon through mazes to show how far he has progressed once he's had an operation that promises to make him smart.  As Charlie grows in intelligence, he also grows as a person.  Experiencing love for the first time, and the memories of his family.  And as he gets even smarter he sees that he wants to help people like him.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it comes at a few prices.  He ultimately loses all his friends.  Where dumb Charlie really was dumb, he was, for the most part, a likeable guy.  As Charlie's intelligence increases, even surpassing the scientists who worked with him, he becomes arrogant.<br /><br />But one day, Algernon's acquired intelligence begins to deteriorate.  Now Charlie knows it is destined to happen to him, and it shows throughout his progress reports as he begins to lose the intelligence he once had.  Not only is this a compelling story about one thing just about every human being wants--to be smart, to prove they're not dumb--but it's also a story about the human psyche.  The emotions that Charlie feels, and even understanding them help us to even feel for Charlie.<br /><br />The story is very effective because of the unique style it is written in.  It is written exactly as Charlie thinks and talks.  That is to say, in the beginning it is written as if by someone who is still taking elementary school English.  But as the story moves forward, Charlie's style of writing improves.  Again, however, it's effective because as he begins to change back to the same old Charlie Gordon, it is reflected in his writings... to the point where he can't even understand his own writing.<br /><br />It should be noted that this book has had a major influence on pop culture.  Influencing plays, three movies, and even being the inspiration for an episode of \\"The Simpsons,\\" (where Homer gets a crayon removed from his brain) and \\"Rugrats\\" (whre Chuckie dramatically improves his sense of smell, only to find the experiment is a failure) among other television shows.  It has also influenced reams of fiction including comic strips and short stories.<br /><br />The story also hits a high emotional level.  Upon reading it I found myself in tears by the end.  It's a remarkable story.  One that not only shows us the cost of intelligence, but the rewards of determination.noted that this book has had a major influence on pop culture.

B00005221M|5.0|This movie is really great.  The whole movie was shot in Asheville North Carolina....which is about 45 miles from my house.  One of the shots was shot up in the gourge in the Nolichuckey River right where the csx trainline runs.  The last 17 minutes of the movie was shot in chimney rock which is a very beautiful place.  There is many landmarks you can see in this movie such as Mt Mitchell, Lake James, and Table Rock.  The first shots at the opening and the closing of the movie where shot from the blue ridge parkway overlooks.  The music for this movie is great everything in this movie fits into place.
B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera proved to be one of the greatest heavy metal bands in the world with the 1992 release of this album.This is also the album that made Diamond(aka Dimebag) Darrel a household name for heavy metal guitar fans and the rest of the band were at the top of their game as well. <br />     The album starts off with Mouth For War, a great and heavy rock song.Walk shows of Dimebag's talent for rhythmic guitar riffing and Phil Anselmo's punk rockish vocals.F***ing Hostle is a good and angry sond and the bass and guitar tempos slow down a bit for the quasi ballad \\"This Love\\". No Good(Attack The Radical) steps it up a notch and the crunchy rocky  groove of Live In A Hole remains one of my favorite songs on the album.Regular People(Conceit) is another good punk style metal song and the riffs on By Demons Be Driven are irresistable.The best song on the whole album is also my favorite Pantera song right now(Hollow).The song starts off with a beautiful moving guitar melody and then kicks into something more anthemic and heavy.  <br />   Overall Vulgar Display Of Power is a great display of musicianship and also was of the best and most popular metal albums at a time when grunge and alternative rock were all the rage.
B00005JO1P|5.0|Honestly, I was incredulous when Ray was getting all the attention it was getting.<br /><br />I was incredulous when Walk the Line was getting all the attention it was getting.<br /><br />And what do you know but that is but an arbitrary and minor parallel that ties these two brilliant works of art together.<br /><br />While some people might complain about a formula developing, such a complaint is slightly unfair.  Sure, the focus of the two movies are similar enough that the exposition of the storyline sometimes seems a bit familiar, something that in a time where originality is upheld as one of the highest virtues, might lead people in the wrong direction about regarding works such as these critically.<br /><br />So they both involve a death of a brother at a young age.  Uh, those deaths?  They actually happened.  So they both involve drug addiction.  Uh, that actually happened.  So they both involve adultery and special love interest.  Well, that actually happened.  And you say it's a shame how both deal so much with post-traumatic stress disorder?  Well... with the things they've gone through.<br /><br />But focusing on Walk the Line alone now, let us contemplate on what this movie so GOOD.<br /><br />For one thing, the acting comes readily to mind.  Acting is one of the most readily apparent and focused on parts of filmmaking for the reason that it's basically what makes or breaks the story.  The acting in this film?  Brilliant, and I'm not just saying that.  Joaquin phoenix's role isn't just unbelievable... it's really believable.  Reese Witherspoon pulls of June Carter and honestly it's difficult to imagine an actress like her actually pulling the strings like that.  Okay, so I'm biased because she's been in mainstream movies of little importance.  But that's the point: she does really well, completely redefining my image of her.<br /><br />And then they can both sing, which I find hilarious considering most vocalists of modern bands can't even seem to sing yet two actors can and can also sing exactly like the people they're portraying.  Ahhh, the state of modern music... but I digress.<br /><br />Secondly, the writing.  As discussed above, the story follows the same rough outline as Ray, but it is different in this way: Johnny Cash is a different character than Ray Charles.  Furthermore, the story they tell of Johnny Cash's life is very good, very touching, and very well presented.  It made the music itself seem that much more powerful.<br /><br />Oh, and the music.  I'm no fan of country music, and I haven't had much exposure to Johnny Cash besides listening to the live prison album alluded to in the movie, but this is some very strong stuff.  It's easy to imagine that miming and overrecording would have been used, but the mere fact that it wasn't just adds one of those indefatigable aspects of what makes this movie work so well.<br /><br />Then of course there's the directing and the cinematography.  Specifically, if anyone's doubting the impactfulness of the work behind the camera, I argue to rewatch that long shot where Cash tears apart the bathroom.  Watch how everything possible seems to be at full work here, movement, zoom, acting, makeup, set design, music, atmosphere, lighting, all targeted in such a way that it does not feel reasonable to assume that such a take could ever be done again, even if all the same mechanics were at work.<br /><br />Okay, so I've basically just hyped it up a whole lot more, adding to that same hype that has people tired and sick of the whole idea of the movie before they've seen it.  Admit it, the mere fact that it's been nominated for some Oscars means that it already feels overrated.  I know exactly what you mean...<br /><br />...afterall, what made me wait to see it so long?<br /><br />But whatever.  Think what you want.  I think this film is pretty darned great.

Blue Racer: Dark Side has my favorites Breathe, Money, Us and Them and Brain Damage/Eclipse.

B00006AFUR|4.0|Alright, Jared Leto is the frontman of this band. You know what that means, right? Right. Start laughing. Now listen to the first 2 tracks or so, and then promptly stop your laughing, because if you have any shred of musical taste you'll realize this band is much, much, more than just an actor's way of idling his time when he's not in a movie. Actually, I found this band when I was very much into the industrial sound. Also, I had no idea of who Jared Leto was at the time. 30 Seconds to Mars has geniunely good music to offer and a much needed injection of originality in the mundane world of mainstream rock that we are experiencing today. The album throws you against a wall with a double team of 'Capricorn' and 'Edge of the Earth' and from there, takes you in all directions from the trippy 'Buddha For Mary' to 'Echelon', which should captivate listeners with its vivid imagery and powerful chorus.    However, that isn't to say that this is a perfect album. The theme, while interesting, will lose your attention in certain points. But, while this album falters, it will regain its former energy and bring right back into the world they're trying to create. This minor flaw is even more forgivable because their second album, 'A Beautiful Lie' remedies the problem by bringing 30 Seconds to Mars back to Earth for a time, showing true versatility by varying the themes of their sound, and even successfully covering the song 'Hunter' (Originally written by Bjork.) So aside from these minor issues, this is a SOLID album and is well worth your time and your money. In conclusion, I give it 4 Stars, but only because I can't give it 4.5.
B00004RFFS|2.0|On a whim, I recently picked up a bargain copy of \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\" Familiar with the controversy surrounding the casting, I was perhaps most interested in judging that question for myself. To get that issue out of the way, while I do think that Cruise is miscast as Lestat, he does a creditable job and gives some of his more comical lines a nice turn. The real disgrace is Pitt, who is just awful as Louis, moping around in a constant funk, like a mobile grey cloud of angst and self-recrimination.  <br /> <br />Having said that, however, dare I suggest he was only doing what the part demanded? And having made that suggestion, dare I go further and remark that maybe the big problem with this film is less one of casting than of whether or not the Vampire Chronicles make good material for movies? I like Rice's novels, but when I read them, I wondered how they could be filmed because they achieve their power through a combination of introspective characters and rich descriptions of sensual experience. The latter are certainly within the power of film to convey, and the handsome production design and cinematography demonstrate that the makers of \\"Interview\\" were attentive to the need. For the introspection to work, however, the scenarist and actors would have to find externalized equivalents to Rice's subjective passages that an audience can understand. <br /> <br />To put it mildly, they do not. Rice is a gifted novelist, but that's no guarantee she's a dramatist. The fact that she was employed to adapt the novel to the screen suggests a misplaced deference to the material that is testified to throughout by the lush, expensive over-production. \\"Interview\\" feels like nothing so much as one of those reverent bio-pics from the early sixties, about a Pope or a King at the very least, or an adaptation of something like \\"War and Peace\\" or \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" or the Bible. Which, when you think about it, is pretty silly when dealing with a popular novel about vampires.When the horror moments come, inevitably the filmmakers fall back on loud music, shock cuts, lots of gore, in short all the standard ingredients of cheap horror. Inevitably, the effects seem out of keeping with the pseudo-importance of the rest of the production. <br /> <br />A first rate director might be able to find a way to bring all these contradictions together, melding the ingredients into a vibrant totality akin to the novels' excitement. Neil Jordan's films tend to be one mark above ordinary. He seems to have a knack for recognizing interesting material, but not enough dramatic imagination to make it compelling. He's essentially a decorator, somebody splashing the occasional visual effect on the material with no real sense of how any of it-story, dialogue, camerawork, design, performance-should work. The results aren't disgraceful, just not very interesting for very long. <br /> <br />Which might be said for the whole film.
B00000JQFM|5.0|I enjoy almost every genre of music from jazz to country, to r and b ect. And how this cd relates to it is that it too is music. I play guitar, but their are more technically proficient players out there. If you just want a mindless guitar shred there are tons of those guys, but satch is different. His playing is so vocal you can understand what he's saying without a single word coming out of his mouth. And he's not afraid to let loose and unleash face melting solos while hes at it. These are not just a bunch of vamps with improv over it. These are structured songs with excellent melodies and hooks that will get stuck in your head(the good way). Its wonderful music that is accesible to ANYONE. I highly suggest to pick this CD up and enjoy yourself. And just for those that are still not convinced. Joe satriani tought such other guitar greats like kirk hammet from metallica, the guitar player from primus(I forgot his name) <br />and probobly the most famous Steve Vai(who was david lee roths guitar player back in the 80's) Mick Jagger has handpicked satch before to go on tour. He has toured with deep purple and was asked to join, but he declined. His famous legato style is known through out the guitar playing community. He is a great artist which are greatly needed in todays world( fall out boy, green day, seether, just turn on MTV). And check out his new stuff too.
6305882592|5.0|Along this Decade the undeniable and relevant presence of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel surrounded and somehow renovated the expressive possibilities of the black humor as irreverence signal and punching cynicism respect the Status Quo (Phantom of the liberty, The milky way or The discrete charm of the bourgeosie);  in this sense it is easy to support this argumentation naming for instance Fellini `s Roma, Robert Altman with Mash,  Irvin Kershner `s A fine madness, or Carlos Saura `s The garden of delights.<br /><br />As it is well known Ashby always bet for smart and funny scripts which had to do with this constant challenge to the rules of the game. And this picture is to my view the peak achievement of his career. This thick humor turns around the Oedipus syndrome; a ruling, conceited and manipulative mother (as you may see the perfect mother in law) and her odd young son, who devises some ethical breakthroughs; but along the way this man will find his sentimental bliss thanks to woman who will become the right device to escape and search shelter without changing nothing except perhaps some shelter.<br /><br />Splendid, ravishing and extremely mordacious.
B00092ZL80|5.0|It was only after surfing through the Amazon catalog that I even knew this concert had happened...guess living in Hawaii can do that to you.  Having missed Chicago's last two concerts out here and never having seen EWF in concert, I was happy to discover a CD that brought back such amazing memories from my med school days in DC when I blasted \\"That's the Way of the World\\" into the Foggy Bottom air (almost daily) in the late 70's.  Hearing Bobby Lamm singing \\"Saturday in the Park\\" almost freezes me in my tracks and any song with Pankow (sexiest man to ever pick up a horn), Loughnane and Parazaider doing their magic \\"makes me smile\\".  The finale when both the groups are onstage playing one another's music was incredible...the CD would be worth it if that was the only part of the concert recorded!! Buy it!!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|So I admit, at first I thought they would sound a lot like Fall Out Boy with insane pop/emo lyrics that you couldn't understand. But I was wrong! They have catchy lyrics that you would find yourself humming unknowingly at work. Alot of the lyrics are mature though, so this isn't really a great album for kids. In my opinion they bring a little something new to their music. It is emo music, there's no denying that. I could probably tell you that just by looking at their lable, Fueled by Ramen which has intoduced many emo and punk bands. But they also have a hint of dance influence blended in that will have you dancing...on your bed with while using a spoon as a makeshift microphone. Their TRL hit I Write Sins Not Tragedies, doesn't really give you a feel of this CD, but it is a good song. This CD really surprised me, you should definatly give it a try.    <br />
0156027321|5.0|the ending will blow your mind.  some parts are slow, but it is worth it all in the end.  one of my favorite books of all time.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|The plot of this lavish 2005 remake follows that of the 1933 film very closely - this is the story of a young and beautiful actress named Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) from the world of vaudeville who finds herself lost in depression-era New York and her luck changes when she meets an over-ambitious filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black) who brings her on an exploratory expedition to a remote island where she finds compassion and the true meaning of humanity with an ape known only as Kong. The beauty and the beast finally meet their fate back in the city of New York where the filmmaker takes and displays the ape in quest of his fame by commercial exploitation which ultimately leads to catastrophe for everyone including a playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) who falls in love with Ann and plays an unlikely hero by trying to save her from Kong and her destiny.<br /><br />Despite its 3 hour runtime and the fact the set up may be too long, I was enthralled by this film and never bored once. It delivers some truly stunning set pieces, including the attack by the hostile, murderous natives of Skull Island, continuing with a dinosaur rampage and a terrifying tribute to the lost Spider Pit scene from the 1933 original. I also loved the period detail of the film, like the reconstruction of 1930's New York.<br />When Kong does appear, it is a true wonder to behold. Not only is the effect totally convincing (trust me, you will think its' real) but Andy Serkis does a marvellous job of portraying what is, perhaps ironically, the most human character in the film.<br />His Kong is a a tortured soul, like the Beast in Beauty and The Beast, or Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies - and shows us that even the most \\"beastly\\" characters can have gentle qualities.<br />Naomi Watts is also quite brilliant considering most of the time she is acting with something that isn't really there. To watch the friendship develop between human and ape is really very touching.<br />I also liked the in-jokes and humor in the film brought about by Jack Black - there are some lovely asides to the original 1933 King Kong.<br /><br />Truly a fantastic film, one that deserves to be seen. Peter Jackson - you are truly a master.film brought about by Jack Black - there are some lovely asides to the original 1933 King Kong.    Truly a fantastic film, one that deserves to be seen.

0679745203|5.0|Michael Ondaatje is one of my favourite writers, and this is one of his greatest works. Ondaatje, who defies conventions and blurrs the line between poetry and prose, is not bound by the same grammatical formalities as most writers. The result is a shocking, unique novel that presents an honest, though sensational, look at life. <br />The themes are sharp and tragic. I now feel an odd understanding of Almasy. He was, to some, insensitive and brutish. But, truthfuly, he was passionate and, though unstable, he was a genius. <br />The ending left me angry, but spellbound. The characters, given free will, reacted in ways realistic but saddening. The novel is a tragedy of epic porportions. <br />The writing extended beyond simply telling the story. Ondaatje, a gifted man, made profound inferences regarding life and expressed them eloquently. He is, and should remain to be, one of the greatest Canadian novelists now living.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, based directly, or as directly an adaptation can possibly be transferred from one medium to another, from Frank Miller's comic series of they same name is disturbing, cruel, unrelentless, and possibly sinful (note: Miller is listed as co-director, but this is at the insistence of Rodriguez).<br /><br />As stated previously, it tells the stories from three Sin Cilty graphic novels.  The two most powerful stories are adaptations from \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" and \\"The Hard Goodbye.\\"  That Yellow Bastard is seperated into two seperate sections, the begining and the end (well sort of) starring Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba.  Bruce Willis is great, but his voice over narration is a technical mis-step and is the only flaw in the story.  The pitcure is so powerful, the voice over overly impacts the visuals.  Willis is believable as Hartigan and he is the last  good cop in a corrupt city - Sin City.  Alba is perfect as Nancy, the little girl who becomes a stripper (the only role I have appreciated Alba as an actress).  The little girl who plays the young Nancy is splendid.  The plot deals with evil at its wose, taking it to its very extremes.  Good finally previals, but with a price.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke gives the best performance since \\"Angel Heart.\\"  He is perfect for the part and  plays it well. This time, the voice over narration adds to the visuals and technically works - enhancing the story and its visuals.  The villians, played by Rutger Haur and Elijah Wood is devilish and scary.  They also show extreme evil, as a man of the cloth perverts what is good for the pleasure of evil transcendence.  The supporting characyters are great, and Rodriguez provides moments to lighten things aup a bit - although quick, it is needed.<br /><br />The story involving Clive Owen should have been left out of this pitcure and maybe added for a sequal, if shown at all. It fails to impact the way the other stories do.  I did not find much wrong with it, it just seemed long and unnecessary.<br /><br />This movie deals with sin, in the extreme fashions, but that may be what is needed to shoke a world out of its slumber.  There is no relativism here - evil is evil - the pitcures tell the story.  And in a world of evil, glimpes of love and hope do survive.  The one good cop and little girl who keeps her promise.  His death is not a suicide but a sacrifice.  A monster showed attention by a beautiful women, and after avenging her, is shown love by the sister.  Redemption is there for the seeking.it just seemed long and unnecessary. <br /> <br />This movie deals with sin, in the extreme fashions, but that may be what is needed to shoke a world out of its slumber.

B000002KON|5.0|what a beautiful album! one of the rare albums that  has no fillers or weaker cuts. i'd call it a classic but that makes it sound dusty. these songs could come out in 20 years and still sound fresh.
B000BCKFWK|1.0|thought maybe I missed something - so I picked up the DVD. I didn't miss much. It's an awful film that looks great. Rourke gives a stunning performance. Too bad it was in such a waste of time film. I liked the books by the way...but a load of the dialogue comes off as ridiculous when it's said out loud rather than being filtered by your brain in context of  paneled art. Glad that people dig it, maybe this kind of stylized film can be built around a good screenplay. Did I mention the music gave me a headache?
B000AMJDHY|1.0|1. Panic! At the Disco sounds like Fallout Boy because they used to cover their songs.   <br />2.If you listen to this, you've been completely played.  The entire album is tailor-made to appeal to young, teenage girls. Every song has a dance-based beat, incessantly suggestive lyrics and titles that almost make the song's content seem socially relevant to all the little suburbanites.  Please, stop polluting the air with this re-hashed, re-worked junk.
B00005JOFO|1.0|I can't begin to summarize this movie.  The plot was so boring; I can't believe I didn't fall asleep during the film.  I didn't even understand a word Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were saying.  They were mumbling.  At the beginning of the movie, the setting was beautiful, but as soon as a word was spoken, everything went downhill.  Anne Hathaway played a good part.  Her role progressed as the movie went on.  Yes, there are a couple sex scenes with Gyllenhaal and Ledger, but it was totally pointless.  They weren't even gay in the movie.  They just wanted sex; didn't matter from who.  This movie also stars Linda Cardellini (Velma from Scooby-Doo 1 and 2) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1, 2, 3, and now 4).  I couldn't believe it when I saw Anna Faris.  When I saw her I'm like `is that the girl from Scary Movie?'  Same comment for Linda Cardellini.  I really expected more from this movie, but instead I was very disappointed.  I just can't believe this got nominated for an Oscar.
B000002MTR|5.0|One Hot Minute may be the Red Hot Chili Peppers most puzzling release, but at the same time, it is their most skilled album, which is pretty much why many people did not like it. That, and of course the John Frusciante bias.    Deviating from the John Frusciante melodies of 1989's Mother's Milk and 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magik, the Dave Navarro era of the Red Hot Chili Peppers focused mainly on song movement, skill, rhythm and power.     Unlike the rest of the Red Hot Chili Peppers catalogue, melodies on this album is all but non-existent, and all four members from Anthony Kiedis' vocals, to Flea's textured bass, to Navarro's surging guitar, and Chad Smith's well timed drumming strove more to create more driving rhythms based in psyhedelia (\\"Aeroplane\\", \\"Transcending\\", \\"Tearjerker\\", \\"My Friends\\"), blues (Flea's solo \\"Pea\\"), funk (\\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\", \\"Aeroplane\\", \\"Falling Into Grace\\", and \\"Deep Kick\\"), jazz (\\"Walkabout\\"), and metal (\\"One Big Mob\\", \\"Transcending\\", \\"One Hot Minute\\", and \\"Coffee Shop\\"). However, at times efforts floundered and some of the songs, most notably \\"One Big Mob\\" and the title track, end up much longer than needed. Nonetheless, One Hot Minute is a rather cohesive album.    As for the chemistry issues people always claim, the fact those criticisms draw mainly Navarro's entry into the band being compared to Frusciante's entry is highly unfair. Frusciante was well familiar with previous guitarist Hillel Slovak and took after him quite a bit (as you hear on Mother's Milk) as for Navarro he did not draw on much from his predecessor, but from his days with Jane's Addiction.     So in closing, if you want to look at it in terms of songwriting,  it may be not as good as its predecessor, but understand, this was Navarro's first and only time with the band and he did not do much to be like Frusciante. If you want to look at this in terms of skill, riffs, and power, than this probably has the best out of all of the Red Hot Chili Peppers albums.    KEYTRACKS: \\"Aeroplane\\", \\"Warped\\", \\"Coffee Shop\\", \\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\", \\"Transcending\\", \\"Falling Into Grace\\", and \\"Walkabout\\".
B0001XALTG|5.0|I could make this a long review but I wont. Theres nothing I can say that will explain the greatness of this film. It is pobably the film I reach for most often when I put a dvd in. If you like films that explore the seedy underbelly of society than you will love this. It is loaded with disturbing drugged out dispair. However it is also one of the funniest films I have ever seen. If you dont laugh at the scene where francis begby randomly lobbs that empty beer stein over his shoulder and it splits that ladys face wide open just so he could get into a fight, than you must not have a twisted bone in your body. This film also has a very serious nature to it as well. Rentons attempts to ween himself from smack will make anybody think twice about sliding that syringe int your veins.That being said this is not just your usual \\"drugs are evil\\" movie. Trainspotting also holds no bars about the reason people do drugs.  \\"Take the best orgasm youve ever had and multiply it by a thousand and your still nowhere near it\\"-Renton. That pretty much explains it all. However in order to experiance the sheer brilliance you have to see this movie yourself.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|Today (February 10th) has not been the most cheerful day in hip-hop. It's the day that Big Pun passed away and also one of the most prolific producers of all time, J Dilla aka Jay Dee. He's been an inspiration for all of us \\"hip-hop heads\\" and he leaves us wanting for more after \\"Donuts.\\" Sadly, we will not hear any new material from Dilla but his legacy and work will live on forever. His death may have been untimely but his work will always be timeless. Rest In Peace brother. <br /> <br />As for this album, please do check it out. You will not be dissapointed if you're a Dilla or hip-hop fan.
0316776963|1.0|This book isn't funny.  Talking about taking drugs, your horrible careers, dead pets and making fun of children is not funny.  <br /> <br />The writing is not very juicy either.  Any one of you reading this could write a better book.  <br /> <br />The good part is, the writer seemed to have trouble meeting the minimal word limit so the reader can finish reading the book rather quickly because there is not much to it. <br /> <br />The reviews on the cover must be for marketing purposes.  If you really are curious about reading it, barrow the book from a friend or buy it when it gets to the Dollar Store.   <br />It's horrible!!!
B00005JO20|5.0|One of the greatest masterpieces of our time. Highly overlooked by many. A simply incredible film.
0060512806|4.0|I had an interesting love/hate relationship with this book.  I bought it on a whim with no background on the story - just the blurb on the back and the sales clerk's hearty recommendation. I'm not a big SciFi fan, so I didn't know Stephenson.  I've since read Quicksilver of the Baroque Cycle and liked Cryptonomicon better. <br /> <br />Cryptonomicon managed to keep me reading, albeit in small doses, over a period of a couple of weeks.  I'd read a few pages on my train ride home from work.  Every couple of days I would get irritated with the slow pace of the story, but just when I had decided I hated this book, it would get interesting again.  In the end, I enjoyed the book immensely.   Although, like other reviewers, I would have liked a more satisfying ending.  I really enjoyed the math and computer bits, but I have an engineering background. <br /> <br />All-in-all, Cryptonomicon has a kind-of historical fiction / SciFi feel with interesting, inter-related characters.  A slow read for me because the story rambles and thus requires some patience.  I will abandon a book if it doesn't keep me interested, but this always kept me just on the line.
B00082IJ08|4.0|I must admit, I have not bought into the whole concept of a virtual, animated band.   I do question if several years after this review is written whether they will continue to ride a wave of success.  However, one can't argue - at the time of this review they have made it work.    Gorillaz's 2005 release \\"Demon Days\\" would bring the band a much more mainstream fan-base.    Much of this success can be attributed to the single, \\"Feel Good Inc\\" - with a catchy beat and a mix of many styles would help Gorillaz broaden their audience.   You will discover that when you get the album, \\"Demon Days\\" - you are getting an album that is not going to repeat the style of \\"Feel Good Inc\\" for each of its 15 tracks.     Instead, you will see that \\"Demon Days\\" really is a concept album.   Many of the tracks incorporate a variety of styles - Funk, Hip-Hop, Rock, and Pop.  I also saw elements of Prince in this music.   While the Virtual Band concept helps feed to the conceptual theme this album offers, this is clearly a work that could stand on its own for the musical product it presents. <br /> <br />\\"Demon Days\\" concept fits into the Science Fiction realm.   It depicts a world in a post-doomsday state.  Perhaps this doomsday state was caused by nuclear war or an alien invasion.    How this occurred is left up to your imagination.     \\"Demon Days\\" presents us with a feeling that this world is full of oppression, tyranny, and martial law.   This feeling will continue through the story of \\"Demon Days\\".    Toward the end of the \\"story\\" we are presented with a more uplifting theme and some hope for optimism.   There will be a heavy use of synthesizers on this collection, but they will basically help to enhance the story that is put forward here.    The whole anime concept of the virtual band has helped also to tell this story visually. <br /> <br />The collection starts off with an \\"Intro\\".   This part really almost simulates how the \\"Doomsday\\" occurred.  The band uses \\"elements\\" (as theycall it) from the game \\"Dark Earth\\" and from the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" soundtrack.   It is an instrumental, but the \\"elements\\" assembled really helped to demonstrate this feeling.     Following the \\"Intro\\", the collection takes us into \\"Last Living Souls\\".   This seems to take place after the doomsday occurred.    Those who remain alive now are simply asking the question, \\"Are we the last living souls?\\"   You will hear sirens that almost paint a picture of martial law that is described in the lyrics.    The third track is \\"Kids With Guns\\" - a title that continues with the theme of anarchy that is painted in the world depicted by \\"Demon Days\\".    There is a great bass track - and some nice piano work.   Listen to some of the Prince-like vocals in this song.   Nenah Cherry has guest vocals. <br /> <br />\\"O Green World\\" continues the themes of the previous two songs.   The synthesizers in this song almost give me the feeling that there was an alien invasion as opposed to a nuclear war that resulted in this state.    The lines \\"O Green World, don't desert me now\\" almost is a cry for help for those who survived.   The fifth song is \\"Dirty Harry\\".   This song will also back-up the theme of anarchy and oppression that have been set forward on the previous songs.  There is a Hip Hop part of this song that you will either love or hate.   There is also a good funk groove to this song. <br /> <br />\\"Feel Good Inc\\" has a very catchy beat.   It is going to have both a Funk and Hip Hop sound along with some elements of Rock.    Again while I not a Hip Hop fan, it works in this song - namely because it is sung from both the point of view of those who are in \\"control\\" and those who are \\"oppressed\\".   <br /> <br />The themes put in place on this collection continue on \\"El Manana\\" and  \\"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\\".   There are some terrific harmonies on \\"El Manana\\".   The sirens continue to depict the anarchist state portrayed on this album.   Listen for the strings toward the end of this song.  \\"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\\" almost has almost a futuristic blues sound to it. <br /> <br />Tracks 9 and 10 are \\"November Has Come\\" and \\"All Alone\\" respectively.  I found these the two most \\"rap\\"-like tracks.  They continue the theme of the album.   I felt \\"November Has Come\\" was the weakest track of the collection.    The female vocal segment by Martina Topley Bird on \\"All Alone\\" is very good. <br /> <br />\\"White Light\\" is the 11th track.   This song has a punk rock feel to it.   Not many words to this song - the words \\"White Light\\" will play mantra-like. <br /> <br />\\"DARE\\" is a very good song.  This song contains elements of funk and techno-dance.  It also has a Prince-like feel to it.    <br /> <br />\\"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\\" is going to be highlighted by spoken words read by actor Dennis Hopper.  This tells the story of a town that was insulated from the oppression of the anarchy, but then eventually falls victim to it. <br /> <br />The last two tracks are assembled as a segue with an Orchestra-like sound.   \\"Don't Get Lost in Heaven\\" almost has a psychedelic 1960's theme to it while the title track \\"Demon Days\\" has more of a \\"Purple Rain\\" feel to it (especially in the strings).  I found these are the songs that take the album's very depressing theme and end it on a uplifting feel and a note of optimism. <br /> <br />The liner notes do not include the lyrics - I consider that a negative when you have a \\"concept album\\".   Despite the animated nature that Gorillaz presents, parents should be warned that there is adult language and suggestive language in some parts of this album.  Musically, this album is as solid as they come.  Highly recommended.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of the series, but this movie was fantastic. Great characters, good story, cool bad guys, tons of action, and some of the best dialogue I've heard in a while. This is a true Sci-Fi film, better than episodes 1, 2, and 3 of the Star Wars movies. In fact after seeing this I want to take a second look at the Firefly series, I think I might of misjudged the show.
0553801503|5.0|Yes, new characters are introduced... which i really wish he hadn't.  He could have saved them for short stories or something.  There's just so much going on in the world already, are these really necessary? <br /> <br />And way too much peripheral characters... Brienne's story was well written, but she could have been completely left out and the novel wouldn't have missed a thing. <br /> <br />I still highly enjoy the book though, mostly because i enjoy the way Martin writes.  I just truly hope he doesn't turn into Jordan, and all we get are characters and no plot developments.
B00005JOFO|5.0|After reading the book, actually started as a short story, I am shocked! I am a gay man and have been looking forward to seeing the movie since I first heard it was being made. Living in rural Alabama, the movie wasn't even playing at any of the 16 theaters in our area until 02/03 even though the \\"official release\\" was 02/16. I'm not in a hurry to see it at the theater, I would much rather see it at home. I was shocked simply because of all the hype which left me with a completely different idea of what the movie was really about, but after reading the book, all of the clips I've seen and the reviews I've read, now make much more sense. I'm sure many other folks have the same idea of the \\"Queer Cowboy Movie\\", but if the movie is anywhere near Annie's story, I just could not sit quietly in a theater and have my heart wrenched and twisted. To the best of my knowledge, the DVD is scheduled for release April 4 ... I've already pre-ordered!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The Region 4 \\"Serenity\\" 2 disc edition is superior and the best out of all regions with exclusive extras.  You can find retailers from down under who ship worldwide.   <br /> <br />If audiences want a film with a good storyline and plot, excellent characters, snappy dialogues and a whole load of action, and science fiction to boot,buy and watch this dvd!  Whilst having watched the \\"Firefly\\" television series will allow you to get into the story quickly, audiences can see this film without having any pre-knowledge of the universe \\"Serenity\\" exists in.  The series was described as \\"a western in space\\" and the film is exactly that.  Exciting, pacey and compelling this was by far one of the best releases of 2005.  Of course, like all films there are weak points but these are few and far between.
B00008BRDX|5.0|This digipak version of this great album is a real treat because they did a great job remastering this.  The sound quality is very good and seems to have given the whole album a whole new lease of life; it's almost as if I'm listening to this for the first time.<br /><br />Although many people like \\"Synchronicity\\" and probably first started being Police fans after that album, I was a fan from the early days when I first heard \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\" from the \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" album.  The sounds I heard just blew me away; the uniqueness of the music and the fact that the band, almost zen-like, used like the Eastern artists do, no sound or silence as an important part of their music.<br /><br />If you look at Eastern, Chinese or Japanese art, the space that is not painted on is just as important as the part that is painted.  One could \\"over-paint\\" and destroy what would have been a great piece of art.  Similarly in the music of the Police, you'll notice that the space or the parts without any music allows the tracks to breathe and the \\"spaci-ness\\" actually is a Police trademark and works very well for them; too many notes and it just wouldn't work.<br /><br />Perfect examples of this are on \\"Walking On the Moon\\" and \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You.\\" Contrast this with the more \\"busy\\" tracks like \\"Message In a Bottle\\" and \\"No Time This Time\\" and you'll see what I mean about like fine wine, letting the music breathe to attain maximum aural effect and The Police were masters at doing this.<br /><br />From an overall great complete, coherent, flowing album perspective, this album is second only to \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" but miles ahead of \\"Synchronicity\\" which had great singles but sounds very disjointed as an overall album and truth be told had some pissed poor tracks like \\"Mother\\" and \\"Synchronicity 1\\" and if ever an album would have been better off with one less track, that one was it as \\"Murder By Numbers\\" although a great track on its own, should never have been on the album.<br /><br />No weak tracks on this baby, though and given the great digipak packaging and the great remastered sound, this is the version that you should get.  Highly recommended.ever have been on the album.   <br /> <br />No weak tracks on this baby, though and given the great digipak packaging and the great remastered sound, this is the version that you should get.

B00005HYHC|4.0|They call this one of the digital remaster series and while you can hear that the sound quality is an improvement over the original, when you compare it with the other digital remasters that are out there, this one pales in comparison.  The sound volume levels are still very low and it makes you wonder if the reason for this is that they did the best that they could with a severely deteriorated master.<br /><br />Still, the mini-lp gatefold sleeve replica design is first class and they even have in addition to all the lyrics in both English and Japanese, great round art fall-outs that resemble what was on the original vinyl centres.  And now to the content itself which is truly brilliant composition by mostly Waters and then the rest of Pink Floyd.<br /><br />Ironically, if you truly want to understand the album, you'll need to get the movie that was done much later with Bob Geldof playing the lead role as Pink, the rock star with the troubled childhood and subsequent life experiences coupled with drug and drink addictions which eventually lead his mind into a slow, inevitable decline into insanity.<br /><br />I read from an interview with David Gilmour who plays some incredible guitar on this album (as a guitarist myself, I'm not ashamed to tell you that the guitar solos on \\"Comfortably Numb\\" bring tears to my eyes each time I hear them: simply beautiful music and soloing with great heartfelt expression)in a guitar magazine how Pink is really Sid Barrett, that early founding member of the band who slowly went mad after drugs and drinks and what Gilmour believes also was something to do with his childhood and genes as well.  He would actually go on stage and play just one chord all the way through the set.  I read that he would go to a clothes store and purposely order a pair of trousers that was 4 sizes too big and then tell the sales assistant,\\"Thanks!  Just the right size!\\"<br /><br />Just like on \\"The Wall\\", the whole story is quite sad because like Pink, Sid Barrett was a true genius; he used to write most of the material of Pink Floyd's early albums (check out the brilliant \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\") just like Roger Waters did on their later albums, their true creative genius on their earlier works was Sid.  He could write great psychedelic lyrics and music but then alas began his downward descent into insanity.<br /><br />\\"The Wall\\" has a unique combination of sound effects (dive bombing war planes, baby cries etc) and great harmonies and even classical themes in addition to the rocks themes that tell the story of how a rock artist eventually loses his mind after having to deal with the early death of his father and the subsequent smothering mother, a rigid and cruel education system and then after drug and drink addiction, the unfaithfulness of his wife led him to self-mutilation and full-blown insanity.<br /><br />This is Roger Waters' and Pink Floyd's tour de force album and surely one of the best concept albums ever.  You have to listen to this one from the beginning to the end at one sitting to truly appreciate its genius.  A true work of art and this version is still probably the best one of \\"The Wall\\" that is out there until they do a better remastering job and improve the overall sound quality of the recording.  Hopefully they'll do the same for \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" soon too.

B0002VKZL6|5.0|Until the last 10 yrs or so I never really \\"listened\\" to Mark Knopler seriously. I remember the moment I really \\"heard\\" one of the most beautiful songs of my life, the song \\"On Every Street\\". I have no idea why, but it makes me almost cry thinking about every time I hear it. From then on I loved Mark Knopler's music and really appreciated it. Now back to this current CD, I must admit that when I put it in my CD player in the car I was disappointed, but like the other reviewer that mentioned listening to it alone, I replayed it when my head was clearer. And then I got it! This CD is more of a personal listening experience than anything else. The stories told are very touching and you really understand the short stories when you listen carefully. For me this CD is a joy to listen to and I only hope that the listeners appreciate Mark Knofler's skills and gifts he shares on this CD.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This albums is the best Hip Hop/Soul ablum of time.To me lauryn hill's talent and soul by far out shines that of Mary J. blige( the most over rated woman in the history of r&b). This classic album makes me feel Ms. Hill is the true Queen of Hip Hop/Soul. Though it is interesting how simular both voices are in timbre. Listen to 'I USED TO LOVE HIM' from this album, you should notice there is ony a subtle difference in tonal quality when these ladies exchange verses (lauryn has the sweeter voice though).    To the review who said this album only gets on every bodies top 100 list because it won a grammy is an idiot.    Um, beyonce's 'dangerously in love', Alicia Key's 'songs in a minor' and norah jones' (whatever the name of her album was) all won a record 5 grammys, but ONLY 'the miseducation of Lauryn hill' is a classic. the others are good but not classic.    Sorry, i lied, 'songs in a minor' is actually not a very good album. it is quite borring.      Im my opinion 'miseducation' rightfully deserved more like 8 grammys. This is due to its uniqueness, rawness(i love this about it), genius lyrics, l-boogie's superfly rhyming skills( she IS the BEST female rapper of all time, lil' kim, missy elliott, foxxy brown and eve who are quite good can't compare), the darkness of her voice and her musical/cultural diversity.    by the way, this ablum had no hype with me. i got it in 2001 long after the hype that surounded lauryn hill died down. i still listen to it every day and i still love it.    it sounds especially fresh when i don't for like a month and then blast it through my sound system. try listening to an alicia keys or beyonce album for 5 years and you'd want to kill your self.    Ms. Hill is a genius.
B00005JOGU|5.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman has acted phenomenally before, but usually in smaller films.  Capote is a fantastic film that never goes wrong.  This is Hoffman in his best performance.  There is no other actor in this year's Best Actor category that truly matches Hoffman.  His accent and mannerisms are perfect.  One of the year's best films and one of the best biography films I have ever seen.  It far surpasses even great films such as Walk the Line and Ray.
B000002B5L|5.0|God alone knows what the hell, 50 cent, g-unit, nelly(who by the way has absolutely no skills on the mic), lil' jon etc are doing. <br /> Well for me this is the best Hip Hop album of all time. the year is 2006 (10 yr after its release)and i quite often am bumping fu-gee-la, ready or not and killing me softly, just to break away from the crap that dominates mainstream hip hop radio. <br /> <br />Sorry to be a young black male and say, 95% of the Hip Hip/rap music and even now R&B music these days are pure crap. <br /> <br />this album is one of music's gems.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is one of the year's best films, and it's more than a movie about gay cowboys.  I understand that some people may be offended by this movie, and in this case, if you are one of those people, please don't watch it and trash the movie.  For us open minded people, this is one of the best love stories I have ever seen.  Wonderfully acted, Heath Ledger is only bested this year by the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman in Capote (consequently in another homosexual role).  Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty good in this movie, but only Ledger's Ennis has enough depth to his character.  This movie is firstly about him, and secondly about his relationship with Jack (Gyllenhaal).  This is a wonderful tragedy.  It seems like a modern day Shakespearian tragedy.  This film should pick up a few Oscars, hopefully for the wonderful direction of Ang Lee.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This CD Has \\" Bonus Tracks <br />- Fighting Spirit (aka Revenge, which was recorded as a Demo) <br />- Super Pop / Superpop (This one was released after Revenge) <br /> <br />It's weird that nobody wrote it before me...
B00005JO04|5.0|Roger Ebert said \\"This is the kind of film that you aren't supposed to follow, but rather you are surrounded by it.\\"  This is a very proper way to put this film into context.  Now, this film is probably one that will be loved by liberals and hated by conservatives, but should be watched by all.  Along with the great acting, especially by that of George Clooney and Chris Cooper, the ideas and views expressed in this movie are very respectable, even if you don't agree with them.  Yes, it's confusing, and yes, it's complex, but it is very worth it.  This is one of the year's ten best.
0060825219|3.0|I have enjoyed other novels by Paulo Coelho and was eagerly anticipating this one.  I'm sorry to say I was disappointed.  The premise of the book seemed intriguing, and the story posed some interesting questions but the writing just never grabbed me and pulled me in.  Turning page after page I kept thinking, there has to be more, but the story never delivers.  The characters are boring and unlikeable, although it takes place all over the world you never get a good sense of the surroundings and on a spiritual level, the story never gives us that \\"AHA\\" moment.  It was like anticipating the release of a movie and finding out it's better as a rental.
B000AL730O|3.0|I was horribly disappointed with Sir Macca's  Cd \\"Driving Rain\\" and had high hopes for this one after seeing him out on the road with this great band rockin' and just reminding us that he is a musical genius. The buzz on this one had been good and all I wanted (after 25+ years of being a Macca fan) is an album better than Driving Rain.  <br /> <br />It is...barely. <br /> <br />Sorry, but like I said in my Driving Rain review the proof's got to be in the pudding. I like some of the songs here...but for the most part for me it's just a dull album.  <br /> <br />I love the Cover Photo!  <br /> <br />1. FINE LINE: Yes. Nice opener. <br />2. HOW KIND OF YOU: No <br />3. JENNY WREN: YES, love it. <br />4. AT THE MERCY: NO <br />5. FRIENDS TO GO: NO <br />6. ENGLISH TEA: YES, charming. <br />7. TOO MUCH RAIN: NO <br />8. A CERTAIN SOFTNESS: NO <br />9. RIDING TO VANITY FAIR: NO <br />10. FOLLOW ME: YES, nice melody <br />11. PROMISE TO YOU GIRL: NO <br />12. THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE: NO, draggy <br />13. ANYWAY: YES, very nice  <br /> <br />I do recommend Sir Macca's \\"Tug Of War\\", \\"Flaming Pie\\" and \\"Run Devil Run\\"
B00005JOII|4.0|\\"Match Point\\" is quite a departure from your typical Woody Allen movie. It is set in London rather than New York, it has an opera soundtrack rather than jazz and, most significantly, it is a dramatic thriller without even a hint of comedy. Does this change in style work for Allen? Well somewhat, but not  entirely. It's far better than Woody's recent mediocre efforts, especially last year's horrible \\"Melinda And Melinda\\". But still it is far off from the best of Woody Allen's work, such as \\"Annie Hall\\", Hannah And Her Sisters\\", and \\"Crimes And Misdemeanors\\", among others.     Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a young Irishman who has given up his career as a tennis pro and taken up a position as a tennis instructor at a school offering classes for London's wealthy and elite. Here he befriends Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode), a young man from an upper crust English family. Chris is soon invited to meet the Hewitt family and then begins dating Tom's sister Chloe. He also meets, and immediately begins lusting for, Nola Rice - a struggling young American actress who is engaged to Tom. Chloe falls hard for Chris and, hoping for a future together, has her father find Chris a well paying executive postion within his company. Chris and Chloe get married and seem on their way to a comfortable life together. But Chris' lust for Nola overwhelms him and they, since Nola was recently dropped by Tom, begin a passionate affair. Nola soon becomes pregnant and pressures Chris to end his marriage to Chloe. But Chris, unwilling to give up his new found wealthy lifestyle, instead carries out a plot to murder Nola. He is then left to deal with his conscience, while a moment of good fortune allows him to escape further police investigation.     The storyline managed to hold my attention but was far from captivating or original. Also, unlike most Woody Allen movies, I really could not find a character to relate to or empathize with. Chris and Nola were both amoral social climbers behavingbadly and Chris also ended up being a heartless murderer in the end. Meanwhile, Tom and Chloe were spoiled, rich kids without enough of a personality to make me feel strongly one way or the other about them. The movie did attempt to make an intellectual statement about the importance of luck in human affairs. But it was used more as a plot device to tie up the story line than as something that struck me as really profound or insightful. Yes, Woody Allen is back - at least from the dreadful depths of \\"Melinda And Melinda\\". But he is still a long way from the \\"glory days\\" of his best work.
B00005QK3W|3.0|Coming off the BRILLIANT  \\"Flaming Pie\\" & \\"Run Devil Run\\" I was most excited to hear Sir Macca's new CD.  <br /> <br />Ouch! <br /> <br />Without getting into a deep analytical discussion...etc, I must come right to the point. The proof must be in the pudding! Are there any songs here I would add to my Macca's Greatest Hits Of All Time list???  <br /> <br />Hardly. <br /> <br />I have bought every Sir Macca album since 1982's \\"Tug Of War\\". I have been loyal and supportive and all I've asked is that I feel like I get my $$$ worth. <br /> <br />\\"Driving Rain\\" disappoints me the way \\"Pipes of Peace\\" and \\"Press To Play\\" did. The songs, in my opinion, just aren't that good.  <br /> <br />There's only 2 songs I really like on here: \\"Heather\\", which should have opened the album, and \\"Magic.\\" The rest just never grew on me to a point where it became annoying. I spent a great deal of time trying to get \\"INTO\\" this album and these songs and it never happend. <br /> <br />I don't like David Kahne's production. Too washy and cluttered.    <br /> <br />Sorry to be negative.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I first watched this movie about 3 years ago when it premiered on HBO.  I never read the books,  so I didn't really have a reason to go see it in theaters, and I didn't even want to see it enough to go out and rent it once it was on video.  So, one Saturday night when I had nothing better to do, I sat down and watched this movie, and I didn't really like it that much.  I thought it was a little too long, and the plot wasn't really that solid throughout the movie.<br /><br />However, after reading the novel, and now watching it again (after purchasing it), I must say that I have a newfound appreciation for the quality of this film, and the amazing job it does of realizing Harry Potter's world.  The casting is pretty much perfect.  For being first time actors, all the kids are well-spoken, and very believable.  Richard Harris makes a perfect Dumbledore.  But the best casting job was Alan Rickman to play Professor Snape.  Rickman just has the perfect look and body language that I imagined Snape to be like while reading the book.  He gives off a very evil vibe.<br /><br />I was able to forgive what I thought were the film's shortcomings on the second viewing because I now understood that the filmmakers were trying to be as faithful to the book as possible.  The truth is, the story about the Sorcerer's Stone was really a secondary plot in the book, too.  The main point is Harry and his experience at Hogwart's, and now I can see that in the film, as well.  Also, the length is now forgivable, because I felt like it was just long enough to include everything from the book that needed to be included, but still keep it at a manageable runtime, where people who hadn't read the books could still be interested.<br /><br />I never thought I'd be saying this about myself, but I know that I'll be at a midnight screening when Order of the Phoenix comes out.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Beautiful movie. It's the real world, so let's accept the subject matter. Great acting, scenery and directing.
0786852550|5.0|fantasy is a very great gerne but the problem is when a good idea comes, its just long rip offs of tolkien, lewis, and rowling. however, there are those books of new ideas, kind of like a breath of fresh air like the warriors series, pendragon, and now the B trilogy (sry, i cant spell its name) though the book has rowling in it like boy wizard but thats pretty much it, the rest is all new stuff. in this series, london is run by magicians who's magic comes from the demons they control. nathanial is one of them who has revenge on his mind after being humilated by a fellow magician. so, he speeds up his education and summons the powerful B (again, cant spell his name) who absolutly drips with dry humor. with him, nathanal orders him to steal the amulat of samarkand but that object has landed nathanal in a whirlwind of espionage, murder, and concpiracy. the book also is full of humor that can make you chuckle with joy, truly B is something new. he'll probally go down as one of the most famous book characters ever. so read this fresh book.

B0002858YS|5.0|In my opinion, The Killers have done so much for music. When I got their CD last year without any great expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. The great thing about HOT FUSS ist that these songs don't take 10 listens to really get into them. They are catchy and refrshing from the first time heard and will stick in one's ear - permanently. After owning this CD for over a year now, it still finds its way into my CD-player on a weekly basis.  <br />The Killers are talented and this album is truly addictive. I reccomend this to fans of alternative, pop, dance and rock, because all of these elements are perfectly blended in on here.

Unfortunately because of our busy schedules, we have viewed it for the first time tonight (2/10/06).  Although we still love this movie, the quality of this reproduction is horrible - the worse I've ever seen!!

B000002TWN|4.0|But D'Angelo probably comes closest this side of Michael Jackson's masterpieces back in tha day (not to say that the two are even in the same category artistically). <br /> <br />Soul, soul, soul ... that's a HUGE factor that separates the D'Angelos, Raheem DeVaughns and Calvin Richardsons from wannabe R&B icons like Usher, Tyrese, Omarion, Chris Brown, Mario ... (did I miss any of today's quote-unquote \\"top R&B talent?\\") <br /> <br />This LP Brown Sugar should be required listening for any up & coming male vocalist that even aspires to one day be big-time. <br /> <br />\\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Lady\\" are my jams.

(LOL). Cope this LP!  It should be among the first purchases when it comes to contemporary hip hop-flavored R&B.

0790732254|5.0|This utterly fantastic film has long been one of my favorite movies,bar none. Being a huge Burton fan definately has something to do with it. Perhaps his finest performance? An adaptation from the controversial[Albert Finney?]play that leaves the viewer in a melancholy and somber mood. The pervasive despair,deep cynisism, and yearning for choices not made(or made poorly) that this middle-aged married couple exudes slowly poisons and cheapens the innocence and naivetie of a young newlywed couple. The film takes place within a single evening and morning. Drinking like you have never seen with,of course,an equal amount of smoking. Brilliant cast of Richard Burton,Liz Taylor,George Segal,and Sanndy Dennis. A very deep and disturbing drama focusing on the bizarre relationship of a washed-up Assistant Professor and his ambitious,yet resigned, shrew of a wife. The one-liners Burton uses are simple yet cruelly barbed. Definately not a \\"feel good\\" movie. Very difficult to explain unless one has seen the film. One of the hardest dramas I have ever watched.

B0007Y08PQ|4.0|The ninth caper in the Trek movie franchise initially received mixed reactions from fans, but it's definitely worth looking at a second time.  <br />Some viewers scoffed at the notion that the Federation could have \\"mis-used\\" the Prime Directive, but in the Trek universe, anything's possible. Lapses in judgment and logic were part of Gene Roddenberry's \\"morality play\\" from the beginning. And besides, isn't this what makes good drama?  <br />Capt. Picard is caught in a moral dilemma: Obey Federation orders and help \\"forcibly\\" relocate a peaceful alien race from their \\"fountain-of-youth\\" regenerating planet so that it can be \\"strip-mined\\" to help millions of others; or, oppose the Federation and defend this weaponless, technology-denounced, simple folk?  <br />F. Murray Abraham plays the principal villian, Ru'Ofo, with over-the-top theatrical flair (not easy to do under a grotesque mask of prosthetics). His character becomes the chief motivator in trying to remove the Ba'Ku off the planet.  <br />There are wonderful moments in subplot: Due to temporary exposure to the planet's regenerative effect, Riker and Troi rekindle their romance (as a result, Riker shaves off his beard!); Worf re-experiences Klingon puberty (complete with accelerated hair growth and acne); and the most heartfelt moment comes when LaForge's eyesight is temporarily restored, allowing him to see a sunrise for the first time, tears welling in his eyes. It's definitely LeVar Burton's finest moment.  <br />There's also a sweet romance between Picard and a lovely Ba'Ku woman (Donna Murphy), as well as a poignant & charming friendship between the child-like Data and a 12-year old boy, who initially rejects him because he's a machine, but then grows to like Data.  <br />But the moral issue embodies itself in the person of Admiral Dougherty (veteran actor Anthony Zerbe), who becomes entangled by his loyalty to the Federation and his faust-like partnership with Ru'Ofo.  <br />There are some great action scenes here: Picard's retrieval of a malfunctioning Data in an exciting scout ship chase; the previously-mentioned malfunction, as a berserk Data jeopardizes a surveillance mission; and Ru'Ofo's scout ships swooping down and shooting \\"transporter tags\\" on the Ba'Ku.  <br />But no Trek film would be complete without light comedy touches: <br /> <br />        Picard: Mr. Worf, are you familiar with Gilbert & Sullivan? <br />        Worf: No sir, I have not had a chance to review the crew roster.  <br />              --------------------------------------- <br />        Riker (spotting a giant zit on Worf's face): You Klingons don't do anything small, do you?  <br />              --------------------------------------- <br />        Worf (speaking to Picard from the alien vessel): They would like to discuss terms of surrender...it may also have something to do with having only 3 minutes of air left!  <br /> <br />This a worthy addition to the Trek franchise, with Picard and crew sort of riding in like \\"the Magnificent Seven\\" and saving the day as they stand up for what they believe in.  <br />
0671027387|3.0|I've been reading Deception Point and thought it was very good but I've come to the part where Rachel & company are escaping from the Delta Force on the ice shelf and have flown off the edge only to land on another piece of ice which is just barely hanging on the main glacier.  When the Delta Force catches up to them they devise a plan to knock this multi-million pound slab of ice from the glacier by inserting a percussive genade which apparently works but then the slab falls perfectly straight down into the Arctic without knocking anyone off and without tipping or slamming into the side of glacier.  Unbelievably the 3 people stay right on the slab after this cataclysmic plunge into the ocean and after the water clears they're fine! Now they're drifting out in to the Arctic and will be frozen to death within minutes but low and behold a submarine has magically appeared just as they approach death.<br /><br />This is extremely cheesy to me and and I don't even feel like reading the rest of this.  This reminds me of a Steven Seagal movie.  Much too far fetched.
B0000683DH|5.0|When \\"Star Trek: the Motion Picture\\" was released, fan reaction was mixed. Although eagerly awaited by Trekkies, the results were mediocre; the special effects seemed to be the true star, not the crew of the Enterprise. Nevertheless, the initial film did incredibly well, offset by the fact everyone were just plain happy to see the return of Kirk, Spock & Co. <br />But no one was satisfied; not cast or crew or fans. Enter writer/producer Harve Bennett. He wanted to \\"build a better beast\\". And so, he got back to the original series' roots, screening all the old episodes. No ideas, that is, until he came across \\"Space Seed\\". Then he said, \\"That's it! We're bringing back Khan!\\" And that's how \\"Star Trek II\\" was born. <br />TWOK (The Wrath of Khan) brings the Trek saga back to story & characterization, with a smattering of morality. The film explores the passage of time: growing old while still playing a \\"young man's game\\"; the contrast between seasoned crew members and their young trainees; sacrifice, death and hope; and how vengeance can be all-consuming.  <br />The latter statement, of course, refers to Khan, reprised with delicious zeal and double-dyed villiany by Ricardo Montalban. If done wrong, his role could have come off as laughable (his wig and garb make him look like an aging 80's metal rocker!). But instead, Montalban turns in an amazing performance, portraying a tyrant seething with rage and revenge for the past 15 years. An opportunity lands in his lap to exact revenge on Kirk, and he does not hesitate to take it.  <br />Most controversial was the demise of Trek's beloved Vulcan, Spock. The death scene is played beautifully between Nimoy and Shatner, and the eulogy is very touching: \\"..Of all the souls I've encountered in my travels, his was the most..human..of all.\\" <br />The dogfight inside the nebula, in which both ships \\"fly blind\\" with no sensors or shields, was well-staged and exciting.  <br />Fine supporting turns from Bibi Besch (Kirk's former lover, Carol Marcus), Kirstie Alley (Lt. Saavik, Alley's first film role), and Merritt Butrick (Kirk's son, David; sadly, Butrick died young in 1989), as well as the original crew.  <br />\\"The Motion Picture\\" may have been their first screen adventure, but TWOK is definitely the best; for it set the legend on the right course and cast the mold for future films.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Prisoner of Azkaban is the weakest of the Harry Potter movies so far, but then the book was as well.  It was mainly a set-up for the real fireworks in \\"Goblet of Fire.\\"  It also worked as a way to get Sirius Black into the story.<br /><br />As for the film, I don't care for Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore.  That said, the movie is quite good.  I really liked the portrayal of Professor Lupin.  The special effects are wonderful, and the magical world is richly portrayed.
B000002IOY|5.0|When the Years of Decay was first released, I approached it with caution, since I wasn't happy with \\"Under the Influence\\" \\"Under the Influence\\" Seemed like a far cry from \\"Feel the Fire\\", \\"Taking Over\\", and the EP \\"F**K You\\". I had no idea that \\"The Years of Decay\\" would not only completly wipe out \\"Under the Influence\\" it became their best out of the bunch (Horroscope didn't exist yet, so I am just comparing it to the first 4 albums) SO here were are 14yrs later since its release, and it deserves to be called a classic. Even though its not quite as good as it was 14yrs ago, I still think it is a really solid album and defines the days of Thrash Metal. I believe every Nu Metal fan should have this in thier collection, as most of the younger artist today probely grew up listening to the likes of Overkill and great 80's Thrash. It is a Metal Masterpiece, and it existed in a time that the only place metal heads could get thier daily dose of Metal was LP's, CD's (if you have the 300Bucks for a player and the 25bucks a pop for the disc), and of course our cassetes. Not to mention the fact we only had Saturday Nights of MTV's Headbangers Ball, or some College Radio stations that spun Metal on weekends late night (anyone from Jersey Remember 89.5 WSOU, in Newark?????) SO I urge all Metal fans to add this to thier collection and own a piece of history!!
6301954947|1.0|A Dino de Laurentis film superproduction with great aspirations and little or no quality other than documentary. A pity that, as it usually happens with massive and costly productions, the final product falls so short of expectations. Orson Wells, since the very first scene looks like a wig on a monkey, he should have done much better being behind the camera directing. The cast is not the problem, though. It's the script, the slow pace, the artificial atmosphere of grandeur a la francaise, the absence of feeling.<br /><br />This does not qualify as a film. As a documentary, yes, and a badly done one too. I was going to watch the director's try on \\"War and Peace\\" but I have definitely given it up now.<br /><br />If Stanley Kubrick couldn't get it done (it meaning Waterloo) and no classic director ever attempted it, how can we expect anything great from this Bondarchuk... King Vidor tried something epic with War and Peace and it never made it to one of his best (though a decent film). Hitchcock said once to Truffaut that he wouldn't try recreating a true literary classic because masterpieces can't be copied into other formats. Just like Don Quixote was created into a book it cannot (it has not so far) be copied into cinematographic language with the same results (Welles tried and couldn't finish). That is why Hitchcock preferred to pick little and more humble books to recreate.<br /><br />Waterloo is not fiction but History. But a masterpiece no less. Inimitable.
0895260131|5.0|Contrary to what some of the previous reviews posted on this site maintain, not everyone one who agrees with this insightful and straightforward book are bitter angry hate mongers. Such accusations are merely a ploy to distract from the important points contained in this book.  It is an old and, sadly, all too often effective strategy: When you can't refute someones stance point by point, go for the ad hominem attack. Some of the reviewers seem not to have read the book carefully at all.  For instance, at least one person referred to the book as \\"racist.\\"  Since this accusation is refuted in the book in an effective manner, I must conclude they either did not read the whole book or did not comprehend what they were reading.  Islam is not a people group or ethnicity, it is a religion.  Most Muslims these days are not even Arabs, but come from a wide variety of nationalities and people groups. <br /> <br />The information in this book is long overdue to be disseminated to the public at large. I have read other books discussing Islam, some by ex-Muslims themselves, and they coincide closely with the claims of this author.  One of the ex-Muslim authors, in fact, had his father try to kill him with a handgun upon learning that he was abandoning Islam (and this is not an isolated incident). <br /> <br />As long as we choose not to understand the mind bent of the followers of this false religion, we remain all the more vulnerable.  The riots and violence in Europe over a simple cartoon reveal the true face of Islam.  This is no argument from hypocrisy, this is what Islam truly teaches and can readily be found in the Qur'an. It is true that individual Muslims may be peaceful...the religion of Islam is not.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I discovered Sufjan Stevens quite by accident a few years ago and have been hooked ever since those fortuitous events.  I have since purchased all of his albums, but I must confess, while I usually am on top of buying my artists' new albums, I let months slide by without buying Illinois.  I was missing out.  This is Stevens' best work thus far.  It's no wonder that it made Rolling Stone's Top 10 for '05.  This album is truly original, thought-provoking, melodic, funky, soulful and spirtual all wrapped up in an eclectic musical burrito.  Maybe even enchilada.

B0006399FS|4.0|I mistakingly didn't buy this for some time, because while I'm a fan of U2's, not their biggest yet a bit of a purist so sometimes nervous that newer cd's won't live up to an artists best.  So it was only after the Grammy's that I bought this, and I wish I got it earlier because it is actually really good.  Vertigo has to be the standout song obviously, but there are certainly other great tracks too.  All Because Of You and One Step Closer are other songs I really enjoy.  I do think they were deserving of Grammy's - don't get me wrong - just maybe not for Best Album because I think there are more stand out stellar tracks on Kanye's and Mariah's cds.  Don't be like me and not buy this because you don't think they are going to be as good as they've been in the past - these guys do still have it and may continue on for many years if they pull another one out like this.
B00027JYLC|3.0|What were Todd Browning and MGM thinking when they made this film? Browning definitely wanted to shock and unsettle his audience, and MGM wanted a horror film that would rival his earlier Dracula success; but what both eventually achieved was an exploitation styled B-Movie with flashes of brilliance that has entertained, insulted, and disgusted its audiences since its first showing in 1932. <br /> <br />Beware...spoilers ahead....................................... <br /> <br />The story of Hans (played by Harry Earles), and his futile infatuation with the considerably taller Cleopatra (played by Olga Baclanova), set against the backdrop of the sideshow and its singular denizens, still manages to make one ill at ease upon viewing; perhaps due in large part to the participation of those real-life freaks that Browning included in his film: Prince Randian, the Living Torso; Pete Robinson, the Living Skeleton; Olga Roderick, the Bearded Lady; Martha Morris, the Armless Wonder; Joseph/Josephine, the Half-Man, Half-Woman; the Pinheads; the Hilton Sisters; Johnny Eck, The Half-Boy; Angello Rossitto (you may recall him from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); and other performers whose countenances were well off the bell curve average. While Browning was indeed heading down a much less traveled cinematic road, with films like The Unholy Three and The Unknown, his penchant for the unconventional hit its zenith in Freaks. <br /> <br />Taking Tod Robbins' story, Spurs, Browning (who had already used Robbins' novel The Unholy Three to critical and financial success), weaves a tale of intended murder and revenge that is visually stronger, and climactically more horrific than the original source material. Adding a sexual overtone that would undoubtedly offend just about everyone in his \\"normal\\" audience of the day, and portraying his performers as initially harmless people with dramatic life-altering physical characteristics, then turning them into demonic angels of vengeance when mistreated, he achieves a story and a mood that brings most viewers to an uncomfortable place they would rather avoid. <br /> <br />The wedding scene is one of the highlights of the film. David J Skal has noted that this particular scene was shot by Browning using his silent film experience (his best work was done in silent films), and indeed, it is prefaced with a title card announcing The Wedding Feast. It is a pivotal point in the film, as Cleopatra humiliates Hans and all of his friends, thereby sealing her doom. Close-ups of the freaks enjoying the festivities is juxtaposed with Hans' growing realization that he has made a mistake as Cleopatra becomes more drunkenly brazen with Hercules, the sideshow's strongman, whom she has been seeing behind Hans' back. As Hans sits, humiliated and heart-broken, the freaks begin chanting \\"gooble, gobble, gooble, gobble, we accept her, we accept her, one of us.\\" Angelo Rossitto jumps on the table and passes around a large goblet filled with wine, so that each of the freaks can sip from it. Cleopatra, alerted by Hercules as to what is transpiring, looks in horror as the cup comes closer and closer, eventually recoiling as the cup is held up to her. She takes the cup, but instead of sipping from it, yells \\"No... dirty...slimy freaks!\\" and tosses the wine into Rossitto's face. In his book, The Monster Show, Skal notes that the wedding feast was heavily censored, and one interesting element that would have intensified Cleopatra's horror at drinking from the communal goblet was removed: as the cup is being passed around, some freaks dribble into it.  <br /> <br />Foreshadowing the horror to come, Browning uses close-ups of Rossitto furtively peering into Hans' wagon, watching Cleopatra slowly poisoning him, and again as his scowling face peers into Hercules' wagon to see her and Hercules conspiring against Hans. What follows is one of horror cinema's more memorable series of scenes. <br /> <br />As Tetrollini's Traveling Circus prepares to get under way during a dark and stormy night, we see Johnny Eck scampering beneath the wagons. As lightning and thunder play in the background, the camera follows him as he makes his way to the group of performers patiently waiting, away from prying eyes, for their moment of reckoning. <br /> <br />Now under way, we cut to Hans' wagon, rolling along in the muddy road, where his friends watch as Cleopatra once again prepares her poisonous medication. Only this time, Hans confronts her, asking for the bottle of poison. His friends quietly pull out weapons and casually clean them, indicating their sinister intent. Cleopatra is understandably alarmed, and the spoon of poison drops from her fingers. <br /> <br />We now cut to mighty Hercules, who is also having a bad night. A knife is thrown by one of the little people, and slides into Hercules' side, bringing him down to the muddy road, where he is relentlessly pursued by a swarm of freaks crawling through the mud and rain, brandishing knives. The scene is nightmarish and stands out as one of the most horrific visuals in horror cinema.  <br /> <br />As for Cleopatra, her wagon overturns and she briefly escapes the little monsters by running into the nearby woods. We see her screaming one last time as they close in on her. After her scream we cut to the sideshow where she appears as one of the freak attractions. Leaving how she arrived there up to the audience's imagination.
B000667FN8|1.0|This is a diaster of a band. Please don't waste your money on this band. they shouldn't call themselfs punk-rock. this should be called lame-pop. most of the songs are just them winning about their proplems, but only they haven't got any proplems they are rich spolled brats.

B000002OMN|5.0|I'm sick and tired of people always going, \\"He'd do anything for love but he won't do that?  What the hell won't he do?\\"  If you can't figure it out, you don't belong listening to Meatloaf.  This album is awesome, I have been a fan since I first heard I'd Do Anything For Love.  Jim Steinman is one of my favorite songwriters ever, and how people can just dismiss him as cheesy and corny is beyond me.  I personally think his lyrics are some of the most clever, and his song writing skills are fantastic.  Every song Steinman writes is a masterpiece, he puts so much effort and thought into everything he does.  This album has a lot of Steinman's work that was previously available on Bad For Good, his solo album. As far as lyrics in music are concerned, Steinman's have always hit home with me.  Everything Louder Than Everything Else and Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through have been two of my long time favorites in which the lyrics have really influenced me.  Objects in the Rear View Mirror is another of my favorite songs, a typical Steinman epic power ballad, which he does to perfection.  Not many people have the ability to make twelve minute songs totally intersting throughout, but Steinman sure knows how to do it.  This is a great follow up to Bat Out Of Hell, Meatloaf and Steinman show that they are a perfect team once again, and the world is a better place having this music to listen to.

On the previous 2 albums the strokes followed a strick formula that worked well on every track. their debut being     <br />'is this it'i thought was stronger than 'room on fire'. Yet on there most rescent album i think they have lost what was once the fundamentals that made them so catchy and good to listen to. There are still elements of there old sound on a few of the tracks but on some i find they are trying to be too experimental and the lyrics  <br />sound sort of drunkern and forced. But still is a fairly good album in respect to all the other crap thats being turned out at the moment.

B00005JLKB|5.0|I finally finished the Buffy series, started the Angel series, but that was going slow.  Took the kids to see Cheaper by the Dozen with Tom Welling in it, and decided to give Smallville a try.  And now I finished Season 1.  Target had the other seasons on sale, so now I have them for myself. Can't wait!  To me, Smallville is a cleaner version of Buffy. Not as much sexual innuendo between characters (at least in Season 1), nicer evil monsters, just not as gory as Buffy, and that is fine. Both are great in their own ways.  It kills me now that Season 5 is showing on TV, and I can't watch them yet, but I will get there one day.<br /><br />  As for the theme song, it is the best, I bought the Soundtrack because of it, and my 5 year old sings it frequently.<br /><br />Fits the show perfectly.

B0009I7NNA|1.0|This band has gotten from decent to bottomfeeeders, this band in a concert with System of a Down, Korn, and Nine Inch Nails felt like Slayer between the line up. Slayer can play, AV7 can't. What I saw that night was awful singing, off beat drummer, bass player was only there as a stage prop and the guitarists just struggled. Hell, Korn gave a 100 times better performance than AV7 and they are declining. To this album, I thought it be a metal album but it ended up in the same category as Good Charlotte, simple plan, blink 182, Sum 41 and the other MTV borefest that gets played on TRL. The drumming is OK, guitar was not that interensting and the singer who by the way took vocal lessons because his *cough growling cough* hurt his vocal cords, gave a sorry excuse for a melodic singer, even whiny and girlish at points. The songs are very weakly written, and the few interesting songs were later just annoying. And what is up with the get up, womens clothing is bad on any man, quirky names are laughable I don't know whether to laugh or vomit. In conclusion, download for free or don't bother at all. I'd go further and more brutal, but I don't want to make anyone cry. You know who you are. And finally all that the concert showed was that Nine Inch Nails and System of a Down made live, energetic shows, and they did it out of charity and were not paid.
B00005R1N3|4.0|This movie has just about everything you'd want. The down right eerie feeling of someone watching you, the thought that some maniac is on the loose. The movie delivered some pretty good gore, which in my opinion was pretty few and far between for the first hour, but then got going in a very climatic ending sequence. The characters were great, and the plot was very unique and well executed. From the mid point on to the end, this movie is very close to a masterpiece. However, getting to that climatic point, for me at least, was a task.<br /><br />I personally felt this movie started off slow, and in a way it helps and in a way it fails. The slowness makes the ending climax very powerful, but makes about 20 minutes of the movie very hard to watch. I still don't know why so many people put thi film in their top ten. It isn't at all a bad film, but it really isn't great either. It has a lot, but what it lacks sort of evens it out to a marginally good film.<br /><br />Directed by Bob Clark, best known for his other Christmas movie \\"A Christmas Story\\", but the two movies couldn't be more different. Definitely his best movie, and Black Christmas was one of the better movies of the 1970's. Watching the movie it is very obvious that other movies that came later took a lot from this. Movies like When A Stranger Calls, Unhinged, Halloween and The House On Sorority Row were all great films that seemed to have nods to Black Christmas. It's not your typical Christmas movie. The sheer darkness and violence of the movie really sets it apart from the aforementioned movies, and really, any movies that came out about the same time.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|In the last of Tim Burton's Batman movies, Batman faces three notorious villains who each in their own ways act as dark mirrors to the Caped crusader. The linchpin of the movie is, of course, Michelle Pfeiffer as the ambiguous Catwoman. Pfeiffer's performanace as essentially three characters--Selena the secretary, Selena the would-be assassin, and Catwoman--is striking and well done indeed. Much as Batman's loss of his parents causes him to be obsessed with justice, so does her attempted murder by slimy businessman Shreck scar her; only, where Batman tries to achieve justice and shies away from completely nihilistic violence, Selena takes on a much more destructive means of getting justice. Also good is Danny DeVito as the appropriately loathsome Penguin, whose story in this largely inverts Bruce Wayne's personal tragedy. At the same time, Christopher Walken makes much of his role as the  centerpiece of much of Gotham's villainy. The characters and the setting of the movie are appropriately dark and conflicted, and in the end while Good triumphs, all is not necessarily well for the survivors. This film is apparently very personal for Burton, and that shows. Sadly, until Batman Begins, there would be no more good live-action versions of the Dark Knight. It's to be hoped future versions of Batman will take this movie and its version of the Batmn universe to heart.

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|. . .but even great bands can stagnate if they never evolve. I do love the first Strokes album; it has fun rockers that display a certain charm and innocence that the boys probably couldn't recapture if they wanted to.<br /><br />So what we have here, to my mind at least, is a more evolved, more sophisticated and certainly more hard rocking Strokes. Clearly, they have become better musicians. I loved the album when I first got it, but hearing it all the way through it seemed to drag a bit after two-thirds of the way through or so. But after several more listens, I dig all these songs now. Julian Casablancas is still highly charismatic; he has such a killer rock n' roll voice and he sings his heart out, sometimes to the point of almost screaming. He also wrote most of the music and all of the words (which are often quite incisive). I have to say, I'm impressed.<br /><br />Big bands often get attention from those who play \\"spot the influence\\" and plenty of influences do abound, but I like the Strokes' influences. \\"15 Minutes\\" makes it pretty obvious these guys like The Pogues, and it's a cool tribute too. Also obvious: the \\"Peter Gunn-like\\" bass riff on \\"Juicebox\\" that delivers that great James Bond sort of feel to it. \\"Juicebox\\" is a worthy single, but several of the songs are even better than that one, in my view. I especially love the opening track- a real killer.<br /><br />I wouldn't call FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF EARTH a radical departure, but rather a natural evolution. Those willing to embrace the new Strokes have been rewarded with a great album. I think most people dissing this record are just jealous anyway, but to each his own opinion.

B000C65Z1G|4.0|\\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a film based on John Le Carr&eacute;'s novel of corporate mischief. When the activist wife of Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), employee of the British High Commission in Kenya, is savagely murdered, the normally self-effacing and reticent Justin finds himself investigating an unholy liaison between a drug manufacturer and Her Majesty's government. Justin's more radical wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) and Kenyan Dr. Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kound&eacute;) had been investigating a cover-up of a supposedly revolutionary TB drug being tested on poor Kenyan patients with a minimum of informed consent. Tessa submitted a report to Justin's boss at the British High Commission Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston). But where is the report and what did it say? Why and by whom was Tessa killed?<br /><br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\" tells two stories: One is a thriller about a harrowing race to uncover what Tessa knew and find out who killed her. The other is the love story of Justin and Tessa Quayle. I found the love story more compelling than the political thriller. The thriller has some moments of real tension and menace, but I think it's undermined by an improbable ending and a premise that isn't very strong. The conduct of the pharmaceutical company in regards to the drug study is really not substantially different from how drug companies act in the U.S. or anywhere else. It's just more dramatic. It's unethical, but not illegal. And I'm not sure their motivation is credible, since the drug company has to discontinue its study and kill the drug anyway for reasons unrelated to Tessa Quayle's investigation.<br /><br />The love story, however, is effective. Justin Quayle's quest to learn about Tessa is as much the mission of a grieving husband to understand the wife who he didn't fully know as it is to find her killers. When Tessa suggested that they marry, Justin pointed out they hardly knew one another. Tessa's reply was, \\"You can learn me.\\" Left with still more to learn after her death, that's what he does in this film. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz have a nice chemistry as two people of opposite personalities who nevertheless share the same values. Tessa's a loose cannon when she latches onto a cause and blunt to the point of recklessness. Justin is a gentleman, a quiet, self-effacing man who likes to toil in his garden. And yet I was convinced that these 2 people adored one another, even though their story is told entirely in flashback.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal/MCA 2006): Bonus features include 4 deleted scenes (10 min), an extended scene, and 3 featurettes. \\"Extended Scene: Haruma -Play in Kibera\\" (9 ½ min) is the entire play that we see part of when Tessa is in Kibera, about some young men with HIV. \\"Embracing Africa: Filming in Kenya\\" (9 min) is about filming in Kenya, particularly Kibera, and includes interviews with director Fernando Meirelles, producer Simon Channing Williams, Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, and some of the Kenyan crew. \\"John Le Carr&eacute;: From Page to the Screen\\" (7 ½ min) includes interviews with Le Carr&eacute; and others involved with the film.

0783117523|4.0|Before seeing \\"Gia\\" I read Stephen Fried's account of Gia, \\"Thing Of Beauty\\".  In terms of factual representation, I have to say that Mr. Freid's tome won, hands down.  Fair enough, anything on the big or small screen simply won't fully translate or capture all the facts, subtleties and inferences that the written word does.  In other words, film adaptations rarely live up to the book.  Yet I gave \\"Gia\\" four stars.  Why, you may ask.  Simply because I think that if there were any actor at the time who could capture or parallel the turmoil Gia experienced, I would have to agree Angelina Jolie was tailor made for the role.  Before Angelina morphed into a UN ambassador and met Brad Pitt, she admittedly had issues, big style.  Disastrous relationships, estranged from a parent, being institutionalised at one stage - and lest we forget, she had a fixation with knives and self injury.  So who best to parallel the role of Gia?  No one could have come close to carrying that role off, and the fact Angelina bore more than a cursory resemblance to Gia further justified her getting the part.  For the vast majority of us who never met Gia, or weren't there in the 70's to witness firsthand how absolutely photogenic and mesmeric she was, I think Angelina's portrayal is the closest we will ever get to glimpsing the psyche of the (albeit tortured) Miss Carangi.  Which again, is why I give the film 4 stars.    However, what annoyed me about the biopic was the composite sketches of the people who were integral to her life.  Where was Rob Fay?  Or Rochelle? Sandy Linter?  Or any of her real life party pals, i.e. Janice Dickinson?  Were there legal restrictions which prevented the \\"real\\" players here being mentioned?  Also, the sex scenes.  Now I'm hardly the most prudish of people when it comes to sex, but the way the sex scenes between Gia and \\"Linda\\" were portrayed, in my opinion, they appeared to pander to the heterosexual male fantasy of watching two women, the way the camera pannedin on it made me feel distinctly uneasy, as if it were voyeuristic (as opposed to Gia's sexuality being another facet in her being, despite it being such an unresolved issue for her).  Another thing I will give the film credit for is the portrayal of how AIDS completely ravaged Gia and how the medical community in the mid 1980's were clearly unable to deal with the prospect of a woman(or much less anyone, come to think of it) having this disease.    As this biopic really did capture the nearest thing to Gia's spirit, and for Angelina fans who somehow haven't yet acquainted themselves with this film, I would by all means say \\"buy this DVD now\\" but ONLY if you promise to purchase Stephen Freid's book \\"Thing Of Beauty\\" first in order to get the broadest perspective of Gia that you possibly can.
0312995423|1.0|Dan Brown needs to stick to more subjective things like religion and vague history, because he really really sucks at writing about technology. <br /> <br />If you know even just a tiny bit about how computers work, you will be laughing at every other page.  The NSA's super code breaking computer in this book was apparently designed by an eight year old.  Here are some examples of the cliches and idiocy in this book: <br /> <br />*The super computer is housed in an eight story silo, complete with precarious metal catwalks, steam vents, trap doors, no surge protectors.  It also lacks a dedicated power source, so if an emergency occurs, the power in the building will be solely routed to the computer thereby cutting off power to the lights, phones, and electronic doors in the building. <br /> <br />*The super computer supposedly cost 3.6 billion dollars.  It also contained 300 million processors.  Even if the computer consisted solely of processors and nothing else, that means they only spent 12 dollars on each CPU. For comparison to those who don't know about computers: a high end processor generally costs about 200-300 dollars.  Of course, a real computer requires more than just processors, and building custom hardware is many times more expensive than mass produced hardware from the store.  This super computer in question would probably have cost in the neighborhood of tens of trillions of dollars. <br /> <br />*Apparently Dan Brown is under the impression that computers explode in massive balls of flame.  They don't. <br /> <br />*The deputy director of the NSA is not going to be foolish enough to choose the name of the woman he loves as his password.   <br /> <br />*Spending 3.6 billion dollars on a computer that can brute-force its way through a password is a waste of money (brute-force hacking is trying every possible password combination one at a time at very high speeds).  For each character you add to the password, the time it takes to break the code increases exponentially.  Say it takes ten minutes to crack a password 8 characters long.  Adding another character means you have to spend ten minutes for the first 8 characters times the number of characters possible for the 9th one (generally 36 characters: 26 letters and 10 numbers), so your computer that needs ten minutes for an 8 digit code needs 360 minutes (6 hours) for a 9 digit code, 9 days for a 10 digit code, 324 days for an 11 digit code and so on.  Adding extra digits to a code will always be faster than building new computers that can crack those codes. <br /> <br />*Encrypting a new encryption algorythym with itself and destroying the unencrypted original is stupid.  The only thing that can decrypt it is itself, but since it's encrypted it can't work. <br /> <br />I could go on, but the point is that Dan Brown clearly nows absolutely nothing about computer technology.  He's just taken a lot of technobabble and thrown it together with no research whatsoever.  Skip this book and find something less insulting to your intelligence.
B00005JN4H|3.0|TAXI is one silly little movie, but has enough laughs and some really innovative chase scenes, to be passing entertainment.  Queen Latifah struts her stuff gloriously as novice cabbie Belle Williams who dreams one day of being a NASCAR driver.  Jimmy Fallon is fun as Detective Washburn, a bumbling accident prone cop who couldn't drive a vehicle if his life depended on it.  When Washburn loses his driver's license and is demonted to a beat cop, he shanghais Belle's cab to stop a robbery in progress.  The robbers are four beautiful chicks who are pretty darned good at what they do and the rest of the movie finds Belle and Washburn trying to bring the girlies down.<br /><br />It's all preposterous and loopy as heck, but Latifah and Fallon have a good rapport; Ann-Marget is fun as Fallon's floozy mother, obviously having a great time in a non-traditional role.  Only Jennifer Esposito as Marta, Fallon's boss and ex-girlfriend seems miscast; it's hard to picture this buxom beauty as a cop, let alone a lieutenant.<br /><br />But TAXI is fun viewing and you could do lots worse.
B00006LIRI|3.0|There is just so much going on in the world of music today. While there are so many acts that seem to be more like the feeling that they are just manufactured, and definitely not really showcasing a distinctive feeling of good. That is very unfortunate today. Nevertheless, that can be said to greatest hits records too. For U2, their Best Of 1980-1990 was a true definitive reflection of U2's legacy. Yet, the 1990's have also brought U2 to a equal worldwide captive feeling with their music and their videos. The big question is can this hits decade package be just as good as before.<br /><br />U2's Best Of 1990-2000 is a compilation that showcases some highs and lows of U2's legacy throughout the 1990's. The album contains a lot of great tracks that have defined the men from Ireland well. The album does feature a lot of great hits like the definitive One, Mysterious Ways, Even Better Than The Real Thing, Stay, the Batman Forever track Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me, and the Grammy-winning song & Record Of The Year for 2001, Beautiful Day. While there are just so many great tracks and highlights here, there also are a few disadvantages to this compilation. The album does overshadow some great U2 tracks like the Grammy-winning Walk On, Elevation, Lemon from Zooroopa and If God Will Send His Angels from the Nicholas Cage film City Of Angels. Not only that, the album features remixed editions of tracks like Discotechque from Pop instead of the original edition.<br /><br />All in all, I was expecting a little more from U2 on The Best Of 1990-2000. It still happens to be a fairly conjured record, but I was just expecting a little bit more to come out of it. Hopefully, when U2 puts out their next hits package, there won't be anything overshadowed out of the blue. Nevertheless, it still isn't a bad record for die hard U2 fans.<br /><br />Album Cover: C+<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: C+
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Another amazing Rush live performance.  With accoustic songs added and a crowd that's really into the music, I can say that this is my favorite live cd/dvd from this band.  Geddy sings, plays bass, 6-string guitar on 'Resist', keyboards, and does his laundry during the show.   Neil is Neil.  He plays the drums better than most mortals can dream of on this or any other planet and has added some new stuff to his solo.  Alex seems to be enjoying himself as much as ever and is the music supervisor for this live endeavor (see credits).  Maybe he had some spare time in between shows.  An amazing performance from a band that continues to stand the test of time.        I thought the sound quality was good, visuals were great,   the band performed with their usual brilliance, and that it  was worth buying.  Just my opinion...
B000001FS3|5.0|The Joshua Tree is clearly one of the greatest albums in rock history.  It has many great songs on it - several more than just the radio singles.<br /><br />There are the songs that everyone knows - 'Where The Streets Have No Name', 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For', and 'With Or Without You'.  These three alone make the album well worth buying.  In addition to these, there are several other songs that are very good.<br /><br />This is such a good album that it belongs in the collection of anyone who enjoys rock music.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I am starting to like this album quite a lot, and I rate it 4 stars for good entertainment. What is good is that on this, her 15th album, Madonna has gone for a full-on dance/electronic production and made a disco album that feels like a cohesive dancefloor record, as it should given its title! The most fun track is the bouncy dance/pop of Jump , which would make an excellent choice as the 2nd or maybe 3rd single off Confessions. The popular single Hung Up has topped charts and filled dancefloors all around the globe over 2005-06, and it's also pretty good. The album version of Hung Up is more exciting than the single edit, as it segues into track 2 the impressive techno of Get Together. The other really good track is Forbidden Love. Interestingly, this tune is not the same song as Track 7 on Madonna's 1994 CD Bedtime Stories (which is also called Forbidden Love and was a smooth ballad produced by Babyface). Go figure! I also like How High , a good song where Madonna questions her achievements and looks forward to posterity - \\"will any of this matter\\" , and Future Lovers also looks ahead to forthcoming days , and has a strong rhythm.  <br /> <br />As I listen to this more, I am feeling that it is a strong album , and though I can't imagine I'll like it as much as Ray Of Light and Music ( her best two albums in my opinion ), I am happy with it and I will keep using Jump as a great song to dance along to when I'm exercising.  <br /> <br />For pop fans and dancefloor aficionados around the world, get a copy of Madonna's Confessions On A Dancefloor and enjoy !  <br />
B00005JO1P|5.0|The short reply to describing \\"Walk the Line\\" is that it is a solid, real-life story of redemption, of a man who finds out who he is and sings from his heart. The story of Johnny Cash's life is told well, sung well, and produced well.<br /><br />Johnny Cash's life is one spared of the consequences of his worst mistakes. When his first wife left him after realizing Johnny's character was in question, when drugs and affairs began to ruin him, he found June. When drugs and alcohol took him down, he found his soul and his way back up.<br /><br />\\"Walk the Line\\" covers the transformation of a child blamed for his brother's accidental death, the drive to succeed as a gospel singer, and the desire to be loved without restrictions.<br /><br />I like Johnny Cash. Always have. His voice sounded off-the-cuff, like someone called him on stage unexpectedly. It is rough, resonant with tobacco and alcohol strained vocal cords, with enough twang to keep it country and enough power to keep it rock. All of these come through adequately in Joaquin Phoenix's attempts, but he's no Johnny Cash. That's a tough act to follow, and I give Phoenix credit for as much as he pulls off musically.<br /><br />Beyond my thoughts of Phoenix's mediocre singing, I give him applause for acting. Not only does he have Cash's signature talking from the side of his mouth, but he has the attitude, the stare, the characteristics that remind me of the Johnny Cash seen on TV throughout the years.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon delivers a persona of June Carter that is extraordinarily sweet. It has to believe she went through so many marriages before finally settling on Johnny. She sings well, and to the ear who has not heard the original, she's enjoyable. The comparison between the two is not fair: one is a musical icon, and the other is only portraying the icon.<br /><br />As storytelling goes, the movie ends in the late 1960s. Johnny and June's life is summed up with that they lived happily ever after. It misses the complete transition, where Johnny's broken life appears to have been a dream, where he goes on to sing more great songs, and even sings for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association crusades.<br /><br />To compare the three recent biopics I have seen, this is the best. While \\"Ray\\" is powerful, Ray Charles' own life only evolves. It never transforms. He is only a great singer and a good man at the end. Johnny becomes a great man after not being much of one.<br /><br />In \\"Beyond the Sea,\\" it lacks by comparison because, partly, Bobby Darin's life was shorter and less dramatic, and also, Cash's catalog of hits is volumes larger.<br /><br />By the end of \\"Beyond the Sea,\\" I was tired of a few songs. In \\"Walk the Line,\\" I kept thinking, \\"Where's 'Don't Take Your Guns To Town,' 'Guess Things Happen That Way,' and 'Sunday Morning Coming Down'? What about 'A Boy Named Sue'?\\" I wanted more music. Those are fantastic, but the movie's director could not use them all.<br /><br />Shaky parts of the movie are found in how it seems Johnny's spiral downward always held to a glimmer that he was a good man making bad choices. However true that is, it came off whitewashing some of the uglier sides of his hard times, and missed an opportunity to show why his songs have credibility.<br /><br />See it in the theater to enjoy their sound system while you still can.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Walk the Line.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.comlife appears to have been a dream, where he goes on to sing more great songs, and even sings for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association crusades.

B000060MWU|1.0|I was dreaming to see this movie for a long time, since 1997. And finally I bought it in Europe for 10 Euro. So what did I find there? Nothing, there is lack of everything. Anyone can shoot something like this, adding clowns in movie does not make it masterpiece. It is not that I do not like David Lynch's movies but here Mr. Lynch and some other people simply wanted to make money. One of the worsest movies ever seen.
0671027344|1.0|One would be hard pressed to fault MTV for publishing this, as such a move was a stroke of genius, without a doubt.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the book itself.  Trying to push back the modern onslaught of empty, sentimentalist pap disguised as hardy intellectualism would be like trying to clobber some sense into a fundamentalist intent on blaming natural disasters on widespread homosexuality, so I won't try.  Suffice to say, the cornerstone of this book is more of the innocence lost with age stuff, so if you're into that as a (the only) central theme, by all means, proceed.  If you want some content and some real insight as opposed to a collage of bloated daytime TV \\"observations\\", check out David Foster Wallace, Don Delillo, or Mark Danielewski instead.  If you're a teenager unable to relate to anything beyond your incredibly narrow range of cultural cliches, at least pick up Like the Red Panda and ignore this.  Save a tree.
B000001DTM|5.0|First and foremost, yes I know its a bold statement, but I dare anyone to to find a better album that has stood the test of time.  Achtung Baby sounds as fresh today as it was when it was released in late 1991.  Few have pointed out this fact: it was a huge and highly commercial success in the mainstream as it was on the college/indie radio stations, I know this fact cause I worked for the local college station between 1992-1995 and we got alot of request and faxes for this album.  If you havnt got this album, then you are really missing out on near perfect music.  On a personal note, this album really changed my life, especially in a sexaul way, sex and love(fidelity) are the prime topics on this album.  There are so many standout tracks on this album eg;\\"Even better than the real thing\\", \\"One\\",\\"Mysterious Ways\\", but you should check out \\"Who's gonna ride your wild horses?\\" and the beautiful \\"Ultraviolet(Light My Way)\\".  This is a must have for any music lover and especially a U2 fan.  Not only did it sound great when played, but when the band took it on tour(ZOO TV), it really made me appreciate this album more, but most importantly, solidified U2 as one of the greatest of all time.
B00005JN4H|5.0|Taxi (starring Queen Latifah(Taxi Driver) and Jimmy Fallon(Slapstick Cop)) is \\"chock full of the nutty antics\\" of Fallon) and the comedic timing of them both ,with much good acting  from their many  \\"second bananas\\" inclusive of New York's Finest(cops)and the villains being a quartet of 4 Portuguese women with the human interest chapters being of  Fallon's mom (due to being a litty tipsy good at making liquers a la Margueritas) and Queen Latifah's boyfriend who melts down Fallon's police badge to a \\"money clip\\"..The stunts are just right;car chases made less tedious with discussions as to where 'the pursued' were at different moments in time; and ends with the \\"Shero(heroine)\\"(Queen Latifah) changing careers(for the 3rd time: bike messenger, cabi/hack),then as a racecar NASDAQ driver sponsored by Banks of New York).
B00005JLT5|5.0|Having seen many war films, this film \\"The Pianist\\" has been the best portraid I have seen, especially as it is a personal account of one person's struggle through the terrible time in the Warshaw Ghetto being a sole survivor.   <br />I myself have lived in Germany at the time and had been arrested by the Gestapo. I know only too well the horrific treatment Jews and people, who were against Nazism, have received. The courage of the Pianist was something extraordenary.  I recommend the film to be seen by every one.  It gives a true picture of the whole era.
B000002UAX|5.0|Great album. Not the Beatles' best album--it's too messy--but perhaps my favorite, and it's the one I've listened to the most. What more can be said about this massive album? John's music is the best her ever did. Cutting this album down to 15 or 17 songs would have made artistic sense. But then we would be getting the Cliff's Notes of a great album rather than the one they made. One problem with the album is the sequencing. Everyone probably has their own ideal ordering of the tracks, which CDs make possible. I once had a cassette version of the White Album, and I think that sequencing was better on that than on the original. Here goes:<br /><br />1. Back in the USSR<br />2. Dear Prudence<br />3. Glass Onion<br />4. Ob-La-Di-Ob-La-Da<br />5. Wild Honey Pie<br />6. The Continuing Stiory of Bungalow Bill<br />7. While My Guitar Gently Weeps<br />8. Blackbird (rather than Happiness, and a nice way to end side 1)<br /><br />Side Two<br />9. Happiness is a Warm Gun (the best song on this album?)<br />10. Martha My Dear<br />11. I'm So Tired<br />12. Piggies (rather than Blackbird, John's backward mumbling on I'm So Tried blends nicely into the Piggies harpsichord intro)<br />13. Rocky Raccoon (so, we get two goofy songs in a row)<br />14. Don't Pass Me By (Ringo's best moment, and he wrote it, too)<br />15. Why don't we do it in the road?<br />16. I Will<br />17. Julia<br /><br />Side Three<br />18. Birthday<br />19. Yer Blues<br />20. Mother Nature's Son<br />21. Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My  Monkey<br />22. Helter Skelter (rather than Sexy Sadie)<br />23. Long, Long, Long<br />24. Revolution 1<br /><br />Side Four<br />25. Sexy Sadie (rather than Honey Pie)<br />26. Honey Pie<br />27. Savoy Truffle<br />28. Cry Baby Cry<br />29. Revolution 9<br />30. Goodnight<br /><br />Pretty much the same, but a little change can make all the difference.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away swept me away.  I first viewed the version in Japanese with English subtitles.  I was hooked.  The art, the animation, and Miyazaki's imagination are just magnificent.  I must confess, every time I watch his work, I think about the thousands of hours of drawing needed to create such a full length film.  I understand that he drew most of his work himself, resisting (until recently) digital animation.<br /><br />So intrigued, I purchased the dubbed in English version.  When I could hear the conversation, the story then really came to life.  I realize now that in watching the version with subtitles, I had missed many visual nuances and subtleties that also move the story along.<br /><br />The story is very sweet. There are lessons for children and adults of all ages.  Chihiro/Sen is respectful of tradition, nature, and the elderly.  Her respect is acknowledged by those with whom she comes in contact.  She handles her trials head on and with much courage.  She is a roll model for young girls who must learn to assert themselves without bitterness or cynicism.<br /><br />Hey... its a great story and you will enjoy each of the characters... enjoy!

After attempting to see him, Peris makes Tally promise not to do anything stupid. <br /> <br />But Tally soon meets Shay, who doesn't want to be pretty. Before both of Tally and Shay's birthday (which is on the same day), Shay runs away, but not before telling Tally where.  <br /> <br />Shay is fleeing to a mysterious place called 'The Smoke', where the people of Uglyville who don't want to be pretty go. She leaves Tally directions that only can be comprehended by her, just in case Tally changes her mind and wants to join the Smoke. <br /> <br />But Special Cicumstances soon finds out about Shay. They confront Tally, then tell her that the only way they will allow Tally to become pretty is if she tries her hardest to find her friend. <br /> <br />But Tally knows Shay doesn't want to be found. But she has to choose soon. Tally has two promises to keep. Her promise to Shay, saying she wouldn't tell. But there's also her promise to Peris, saying she wouldn't be doing anything stupid, and that she would turn pretty. Which is more important? Being pretty or keeping a best friend?  <br /> <br />And maybe something else happens when you turn pretty... something that's not only skin deep. <br /> <br />A great read for ages 12 and up, and recommendedto anyone who's looking for a book that will keep them hooked, all while being well written.

B00003CX5P|4.0|I really llike Star Wars, and this movie was no exception, but why did there have to be so much Jar Jar?! Yeah, yeah, he was sort of revalant to the plot, but as one of my friends said, \\"Less Jar Jar, more Maul!!!\\" he has a point. There aren't a whole lot of lightsaber fights with the jedi in this episode. The pod racing and whatever duels there were in the movie were exciting, but it was a bit more talky than episodes II- VI. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent movie and has a place on your shelf, but episodes IV, V, and VI should be there too. (So should Episodes II and III they're really good)
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I've been a Madonna fan for the past 23 years and by far this CD is her best work.  It's her best work I believe because the writing and musical combination is infectious .  I have two copies of the CD and listen to it constantly.  She never disappoints expect for American Life her last CD.  Buy Confessions on a Dance Floor and you won't be sorry! Don't spend the extra money for the Special Edition it only has one extra song!
B000062YAY|5.0|As I've said before, no words can describe how much I love Slayer. They are one of my all time favorite metal bands, and I just can't praise them enough. They kick tons of ass in the recording studios, but when they perform live, they are more awesome and just flat-out merciless, and this album proves it. Recorded during their tours between the years 1990 and 1991, \\"Decade of Aggression: Live\\" has Slayer performing some of their all time classic songs from their earlier albums being \\"Show No Mercy\\", \\"Hell Awaits\\", \\"Reign In Blood\\", \\"South Of Heaven\\", and \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\"(their other stuff kicks ass as well). Singer/bassist Tom Araya's vocals are more rougher and aggressive live. Dave Lombardo's double bass drumming is more faster, crazier, and more in your face on here. Guitar duo Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are just on fire throughout here. These guys just rip through the speakers with their lightning fast dualing riffs and awesome ear piercing solos, just incredible man. Please read on for my song ratings.<br /><br />themetalbeast's song ratings:<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />1. Hell Awaits - 5/5<br /><br />2. The Anti-Christ - 5/5<br /><br />3.

0393317552|4.0|I learned so much about history reading this book, but it is a really dry read.  I ended up taking a 2 month break half way through this book before finishing it.
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|Sia.  Just about the most AMAZING (female) songwriter in the history of history.  I first heard 'Breathe Me' on the radio and kept waiting for it to crop up again, then finally bought the CD after realising she was one of those... popular but not mainstream artists. <br /> <br />Sure, I've only given the other songs a once-over now and then, but that's because I'm paying so much attention to 'Breathe Me' and it's kind of crowding the others out on my list of important stuff. <br /> <br />The album was overall quite an easy listen.  Even though I can't quite distinguish the lyrics in some of them and that takes off a few points, I can still tell them apart from each other--and that's good.  None of them are copies of 'Breathe Me', and while some people argue that this makes them not as good, I'm sure I won't be clawing at my ears if one of Sia's other songs comes on the radio.  :D
B0009R1T7M|3.0|lets face it, most people write online reviews because they LOVE or HATE something. i'll try to keep my comments somewhere in the middle, which is about how i rate this album.  <br /> <br />to be honest, the first several times i tried to listen to 'illinoise,\\" i just couldn't get through it. clocking in at over 75 minutes, it was just too much. take away 20 or 25 minutes of songs that go on too long and pointless instrumentals, and you'd have a much better concise musical statement. <br /> <br />that is really my main criticism of this cd: the rule of \\"keep it simple, stupid\\" is constantly broken. the first half of the cd is especially good, but then the repetition kicks in, and its hard to get through the second half. it doesn't help things that stevens has a soft, breathy and limited vocal style. some of the melodies are a little 'sing-songy.' i know this is singer-songwriter territory, but i think more electric rock guitar would help. get tough. drink a shot of jack daniels, scream for 15 minutes, then record a song with that voice.  <br /> <br />but there's no denying that sufjan stevens is talented. (the fact that he is a christian is of no consequence. he's NOT preaching  or trying to convert anyone.) his lyrics are good, and he has at least tried to be original, something all too rare in today's corporate music scene. with the right producer, and a little restraint, i think stevens will live up to the hype.
B00003CX9W|3.0|Fantasia is a brilliant film...if it's all together as it had been during its initial VHS release.  But this \\"updated\\" and more \\"politically correct\\" version is lacking in many ways, especially during the Pastorale series; not only did the editing out of black centaurs just make the film look grainy in spots (completely unnecessary in my opinion), they also trimmed out spots of the actual movie so the original music doesn't match up with the original animation, such as the girl getting her hair modeled with doves (the cupids try once before, but that is not seen--there are also more scenes of the female centaurs getting \\"dressed up\\" that are missing here).  To be more politically correct, Disney animators have truly murdered this overall wonderful film (including the re-voice dubbing and re-placing of the narrator--with today's technology, they ought to be able to just use the VHS version and transfer that directly to DVD, even if it's not in pristine digital clarity, as they say.  Do you see people going back and re-editing To Kill a Mockingbird because it said the n-word in it multiple times?  No.  So Disney, if you're listening, PLEASE restore this movie to its original quality for all our sakes.  To edit it out is murder.
B00005JOFO|3.0|As with most movies that are hyped to the stratosphere, this one does NOT, CANNOT live up to all the hoop-la.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice film with a moving story and decent acting.  But once you get past the non-mainstream aspects of the story, this is not a remarkable film.  Heath Ledger did quite well with the role of Ennis, FOR Heath Ledger.  In other words, it was definitely one of his better outings, but it was otherwise not what I would characterize as a \\"remarkable\\" performance.<br /><br />I'm a Jake Gyllenhaal fan, but neither he nor Anne Hathaway ever looked completely comfortable in the skins of their respective characters (Anne particularly), especially as the film progresses and Ang Lee turns them into bizarre caricatures of 1970s Texans.<br /><br />Now, Michelle Williams' performance?  Terrific.  She actually was \\"remarkable\\".<br /><br />Other aspects of the film missed as well.  Shots that might look good for the publicity stills or on the trailer, look totally contrived and unnatural in the film.  And they had all that beautiful mountain scenery to take advantage of, but they missed there too.  I don't know what they did, but shots that could have been breathtaking seemed somewhat flat and uninspired.<br /><br />Hype, hype, hype.  The only reason this little film is doing as well as it is at the box office is curiosity.  Between the subject matter and all the noise, folks that otherwise would be unlikely to ever drop $10 at the theater for a little movie with no space battles or giant apes are succumbing to curiosity now rather than waiting for cable or DVD.  Hype, hype, hype.<br /><br />Again, it is a nice, thoughtful film and worth a look, but it is miles away from deserving a Best Picture nod, especially given the superior caliber of its fellow nominees.
0156907399|5.0|To the Lighthouse, by Virginia Woolf, is about the internal states of its characters: their sensations, emotions, thoughts, and motivations.  Events occur in the outside world, but the real action in the book takes place in interior worlds.  Woolf mostly focuses on two women: Mrs. Ramsay, who finds happiness, of a sort, in marriage and Lily Briscoe, who finds happiness, of a sort, alone. <br /> <br />The action in the first part of the book, \\"The Window,\\" takes place during part of a day and an evening as the Ramsay family and some of their friends and acquaintances gather for a dinner.   <br /> <br />In the second part of the book, \\"Time Passes,\\" the last light is turned out, ten years pass, and, parenthetically, the reader learns of some major developments: Mrs. Ramsay and two of her children die and a family friend becomes famous.  In her extended rumination on time, Woolf compares time to a wheel that thoughtlessly crushes us.  \\"Time Passes\\" features some of the most beautiful writing in the book:  <br /> <br />\\"So with the lamps all put out, the moon sunk, and a thin rain drumming on the roof a downpouring of immense darkness began.  Nothing, it seemed, could survive the flood, the profusion of darkness which, creeping in at keyholes and crevices, stole round window blinds, came into bedrooms, swallowed up here a jug and basin, there a bowl of red and yellow dahlias, there the sharp edges and firm bulk of a chest of drawers. ...  But what after all is one night?  A short space, especially when the darkness dims so soon, and so soon a bird sings, a cock crows, or a faint green quickens, like a turning leaf, in the hollow of a wave.  Night, however, succeeds to night.  The winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally, evenly, with indefatigable fingers.\\" <br /> <br />In the last part of the book, \\"The Lighthouse,\\" a few of the characters introduced in \\"The Window\\" gather again.  Several of them undertake an expedition they planned, but did not take, ten years earlier: sailing to a lighthouse far offshore.  Meanwhile, Lily Briscoe paints in the garden, amateurishly.  Again, the real action takes place inside the characters, and this interior action has less to do with events in the outside world than with memories and associations from past events.
B0002858YS|5.0|Out of left field comes the Vegas gang the Killers, with an awesome debut, Hot Fuss, which channels many 80's influences while blending in a little emo sexual angst.  The opening of \\"Jenny was a friend of Mine\\" is evocative of vintage Duran Duran, while \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is impossible to listen to without thinking of Ultravox. \\"Smile like you Mean It\\" broods like the Cure with a snarl, and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is pure pop perfection. At the midway point of the album is \\"All These Thing that I've Done\\" a sprawling gospel-rock anthem that will get a rise out of you. Then a thick -synth drenched \\"Andy, Youre a Star\\" brings out some Ziggy Stardust action. \\"Change your Mind\\" is a fast-paced ditty with some more Cure jangle, and \\"Believe me Natalie\\" almost defies description with its bossanova beat and horn section. The openiong of \\"Midnight Show\\" is almost identical to \\"I Will Follow\\" by U2, and the album closes with a song of pure uplift \\"Everything will Be Alright\\" (NOT a cover of the Naughty by Nature tune). Get this quick!
0316666343|4.0|I don't expect books to be perfect, I enjoy what's there to enjoy and have a heavy appreciation for the creative effort involved with 1) imagining the story and 2) putting it to paper.   <br /> <br />Ms. Sebold took a story which is all too easy to imagine, which is actually, sadly, somewhat commonplace....and told it in a completely inventive manner.  Her writing is thoughtful and full of ideas and beautifully expressed. <br /> <br />I highly recommend the book.  But be prepared to shed a tear or two.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's Parachutes was a stunning, yet meandering debut album. They were now faced with the task that had daunted so many bands before them, including their mentors U2---How to make our atmospheric, lush sounds coalesce into pop songs?<br /><br />This album does it.  From the opening piano bang of \\"Politik\\", Chris Martin and co. try to grow their own Joshua Tree, and very nearly succeed. Nearly every song on this album has an inescapable melody, and the origins of Coldplay's Bono-Edge obsession sprout here, especially on \\"God Put a Smile\\" and \\"Clocks\\".  There are two missteps here, and both sound similar.  One is \\"Daylight\\" and the other is \\"A Whisper\\"  which both seem to repeat the same melody over and over again.  But every other song on this album is a gem.  My personal favorite is the title track and \\"The Scientist\\" both evoking Lennon-Mccartney.  Get this before X and Y.  This one is a little better.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I went to this film alone (no one to heckle me for getting sucked into the romance) and in the mood for escapism, at 7PM.  I went back and saw the 10PM show the same day.  Ultimately I saw it four times in the theater. <br /> <br />Either you like this genre, or you don't; you love Jane Austen, or you don't.  I do.  And I don't hold the good people who put her stories up on the big screen to any particular standard.  I really like the Greer Garson version, I like the BBC series.  This movie is something else.  It's not quite a reinterpretation, but it does add another dimension to the story.  That isn't a problem for me -- it's a different medium; I didn't go to the movie to have someone read the book for me.  The characters in this movie do not all have perfect hair, are not perfectly beautiful, look like they occasionally get B.O.  But you like them.  Alot. <br /> <br />The film resonated with me for days and days; I bought the soundtrack, I re-read the book again (not for the first time). <br /> <br />Don't be put off by Matthew McFaydden's sterness in the beginning; it's deliberate and by the end of the film I believe that you will agree he was absolutely perfect in the role.  It must be hard play that character for people who in large part already know how the story turns out.  But he convinced me to hate him like Elizabeth does at the beginning, and to love him like she did at the end.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day took the concept of a jaded rock opera in the Bush USA and knocked it out of the park.  Every melody on this album sounds like you've heard it before and at the same time it sounds fresh.  \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" may be the greatest hard rock song in the last 20 years, evoking the spirit of Queen and the anger of the Clash all at once. The title track and \\"St. Jimmy\\" are familiar Green Day territory, while \\"She's a Rebel\\" and \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" are pop masterpieces.  This is an addicitve drug that you won't soon get out of your head.
0553801503|5.0|I don't even LIKE this genre, people!  But I'm addicted to this series.  I don't know if it's the power politics, the shameless slaughter of favorite characters, the fact that the good guys hardly ever come out ahead.  But this was book four, and I couldn't put any of the preceding three down, either. <br /> <br />I'm not going to quibble with Mr. Martin about whether the decision to split up the story the way he did was appropriate or not.  I haven't seen book 5, so who am I to judge.  He's done a great job so far, so I trust him. <br /> <br />If you read the first three books and enjoyed them, then dive in and enjoy this one, it won't disappoint you, and you probably will be suprised by some of the developments. <br /> <br />If you haven't read the first three books, it makes absolutely no sense to start with this one -- get Game of Thrones and start at the beginning.  Why skip over the first three when they are great stories?
0140288503|5.0|A detailed and gripping read of the 1993 Mogadishu catastrophy, though heavily censored. Bowden apparently decided to omit accounts of U.S. forces resorting to using Somalis as human shields, and the excessive civilian toll that resorted from the wild street battles in favor of a tale more palatable to American patriotic sensibilities. Nevertheless, Bowden's accounts of ground combat are intense and vivid, and one comes away with great admiration for the men on the ground who did their utmost to help each other make it out alive, and the spectacular idiocy of the entire chain of command that conceived and executed and ordered this catastrophe, from the White House down to the commander at the scene. The dedication and commitment of the troops on the ground is heart-breaking. If only the same could be said of our failing leadership, then, and now.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|were trying to look crazy to get on camera?  crazy.
B000000OA6|5.0|Another masterpiece from one of the best and most original rock bands ever. One cannot help but listen to this album with the knowledge that Freddie Mercury was aware he was facing the end of his days. How he was able to deliver musically with such power,humor,and hope is amazing. Yes, understandably there is a darkness to this album, but there is still a message of strength and endurance conveyed. (And there are some blistering rockers here as well : \\"Headlong\\" and \\"The Hitman\\" in particular.) Even the light-hearted \\"Delilah\\" is more enjoyable given the fact that Mercury truly adored his feline friend and undoubtably drew a great deal of comfort from her companionship. As usual, Brian May's masterful guitar work drives the album to brilliant peaks. Classic Queen and a must-have for any rock fan !
0812550706|3.0|Other reviewers have remarked that the lack of description hurts the novel's quality, but they do not give Orson Scott Card enough credit: He offers the young reader ideas and action sequences in a loosely detailed, futuristic environment and asks you and your mind to fill in the details.  This is important for young adult and children's literature, and Card should be commended. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the motivations of the characters in the Wiggin family are categorical and un-dramatic.  Peter is the smart, evil one, Valentine is the smart, kind one, and Ender is the smart and balanced one.  This symmetry is central to the characters' actions and is quite forced, especially Valentine's weakness (because she's a girl?) in the face of people whom she knows (because she's smart) are trying to deceive her. <br /> <br />Ender plays the part of the tool in this novel.  He is even informed by another character that human beings are, in fact, tools when humanity \\"needs them.\\"  Instead of a smart child being used to cure a disease, advance art and philosophy, or lead the world by example, the child is recruited to engage in a pre-emptive war campaign.  The description of Ender's psychological turmoil is accurate, indeed; it's the description of a young mind being impressed upon and made less innocent by adults. <br /> <br />I do wonder if the novel at large argues for a nave and barbaric just war theory via hindsight as well as blind fear of the unknown Other (the Buggers). <br />
0143036556|4.0|This book contains a similar depth and scope of knowledge that made Guns,Germs, and Steel a classic. However, the book is very heavy on environmental factors vis-a-vis the multifaceted approach of Prof. Diamonds' other books. Overall it's an excellent compliment to GG&S and will get you thinking about the ramifications of our own choices in the modern political and business realm.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I was totally impress when I saw Napoleon Dynamite, mostly because of the fact that it is a movie you can sit down and watch with your family and not be embarassed.  No nudity, no foul language, nothing to have to explain to the kids - just good humor. <br /> <br />When I brought Napoleon Dynamite home, my husband wasn't too sure about seeing it, and in fact, didn't want to watch, but we both laughed all the way through the film. <br /> <br />Great story, great soundtrack, great actors.
B0000508U6|5.0|Say what you want about Coldplay...to some they're overrated, unoriginal, and Pink Floyd/U2/Radiohead wannabes, but to many they're simply a band who's one of the best British groups of our generation. This album can't get any better. It's probably the most subtle, simple, and touching Coldplay album. Even though Coldplay's sounds, style, and music hasn't really grown or changed much (hopefully in time they'll be less predictable and more experimental, they have so much potential), there's still so much to like in this album and their other albums. If you appreciate good music, you will like this album. Just listen to it for what it is.
B000001E7L|4.0|Dolores O'Riordan undoubtedly has a beautiful voice and the band write (and play) some gorgeous melodies for her to float it atop. But the band's strength on its debut EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING IT, SO WHY CAN'T WE? was also its biggest weakness: a wispy etherealness that overcame the album as a whole, smooshing it into 1 long daydream. There simply wasn't enough musical and emotional variety...all longing, no passion.<br /><br />On this one, the band haul out some numbers with tempo and unveil a broader emotional palette. The result is a more satisfying album than EEIDISWWW was.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />\\"Ode to my Family\\" is somewhat of a guilty pleasure. Its wonderful melody and alienation sentiment allow it to overcome my objections to its somewhat laughable lyrics. (\\"My father, my father/He liked me, oh, he liked me/Does anyone care?\\") \\"I Can't Be With You\\" is probably as close as the band gets to straight-ahead pop but it's a darn fine tune as O'Riordan pines after her long-gone lover (\\"I wanted to be the mother of your child/And now it's just farewell...\\") It bounces on a percussive acoustic guitar groove that soars into orbit when Noel Hogan's Nuggets-style fuzz guitar solo kicks in to close things out. \\"Zombie\\" addressed the wartorn condition of the band's native Ireland as O'Riordan took on the persona of the architects of battle, imagining how they must rationalize war to themselves. (\\"But you see, it's not me, it's not my family/In your head, in your head they are fighting...\\") It's all set to a crunchy guitar sound that would be the heaviest the band had put to disc at that point. \\"The Icicle Melts\\" finds O'Riordan lamenting the death of a young child and trying to offer hope to the grieving mother. (And she will hold him in her arms sometime/'Cause nine months is too long, too long, too long...\\") \\"Dreaming my Dreams\\" is poignant in its simplicity. (\\"If you want me I'll be here/I'll be dreaming my dreams with you..\\") Understated violin adds just the right touch to the song musically without veering into pathos. The title track closes things on a high note, a funeral organ the perfect accompaniment for the dead love affair dirge. It could just as well be titled \\"Requiem\\" as O'Riordan reverently recalls the love she lost.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />I'm not still not apt to call this one \\"great\\" as so many others are doing. But it does have enough standout tracks to say this one is worth owning since many of the best tunes did not make it onto the STARS best of compilation.<br /><br />3 1/2 starse right touch to the song musically without veering into pathos.

B00005JOFO|3.0|Are people viewing this film objectively?  Or are people either blindly affirming it as a masterpiece or condemning it as example of Hollywood's moral perversity?  My own take was somewhat different.  If people get past the fact that it stars movie stars Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal and focus on the actual characters, the inescapable truth is that this is a film about some exceedingly uninteresting and intensely bland characters who share a love over twenty years that is societally forbidden.  Now, if the two central characters were actually interesting--and remember, in a film it is the characters and not the stars that are at the heart of things--this could have led to an interesting film.  But the brute fact is that this is a film about two central characters and several secondary characters who are all intensely and spectacularly uninteresting.<br /><br />I think this central fact is getting lost by most who see the film.  Anyone doubting me should go back over the dialogue the two leads engage in.  Apart from a couple of memorable lines that reflect back over a couple of decades of love, where does either of the leads say anything funny or compelling or even remotely interesting?  Where is there anything that would help us understand why either was remotely interested in the other?  If you watch THE LADY EVE, it is impossible NOT to believe that Henry Fonda would have been enthralled by Barbara Stanwyck in the first fifteen minutes of the film.  But where is there any indication that either of the two leads would have thought the other as anything but an utterly uninteresting individual?<br /><br />And that is for me the central problem in this film:  we are presented merely with the fact of a love between two men, but never any reason for why either would have been interested in each other.  Nor are we as viewers given any reason to care about these two characters.  In fact, at film's end, I found myself even remotely caring for only two, Michelle Williams's Alma, who has to live with the knowledge that her husband has a passion for another male, and Ennis's daughter Alma Jr.  Apart from those two, I didn't manage to find a single character interesting.<br /><br />Despite the dramatic vacuity at the heart of the movie, this is one of the most visually beautiful movies I've ever seen.  Every movie I see that has been filmed in the Canadian Rockies increases my desire to go there someday.  The landscapes in this are as beautifal as in any movie I have ever seen, and the incredibly gifted Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto could very well win the Oscar for Best Achievement in Cinematography.  But apart from that Oscar Nomination, I have trouble understanding any of the other nominations the film received.  Even factoring in that it was a bad year for movies, the Best Picture nomination is baffling, and Jake Gyllenhaal's Best Supporting Actor nomination is a joke, since he is clearly a lead and not a supporting actor.  I will say, however, that while Heath Ledger's character is uninteresting, he acts the part magnificently.  You would swear that this young Australian is indeed a dirt poor cowboy.  But apart from his nomination and the one for Rodgigo Prieto, I can't understand the acclaim this film is receiving.<br /><br />My firm belief is that this is one of those film that in ten or twenty years people are going to have an exceedingly difficult time the praise it received at the time.  My only theory is that people are blinded by the innovation of the film revolving around a male-male romance into thinking that that is sufficient to guarantee its quality.  That the two characters are profoundly uninteresting doesn't seem to faze many people.  But if there were a different film with a very dull male and very dule female character, would people have accorded it the same degree of praise?  I very much doubt it.<br /><br />The film is made with enormous competence.  The score is good, the direction is strong, and while the characters are uninteresting, all of the performances are quite strong.  I have not read Annie Proulx's short story upon which the film is based, but I can even imagine it being a good story.  But not all short stories can translate to the big screen and this one was crippled by the fundamentally uninteresting characters.  It is, however, a truly beautiful movie to look at.  In fact, I think much of the praise the film is receiving is in fact the reflected glory of the landscapes.  Had the story taken place in a swamp, no such praise would have attached to the film.all of the performances are quite strong.  I have not read Annie Proulx's short story upon which the film is based, but I can even imagine it being a good story.  But not all short stories can translate to the big screen and this one was crippled by the fundamentally uninteresting characters.  It is, however, a truly beautiful movie to look at.  In fact, I think much of the praise the film is receiving is in fact the reflected glory of the landscapes.  Had the story taken place in a swamp, no such praise would have attached to the film.
B000002U82|5.0|This album is in one word \\"beautiful\\", \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\" makes the hairs on my back stand up when i listen to it.  <br />I truely apprieciate this album as a music lover. Ahead of their time in more ways than one, experimentation of electrical equipment before sampling was even born. I'm not that old i'm 18, and i can see how amazing this album is. Close your eyes when you play it and let the music take you for an amazing journey, cheesey yes, but it really does it, u have to buy it to see. A must for anyone who loves - and apprieciates amazing music of the highest quality.  <br /> <br />11/10 for me, and i dont even give most album's ten, it's that good.
B000301YY8|5.0|I first heard James' music long before his album was released in the States.  Thanks to the magic of online radio stations, I've been a fan since his UK debut.  This album is amazing - there isn't a bad song on it.   I am looking forward to his future work.
B00003CX9W|3.0|Loved original on VHS form.  This one sucks.  It's a beautiful film, a 5 star one in fact, but editing out black centaurs and having the dialogue, and commentator, completely redone and new?  C'MON.  Save it, resort to just copying/restoring the VHS version.  With today's technology it can be done.
B0006GAOBI|1.0|For months and months my friends and co-workers raved to me about the \\"originality\\" of Donnie Darko, so you can imagine how great my anticipation was as I settled in my Lazy-Boy with my popcorn and soda, preparing to view what my friends had assured me was a masterpiece. What a let-down. <br /> <br />The film starts off with promise as Donnie Darko wakes up in a forest with mild amnesia and bicycles home in a frenzy to discover that while he was asleep, a plane had crashed into his home. What's more, one of the plane's engines went straight through his bedroom, which would have killed Darko had he not been sleeping outside. Did Darko have some premonition of this event? It is never revealed. <br /> <br />Stupid scene after stupid scene follows, most of which are unconnected to the main plot, which I gather has something to do with time travel. In one scene Darko and his friends discuss whether smurfs have sex lives. In another Patrick Swayze's character (who plays one of those hyper motivational speakers) is arrested for possessing child porn. At some point in the film Darko begins having hallucinations of a man in a gray bunny suit who identifies himself as Frank. I found the scenes involving Frank to be weird and ridiculous and couldn't for the life of me discern how they were tied to the plot. Towards the film's end I began wondering if \\"Donnie Darko\\" was like Frank - a grotesque hallucination. Surely my friends and co-workers wouldn't lavish plaudits on such a pointless, weird and stupid movie. Maybe, I wondered, they made two Donnie Darko's and I rented the bad one? No such luck, alas. Two thumbs down, WAY down. <br /> <br />I'm Carl Rylander and until next time, the balcony is closed.

0385512058|2.0|There are some good tips in here and it is worth a quick review.  <br />However, the author comes across as shallow, name dropping ego maniac; I would rather eat alone than share a meal with him. My favorite part of the book comes up right after you have read enough to figure out just what a blow hard he is. Chapter 6, The Networking Jerk, describes how he used to be a self-obsessed bore until an executive coach straightened him out. He even gives her name, not recognizing that the obvious lack of success she had with him is not exactly a ringing endorsement for her work. <br />
B000002U82|5.0|I can't say enough about Dark Side Of The Moon.  I loved the first time I heard it as a kid.  If you are looking to get started collecting Pink Floyd albums this is the one to start with.  There have been few albums that have had the creative impact on rock music that this one has.  It is simply a masterpiece.  No and I mean NO CD collection should be without Dark Side Of The Moon.  Pink Floyd has to be one of the top 5 bands in the history of rock n' roll.
0321344758|5.0|Even if you have conducted usability testing and think you know what constitutes a usable web site, read this book! Krug has distilled years of experience into a few principles that are easy to grasp but not always so easy to implement. His insights are sometimes counterintuitive and often not what a designer would want to hear. (I know because I am a web designer!)<br /><br />For example, his characterization of how people really approach web pages is quite an eye-opener. The designer may think that the user will take an orderly approach and read each section of the page, but here's how Krug describes the reality:<br /><br />\\"Look around feverishly for anything that a) is interesting, or vaguely resembles what you're looking for, and b) is clickable. As soon as you find a halfway-decent match, click. If it doesn't pan out, click the Back button and try again.\\"<br /><br />If designers can swallow their pride and discard their preconceptions, they can learn here what it takes to make the web a more pleasant and usable experience for everyone.
0895260131|1.0|I do not want to go low to the level of the author and point fingers and focus on the negatives instead of the the many postives that we have in common as Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Or Buddists for that matter. I believe we are all one (the human race). We all want the same for ourselves and our children. We all want a bright future for our world. We all have hour faults and our goods. We are all created by one Creator and We all will answer to Him and Him only.<br /><br />No body is saying that the Muslim world is without faults.<br />Some Muslims, and their leaders,  have to have a re-evaluation of themselves done and fast. But please believe me (and read on) when I say the religion of Islam is perfect as teachings of Jesus and Moses are perfect. I and millions of other human loving Muslims are the living examples. Just look within U.S. The U.S Muslim population are one of harmony and peace. They are Doctors, Engineers, Business people, CEOs, Lawyers, and they love their country, U.S. and their religion, Islam. They may not love Bush and Cheney, but believe me we Love this country and we are always greatful for it.<br /><br />Frankly, I fear a pandemic, like the bird flu, than an entire sect of the human race. But thats just me :-) There are extremists and Wackos that believe they are Muslims yes, but they are few (ofcourse the loudest) and they have short or no longevity.<br /><br />For the sake of argument I must say, this book is written by a bigot and in a discriminatory fashion. What do you call it, when the author calls 25% of the world population as war mongers, misguided and savages that want to force their beliefs on others.<br /><br />In U.S., it was just recently that we treated the entire black people as our properties or subclass and we thought they were sub humans, simply because they looked chocolatey.<br />Now we have started the same thing again. Only this time its not only based on skin color but on a set of people who call God Allah. If this was 40 years ago, you would have seen this author write a book about demeaning blacks/Latinos or some other minority group. And how to rid of them.<br /><br />This book offers no solution what so ever.<br />Any one that knows anything about Islam or any other major religion for that matter knows the author is full of absolute fabrication. No major religion that I know of condones violence, invasion and coercion. Especially not the religion of Islam that has over 1 Billion followers and counting and has explained the many mystics and science of our world more than 1400 years ago. For example, Islam has been home to many enigmatic figures likes of Rumi, Bukhari, Akbar the Great, IBN SINA (Avicenna), Al-Khwarizmi (Algorizm) Father of Mathematics (also where the term Algorithm is derived from) and hundreds more. Please refer here: [...]<br />So, it wasn't the sword that spread Islam throughout subsaharan Africa and Asia, but education, enlightment and inventions.<br /><br />Further, Islam respects and accepts Christianity and Judaism in high regards. It may be hard for you to believe, but Islam offers tools to question research and discover your faith over and over.<br />Another words, its against blind faith and encourages to learn.  It teaches that all humans are children of Eve and Adam, cherishes and adores values like Ten commandments, believes in equality regardless of color, ethnicity, wealth or family history, encourages self improvement, encourages to help the needy (charity), I can go on and on. And this is no fabrication or whitewashing, this and much more is what you will discover if you take the time to study with an open mind and a open heart. I know we love Mr. Spencer's bumper sticker kinds of books, but I am afraid our complex world requires us to do do diligence.<br /><br />Please note that amongst many of its Mystics, 80% of what is taught in Quran is about how to be a good father, brother, sister, wife, husband, neighbor, etc. Only about 20% of Quran focuses on Believe and admiration for God and his prophets.<br /><br />And it is so obvious that the only people that agree with this author have no previous real knowledge or experience with Islam or a Muslims or have never been in another Islamic country or any other country for that matter.

I missed the point and disliked the characters and I think I should have an MRI done to figure out why I finished it. <br /> <br />I couldn't tell who the good people were and who the bad ones were, butI did like the therapist.

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|not quite as good as the first for this viewer, but overall a great thinking person's adventure movie with twist at every turn. Matt Damon, the best big screen actor of his generation, is superb as the tightly wound, robotic, but sensitive Bourne. Great music, great scenery, great ending.

B00003CXI1|1.0|You know what really sucks? When someone craps in your Cheerios. You know what's worse? When everyone one you know eats those crappy Cheerios as if they were sweet, sweet candy. Or you know... uncrapped in Cheerios. Right, well I'm getting side tracked. Okay, my point is Harry Potter was my Cheerios (I shudder to admit this now, but I was young and needed the money) and the crap is the movies. They made what were good books, the first three the last three sucked, into pale shadows of their former selves. And yet people just keep lapping it up. The best example I can give to illustrate my disgust is as follows... <br />I have this Great Dane, Tigger (I didn't name him), and if any of you have ever had a great dane or any big dog you'll know what I mean when I say that he had this very large, and quite disgusting loogy (I don't think that's how that's spelled) hanging from his lips. So Mutie 2, another dog (hideously ugly, thus the name Mutant 2) slurped it up like a very gnarly spaghetti noodle.  <br />I think that describes my feelings for Harry Potter. A big, slimy loogy that people can't resist eating. So instead of spending money money or time on crapped-upon Cheerios or loogies, you could slowly drive a rusty nail through your forehead for much the same effect. <br /> <br />P.S. The casting is very bad. You'd think they'd cast at least one hot guy by mistake, but alas. And where did they find that many red-headed people without freckles? <br /> <br />*note: this applies to all editions not just this one*
B000DZIGDU|2.0|In my opinion the message of the film brigs notting new on the subjet, any war as no resenable meaning, a war is a war. It's not all bad in this movie there are some good scenes but now a day i think that every one knows the reasons behind Irak's war. I only recomend this film if you would like to see once more (Apocalipse Now, Platoon)the psycological effects of war in the soldiers and civilians or if you like war films.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This was the most moving film i've seen. It was truly amazing that one man,a NAZI, for that matter, could save 1100 Jewish people. This man is truly my idol. We watched this movie for school and everyone who saw was truly in tears about the little girl in the red coat, the esstional worker, the women being sent to Auschwitz, and when Osker lost his cool way of facing the whole matter. This is one of the best movies of all time. Everyone should see it.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|While this musical doesn't rank with me quite as high as some of the classics, it has definitely earned a spot as one of the better musicals out there. Stephen Schwartz's lyrics are very clever and the music is pretty good, too. The vocals were excellent, and I have(for once) no complaints with the cast. This time I will go in track order and give a rank for each of them, 10 being the best. <br /> <br />No One Morns The Wicked(9/10)-It captures the tradition of starting a musical with a big opening number, and is an excellent introduction to the show. It gives enough of the backstory without droning on, and gives an impression of what homelife might have been like for Elphaba.  <br /> <br />Dear Old Shiz(7/10)-It won't be your most favorite track, and you may end up skipping it after a few times listening to this CD. The vocals are good, however, and it has some nice harmonies. <br /> <br />The Wizard and I(8/10)-This is where you first hear Menzel's excellent vocals, and while it is enjoyable for the first few listens, it isn't the song that stands out the most. I gave it an 8 however just because of Menzel. <br /> <br />What Is This Feeling(9/10)-Definitely one of my favorites. This is one of the songs where the lyrics stand out more than the music. It's a nice melody with some nice harmonies, but the lyrics are superior in this case. It tells the story through the lyrics and not the music. <br /> <br />Something Bad(7/10)-A little ominous if you're new to the story, but again, after you listen to it for a while you'll eventually skip this track.  <br /> <br />Dancing Through Life(8/10)-Very clever and funny, but the music is less than superior. Very bouncy and fun, but nothing very deep. Again, the lyrics win in this case. <br /> <br />Popular(9/10)-One of Chenoweth's big performances and another one of my favorites. This really shows off Chenoweth's excellent acting within singing, and the lyrics shine once again.  <br /> <br />I'm Not That Girl(8/10)-Very touching and very sweet melody. It opens the door to the more emotional songs to come in the end of the first half and the second half.  <br /> <br />One Short Day(7/10)-A nice melody with some good harmonies between Menzel and Chenoweth. You begin to see their growing friendship. Besides that, it doesn't have much substance. <br /> <br />A Sentimental Man(6/10)-Essential to the story, but not one of the favorites. <br /> <br />Defying Gravity(9/10)-One of the strongest songs and most likey everyone's favorite song. It has powerful vocals on Menzel's part, and really shows off what she can do. This song made me become a fan of her vocals. <br /> <br />Thank Goodness(9/10)-Another strong song that shows of Chenoweth's range and vocal capacity. It shows a conflicted and deeper side of Glinda.  <br /> <br />Wonderful(8/10)-Very clever lyrics, and bacically the same type of melody used in previous songs.  <br /> <br />I'm Not That Girl(Reprise)(8/10)-Sung very well by Chenoweth. It makes you feel sorry for Glinda once again. <br /> <br />As Long As Your Mine(7/10)-I was disappointed with this song, because it sounds very much like a pop song. I do not like pop songs within a musical. I still gave it a 7 because it was sung very well, and I enjoyed the lyrics. <br /> <br />No Good Deed(9/10)-Excellent vocals by Menzel. She has a very powerful voice, and it is brought out by this song. In my opinion, this part is the climax of the story.  <br /> <br />March of The Witch Hunters(7/10)-Not one of the most thrilling songs, but necessary to the story nonetheless. Most likely this will be skipped over, too.  <br /> <br />For Good(8/10)-Touching and emotional. This song displays how well Menzel's and Chenoweth's voices blend together.  <br /> <br />Finale(8/10)-Sad and well done. It makes a nice contrast to the beginning of the story. <br /> <br />This musical was overall well done. It was a fun soundtrack to listen to. The lyrics won me over more than the melodies, but the story was still well done.

B0007GAEW6|2.0|Within the first minute of listening to Frances The Mute, it is apparant that you are going down an interesting musical journey.  The problem is that after the first 10 minutes of hearing the lead off song, you wondering when the band is going to stop being redundant and call it quits. <br /> <br />There is nothing wrong with making challenging 20-25 minutes opuses, the problem is Mars Volta has a good sounding front man, and has some GREAT musicians with some great chops, but they don't know how to keep the listener engaged. <br /> <br />The Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd, salsaesque, Santana on steroids is no doubt a hallmark of this bands sound, but the first track should have ended at the mid 3 minute mark.  The curious filler and soloing keeps going until you've just had enough.  and just when you think it's over, they keep repeating the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br />Rush and Pink Floyd's old progressive bent in the day did it better.  Even the 5 minute track The Widow which is okay.. has a sonic outing that is added in the last minute for what seems no purpose whatsoever, and is just more than HALF the actual song!  THe song is basically over at 3:30! <br /> <br />If you are going to add filler you have to make it interesting.  Where is the FLOW in this album?  There isn't any.  It's just songs that go into chaotic weirdness for too long, before you are wondering when the band is going to start playing again?  Or when are they going to stop!  It's as everything is cut and pasted from outakes and other songs, to make some 15 minute track, and a bunch of guys in the studio trying to coax out weird sounds on a mixing board (and most of those tricks are borrowed that you have heard before [flange drums think By-Tor and the Snowdog from Rush, or the keyboard sound on Widow obviously made to sound like Floyd's Wish you were Here], or come off as something un-inspiring).  Why?? <br /> <br />This is a unique band with a great sound, but if you are going to write a Santana esque version of 2112 you better make it relevant, interesting, and ENGAGING!  Not some inside pot smoking drug induced haze that comes off as some inside joke between the band and their friends. <br /> <br />Hopefuly there is something better out there by this band cause this album seems like a horrible waste of talent by these guys.
0066620996|4.0|Good to Great is a great book. It covers the straw that stirs the success of companies that were good for quite some time, but then became great.  <br /> <br />Who will benefit from this book? Entrepreneurs and managers. Whether you are starting and running your own business, or have a position within a company that allows you to impact the bottom line, there are concepts in this book that you shouldn't put in another day of work without. You'll learn how the \\"Keep It Simple, Stupid\\" (KISS) principle applies to business as the Hedgehog Concept, for example. I found myriad habits and principles that I can take and apply to my own pursuits with taking companies from good to great.  <br /> <br />I would encourage you to proceed with caution, however. The book feel short of 5 starts for a simple reason. The book has a passionate preamble about how objective it is, which caused me to raise an eyebrow and keep an eye out for those points where objectivity slips. Unfortunately, I found that many sections of the novel slip into the author's attempt to really force the idea through at any expense, despite moving into very subjective areas. <br /> <br />In other words, some of these pieces of the \\"Good to Great\\" puzzle are great ideas but aren't necessarily something you can scientifically quantify. I like the ideas, but the chapters that go to great lengths to insist that \\"this idea must be taken as law, it's not just our opinion\\" really felt like, well, opinion.  <br /> <br />Overall a fantastic addition to the entrepreneur or business manager's library, and a great and easy read on top of it.  <br /> <br />It also managed to plant a seed: now I'm dying to dive into the author's earlier novel, \\"Built to Last.\\"
B000002JSP|4.0|Nope, Led Zeppelin never shriveled up, blew away, or fell off the sidewalk, musically speaking. The context of this record is astounding. Considering their falling out of popularity, the music scene, the billboard charts, and even the loss of such longtime fans, Led Zeppelin were the strongest, toughest group of Brits out on the rock scene. As long they were all living and physically healthy enough to play, music never stopped churning out of their genius little minds. With the rise of the punk scene, and the keyboard, in which the two would eventually converge to form the \\"New Wave,\\" Zep's early blues/rock/sound was outdated and unpopular. So bassist JPJ steps up to the keys and turns out with a starring role on this record. His keyboard backings to Page's still heavy and early-days-sounding riffs add a definite new element to the sound of the band. But as perserverent and strong as they were, they had not changed the atmosphere of their music at all. Neither had their musicianship, Page in particular. Witness the strange FM hit, Fool In The Rain. (Strange for it being a radio hit; yes, we all forget this was Zeppelin, in the latter days.) Only Page, and the band, could keep such a simple continuous riff like that going over SIX minutes, without it ever getting uninteresting. They were usuals at longer recordings, they always had been; the average track length on all their LP's put together was about 5:30 minutes. Page rips out solo after another on this song, one in particular stands out, seemingly very Santana-inspired. This is basically the formula for all the tracks on the record, which is really the formula Zeppelin used from the beggining: several riffs, mushed in and out of each other, with Plant howling sexy lyrics and Page pulling out solo after trippy guitar effect after solo, and a sweet Bonzo drum roll in between each. Like I said, these guys never gave up their sound, to the bitter end, as long as they were all alive and in good health, they would continue to do what they were doing and rise to the top of the scene. And if the times were changing, Led Zeppelin did not have to change. Just make a few adjustments. JPJ's keys range on this album from the latin piano of the former mentioned Fool In The Rain, to the psychadelic intro of In The Evening, to this mellotrony symphony effect used on basically all the others. Its the same sounding stuff he did on Houses of the Holy with The Rain Song and No Quarter. They were truly a group effort, but JPJ's keyboarding talent does not necessarily \\"shine\\" on this album, though it's not necessarily bad either. Its just not quite the equivalent of his bass skill; their is deffinitely no Lemon Song-solo equivalent. The true stars of this album are still Page and Plant, in such order. Just as the good old days. And to look back at this record in retrospect with the career of the one greatest band in rock and roll: no, it does stand above their rest; it's obvious to see it was part of their more \\"dog days.\\" None the less, this is a Led Zeppelin record we're talking about, and it does not just give up, accept that it's over, and assume its loss, unlike its acclaim so far in history. It is a fine record by the finest band around.<br /><br />As silly as it sounds, the overall sensation and atmosphere of the entire Led Zeppelin career is summed up in the probably the finest moment of the album - the introduction. We've always loved psychadelic band intros to albums, but Zep was never too interested in them. The closest we ever got was probably Black Dog's little trippy, windey waa-effect opener. But something about the tone of JPJ's 1:00 minutes opener, aided by more effects of Page's guitar, though quiet, and subtle, really seemed like a brief review of the career of this band, looking from the bluesy New Yardbirds, to Achilles Last Stand; and now, bold as they were, from the sound of Robert Plant's now 30-year old wail \\"In The EVENING...\\", and the crash of Bonzo's symbals, they took their next step beyond into a new realm of rock, one they were ready to embrace, whatever the cost. Thus, IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR, as fine a record as it is, and as each song is, is more a C.D. to purchase to get a feeling for what the band was like at this day, and a keepsake, for inspiration, to show what its like to perserve through the music world, and life in general; and less a c.d. to keep for musical pleasure and listening to each song singley. Even so, the record boasts a fine track listing, also featuring: \\"South Bound Suarez,\\" \\"Hot Dog,\\" \\"Carousselambra,\\" \\"All My Love,\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Crawl.\\"ook their next step beyond into a new realm of rock, one they were ready to embrace, whatever the cost.

B000005RFQ|4.0|I love Black Sabbath whether it's with Ozzy, Dio or Tony Martin. Born Again with Ian Gillan is no exception. The music itself is phenomenal Iommi and Butler never disappoint it's probably their heaviest record since Master of Reality. Gillan does a fine job on this release although the lyrics could have been better. My real complaint is with the constant screaming someone had to be grabbing his balls while he was recording his tracks. It's just waaaay over done and in some songs completely unnecessary...Gillan's tracks need to be edited. When his balls are not in a vice he sounds good over the music. I bought this on vinyl as a kid back when Maiden and Priest were both utilizing the operatic scream and they sounded great but in this case, it does not. Born Again is a terrific album if you could get past the screaming.  It's a must have for any Sabbath Fan. Btw, I don't know why so many people dislike the album cover I think it's one of their best...it's pure evil.
6301008944|5.0|I got this movie for one reason and one reason only.  Albert \\"Frozen Alive\\" Collins (a.k.a. The Master of the Telecaster) appears in the bar scene.  Mr. Collins is one of the best guitarists ever.  He is underappreciated because of his unusual tuning and unusual playing method with the capo at the 7th fret, but nevertheless it's worth getting the entire movie just to see Mr. Collins.<br /><br />Mr. Collins also had a healthy sense of humor so he no doubt jumped at the opportunity to appear in this movie.  He has since passed away, but we can all still enjoy him in this movie.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is pretty good too
B0000029GA|5.0|Classic Album...Premier shines as well as other production...Probably the best \\"TRU\\" hip-hop album of all time...TO be modest...It's hard to Pick a favorite since the whole album is equally enthralling...But i will say Memory Lane with It Ain't Hard To Tell coming in at a close second...Your assignment is to go by this album and educate yourself!
B000002BYA|5.0|Everyone knows SRV was great so of course this CD will be excellent, but it's not the same old SRV.  It shows SRV in a setting that is not captured in any other SRV recordings.<br /><br />The first half of the set is Stevie and Double Trouble playing the regular song set that they played at the time: Scuttlebuttin', Love Struck, etc...  It's excellent of course but nothing you haven't already heard before on other SRV CDs.<br /><br />The second half they are joined by a complete horn section, keyboardist, second drummer, and a female singer Angela Strehli sits in for one song.  Here they play tributes to other blues artists like Guitar Slim, Albert King and Albert Collins, songs that are not found on other SRV CDs.<br /><br />The sound is also unique to SRV.  He's not using his usual chocolate brown aged Stratocaster but a newer model with a distinctive sound.<br /><br />This is NOT an old tape that Jimmie found laying around and released to put some coin in his pocket.  This is excellent stuff that any true SRV fan must have in his collection.
B0007P3582|2.0|I aint going to hate on 50 cause he makes his money or whateva and he is relatively entertaining with all his beef and thug themes etc....BUt musically, lyrically, and just in general...He is horrible...His old stuff is not that bad and thier is 2-3 listenable songs on this CD...But as a whole this is his worst by far...He is drowning deeper into pop.. He has been on a steady decline ever since fame hit him. Keep doing your thing 50 but i wont be buying it...I will get the bootleg
B00005JNRE|5.0|I - along with an untold number of others - have been waiting a very long time for this movie. We have been following it from the time it was announced Colin Firth would be in the movie (February 2004). We followed the production - scouring the internet and everywhere else for pictures and all the details we could find. We waited as the original release (Easter 2005) was delayed and then the US folks waited even longer as it opened here three months after the UK.   Owning a website, I had quite a bit of advance knowledge of the context of the film, but I have already been 4 times. I went opening day to the first showing. Later that night I took my daughter (well, she's 27, but still loved it). The next day my husband wanted to go (he likes Kelly M) and couldn't say enough good things about it. I have since gone by myself once more. Once in awhile you just want to sit back and be entertained. You don't want a movie that you have to pick at or pick apart. Nanny fits the bill. This is a movie for all ages. I never go to childrens movies anymore, but I wouldn't classify it as such.   I'm a bit weary of the Mary Poppins comparisons. This movie stands on its own as \\"Nanny McPhee.\\"  I'd just like to add a side note about Colin Firth. He doesn't and hasn't always played the romantic lead. Take some time and check out his dramatic works, which he has done more of than romances and/or comedies. If you missed the last 3 dramas he was in 'Girl With a Pearl Earring - 2004' 'Trauma - 2004' and 'Where The Truth Lies - 2005,' give them a looksee and then go for some of his older works. The man is talented and versatile.  Of the overall acting in this film, you couldn't have cast it any better.  (Other recommendations - Master of the Moor, Donovan Quick, Conspiracy, Apartment Zero, A Month In The Country, Tumbledown)
B00004RFFS|5.0|Very dark and beautiful movie. The music is perfectly insync with the cinematics. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, and Ms. Dunst are superb in this film.From start to finish you feel the emotion in the movie. The Dark vampires, Louis's Pain and his sollace of eternity, and not to mention the sexual themes. But i suggest you pick up the score(instrumental soundtrack) of this film....Truly haunting.
B00006879E|1.0|MORON 5, JUST SAY IT YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO. Anyway back to this trivial band. This album is nothing more than filler music. There is just no other way to describe them, they have no musical talent. Everything they play is incredibly easy and monotonous. Which leads one to come to the same conclusion everytime these guys or the hords of others just like them come out with a new record. COMMERCIAL RADIO SUPREME!!!!!!! These guys are a radio execs wet dream. Now that I think about it I probably shouldn't have used the phrase \\"no talent\\" Because in all honesty I don't know if they do or not. Mainly because all they ever do is record stuff like this. I guess what I should have said is the stuff that they put out doesn't require any talent. Maybe that won't p*ss off everybody as much. HAHA
0312995423|2.0|Not like his others, this book was about 200 pages too long.  Pretty much drug on for the last 200 pages.  His other books, I wish were longer, this one was done and figured out by the middle of the book. Still have to admit, it was worth reading.
B000002JS6|5.0|ACDC is a band of iconic proportions, and it's easy to understand why. Especially with their now legendary album \\"Back In Black\\". You might be wondering if purchasing the whole album is worth it; if every song is just as good as the popular classics such as \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Shoot To Thrill\\", \\"RocknRoll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", and the title track. Well let it be confirmed, my friends, from start to finish this album is a keeper! The energy never gives in, and the music rocks itself right off the rocker throughout the whole thing. And the louder it is, the better it sounds! ACDC is a prime example of how any musician can show off and steal the show, but it takes five great men like the ones found here to pull together and make an absolute symphony of headbangin' goodness that stands the test of time. \\"Back In Black\\" kicks the listener just as hard as it did in the 80's, and I have a feeling it doesn't plan on quiting any time soon. It's the kind of music you can't get out of your head -- and I mean that in a good way. So pop it in, crank it up, and let the wild spirit of rockroll surge through your soul!
B00005JOIF|1.0|Munich is nothing more than another contemporary remake of a previous movie, Speilberg should not stoop so low as to simply remake a movie originally released in the 80's.  If you would like to see the original, get a copy of \\"The Sword of Gideon\\", for my taste it is a better telling of the tale.
0393317552|4.0|A great find for any history buff. This work explains some common yet over-looked factors determining conflict without being a boring history lesson. It is a sort of patchwork to any history 101 class and should be a manditory read in colleges. Not at all depressing as the title my suggest. Nicely written and a timeless work.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|My wife and I just got finished watching \\"Short Circuit\\" again today and we were thrilled to see such a wholesome movie, a stark contrast to the morass of movies that we get spoon-fed from Hollywood these days!<br /><br />While the special effects are indeed from the 80's (as they should be since this film came out in 1985), the story of love, compassion, and believing that Number 5 really is allive is what makes this classic film worth watching time and time again.<br /><br />If you've got kids, then you need to show 'em this movie.  There's more to life than SpongeBob, Dora the Explorer, and the like.  Good, wholesome, family comedy-adventure movies are hard to come by, but this one fits to the bill.<br /><br />It still makes me smile 20 years later!
B0007INZXO|5.0|Great album period.  Until a week ago or so I wasn't even really familiar with Colplay until a friend of mine mentioned that he wanted a new Colplay album X&Y.  I started doing little research of my own and found their sound to be intriguing.  It all pretty much started from me playing Speed of Sound over and over, then I started liking songs from their previous albums and once I really got into the new album, that's pretty much all I wanna have in my boombox.  It takes a while to get into the whole Colplay style but once you do, you're forever caught up.  If not the lyrics, then you should get the album just for its amazing instrumental arrangements.  It's a compilation you can just put on and not skip any tracks and few albums these days are like that.  It's an experience that's almost indescribable.  If you like the whole U2 sound or you love instrumental and/or melodic music, you will love this CD.
B000002BE9|5.0|Oh, I can honsetly say that Tidal is Fiona Apple's best album. Theres not a single song that I skip on this CD. When I first got this CD in 1998 I mainly listened to criminal but now i've grown to all of her songs. Her songs reveal a deep hurt and internal pain that will haunt any listener. The lyrics \\"...but as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappeared\\" or \\"I'll haunt the world inside you\\" just barely scratch the surface of this siren of melancholy's potential. I actually had sang \\"Slow like Honey\\" at A close friends funeral because it signified the hurt that I felt of a lost loved one. Shadaow Boxer also exercises Fiona's piano potential and so does Never is a Promise. Fiona surely outdid herself and gave us an emotional tidal wave that nobody expected. If you don't have this CD, you should definately add it to your collection.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I love Stand By Me. I first saw it a year ago, because I was a River Phoenix fan (and, as a Trekkie, I obviously knew and enjoyed Wil Wheaton). I wasn't expecting any great masterpiece, but it certainly turned out to be one. <br /> <br />The acting is superb, but what I love most is the dialogue. It's very witty, very clever, and absolutely fantastic! Plus it was filmed in my hometown, so it's all good! <br /> <br />I would say more but I don't want to ruin it. If you're debating whether or not to rent this movie, or buy it, just go ahead and do it! You'll love it. Trust me.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|\\"Blow Away\\" is powerful, sincere, innocent, and pure.  Just listening to this album you can't help believing that he must have been in touch with the divine.  Other favorites are \\"Soft Hearted Hana\\" and \\"Not Guilty\\" (which appears on the latest Beatles Anthology).
B0001KU93C|1.0|I was looking for a good western and saw very strong reviews for this one.  Man, was I sucked in!  Do you ever have suspicions that more than just a few of the reviewers are employed by the companies responsible for releasing a movie?   <br /> <br />Hear me now and listen to me later.  This is, bar none, one of the most over hyped excuses for a western of all time.  This does not even come close to Leone's films.  Do not pay full price for this one.  Waste less of your money and buy it used if you can`t fight the urge to see this movie.  My copy will be back on the street soon.  The extra disc was horrible, too. <br />
B00005JNEW|4.0|Having read the excellent book on which this film was based, I was apprehensive about what Hollywood might do to distort it. Author Bissinger addressed the topic of racism in that book, and my fear was that this would be the sole theme focused on by the film makers. However, to their credit, they made the movie about much more than that -- and when they did touch on the topic, they did so fairly even-handedly, showing from the comments made by some Carter players that racism is a two-sided coin.  <br />This movie is a powerful contrast with \\"Varsity Blues\\". That was an entirely forgettable movie because it dealt with fictional characters in cliched situations. \\"Friday Night Lights\\", based on true events, portraying real people at real Texas high schools, and showing the agony and ecstasy of the run for the state championship, was a memorable film.
B00000AFDW|3.0|When I heard that the original band were going to record their first album in 19 years,(the last being 1979's disaster \\"Dynasty\\"), I couldn't think about nothing else. When I heard the title track, \\"Psycho Circus\\" during the summer of '98, I was so pumped. I recorded it off the radio,and played it over & over again. When the day it was released, I had my wife stop by the cd store & get it. I could barely stay below the speed limit on the way home from work. I popped it in the cd player & rocked out. The first five songs:\\"Psycho Circus\\",\\"Within\\",\\"I Pledge Allegience...\\",\\"Into The Void\\",and \\"We Are One\\", are GREAT songs. But that's when the excitement left my body;like a balloon that was popped. \\"You Wanted the Best,You Got the Best\\" is a LAME attempt to make the fans think they're all 'buddy-buddy' again. Doesn't even rock in the least! \\"Raise Your Glasses\\" sounds like a song written for Pepsi. Peter's ONLY song is a freaking BALLAD??!!! I was wishing for a rocker,like \\"Rock & Roll Over\\"'s \\"Baby Driver\\". \\"Dreamin\\" sounds a lot like Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\",and a judge agreed. The only bright spot in these last five songs is Gene's \\"Journey of a 1,000 Years\\". Like the title of my review, \\"Psycho Circus\\" just live up to my expections. (This coming from a KISS fan of 25 years).
B000002IAZ|4.0|Yeah, Buffalo Springfield had some great tunes, and any band with a pre-mega-fame Stephen Stills and Neil Young has to be at least interesting, but I've gotta come right out and say what no one else seems to be willing to say: Richie Furay and his lugubrious, New-Christy-Minstrels vocal style really lower the quality of the proceedings on this, or ANY Buffalo Springfield collection, for that matter. Sorry for the long sentence, but WHO decided that it was a good idea for Furay to sing Neil Young's songs? OOF! Damn, that guy can suck the life (as well as any trace of \\"rock and/or roll\\") out of ANYTHING. His pseudo-emotive, lounge-singer delivery on \\"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\\" pretty much ruins any impact the song might have. This collection, with a lower ratio of Furay-to-good-stuff, works better than their individual LP releases.    I remember being a teenager, and a BIG fan of Neil Young and of CSNY, and getting all three original Buffalo Springfield LPs as an xmas present. \\"Underwhelmed\\" might be the best word for my reaction. The first LP has some decent Stills bar-band sort of stuff, too many Furay-sung tunes, and the always-great \\"Burned.\\" The second LP feels like Neil was on a different planet from the other guys, with Stills' tunes much improved, but still, Furay is there to water things down and head the band into the middle of the road, where they did NOT belong.  The last LP has even more Furay than the other 2, and sinks under his bloated style. What he did to Neil's On the Way Home is UNFORGIVABLE, as witnessed by the GREAT versions of that tune that Neil did over the next two years with CSNY and in solo shows.    No joke--they could've been GREAT, and they just about managed to be GOOD. Just try to sit through ONE of their LPs without hitting the fast-forward button. NOTHING deserves more than 4 stars if you can't listen to it all the way through. This gets 4 stars for the Neil songs that made it through (Mr. Soul, Broken Arrow, I Am a Child, Expecting to Fly) for the moments when Stills' ego didn't get the better of him (Rock and Roll Woman, Bluebird) and for when Richie Furay was OUT of the spotlight. Pardon me if I've offended anyone, but this needed to be said. Just check out Lester Bangs' comments on these cats if you want to find someone else who feels this way.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|I own every Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler CD, but for some reason, I bought this compilation. I am glad I did.<br /><br />First, this is the best compilation yet in that the songs are the full album cuts, with no curtailing of the long terminal solos to make them more compact. Second, the sequence of the songs ignores chronology for the most part and puts the songs in an order that just flows so nicely. Pink Floyd did this with their best of, \\"Echoes\\"; it worked for them and it works for this set. After years of expecting a song to come up after the current song, it was nice to have this new sequence to make the listening fresh.<br /><br />Sure, we could all come up with songs that should have made the cut for this set, but then again a true fan would already have the albums. I review this as a \\"bunch\\" of Dire Straits and Knopfler songs and not a \\"best of\\", because the real \\"best of\\" would be a set of about 8 discs in my opinion. As a \\"bunch\\" of great songs, this is a fine compilation.<br /><br />For the fans, this is just another way to enjoy the music.  It has been spinning in my car stereo for days, and I get over a couple of decades of music in one CD jewelry box.  And if you are just discovering Knopfler, this set should be your gateway to the albums, and many, many more great songs.
1400032717|5.0|This book was hilarious, compelling and above all, one of the most unique books I have ever read.  The perspective of the story from Christopher's point of view was brilliant and I really liked how the \\"central\\" plot of solving the dog's murder was actually a very small part of the overall story. Though the book is told from Christopher's point of view, you actually fully comprehend the motivations and joy and despair of all of the major characters. <br />  <br />I enjoyed how the majority of the saga between his parents and himself was played out over the length of the work.  The plot was very even, despite the choppy-type of chapters that were reflective of Christopher's thought processes.  I truly thought the book flowed perfectly and at times I found myself frustrated with Christopher and then at other times rooting for him, feeling sorry for him, feeling sorry for others around him, etc.  I was surprised that in such a seemingly simply written text, I could endure the entire gamut of emotions so profoundly!  <br /> <br />This book was so well-done, I highly recommend it....I know a few readers that have commented that this book \\"wasn't their usual sort of reading material\\", but I think that if your sort of \\"reading material\\" is a work that is fresh, compassionate and humorous all at the same time, then this book is absolutely a must for you!
B0002P18GI|5.0|If this was a Science Fiction Novel, it would have won the Nebula Award. Like a tartan patchwork, the story loops arounds itself and you have to squint real hard to spot the little details within the general pattern. Until finally, you realized that there's more than just a simple lovestory. The ending was an inspired moment.  <br /> <br />Although the beginning can be a bit slow, and personally to me, somewhat boring. Just give this movie a chance, and work through the first 30 minutes. You won't regret it! And oh, do check out the poem by Alexander Pope... it's just as good!
B000008HPE|5.0|It took three years for Huey Lewis and the News to come out with the followup to their multiplatinum hit album Sports, Fore!  Inbetween that time, though the News made their first #1 hit with \\"The Power of Love\\" from Back To The Future, where Lewis had a cameo playing a high school music teacher holding band auditions.  The tempo of Fore is mostly mid-paced compared the power-pounding rockers of Sports, plus there's more of a polish to the songs.  But some songs seem like excerpts from yuppie middle-class suburban family life, so more serious social commentary here.<br /><br />Take for example the acapella doowop of \\"Naturally,\\" where despite hardships, things will eventually work out:  \\"you know that love is a struggle/and only the strong survive/so it's up to me and you/to do what we've got to do to keep our love alive.\\"  And the philosophical \\"Simple As That\\" traces the life history of the working man, from working all day, paying bills, fighting the high cost of living, trying to get a loan for the house, and seeing one's children married with their own children, with a humorous aside of being left with one's wife, dog, and cat.<br /><br />Fore! though yielded two more #1 hits for HL&N.  In fact it would be their last two #1s.  The first was \\"Stuck With You,\\" three weeks on the top spot and on the adult contemporary charts, a leisure, mid-paced Beach Boys-type pop song with doowop harmonies and organ in the chorus.  A catchy song about deciding to stick together despite the ups and downs and thoughts of breaking up, with some pithy reasons of being bound by the same address and phone number, it was a wise choice to be the first single from Fore!<br /><br />The second was the Bruce Hornsby-penned \\"Jacob's Ladder,\\" a commentary on religious hucksters, be it the man chasing the fan dancer in Birmingham per the song, or televangelists.  \\"Hey mister I'm not in a hurry and I don't wanna be like you/All I want from tomorrow is to get it better than today,\\" sings Lewis, true to his artistic temperament.  Well, given the performance of the singles, Fore! did make it better than Sports.<br /><br />The #3 single and #1 mainstream rock hit \\"Hip To Be Square\\" is the most energetic song on Fore!  This song about letting go of one's renegade ways, such as cutting one's hair and playing it straight, may raise eyebrows to those wanting to be different, but when he mentions working out and watching what he eats, well, when one things about it, eating and living healthy seems renegade in today's \\"supersize me\\" fast-food society, so maybe this song embraces some hip values after all.  The News has football players singing backups on this song, BTW.<br /><br />If \\"I Want A New Drug\\" was slowed down, it'd probably sound close to the #9 \\"I Know What I Like.\\"  \\"Doing It All For My Baby\\" was the fifth single and peaked at #6.  A rocking piano and guitar ballad with backing from the Tower of Power horns section, this is a tribute to soulful 60's and 70's music.  With the silly Frankenstein-influenced music video overplayed on MTV, it didn't take me too long to get sick of this song, but now, it's like welcoming an old friend back to the fold.<br /><br />\\"Whole Lotta Lovin',\\"-no, not the Fats Domino song, but an original by Lewis, owes a nod back to 50's style Elvis or Little Richard style rock, and darned if Lewis doesn't get the genre nailed down!  The best non-single here, with Huey doing a harmonica solo in the middle.  Huey plays counselor here in displaying old-fashioned wisdom in the good-natured \\"Forest For The Trees,\\" where things are that fuzzy gray and not black and white, and a need for sitting back and thinking things out will do a world of good:  \\"and if you're not afraid to open your eyes, you may be pleasantly surprised things are never as bad as they seem.  You just gotta learn to see the forest for the trees.\\"<br /><br />Fore is not only a successful Huey Lewis/News album with a combination of hit singles and sobering but ultimately optimistic commentary on the struggles of life in the 80's.but ultimately optimistic commentary on the struggles of life in the 80's.
B0000048CP|5.0|If you don't know about Bathory, chances are you aren't a metal fan. Quorthon's masterful work was just that influential, creating black metal, viking metal, and playing a non-negotiable role in the creation of death and thrash metal. Label them however you want, fact is most genres wouldn't be the same without Bathory. History lesson aside, let's focus on Quorthon's fourth, Blood Fire Death. This album was sort of a transition from his proto-black metal style into his patented viking metal stuff. This means you'll hear a melange of motifs, ranging from the said genres, to some Venom-derived riffage. Very ambitious indeed.    The album starts out with a bang, as the classic opener \\"For All Those Who Died\\" begins with a soft accoustic piece. This song gives you a good idea of what to expect later. Majestic melodies, Lyrics of viking battles, furious solos, and Quorthon's frenetic roar. Next is the old-school thrasher \\"Golden Walls of Heaven,\\" which spews blasphemy in ways Slayer never accomplished until Reign in Blood.     I'd like to call Blood Fire Death a no-filler album, but the next track, \\"Pace 'Til Death,\\" intervenes. The painfully cheesy Venom-worship \\"nana nana booboo\\" intro keeps this track from being easy to listen to, but it's a nice standard black/thrash track nontheless. \\"Holocaust\\" observes the album at its most intense. Quorthon's ambiguous vocals are probably their most \\"black metal\\" here, as he violently strains over the 120mph riffage.    \\"For All Those Who Died\\" is easily one of the most memorable anthems in the genre. It's a hard-hitting, percussion-oriented viking epic, its only flaw being that it's too short. \\"Dies Irae\\" dabbles in the thrashier, pseudo-blasphemy aspects of Bathory's old Material. During the verses, the vocals hold a very rhythmic power, only to quickly erupt like torrential rainstorms. The song drags to a near halt at the last minute, and webs a pleasant melody. The subsequent epic \\"Blood Fire Death\\" is the definition of viking metal; Intoxicating melodies, every minute dripping with grandeur. Quorthon kind of \\"cleanly\\" sings with his very rough, untamed voice, about themes of unity in battle, accompanied by an ethereal-sounding choir. Near the last few minutes, the vocals reach their venemous peak-- Until the song descends into an accoustic outro, as if returning from whence it came.     It's a cliche, but this album is a juxtaposition of ferociousness and beauty that has been emulated, but not surpassed. I could delve deep into the musical and artistic nuances that render the majority of Bathory's catalogue excellent, but I won't waste your time any further. Just listen to it if you haven't already.    R.I.P. Quorthon
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This is a great movie, especially for those who enjoyed Van Helsing and Constantine.  The effects were complete and amazing throughout the entire production.  SO  many movies in this genre fall short by having good effects for big scenes and then crappy effects for minor scenes.  This is not the case with Underworld.  The other good thing about this film is that it is not bogged down by crap that doesn't have anything to do with the major plot.  There is a deep sense of emotion in the film, but no crappy love scenes with vampire or werewolves.  I applaud the film makers for keeping this film above-board.  It will go down as one of my favorite films of all time.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|I'll see anything directed by Sam Mendes after \\"American Beauty\\".  I had high hopes for Jarhead and I was not dissapointed.  Jake Gyllenhal, Peter Sarsgaard, and Jamie Fox were excellent, as was the cinematography, writing and directing.  I liked that the film didn't try to glorify war, and pretty much did the opposite.  It showed war from a much more realistic standpoint through the eyes of the main character, the troops motto was \\"welcome to the suck\\".  I am not speaking from experience, but I'm sure when you are fighting in war it does suck and you do question why you're there, like the characters.  The film really captured how I would imagine fighting in war today to be like.  I highly reccomend this film, it's great.
B00005JO20|5.0|Easily one of the best films of 2005, Peter Jackson's King Kong is now officially one of, if not my absolute favorite movie of all time.<br /><br />Of course, I'm not just gushing to be one of the \\"in crowd,\\" because King Kong really IS something unique amoungst cinema. While the original set the standard (also availible here on Amazon), PJ's Kong takes everything to the next level. The SPFX are Oscar-worthy (at the very least), the writing and acting is all rock-solid, and the directing is inspired, as is Jackson's style. The only flaw might be the length, but if you care enough to know about the characters, then the first hour will fly by.<br /><br />The best aspect of the film, aside from one of the best giant monster battles in pop-culture history, is the wonderful relationship between the mighty Kong (Andy Serkis) and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts). The two lost souls find comfort with each other, trying their best to stay together (and alive) against a world that wants to rip them apart.<br /><br />No movie fan's collection will be complete without this dvd! A must-own!
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|I have been waiting literally decades for this album to be released on CD, and they one-upped me to a DVD! Simply astounding performances, and it still gives me chills when I hear certain songs.
B00005JMYI|4.0|This is going to be a classic.  This movie is worth buying if not renting.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|These four are absolutely brilliant. If I could write music (and I can't) this would be what it would sound like. Maybe these four would be nothing apart, but together they are masterful. There is not a weak song on this album. They are The Beatles, the best of the 80s & 90s all wrapped into one. I have listened to this for 3 months solid and can't get tired of it.
B00005JNQS|4.0|A cute animated comedy, Robots, brings to the screen the story of a poor country robot that makes the journey to the big city in hopes of making his dreams, as an inventor, come true, with all the ups and downs that that entails!  What he encounters though, might be more than he bargained for... <br />Robots, is a film about friendship, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, integrity and inner strength.   <br />Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Robin Williams, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all very good. <br />In short, though not a masterpiece like the Shrek movies or Monsters Inc, Robots is definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment. <br />
B000B0WODA|5.0|I thought their debut was incredible, this album is even better! The lyrics are deeper, the guitar a little guttier. Punk at times, dance at times. Fallen is simply their best song to date. Please read the lyrics, I can't even describe them. There isn't a band out there right now with this kind of range, can't wait for the next album!
6304708521|2.0|Those who read this review are, no doubt, familiar with every word, note, and film frame of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.  In short, the DVD transfer is horrible.  Granted, the original 16mm film was not a professional job either, but this DVD appears as if it was derived from a very poor copy of the Beatles' film.<br /><br />I have seen MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR in many formats.  Years ago I found a 16mm film copy in the library.  I borrowed this print several times.  The the picture was very clear, but the sound was poor.  Later I bought a VHS copy through MEDIA.  The original VHS copy was about the same quality as the film, except that it was convenient to play on a video cassette recorder.  Still later I bought a \\"remastered digitally enhanced\\" VHS copy.  The picture was about the same as previous editions, but the sound was greatly improved.<br /><br />Recently I bought the DVD release.  I was somewhat concerned that the DVD did not display the Apple Logo, but I had heard that this film drifted into the public domain a few years ago.  I was sadly disappointed at the quality of the DVD.  Nothing was done to improve this copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.  The color is washed out, picture is grainy, and the sound is worse than the original 16mm film.  About the only benefit of the DVD is that enjoys the semi-permanence of being on DVD and you can jump from chapter to chapter.<br /><br />As for the film itself, this was the Beatles first attempt -- outside of some of their music promos -- at making a film.  It was designed to be for television, so it was captured on 16mm color film.  The plot is simple: The Beatles and friends load onto a bus to take a sight-seeing tour of England.  These tours were standard fare for Brits in the late 1960s.  Along the way the passengers and crew of the bus encounter some odd scenery and situations.  In between there are some great Beatles musical numbers.<br /><br />Okay, the film itself is not Oscar material.  It is more like something you would expect from someone showing off a new home movie/video camera.  However, it is classic Beatles.  There was not much of a script for this movie and John, George, Paul and Ringo all took part in the production.  Apparently all four Beatles were involved in the editing, though never at the same time.  As such, the film took on conflicting directions depending on who was in the editing room.  Paul even slipped in his solo \\"Fool on the Hill\\" promo from Southern France.<br /><br />We have all heard the legend.  This film bombed on British television.  It was broadcast in black and white.  Later it was rebroadcast in color in a bad time slot.  Worse yet, the film was blown up to 35mm and premiered in theaters.  Still, it heralded the creation of Apple.  All four Beatles would be involved in numerous other film projects and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was good experience.<br /><br />If you do not already have a VHS copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, I recommend that you wait for Apple to re-release a restored copy.  On the other hand, the DVD is affordable.f a new home movie/video camera.  However, it is classic Beatles.

0385512058|5.0|I just bought and read this book and I am already recommending it to my friends. I recommend it to you as well.<br /><br />Sometimes I feel like I don't have a smidge of social skills and I wonder if I ever socially developed beyond the age of 12. I know there are a lot of other people like me out there. Some people seem to look down on us.<br /><br />Thus, I became a successful technician. For all you other technicians, artists, writers and other wallflowers who just don't get how the other half can't patiently spend two days looking over a giant spreadheet for a mistyped formula, you should read this book.<br /><br />So, one day I was sitting alone in a crowded cafeteria reading \\"Never Eat Alone\\" ...<br /><br />Fellow quiet folk, take a look at how the other half thinks and acts (and it's all in a book so we don't have to actually talk to anyone.) Yes we actually were ignored on purpose, but as Ferrazzi explains - open up and be interesting if you want the social climbers to notice you. And then spend lots of time sending them cards and notes instead of wasting time doing the real boring nitty-gritty work.<br /><br />Grain of salt...<br /><br />Yes, Ferrazzi comes across strong, but he also comes across honestly. I certainly won't be trying to imitate his lifestyle, but I got a great view of how a purely social personality thinks - and a very successful person to boot. You may or may not like him, but you should study him. The same goes for Machiavelli.<br /><br />People chess...<br /><br />After reading the whole book I got a big picture view of how to network. I found techniques I could tone down and adapt. I learned some basic etiquette of Ferrazzi's world. I already feel much more comfortable with networking now that I have been given a little preview of the way it is supposed to work out. I find that fear of the unknown is one of the keys to making people shy - so buy and read this book.<br /><br />The grass is greener....<br /><br />And by greener I mean money. Ferrazzi points out that many of the most powerful people are not the very smartest, but the very connected. You know the people who can take ten smoke breaks a day with the manager; they often get more promotions than the people who stayed and worked.<br /><br />I am a great user of the public library, but I do think Ferrazzi deserves to have every copy of his book in print purchased - he earned it.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Where can one begin to sing the praises of Rear Window? Is it the two leading performances (James Stewart & Grace Kelly)?, the wonderfully absorbing narrative? or the immensely claustrophobic cinematography? <br /> <br />Answer: all of the above. very rarley there appears a film which manages to encapsulate every ingredient required to culminate into a top rate suspense thriller. Rear Window is the king of kings in suspense with a little romance and humour thrown in.  <br /> <br />Rear Window was the second of four collaberations between Alfred Hitchcock and james Stewart and in my opnion is the best. The gratitude that Stewart shows is reflected in his portrayl of the no nonsense snapper who, despite dominating the picture, you never tire of the sight of Stewart in his blue PJ's peering out over the courtyard at the array of characters the director treats us with. <br /> <br />The film centres around travelling photographer L.B. Jeffries (Jeff) played by James Stewart, who as a result of an accident, is temporarely confined to a wheel chair with a broken leg and in order to stave off immense boredom, peers nonchallantly into the windows of his Greenwich village neighbours apartments. What he sees to be innocent, slightly eccentric characters ('miss hearing-aid') there is one apartment which holds a suspicious fascination for Jeff and that is of salesman Lars Thorwald (played brilliantly by Raymond Burr with a frightening and both pathetic and desperate angle.) <br /> <br />His determination to prove that Thorwald murdered his disabled wife despite objections from his detective friend (Wendell Corey) is intertwined with an array of interesting and spectacularly original characters such as the afore mentioned Grace Kelly as Jeff's socialite girlfriend 'Lisa Freemont', whose passion for Jeff is only matched by his apprehension and the doubts about the relationship and it's uncertain future. The insurance nurse with the sharpest tongue in fifties cinema played by Thelma Ritter who seems to share the directors thirst for the macabre.  <br /> <br />All this ends in one of the most nail-biting endings Hitchcock has ever created in use of lighting and montage in his piecing together of the scene.  <br /> <br />There seems to be numerous sub-texts which appear in the film, (the nieghbours dilemma's seem to outline the possible outcomes of Jeff's relationship with Lisa). However, put aside the ins and outs of Hitchcocks mind because you will only scratch the surface, and instead marvel at the sheer brilliant cinema at which every shot portrays from the 'jazzy' opening credits to the delightful closing offering. <br /> <br />Purchase, watch and enjoy again and again and again.............  <br /> <br />

B0001BKAEY|5.0|The Matrix Trilogy is, without a doubt, one of the greatest works of art in the history of mankind.  Some discount this because they were movies, and not works of literature or music or \\"traditional\\" art (i.e. painting, sculpture, etc.).  Others discount this claim because the trilogy was science fiction and not drama. <br /> <br />Yet I claim that the Matrix Trilogy should be held alongside the works of Shakespeare and DaVinci and Michelangelo!  The Matrix Trilogy contains all the best of the literary, the musical, the visual, the comedy, the tragedy, the mystery, and the anything-else-you-want-to-include-here.   <br /> <br />For those who didn't \\"get\\" the last two films, I am sorry to inform you that you simply should have stayed awake in your philosophy and comparative relgion classes in college.  In this masterpiece you have the distilled philosophical wisdom of Descartes, Nietzsche, Baudrillard, Schoepenhoer, Plato, and many others along with the religious insights found in Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity. <br /> <br />The Matrix Trilogy could be watched a THOUSAND TIMES and would still reveal more truths and mysteries with each successive viewing. <br /> <br /> <br />My answer to those who try and compare the first film to the last two would be two-fold:  First, view the Trilogy as a WHOLE, and not as three separate films.  Only then will you realize that the answers to questions posed in the first film were not answered there, but rather, in the two subsequent films.  Second, if you are not up on your philosophy (shame on you for getting that USELESS and BOURGEOIS business degree), then go out and buy one of the three main books EXPLAINING the many meanings of the films (\\"The Matrix and Philosophy\\", \\"More Matrix and Philosophy\\", \\"Taking the Red Pill\\", etc.)   <br /> <br />If all you are seeing are the special effects and the gunplay, then you truly ARE trapped in a Matrix.  It's called IGNORANCE! <br /> <br />Educate yourself that you might enjoylife more fully!  WAY TO GO WACHOWSKI BROTHERS!
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Lord Of War is by far one of the best movies released in 2005.  Nicholas Cage & Ethan Hawk gave stellar performances and the story was very unique.  The movie is full of soliliquies reminiscent of \\"25th Hour\\" or \\"Rounders.\\"  The special effects are great and the introduction to the movie is very original.  This movie is well worth watching and is based on a true story so give it a try.
B000B0WODA|4.0|\\"Indie [Slang For Independent} Rock Is the Underbelly of  Rock.\\" said Meat Puppets front man Curt Kirkwood in the Mid Eighties, and while for the most part Indie rock has been shunned over the years since leading Indie rock groups like Pavement, Dinosaur Jr., and the Pixies have disbanded, in the year 2004 it suddenly became the new \\"it\\" music. With people like The Killers, Modest Mouse, and Interpol suddenly becoming major icons in modern music, it looks like Indie rock may have found its glory days. Of all of the indie rock \\"heroes\\" no one is more powerful than the modern Indie-rock Kings Franz Ferdinand, and with their sophomore effort they do nothing but back up their place in history as one of the most popular Indie rock bands of these past two decades. You Could Have It... opens with \\"The Fallen\\" a cheese-grater guitar shredding Funk Rock anthem about the wonders of Destruction N' Rock and Roll. Coming Shortly after \\"the Fallen\\" is \\"Do You Want To?\\"  the first single off of the album and one of their catchiest songs ever, all an ode to the wild party driven lifestyle the four boys from Glasgow, Scotland have had thrown at them after the success of their self- titled debut album. The Two Standout Tracks On the Album are \\"Walk Away\\", a bittersweet ode to rejection that could've easily been written by Burt Bacharach, and \\"You Could Have It So Much Better...\\" a pounding bass n' drums anthem about the sheer annoyance of Passive-Aggressive people. All In All, the album has only one weak spot (Hence the Four Star Rating) and that weakness is in the song \\"You're The Reason I'm Leaving\\" a sloppy, watered down virtual remake of the song before it \\"Evil and a Heathen.\\" The Days of Pavement being the Indie Rock Gods are long gone, and I doubt if the now bloated R.E.M. can ever take back the throne of the lords of the Underground, so to all of you fellow Indie rockers, take a step back, Franz is the new King.
0446343129|5.0|I just want to echo the fact that this book will definitely help you to understand the history of sugar and its real affect on the body in a way that will make you want to kick the habit! I am thrilled to have come upon this information.  For this I gave it 5 stars!!!  However, the author, seemingly a vegetarian Buddhist, is very angry in the writing of this book.  I can't say I blame him in a way, and yet, there is a lack of charity pervasive throughout the book.  Christian forgiveness could go along way here as an added bonus to improve mind, body and spirit to an even higher level. Also, I too am disappointed that he does not draw more upon the findings of Dr. Weston A Price.  I realize that Dufty aligns himself with more of an eastern mindset, but still...  The discussion of vegetable fats and meat are not explored properly -- Prices' findings, in fact, are ignored.  This doesn't seem all together honest. That being said, read the book for what IS said about SUGAR, the worlds number one killer!!!

Told from the point of a view of an autistic person, this book provides a perspective on life that provides a level of clarity that is astonishing.  It's like viewing civilization from outside the culture as an intelligent entity, but something different than human.  I wager those that buy it will be foisting it on their friends, and re-reading it through-out the years.
B00004ZD69|3.0|Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven is a good example of an album where concept ideas are far above their musical embodiment. There you have all the typical post-modern sound-art elements like radio sounds, ambient wrappings, atmospheric noises and even a tear-jerking story of an old man. You even have some truly soulful mininal violin passages together with the post-rock stamps like soft-loud-soft guitar crescendos. Add some strong songwriting and you have another Dark Side of the Moon! Unfortunately, the last element is the band's weakness. With all the above-mentioned post-modern aesthetics, the music itself remains quite flat and strictly one-dimensional.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen, it's a good time to be a comic book nerd. <br /> <br />With the recent renaissance in good comic book films (starting with Blade in 1998 and really kicking into high gear with X-men in 2000), fans of characters like Wolverine, Peter Parker, and now the Dark Knight, have finally been able to enjoy movies that treat their source material with almost unerring respect, and yet still manage to stand alone as solid entertainment. Batman Begins, directed by Memento and Insomnia's Christopher Nolan and written by comic book veteran David S. Goyer, is the best thing to happen to the character since Bruce W. Timm's animated re-imagining of Batman more than a decade ago. <br /> <br />Like other \\"comic book movies\\" in recent years, Batman Begins lives up to its title, telling the origin story of Gotham's tormented savior from the death of his parents to the \\"present day.\\" However, unlike Burton's boldly gothic world or the later, glitzier neon Batman incarnations, Nolan's live-action film places the story firmly in a recognizable reality, avoiding even the milder sci-fi trappings of the Spider-man and X-men films. Gotham City is not an evil-looking nest of fiersome gargoyles and gloomy cityscapes; it feels like a real american metropolis, albeit one that has obviously fallen on hard times. Economic depression has created street thugs of honest men and women, and the crime syndicates flourish while the powerful are too scared or too bribed to do anything. <br /> <br />All this changes when Bruce's parents are gunned down in an alley by a desperate man, leaving the grieving young boy alone in the world but for a childhood best friend, Racheal, and the family butler, Alfred. When robbed even of the chance to exact vengeance against his parents' murderer, Bruce Wayne abandons Gotham and his inheritance to disappear into the ciminal underworld, eventually ending up a prisoner in Asia. Here, a fateful meeting with Henry Ducard (Liam Neeson) and Ras Al Ghul (KenWatanabe) propels Bruce from his training as a member of the League of Shadows to donning the cape and cowl of the world's greatest detective. <br /> <br />The film's strengths lie not just in the refreshingly realistic sensibilites that the film uses to portray Begins' ihabitants (everything from corrupt city officials, bent cops, lone idealists, and cocksure kingpins manages to feel grandiose and familiar without coming off as overbearing or cliched), but also in the skill apparent in every frame of the film. The story is a very well-drawn tale that touches on Batman's complex but idealistic morality (something Burton's films forgot when it was time for Batman to break out the chainguns and bat-bombs), as well as creating credible villains. <br /> <br />For that matter, the entire world seems credible; Gotham doesn't look too much like any one city to be place (Chicago with multiple digital and practical enhancements plays the part), and everything from the stunts to the more outlandish technology never feels out of place in the film. The same can be said for the music; Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard collaberate to create a subtle yet very moving score that never tries to one-up or emulate Elfman's original. <br /> <br />However, perhaps the most impressive accolade the movie can claim is the cast. Christian Bale completely inhabits the dual role of Bruce Wayne/Batman with a feral strength and darkly ironic sensibility that never quite made it to the character in the previous live-action films. However, even more enjoyable is the supporting cast; Gary Oldman's Sgt. Gordon looks like he stepped right out of the pages of Batman: Year One, and is cast brilliantly against type as Batman's lone ally in the police force. Micheal Caine's Alfred is fraternal and likable enough for two roles, and Cillian Murphy's turn as Dr. Cane/The Scarecrow is so enjoyable that it's almost depressing that he is now unable to play the Joker in any future films. Tom Wilkinson, RutgerHauer and Morgan Freeman also turn in slightly smaller but no less memorable roles as allies and adversaries to Bruce and his alter ego. These are thesbians who could sleepwalk through their roles in the movie, and yet every one of them turns in a grade-A performance. <br /> <br />The film is a pure delight for comic book fans, and does a fantastic job of obtaining its own identity as a very good hi-tech action/adventure film. In fact, the only (very miniscule) flaws of the movie lie in the more action-packed segments. Fisticuffs are never shot from quite enough distance, limiting the view of the coreography and creating perhaps a bit too much \\"in your face\\" intensity and not enough of the grace of Batman's combat style. It works the first time we see the Dark Knight in action, as we see from the criminal point of view, and it's mean to be disorientating and frightening. But by the time the duel on the monorail rolls around, one starts to wish that the fights could have been filmed more like The Matrix and less like The Bourne Supremacy. <br /> <br />However, these are small complaints in an otherwise astonishingly good and refreshingly serious take on the genre; a movie that is its own film first and foremost, and just also happens to be about comic book characters while treating its source material with the utmost respect. <br /> <br />The DVD itself (the double-disk deluxe edition) is a fine investment, not only containing the film with an excellent video and audio transfer, but an entire second disk of bonus features on everything from the secrets of the special effects (you'll be surprised what was real and what was computer generated) to the genesis of the redesigned Batmobile (and some cute comic book easter eggs to boot). All in all, a spectacular addition to anyone's DVD collection, and an absolute must-have for every comic book and Batman fan.

B000085RTZ|5.0|Power Metal tends to be very one-dimensional.  That's not necessary a dig on the genre, but it irks me very much when musicians with so much talent play music tht is about chasing dragons.  A little of that is fine, but when it is every song on numerous releases, it gets old.  Whether is deserves it or not, the genre gets a really bad rap for the common subject matter, despite the music being very well-played. <br /> <br />That said, Kamelot does not belong in this category.  On 2003's \\"Epica,\\" they play music that is melodic metal falling somewhere in between Power and Progressive Metal.  The sound is closer to Power Metal, in that the track lengths are never very long, there are not huge instrumental passages, and the music is pretty straightforward in its arrangement.  But plenty of Progressive elements are here.  For one, \\"Epica\\" is a concept album in which the protagonist is losing his way in the world and signs a deal with the devil. <br /> <br />I don't know that the actual story in \\"Epica\\" is that exciting.  But it is the way in which Kamelot uses this story to construct songs about many basic human emotions and ideas - things like addiction, loss of faith, suicide, life after death - that is what makes Kamelot's songs interesting from a writing standpoint. <br /> <br />From a musical standpoint, \\"Epica\\" is nearly flawless.  All members of Kamelot are in top form.  Khan's vocals deserve all the praise they recieve in the other reviews on this page and then some.  Guitarist Thomas Youngblood's work is astounding, though never overshadowing the other band members.  The rhythm section is equally great.  No member is really given dominance in the music - Kamelot's ability to function as a coherent musical force is amazing.  They launch a flurry of sounds at their listeners that is simply magical. <br /> <br />The tracks will not be individually reviewed because none of them are weak in the slightest.  At the moment, \\"Center of the Universe\\" and \\"The Mourning After\\" are my favorites. <br /> <br />Ultimately, it is Kamelot's songwriting that places them above other Power Metal groups.  Their music is commanding and meaningful, demanding of the highest attention to detail. <br /> <br />It should be noted to the concept album enthusiast that the story depicted in this hour-long musical journey does not conclude.  The second half of it is told in Kamelot's 2005 release \\"The Black Halo,\\" which I have not reviewed because I think considerably less of it than I do \\"Epica.\\"
0316168815|5.0|Lovely Bones was such a powerful book. It's about a teenage girl who was murdered by her own neighbor and is now looking down from heaven watching her family move on with their lives.

B00020X88O|3.0|Paul Verhoeven and Joe Eszterhas did it again, some how they managed to take a great movie premise and go one step (maybe two) beyond \\"Good Taste\\"! What we have here in an updated version of 42nd St. Which in it's time (Pre code 1933) was almost as controversial as Showgirls is today. Elizabeth Berkley by the way is in the Ruby Keeler role. The major difference between the two films is Paul Verhoeven's unique ability to create \\"unlikable characters\\". Showgirls is as spectacular as it is over the top! Mind you I have \\"no\\" problem with the nudity and language when used to creative effect. Never the less watching Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls leaves you with the odd feeling that you really need to wash your hands.      Elizabeth Berkley is beautiful but is forced by the material to come off as a \\"Screaming Shrew\\"! Gina Gershon almost steals the show giving an interesting interpretation (very cat like) to the leading lady role (42 nd st, Dorothy Brock (Bebe Daniels)) who breaks a leg.      In short the Showgirls isn't as \\"bad\\" a Film as it is an \\"unlikable\\" Film. I find it best and most enjoyable to watch the film with the sound off.     About the \\"SHOWGIRLS VIP EDITION\\" it's different!   I'm not real sure why some novelities were included!  As some other reviewers have said \\"what were they thinking\\".  I guess if you get bored you could always break out the deck of cards. The Commentary by David Schmader is more bazaar than anything in the movie itself. Oprah Winfrey could not done a better job of straight \\"man-bashing\\".
B0009SS00A|1.0|This book has so many holes in the plot line, it will make you cringe if you know anything about Cryptography, software programming, or network security. The perceived hacker attacks that Dan Brown orchestrates are plain dumb. <br /> <br />Setting aside all that, his characters are also hard to relate to. The cheif of the NSA Cryptography who spent all his life working hard to get to where he is now, is willing to give up everything in an instant for a woman by murdering her fiance?.  Even more unbelievalbe is that this character choses for a password that girl's name.  Common! Head of NSA Crypto, uses the name of someone he knows as his password?  They teach a secretary at a paper factory not to do that. <br /> <br />After reading both Angels & Demons and Digital Fortress, I find a pattern that attributes the catastrophic failure of a great man to a crush on the hot, smart girl who is in love with someone else. I wonder if this stems from personal experience.

B00003CXTG|4.0|Yes, Ben Affleck actually did appear in a few good movies, and one of them is Pearl Harbor.  After reading through so many reviews posted on Amazon.com I have to say that the ratings for this film seem to be the most divided I've ever seen and I'm rather disappointed in the unfavorable ones.   <br /> <br />Why?  It's the reasons so many give for disapproving, attacking it for being too romantic instead of being a true war film and quibbling about a minor historical inaccuracy or two.  My words to the jeerers is that we're sorry if it wasn't the kind of film you wanted it to be so please don't insult those of us who watched it with an open mind and enjoyed it.   <br /> <br />About the historical inaccuracies, just remember the makers of BRAVEHEART took MAJOR liberties in totally rewriting the William Wallace story, but how many complaints did you hear?  Pearl Harbor is also criticized for being formulatic and predictable.  True perhaps, but does that automatically qualify the film as a waste of time?  For those who say the attack wasn't depicted horrifically enough, all I can say is that not all of us can bear to see the gritty realism of Saving Private Ryan all over again.  This film was designed for mass appeal after all, not mass disturbance.     <br /> <br />Indeed, Pearl Harbor succeeds on its own merits other than just the spectacular special effects.  Watch it and appreciate it for what it is (a love story in a historical wartime setting) and not for what you wanted it to be!

B00004SZWD|5.0|Blue Racer: I Love MTV is wrong about Stevie Wonder. Japanese Beetle: Serpent Son, this Stevie Wonder album came out in 1976 and was making music since the 1960s unlike Justin Maggotcake who wasn't born until 1981 and came out in 1998 with OuttaSync. Blue Racer: Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life is a classic which swept the Grammies in 1976. Japanese Beetle: Like I've said Serpent son, not all great music came from MTV. Blue Racer: Songs like Sir Duke, I Wish, Pastime Paradise and Village Ghetto Land showed that Stevie could write, sing and produce his own songs plus he can play keyboard, harmonica and drums(not bad for a man who cannot see). Japanese Beetle: If we see I Love MTV's next alias trash this I'll give him HAASAH(karate chop). Sayonara!

0131479415|5.0|Another amazing book by Mike Cohn! I'm a big fan of Mike's writing, and would recommend not only this book but an earlier one he wrote called \\"User Stories Applied.\\" Both books provide practical how-to advice for agile teams. As an agile consultant, I've often had people ask me where they can get more tactical books on how to implement agile or perform specific agile practices. \\"Agile Estimating and Planning\\" answers all those \\"how do I...\\" questions with detailed descriptions and plenty of examples. Cohn does a great job of explaining unit-less estimating, predictions and uncertainty, and communicating status and results.  And the way Mike writes, it all finally makes perfect sense! People are hungry for guides like this one that provide more direction, more examples, and helpful tips and techniques. Just as \\"User Stories Applied\\" is a must for anyone who wants to better understand how to write effective user stories, \\"Agile Estimating and Planning\\" is a must for anyone who wants to improve the way they plan their agile projects.
B000002H2Z|5.0|Though this is the premier Cure album for most....All Cure recordings are timeless.  As I listen to \\"Pornography\\" or \\"Faith\\" both still seem new and vibrant.  As \\"The Cure\\" progressed into the '90's they went from dark to somewhat bright with \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" (not a favorite of mine). IPrsonally prefer the darker, yet intriguing \\"Cure\\" of the early/mid to late 80's.  Push, Sinking, Screw, When the Baby Screams...all the best and most memorable tracks from The Cure!
0440237688|3.0|This is probably the most interesting book that I have ever read. Lois Lowry's story of the Community that is devoid of feeling and color takes you on a deep journey, but that journey grinds to an unsatisfying halt. Lowry claims that she wrote the ending of the Giver to be so vague because the book is so many different things to so many different people and that everyone has a different idea of how it should end. To me though, it just feels like she rushed to create the ending and is cheating us by not even offering a sequel. This novel had great potential, but the ending ruined it. A good author starts strong and ends strong and gives the reader something to take with them in the last few moments. Lois Lowry does neither of these things and that is the big disappointment.
B0006399FS|4.0|Some people like U2 when they where in love with America in the 1980's when they where on top of there game , or when they went experimental of Europeian elctronica of the 1990's and wern't afraid of taking risk. Some also like how U2 finally have progress to an awesome rock band that have grown wiser beyond their years. HTDAAB is an album that has touched a cord with everyone. \\"Vertigo\\" is an upbeat track that has brought out the youth in U2 while \\"Original of the Species\\" is the true gem of the album with Bono's lyrics at his best. Does this album desirve 5 grammy's? That is up to anyone to speculate. Acthung Baby is a better album than HTDAAB that was disappoting at the Grammy's . This is a great album that proves that U2 still has what it takes to be fresh and on top of there game. If this album drew a lot of cheers and critisims from people, I wonder what the response will be like when U2 creates and release their next album. How do you dismantle an atomic bomb? The answer, Love and Peace!
0804115613|5.0|The movie was great but the book was delightful. The movie leaves out many great characters and moments that are offered in the book and now feels a bit disappointing. Some people may find the back and forth writing of the novel to be confusing but it shouldn't be too much of a problem. The book allows you to go on journeys with Smokey and other characters and doesn't focus on Ruth and Idgie as much as the movie does. The male characters in the movie feel one dimensional but in the book Fannie Flagg does a better job developing them. The book was funny, touching, and sad, and makes me wish that I could go somewhere as great as Whistle Stop and meet the people there. If only there were people like Idgie and Ruth in our world...it would probably be a much sweeter place.
0316776963|5.0|I first heard about this book on NPR, but I didn't actually get around to buying it until now. Sorry I waited. Mordant, dry, hilarious--as you probably have heard by now.

B000A3DFZE|3.0|Three stars is average, right? This is an average cd: Good natured, consistent, in tune. Nothing that'll make you cry, nothing that'll make you scream. Perhaps it's fair to say we expect more from Clapton, but this has been part of his ebb and flow for quite a while. The man will be 61 years old in a minute,  has been in the public eye since he was 18, and essentially did every important thing he was ever going to do by the time he was 25!, (Yardbirds, Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Powerhouse Blues Band, Cream, Blind Faith, Delaney & Bonnie, Derek & the Dominos, Beatles/George Harrison, and the beginning solo career). So relax and get used to an old man sitting around making music. It's beginning to look like Clapton is the next in line behind the Rolling Stones for \\"Eternal Success\\": While his latest releases don't necessarily sell as well as newer artists , his tours always sell out major venues  worldwide. For Clapton, as with the Stones, the fans don't really need any new product, it's just something  to keep his foot in the door.
B00005JKGO|5.0|This surrealist picture is a magical mysterious tour around a bizarre world where the emotions have been lessened for the social conventionalisms, the double moral, the frivolity, epidemical visions, unresolved gilts, an easy going approach that do not seem to be so far of Rabelais or Moliere.<br /><br />One of the freest films in any age and a milestone reference picture. Another sublime artistic feat of Federico Fellini; these dilemmas, far from being diminishing, have been growing up, what it proves its magisterial precognition and penetrating sights in the social body.<br /><br />A must see!
B00000J7SS|5.0|Some of the reviews here sound like the first reviews Coltrane received for his quartet in the 60's and Ornette Coleman got for his 'free jazz'. It just goes to show no matter how far we advance people are still not willing to accept something that sounds different.. To say Bitches Brew is free jazz is a bit of a stretch - there are very clear melodic and harmonic schemes going on and what is created is at times very loose and spacey but never aimless or without direction. The argument that it is dated does not hold together very well either - there is simply nothing else to compare it with musically. Check out any fusion albums before or after it - totally different. Yes it may have a psycodelic sound at times - but I don't see the word psychodelic as having negative connotations.. Not many people put down Hendrix or the Doors for being psychodelic, nor do they call their music dated. I think maybe it is Miles' personality that people are turned off by - and yes he was a difficult man... so was Mingus and Monk..but these difficult people created beautiful music that we are still catching up with - resist the urge to be a curmudgin' and listen to the music.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Not everyone will like Sin City, but if you grew up reading Frank Miller comic books you might.  Or, if you are looking for something different to watch.  Sin City's landscape and cinematic appearance is well done.  It's kind of a cross between a black and white comic book and real actors...no not Roger Rabbit!  What really makes this movie great are the emotions and personalities of the characters.  You have really seedy bad guys and people that are in bad situtations who are at the end of their wit and have to do everything they can to survive.  I wished it had been a little longer but oh well.  I hope they make another one.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Wow, like, what an amazing science fiction masterpiece, huh?  Serenity is the collaboration of the hard work of Joss Whedon, who put together the Firefly series.  Serenity is packed with action and adventure.  I was really glad to see some things happen that helped say goodbye to the series.  The background is kind of a cross between Star Trek and Tombstone!!  I like Kailee and Wash they are my favorite characters by far.  Fun movie that keeps you wanting more!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam has compiled a lot of hit songs through their tenure.  With Lost Dogs, the fans are given a treat beyond belief; B-sides that are not filler tracks.  A great double CD set that covers thier long standing in the grunge music scene.  If you like them as much as I do I think you will love Lost Dogs.  Many of the songs I noticed are really hard edged and remind me of their earlier releases like Ten and Vs.  Other songs on here are also psychadelic and drifting.  I think a long time from now people will be talking about this band, and also this very dual CD set.  I wasn't a big overall Pearl Jam fan but Lost Dogs has me liking them more than ever.  I give it five stars for that reason.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I sat down and watched Firefly and then Serenity the past month.  I LOVED THEM.  I grew up and Star Wars fan.  Ever since the prequels let me down I find myself pointing at different things saying, \\"thats what episode 1,2,&3 needed!\\" The cowboy, the pirate.  FIREFLY is simply a great story with great characters.  I have been begging everyone I know to watch them, \\"you like Han Solo? --- you'll like Firefly.\\"  I can only hope that the makers of this story find a way to continue telling it.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Personally, I really enjoyed this CD. The music was a refreshing change from the usual and offered a new level of maturity that surprised me from such young artists. The lyrics were catchy, quirky and fun. I don't think that Panic! is a \\"rock\\", \\"emo\\" or \\"punk\\" band, but I've never enjoyed lumping music into stereotypes. Comparing -- in my opinion -- bands such as Metallica or Slayer to Panic! is utterly unfair, because their sound differs so drastically. And, in case someone's wondering, I like Metallica and Slayer both. Each song varied from one another, which was another thing that I liked. I'll be awaiting the next release, is all I can say.
0393317552|1.0|Diamond starts the book bashing The Bell Curve, saying that no variability in intelligence exists between the races, which is fine, if you're providing evidence to refute an arguement (he doesn't, it's all anecdotal).  He then goes on to discredit himself by declaring, in the last few pages of the first section, how much smarter New Guineans are than Europeans (not all other humans, but specifically Europeans, which by implication means that Europeans are dumber than all other human beings).  The rest of the book is like this.  Every chance he gets he notes the unexceptional achievements of the West.  It's all due to geography and absolutely, positively nothing else.  Not the scientific enquiry that Europeans invented, then perfected; not the idea of liberty, which no other society thought of, but an idea the West was kind enough to export; China, apparently, is a victim of geography, not a self-imposed oppression that chokes off anything that might challenge it's political leaders; the barbaric attrocities committed in Africa is due to geography, not ethnic hatred; and on and on.  Diamond is deafeningly silent on all these points.  In other words, culture, political systems, economic systems, nor anything other than geography, plays a role in the course of civilization's evolution.<br /><br />This, of course, is absurd because there are numerous counter examples of a society or city collapsing, only to have the same geographic location become a cultural, political, economic success because of the differences in culture, politics, and economics between the failed society and the successful one.<br /><br />His political correctness is so out of control that he actually uses [sic] when using a direct quote because the author of the quote had the audacity to use \\"man\\", instead of some gender neutral term.  Diamond would never be so insensitive to women as to use \\"man\\" when talking about mankind, probably another term Diamond wouldn't use because it's not gender neutral enough for him.  I have a vague recollection of some of the more interesting ideas in this book, but I can't really remember most of them, because I was so disgusted with his outrageous bias and political correctness.enough for him.

B0006L16N8|5.0|It wasn't hard to see why \\"X & Y\\" was one of the most hotly anticipated albums of 2005.  After the stratospheric success of their first two albums, nothing less could be expected.    But upon listening to the album, there is little to justify such excitement.  Yes, the album is good.  It is better than most of what was released in its time.  But it is not the sort of album that will be remembered years from now.     What, then, is the downfall of \\"X & Y\\"?  Ironically, it is the same thing that propelled Coldplay's first two albums to such success.  When I first heard \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" I had only one complaint: that the band had, rather than devising something original, simply released \\"Parachutes, Vol. 2.\\"  Luckily, the strength of such songs as \\"In My Place\\" and \\"Clocks\\" was able to make this album worth listening to.    On \\"X & Y,\\" Coldplay has decided to create a third volume to \\"Parachutes,\\" employing the exact same song structures and often borrowing melodies from their earlier successes.  Recognize that riff from \\"Speed of Sound?\\"  If not, perhaps you should listen to \\"Clocks\\" again.  While creating an excellent imitation of \\"Parachutes\\" worked marvelously for Coldplay on \\"Rush,\\" by \\"X & Y,\\" it is just a tired cliche that few will have patience for.    The one song on the album that truly shines is the one song in which Coldplay tries to create something new.  \\"Till Kingdom Come,\\" originally meant to be performed by the late Johnny Cash, truly steps out of the mold and gives its listeners a novel musical experience.  Sadly, the rest of this album cannot offer the same.  Perhaps Mr. Martin and his bandmates will see this as a lesson for their next album, and give us something that is not \\"Parachutes, Vol. 4.\\"
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Although this version is often called \\"too Hollywood-ized\\" I absolutely love it.  Rich girl Emma Woodhouse (Paltrow) feels very unsecure about life when her nanny, and best friend, gets married and has to move away. Emma doesn't really now who to talk to about her problems with her love life. Instead she tries to be a matchmaker for her friend Harriet (Collette). She tries to get her together with the nice young reverend Elton (Cumming), but it turns out he was only interested in Emma! Problems ahead for everyone involved.  After a slow first half-hour, the story got started and I found that this was actually a funny, smart and beautiful tale.<br /><br />During the last 20 minutes or so of the film, I had an \\"Ah ha!\\" moment when I realized that this movie was just like Clueless with Alicia Silverstone.  Is this better or worse than Clueless? It's difficult to decide. Interestingly, both lifestyles depicted seem just as distant from most people's - 1800 England and 1995 Beverly Hills. In both films, the dialogue sounds equally unfamiliar. Both are hilarious and charming, though Emma is the more subtle and touching film. Overall, I think Emma wins out.

0800177177|3.0|\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is one of those films that reeled people in by making its audience believe that it would be an intense horror film. Instead, director Francis Ford Coppola stayed more true to Stoker's novel and put a focus on an intense love story that transcends time, the elements and even life and death. This naturally turned off many horror enthusiasts who would rather see a film that thrives on shock value rather than a movie that thrives on heart, brains and emotion. The film is naturally about the titled character, an immortal man (played superbly by Gary Oldman) who has turned against God and now lives through the powers of darkness. By the late-19th Century, the titled character is trying to lure back a reincarnation of his one true love (Winona Ryder) and of course attempting to eliminate all those that might stand in his way (Ryder's fiance Keanu Reeves and professor Anthony Hopkins most notably). Overall \\"Dracula\\" is an amazingly good looking film that benefits from high production values and guaranteed performances (mainly from Oldman and Hopkins). Coppola's direction is strong, but a bit overbearing at times and sometimes it is unclear what the tone of the production truly is.

B00004W52U|5.0|I was recently introduced to Op Iv by a friend of mine. This album has been playing in my CD player non stop since then. The music is raw ska/punk at its finest. Hands down one of the best CD's ever by anyone. MUCH better than Rancid.
B000000W5L|5.0|While the Rolling Stones are known as one of the most popular and best rock bands of the 20th century for a number of their popular songs, this album seems to be often be disregarded, possibly because it has no big hit single, or one song that especially stands out on its own. For that reason, I think \\"Exile On Main Street\\" is the Stones finest accomplishment, a great blend of 18 completely unique songs. This 1972 release is looked at highly by critics though, landing the #7 spot on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Now, to review some of this great music.<br /><br />\\"Rocks Off\\" is an attention grabbing opener and certainly one of my favourites, using a surge of rock flavour while also blending in the sounds of horns. \\"Rip This Joint\\" is far more straightforward rock n' roll, short and sweet. \\"Shake Your Hips\\" adds a taste of blues to the album, in a fairly effective manner. \\"Casino Boogie\\" has a catchy guitar riff, and is lyrically strong. \\"Tumbling Dice\\" is probably the most popular song on here, with a catchy feel to it. \\"Torn And Frayed\\" has a very great, pure rock sound, with excellent instrumentation. \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" is one of my favourites on here, it is mix of folk and rock, with simply a great guitar strum. \\"Loving Cup\\" is another album highlight, with a beautiful chorus and great drums. \\"Happy\\" is in the similar vain of \\"Rocks Off\\", with a great, signature Stones rock n' roll sound and a catchy tune. \\"Ventilator Blues\\" certainly has that slower paced, bluesy feel to it through the lyrics and guitar riffs. \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\" is a less memorable song on the listing, but has its own unique qualities to it. \\"Let It Loose\\" is maybe the most musically impressive song on Exile, with beautiful instrumentation and also nice lyrics and a great vocal. \\"All Down The Line\\" has one of the best guitar riffs on the album in my opinion, and is an exceptional song. \\"Shine A Light\\" has a beautiful piano introduction, and has some of the best vocals on the album, with ensemble singing in the chorus. \\"Soul Survivor\\" goes back to the rock feel found scattered all across this album, and closes Exile out very well.<br /><br />Overall, I find \\"Exile On Main Street\\" incorporates all the tools that build a great rock album. The mix of sounds is impeccable, with an original, unique feel in each song, and a brilliant usage of many different genres. The instrumentation is excellent, with catchy guitar riffs, beautiful piano structures, and crisp drumming. Also lyrically, this album is very difficult to match, and Jagger has his vocals on the mark in every song. Highly recommended to all people who live and breathe rock n' roll, you should not die until you've at least heard this album once. As for Stones fans, this is more than essential, and to newcomers a great place to start.as some of the best vocals on the album, with ensemble singing in the chorus. \\"Soul Survivor\\" goes back to the rock feel found scattered all across this album, and closes Exile out very well. <br /> <br />Overall, I find \\"Exile On Main Street\\" incorporates all the tools that build a great rock album.

0752860313|5.0|This was a little gem of a book, several evolutionary steps away from the treacly psycho-babble of a self-help book.  It's really a series of simple lessons derived from the author's successes and (more often) failures, all linked with the not very touchy-feely theme of \\"get off your butt and get to work.\\"  The lessons apply to anything in life that requires risk, sacrifice, and creativity to accomplish.  Buy it.
0930289331|4.0|I'd have given this 5 stars, except I did not like Mazuchelli's art. Matter of taste, so I'll say no more other than I found it unappealing.      This is a dual story that is as much Jim Gordon as it is about Batman. Jim Gordon starts as a good cop transferring to Gotham after a mistake. Gordon won't muddy himself with the unethical behavior of the police department, nor will he ally himself with the Batman whom he considers a bad guy as well. Jim's black/white ethos slowly changes as he first beats a fellow police officer(after he himself was beaten), has at least the beginnings of an affair and comes to realize that maybe Batman isn't the one he should be against and comes to terms with allowing the Batman to do the work the police department cannot. Gordon's change and domestic story was the best part of the book.      On the Batman side we see the first incompetent gropings towards superherodom as Batman hits the streets, first in disguise, then in costume and generally gets his head handed to him by making mistakes. We also see how he inspires one Selina Kyle to become Catwoman.       Though Bruce's struggles are shown to the reader through internalized monologues more than Gordon's, it is still Gordon's struggle that takes over the story, and that is a strength rather than a weakness. It shows Gotham as an organic being, with the dirty cops, the mobs, the judges, the Batman, the D.A. and Jim Gordon reacting to one another and changing. Showing that not even Batman is big enough to effect the kind of change he wants on his own.
0375758992|5.0|If you have been to Africa, Alexandra Fuller's words will bring back to life all that your senses have experienced - the still, thick nights and choirs of morning movement, the enveloping smells, the stunning beauty and feel of the earth. And they will bring back the reality of poverty and inequality.  If you have not been so blessed to have been to Africa, Fuller will light your imagination with her words.  She will, perhaps more importantly, give you a glimpse into the life of an Anglo family in the midst of the southern countries' fight for independence and land reform.      Fuller speaks openly of the racism held tightly by the European farmers, farmers who for generations worked the land of today's Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe.  This racism runs strong in her own parents, and she portrays them with honesty and with love.   She gives an insight into a life I have long held my own bias against.      Fuller transports the reader on to the farm and into the bush, from her early childhood until marriage.  She speaks as a child would recall leaping into bed after a trip to the bathroom in the dark of night, lest there be monsters under her bed.  But her monsters were in the form of \\"terrorists\\".  She reflects as an adult, aware of the kinks in her own upbringing, the stark horrors of the times, and the beauty of the place.  She does this with wit, clarity, absence of sentimentality, and with love.    I began reading this book for a second time - the day I finished the first.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Except for the ending, I have few problems with the adaptaiton. Even these issues were slight, falling under the \\"not how I would have done it\\" category rather than the \\"what were they thinking?\\" heading. But then, a faithful translation would run far too long for a feature film (c.f. the A&E version, which runs to six hours). And in spite of the absence of Colin Firth, it was well-acted -- Keira Knightly's Elizabeth in particular. My only real issue with this adaptation, and the only thing in the way of a fourth star, is the complete elimination of Jane Austen's original ending in favor of one that is overly Hollywoodized.
B00004RF9I|5.0|\\"Network\\" still has a bite, although viewing it is like journeying in a time machine back to the 1970s--at the time when Jerry Ford was urging Americans to whip inflation now and the Vietnam war had just been lost. It was a time of malaise, although it would be several years before Jimmy Carter would come along to point this out. And then there was television--still almost entirely \\"over the air,\\" and ruled by three networks (Fox was still in the future). Paddy Chayevsky's Oscar-winning screenplay, a brilliant satire on the state of the broadcasting industry as it was in the middle of the decade, was expertly filmed by actor-friendly director Sidney Lumet, who teased signature performances out of Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch (also Oscar winners, as was Beatrice Straight for best supporting actress). It was a great concept. Finch, an alcoholic news anchor for the fictitious network, UBS, upon learning of his dismissal announces he will shoot himself on the air the following Tuesday. Dunaway, the programming Vice President, seizes on his breakdown and convinces corporate hatchet-man Robert Duvall to keep him on the air, over the objections of William Holden, Finch's friend and head of the news division.<br /><br />One night, Finch wanders into the studio in his pajamas, a raincoat over them, and urges his viewers, in the film's most famous scene, to open their windows and scream \\"We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more!\\" The ratings zoom. Soon, Finch is presiding over a news circus Dunaway has set up (it includes a psychic) that eerily anticipates on the one hand Oprah Winfrey and, on the other, the cable news screamfests then still more than two decades in the future.<br /><br />The film, with its visual trip into the past--with rotary phones on the executive desks, the clatter of news tickers in the background, the so not cable ready rabbit ears tv's always present--is still great fun. It was the last great cry of outrage about the loss of American innocence from the generation born before there were tv's in every house, and a lot of the bile is still relevant. The bile was apparently too much for the academy, too. While the film was nominated for best picture, it lost out to \\"Rocky.\\"<br /><br />Notes and asides: Apparently there are plans to remake the film, but how? If it is set back in the 1970s, where it belongs, the remake cannot possibly equal the original; if it is set in the present, it won't work. You might as well remake \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" with Jennifer Love Hewitt.rican innocence from the generation born before there were tv's in every house, and a lot of the bile is still relevant.

B00003CXBK|5.0|Miyazaki is wondeful. Princess Mononoke is just one of those experiences (and I do mean it's an experience) that transcends all praise, no matter how worthy. The word masterpiece comes to mind. EVERY FACET of this movie is excellently crafted and executed. The voice acting is marvelous, the animation sets standards, not just for animation, but for cinematography...the story is relevent, moving, and it sucks you in, enveloping you, and when you walk away from the screen, it stays with you. It haunts you in your dreams. The world in which our protagonists dwell is so soothing to the aesthetic palette, it almost makes one's heart ache with the knowledge that it does not exist in this world. It does, however, exist on this magical little polymer disc, in our minds, and in our hearts.

They HOOK you in and keep you coming back.  <br /> <br />Oddly enough, the polished and structured tracks have a powerful emotional content. It's likely the wonderful melodies and chord structures in these amazing songs that do the trick. Combined with these emotional songs, the rather bland lyrics work well; not too clever or tricky.  <br /> <br />I dare you to hear it once and not REMEMBER it!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This Strokes album is great, a bit different then the last two albums that the band made, but still great. What stands out on this album is the guitar solo's on such tracks as Vision Of Division, Ize Of The World, Electricityscape, and Heart In A Cage. That alone is worth the price for this album. So if you love The Strokes and want to hear something a little different from them and an album that takes the band to a new level then get this CD!
B000003S0P|4.0|As said by others, this IS one of the top ten's of progressive albums, certainly (I think) King Crimson's definitive. Their first album and \\"Lark's Tongue\\" have similar qualities, but this one rates up there because of the sheer brilliance of \\"Starless\\" and the title track. <br /> <br />I'm surprised the album doesn't have more crossover appeal, as it has some seriously heavy guitar work. I always say King Crimson is the closest thing to Black Sabbath in popular progressive rock. And, oddly enough, the songs are.... wait for it.... catchy! They certainly knew that riffs are the musical food on which we live!
0671027344|4.0|I picked this book up from the school library, because I needed something to read and I happened to find this, which is also on my book list. So anyways, I just wanted to pass the time before I got on to my other books, and when I started this book I was definitely not expecting it to be this good! I honestly really liked this book. It reminds me of some people I know, mostly the quiet ones. But this book is about a teenager who has trouble finding friends and misses his aunt, and so he finds real friends and realizes that he is special.<br /><br />The ending was strange, but otherwise this is really good.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This album is certainly something to own; it is an excellent place to \\"get to know\\" UFO as well. Some have said it IS the best live album ever recorded. I'd say it rivals the best and most famous live records from The Who, Frampton, Priest, Allmans, Hendrix, etc.  <br /> <br />The songwriting is amazing, and distilled to the very best cuts from their albums to date. The performance (whether it truly be one show or a compilation) is amazing. It SOUNDS live and raw, yet with the power and polish that few bands could achieve.  <br /> <br />I think this reissue is a must for fans, bu I do prefer the sound of the original version (now out of print). The new songs are a great addition, but the original song order (although not what the set really was) were editied so to make the BEST album possible. Either way, the music is stunning, worth a listen for anyone into 1970s hard rock. This IS as good as a live album gets...
B000E1YVZU|3.0|I bought the 2 cd soundtrack for Rent back in the '90s and wore out the disks.  I listened to it constantly, and still do.  I followed the journey of Rent from stage to screen with a mixed bag of emotions.  They got most of the original cast (GREAT!) Shooting on location in New York (Great!)  Chris Columbus, the same guy who directed Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone is directing this movie (Uh-Oh.)  But still there was some hope.  He did a decent enough job with the first two Harry Potter movies because he made it an extremely faithful adaptation.  Maybe he'd do the same here.  Then a PG-13 rating.  The soundtrack included some rather strong language and some songs with risque content which in this ultra conservative day, would have guaranteed it an \\"R.\\"<br /><br />Still I was cautiously optimistic that the movie would follow in the footsteps of other cinematic rock operas like \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Jesus Christ Superstar.\\"<br /><br />No such luck.<br /><br />For some reason they decided to set the first part of the movie in 1989, even though they refence several elements from the 90's, like \\"Thelma & Louise\\" for example.<br /><br />Then much of the songs has been switched to straight dialogue interrupted at times by a musical number.  Often this dialogue would bring the movie to a screeching halt, only to come alive again when the singing started.<br /><br />I have no complaints about any of the actors.  I thought they were all great, even if some were different from the original.<br /><br />My problem is that I wanted more singing.  I wanted Chris Columbus to be as faithful to the stage production of Rent as he was to the books of Harry Potter.  I would have been satisfied if he had just pointed a camera at the stage and let it run during a performance, just to keep all of the songs intact.<br /><br />Instead we have a movie that feels like it plays down the fact that it's a musical, that altered the subject matter to get a more family friendly rating, that, let's face it, sold out to the corporate interests that it pretended to criticize.'s face it, sold out to the corporate interests that it pretended to criticize.
B0009WFFS6|2.0|Whatever the case, they phoned this one in.<br /><br />Because of who they are however, this call has to be justified. Clapton, Bruce and Baker are all top-flight musicians and whatever they do, together or otherwise, isn't likely to be really bad. All three are simply too good at what they do for that to happen. Their reunion, as such, was far from bad. On a purely technical level what they played was rock solid.<br /><br />But it wasn't inspired. Nobody pushed anybody. Bruce and Baker laid a foundation and Clapton played off of it. Nothing more and nothing less. Bruce never made Baker play harder and neither of them gave Eric anything to really react to. Yes, they were solid. This gets two stars for that. But they were just going through the motions.<br /><br />Anyone looking for inspired playing shouldn't bother with this.
B00009P1O2|5.0|While they never lost their popularity in England, some may argue that Queen went into a mild slump in the early 1980s in the United States.   However when Queen performed at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in 1985, Queen clearly put themselves back on the map.   Their performance at Live Aid was nothing short of legendary.   Queen found themselves with a lot of momentum coming out of the Live Aid show.   This momentum would lead to a new Queen album, \\"A Kind of Magic\\" and a follow-up tour.   For that Tour, Queen decided to wrap the Tour up in England and decided to perform two shops at Wembley Stadium in July, 1986 (a year after Live Aid).  The shows were so big that a third one was added at Knebworth.  Little did fans know - that with Freddie Mercury's illness on the horizon, that this would be the last tour with the four main members of Queen.  It turns out that the second to last show (the last show performed at Wembley by Queen) would be filmed   The resulting film would be \\"Queen: Live at Wembley Stadium\\".   Thanks to DVD, we get not only the complete concert - but also plenty of bonus footage.  Queen succeeds in surpassing that legendary Live Aid performance by delivering a full concert.   This concert might just be one of the greatest ones ever recorded. <br /> <br />This is such a great concert, there isn't room to discuss everything on here.   Here are twelve \\"things to look for\\" on this concert.   These are in no particular order: <br /> <br />1.While Freddie Mercury is a brilliant vocalist, Roger Taylor really holds his own.  Not only does he deliver thundering drums throughout the concert - he is simply outstanding providing the main background vocals.   Taylor's performance on \\"Under Pressure\\" is going to make you forget that David Bowie would perform this song with Queen. <br /> <br />2. \\"A Kind of Magic\\" really surprised me.  This proved to be a great live song and this would to be the first (and only) tour Mercury would deliver the vocals.The Queen \\"balloons\\" flying in the air and throughout the stadium make for a great visual to compliment the performance. <br /> <br />3.I guess back in 1986 it was also a \\"trendy\\" thing to do an acoustic set.   Queen will perform \\"Love of My Life\\" and \\"Is This the World We Created?\\" in Acoustic. <br /> <br />4.Queen's tribute to the music of the 1950s and 1960s proves to be a nice change of pace.  This includes \\"(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care\\", \\"Hello Mary Lou(Goodbye Heart)\\", \\"Tutti Frutti\\", and a bit of \\"Gimme Some Lovin\\"    Perhaps the highlight of this set is how during \\"Tutti Frutti\\" they change from a more acoustic set to a harder rock set  - watch how Brian May will switch guitars.    I kind of wish Queen would have performed all of \\"Gimme Some Lovin\\" <br /> <br />5.\\"Radio Ga Ga\\" never disappoints me.  This might be one of the greatest songs ever performed live.   It was awesome at Live Aid because of how the crowd responded in-sync with the band.  Once again, the crowd at Wembley responds at a high level.    <br /> <br />6.At first I was a little bummed that Queen will use a pre-recorded version of the \\"Opera\\" section of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", but the way they use it actually works - and will make for one heck of a performance.     <br /> <br />7.Overall, it is going to be last nine songs that are going to be the highlight of this concert.   On the bonus DVD, Queen discusses how much attention they paid to ordering the songs.   I wouldn't have changed a thing. <br /> <br />8.Little did we also know that this concert would be the second to last time that Freddie Mercury would perform \\"We are the Champions\\" with Queen.  It is an emotional performance, especially when Mercury goes \\"I Thank You All\\" and the crowd responds.   Mercury, who is in mid-performance turns to the crowd and acknowledges them.  Watch how Mercury crosses his arms as he plays the piano during this song. <br /> <br />9.Brian May will also do the guitar switch during \\"Crazy Little ThingCalled Love\\".  Freddie Mercury will pick up a guitar for this song.   It's worth noting that on the Friday show, Freddie and Brian perform an even better guitar jam. <br /> <br />10.John Deacon - the Bass player is all business.  He's very underrated, but doesn't miss a beat during the show.   He shines during \\"Under Pressure\\" and \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\". <br /> <br />11.The bonus DVD discusses the use of Technology for the 2nd Wembley show.    The bonus DVD also contains highlights from the first show which was filmed as a test-drive for the main show.  That first show had less cameras and as a result doesn't have the same \\"in house\\" realism of the second concert. <br /> <br />12.Overall the Bonus DVD contains some great information:  As mentioned above, there are some highlights from the first show as well as some of the \\"behind the scenes\\" information about how the concert came together.  There are also some terrific interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor.  There is some raw home video of Queen rehearsing for the concert.   Queen also provides multi-angle features for \\"One Vision\\", \\"Under Pressure\\", \\"Now I'm Here\\", and \\"We are the Champions\\".   There are four angles - one focused on each member of the band.  This will provide a unique perspective for seeing the members perform these songs in action.  Perhaps the best part is the commentary provided on the tearing down of Wembley Stadium - great stuff. <br /> <br />Overall, this is simply an outstanding concert - and an outstanding video of the concert.  You will find yourself watching the concert and bonus material over and over again. This is clearly the gold standard for concert DVDs.  The only weak spot is I wish the enclosing booklet contained some written material about the concert.  This is a must for Queen and music fans.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Original in their art; fantastic music, modern, sensual, sexual, animalistic.  They are wonderful artists.  I really enjoy this compilation of Enigma's works.  Others try to copy what they do, but pale in comparison.  So happy to have them in my collection.  :)
B00006JJ1O|5.0|ok ive had this album now 3 years <br />and guess what  <br />it only gets better when they bring out there new one <br />as all the songs from both albums <br />are fantastic <br />i love the malchik gay one <br />on the 200kmh in the wrong lane <br />as its awesome <br /> <br />but if tatu keep up the good work <br />witch they have so <br />far <br />they will not get old with us <br />loveing there music <br />for all time <br />to come
0060765488|3.0|Unlike most of the rest of the world, I never read this series as a kid.  With the movie coming out, I thought I would take a look as an adult.  While the story is nice and there are some fantasy elements that would be appealing to kids, it seems odd to me to compare this book to epics like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, principally because there is just not much there.  The story is short and simple, the battles barely rate a couple of sentences of description, there is a bit of repetition, and the characters are fairly simply drawn.  Don't get me wrong:  I have no problem with the allegorical message or the story for what it is, but is is more akin to A Wrinkle in Time in terms of depth and detail than it is to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.  Thus, it is more likely to be appealing to younger kids than to those able to tackle more extensive and more complex reading material.  YA readers who like Narnia might also like Jean Rabe's The Finest Creation.
B000000WJZ|1.0|Despite all the rave, this is still just a piece of crap...in a cage?  The music is pretty dang good but the vocalist is beyond gay and always has been...let's not forget he's the guy who started Zwan...ZWAN for god's sake!!!  This man should not be revered as a rock legend...or ANYTHING to do with rock for that matter.  This is pure file 13 but the mass mind is too stupid to realize.
B0000CABJ1|3.0|With the countless Donna Summer compilations around, you would think that Universal would opt for a compilation that would give fans something more than what they already have. This compilation once again features the heavily cut versions of songs.  It's main attraction is the inclusion (on the Australian and UK edition only) of the hard to find single \\"Theme from the Deep\\".  Overall, the best part of this CD is the second disc which includes the 12 inch version of \\"Love to Love You Baby\\" which is great to have.  The other extended mixes on this disc are ok, although not sure why they included the patrick Cowley remix of \\"I feel love\\" over the original 12\\" mix.    My advice to anyone considering buying this, is to pass over this, and look at the more recent double CD titled \\"Donna Summer: Gold\\", it is truly amazing.  It contains longer versions of most of the key singles, and features the correct single version of \\"love to love you baby\\".  GOLD is worth every single penny ... and shows that record companies sometimes get it right.
B000BNX3B4|1.0|I usually try not to write negative reviews -- following my Mom's advice about not saying anything at all, blah, blah...But this movie is simply awful. And I write that it is awful not out of malice but out of disappointment. With such a stellar cast -- Diane Lane, John Cusack, Chris Plummer, Stockard Channing, Elizabeth Perkins -- you'd expect at least \\"watchable.\\" I do not blame the actors or the writer. I blame the directors, the producers, the editors and the Hollywood movie \\"machine\\" that lacks the courage to do something that is not formulaic and trite (and supported by a snappy soundtrack). It is easy to see how this movie got made, but unfathomable that it got made this way....
006072448X|5.0|This book is the horrific story of a boy who becomes a mass-murderer in his own high school.  It is well-written.  It is not a book I would have ever picked up on my own, but it was chosen for our monthly book-club selection by another member of our group. <br /> <br />The events in the book are so terrible that I wondered why the author wrote it.  As an American, and as a former teacher at Columbine High School (several years before the shooting) myself, the only reason I could see for the author writing this book is to assuage any guilt parents of a mass-murderer might feel.  The parents did everything right, but none of that made any difference. <br /> <br />I recall a play I read (in school), in the 1960's, called \\"The Bad Seed.\\"  It posed the question as to whether some children were just \\"born bad.\\"  This book causes the reader to reflect on the same question. <br /> <br />Aside from being about Kevin himself, the book is also about the husband and wife's relationship, and about Kevin's relationship with his mother.  <br /> <br />While I am giving this book five stars for being well-written, I can only recommend this book to two sorts of people:  a guilty-feeling parent who wonders where they went wrong, or anyone who strongly dislikes genre-fiction for their predictably satisfying endings.   <br />
B00009L1TA|3.0|There are so many twists and turns in this plot that the viewer is bound to end up with the moviegoer's version of whiplash. Without the admirable performances of Samuel Jackson and John Travolta, the labyrinthine turns of plot here might turn what at first promises to be an interesting story to dust, but the Jackson/Travolta team (not that they are on screen together...) and the riveting and plummy-voiced Giovanni Ribisi save the film from the trash-heap. In the end, though, the viewer is bound to feel that the makers of the movie had the advantage and the audience-members are merely the pawns in their hands.  <br /> <br />Also, except for one rather violent scene when the Connie Nielsen character draws a gun on Travolta (who says deadpan, \\"I guess that means 'no'\\"), the love interest in the movie basically goes nowhere. Too much of the female interest here comes simply from seeing women act as violent and macho as men can act -- not a very interesting portrayal of the ladies.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is incredible! It is definately now the most romantic drama! Kierra Knightly definately does a beautiful job of playing her part. Nothing can compare to this love story and I would reccomend it to teenage girls, any women, even men. This movie makes you cry and laugh. Pride and Prejudice definately deserves 5 stars, even 6! This movie comes out February 28, 2006 and I urge you to buy it. I can garuntee you that you will be pleased and love it! No  movie can even compare to it, it is so beautiuflly made. Pride and Prejudice is 2 thumbs up with out a doubt!
B000BHHVPO|3.0|Yes it is!  I can't believe the packaging is wrong. If you were waiting like me since it was listed as as full frame wait no further, it is full 16x9 transfer!  You can't ask for better video quality!  I would have given it 5 stars if the whole Green Day set was included, but its not.
B00002Z88D|5.0|EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE BOYS STRUCK GOLD WITH THIS CD.I CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT. ITS JUST A BRILLIANT PIECE OF WORK. THEY ARE GODS............GODS. THE DVD IS EXCELLENT TOO. CRANK IT UP!!!!!!!
B00005JLCI|5.0|What is arguably the definitive movie version \\"Hamlet\\" since Olivier's hasn't yet been released on DVD?  What?  Am I missing something? This lack is inexcusable, especially for teachers of British Literature, who for the past decade have only been able to refer absently to this breathtaking movie.<br /><br />Update: the DVD is alleged to be in the works for a 10th<br />anniversary release this year (2006). TEN years to DVD.  Well, hopefully \\"Walker, Texas Ranger\\" is on a tighter schedule.
B0006399FS|5.0|It sometimes takes a bit of time for some to discover the true beauty of this Album.  <br />Maybe you even have to listen to it for a week or even longer but as soon as you really get into all the tracks you'll discover a truly mature and magnificent world of sound.  <br />I can easily listen to it over and over again.  <br />The Songs grow and grow. Truly amazing. <br /> <br />Raw emotions, Bonos intense lyrics, the extrordinary guitar riffs of The Edge, Adams subtle bass and Larry's unique drumming style create more than just music; They make you feel... <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|This movie is ridiculous!  Although visually pleasing, this movie fails to develop any of the characters and plods along like a bad high-school production.  The drama of the story is completely lost and the sentiment of the film is not true to Jane Austen's novel.  All of the characters are dull stereotypes and the acting by Keira Knightly is laughable to say the least.  She is not capable to conveying the wit, passion, and complexity of Elizabeth Bennett.   <br />See this movie if you must but don't expect it to replace the Colin Firth version by BBC
B00005JO1Y|5.0|King Kong is the greatest moveis of all time!! My mom said that she perfered the 'original' one, yah rigth!! It has ausome footage and great computer images to boot! My two favorite parts is when they all fall down that big hloe and all those bugs come out and try to eat them(that was very discusting, gross, and nasty by the way), and when Kong saves the girl from all those T-Rexses, now that was sweet!!!
0517053616|3.0|As my review states, this rating has noithing to do with the writer. I would never say a thing about his brilliant works, which I admire and adore. I feel the book is low quality, and there is a lack of foot notes. I own other volumes of his works and I've never seen something as this before. Shocked yes I am.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Doggystyle, The Chronic, and All Eyez on Me are probably the most popular west coast rap albums of all time. Are they the best? Not in my opinion. But nevertheless, I have to give them props. Why? They paved the way, set the precedent from which everyone else built off of. Were it not for Dr. Dre and Snoop, my favorite style of rap, G Funk, never would've caught fire. Doggystyle is the best of the most popular, I think, improving where Dre fell short. Here we have an instance of the student surpassing his teacher. Snoop's just a better rapper. Dre is hard and serious. Snoop is jovial, funny and smooth...as smooth as the outstanding funk samples.  The music and rapping come together seamlessly.  <br /> <br />My favorite song on Doggystyle is \\"G Funk Intro.\\" It's the best intro of any album of any genre I've ever heard. The 2nd classic is \\"Who Am I?\\" Both sample portions of George Clinton's \\"Not Just Knee Deep\\" and yet the two songs sound quite different. Just a testament to Dre's production skills. The third classic is \\"Doggy Dog World,\\" featuring Tha Dogg Pound and The Dramatics doing the croon hook. Besides these 3, Gin and Juice of course is great, but slightly overrated. Ain't No Fun is the apex of pimp anthems and Gz and Hustlas has a thunderous baseline that few songs can match. Each of these near classics, I'd rank 8/10. The quality finally drops. \\"Pump Pump\\" and \\"Serial Killa\\" land under this category. But still, I'd hardly call them bad . The only song I never listen to on this album is \\"La Di Da Di.\\" Just never liked it. <br /> <br />It's tough to write a review about something this hyped. Especially since, all in all, it delivers. You can always write more when something's bad, or disappoints. Unfortunately for this review, fortunately for those who buy this, Doggystyle is just that good. Dre made g funk. Snoop was made FOR g funk. Together, they churned out an album that stands as one of the greats in any category in which it falls.  <br />
B000089RVX|1.0|I have no idea why the hell people actually like this garbage. This is complete crap, and this band might have some of WORST musicians I have ever heard. (besides Blink 182) The only thing they have going for them was a decent lead singer, and if she was smart she would dump these losers and go solo, and maybe she might have a shot of leading a decent rock band. I am glad to see that since 2002, they have managed to release one album, and one album of Live material from this album..WTF????? Face it people, this bands 15min of fame is over, and if you are giving this over 3 stars, you might want to take some classes on music theroy. Stop giving sell out MTV created artist your money, and start supporting other musical artist that deserve more then your 30bucks for a version of this..and OH...a LIVE version of more of the same crap....GOOD GRIEF!!
0393317552|3.0|Overall this was an enjoyable book to read and I'd recommend to anyone interested in History-Prehistory-Anthropology themed books. <br /> <br />While Diamond tends to repeat himself often and does inject a little too much \\"political correctness\\" (as mentioned in the spotlight reviews) his hypotheses are very interesting. Certainly geography plays a role in the development of civilization and his analysis of the interactions between geography, human development, agriculture, animal husbandry and disease is brilliant.  <br /> <br />Diamond logically and eloquently explains why the Incas and Aztecs were wiped out by European disease yet he does not explain why the Incas who were as mathematically adept as any culture on the planet had only achieved Stone Age technology despite adequate natural resources. While along the same time line in a span of 400 years 1000-1400 a.d. Europe went from the Dark Age to world dominance. At the same time China developed gunpowder but Europe discovered guns, why did China not overtake the west? Genghis Khan almost did it with horses, should not gun powder be the ultimate weapon for the Chinese? <br /> <br />I think it is important to consider the relationship between humans adapting to its environment, and the environment adapting to humans. It is within this `give and take' milieu gestating over 1000's of years which lead to the development of unique cultures and civilizations. To discover why `civilizations clash' is perhaps left to other so named texts. Yes geography plays a role in the development of culture and society but it is not the sole factor. Diamonds book is an important text but it does not stand alone. One must read more...much more, to develop an appreciation and understand for any possible definitive meaning of and purpose for our existence on this planet. <br />
B00000DFSK|5.0|One of the best of album's I've ever heard. No wonder, the decade 80-90 was their most succestfull time and they wrote excellent songs for more than one \\"best of\\". It was difficult to decide, which songs don't appear on this \\"best of\\". Which other band has such problems :-)? <br />By the way, who is Mariah Carey? A lot of boring songs! When we hear a song from her on the radio, my three-year-old song said: <br />Daddy, please turn the radio off!
B00005JOQ9|1.0|Only by scratching my head and squinting my eyes can I remember sitting through \\"Cabin Fever,\\" which marked writer/director Eli Roth's film debut, and just barely can I remember the movie itself. I remember being entertained by it, but it just wasn't good enough. I decided to give Eli Roth a second chance if he ever made another film, and now he has, if you want to conisder \\"Hostel\\" a film. I'd like to think of it is a heartless, brutal melting pot of the different methods of grisly torture one could inflict on another human being. I am ashamed that I ever saw it.    Exactly what Quentin Tarantino, one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, saw in Eli Roth during his first runaround, much less his sophomore effort, is a mystery. But that's not the biggest mystery. Roth has quickly dropped from an exceptional filmmaker to Uwe Boll lousiness in only one film. God knows what his third film will be like. If it is anything resembling \\"Hostel\\" then you should save your ticket money and purchase it some time later when you stumble accross it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart.     Roth apparently fancies himself a horror film director. Well, I've got news for him. Scenes depicting bound victims having holes drilled in their flesh, their appendages torn off with chainsaws, and their eyes plucked out are not scary, but are instead the disturbing masterworks of a director who could use a little psychiatric care and a happy pill or two. And anyone who finds them entertaining should join the director in a group therapy session. I'm sure they are the same individuals who were mesmerized by last year's similar motion pictures (\\"The Devil's Rejects\\" and \\"Wolf Creek\\").    I paused after finishing the previous paragraph and thought for a moment. Why are films whose central themes include torture, rape, and sadism being made? And who could possibly find them entertaining? I suppose knuckleheaded filmmakers are just all too eager to cash in on garbage to make other garbage films. Turning disgusting content into a profit is a greater crime than what happened with Enron. Films that are gratuitous in senseless violence, vulgar brutality, and nihilism should stay in the sick minds of the people who write them.     Let's just say I'm glad that Roth has chosen to direct these kinds of films, because the material skills in his head will never be able to muster Oscar material. Without waisting much more time discussing the film, I will say that it is almost unbearably violent, disturbing, dark, ugly, mean, and terrible. In his review of last year's \\"Chaos,\\" unseen by me, film critic Roger Ebert wrote \\"Why do we need this s**t?\\" quoting another film critic by the name of Ed Gonzalez. One can ask the same question about \\"Hostel,\\" and I can go even further and label it as a middle finger to the face of cinema. - Isaac    Rated R; 96 minutes; Directed by Eli Roth
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|Seems like the best are just too good for this world.  Iwas really waiting for his Donuts and many other collaborations.  His beat style would have been perfect with groups Like Lil Brother, Jean Grea, and others...Vol 1 Fantastic was a classic and that style would have fit many as our golden era is beginning to resurface.   <br /> <br />On Donuts...well Dilla this album was str8 bananas!  Hopefully true heads will carry on your legacy.  Too much garbage in hip hop right now.   One Luv Dilla  RIP
B0007GAEW6|4.0|After falling in love with Deloused in the Comatarium, I decided to embark on Frances the Mute, expecting the sameness. But Frances the Mute is so much more complex and overwhelmingly long compared to Deloused. I have listened to Frances many times and it is kind of losing interest. Even though I absolutely love TMV, I think they couldve done a better job here, maybe if they were high it couldve been more enjoyable. There are just too many long periods of nothingness, some are unique and neccessary, but they couldve cut it down a little bit. This album definately isnt for everyone, you need to listen to this many times to truly get anything out of it. I suggest anyone new to TMV to buy Deloused instead or before you buy this CD to get a good feel of how TMV's music is. <br />I do like how Flea plays the trumpet on here though, a very unique addition to the album.
0399230033|5.0|My daughter loves this book and I love reading it. A story of a kind zookeeper family and the animals they look after, perhaps its the animals which look after the zookeepers.  The illustrations are the book, for they tell the story with minimal dialogue. The richness in detail of the illustrations is especially enjoyable. My daughter has not picked up the detail yet, but I appreciate them as I read. Examples; follow the balloon...how many children are watching in the window...color of the keys and cages...and what kind of dolls do the animals play with? As your child grows older, Goodnight Gorilla will entertain them with new pleasures.
B0006399FS|5.0|Thank you for this album. Almost every song is very good, that's the biggest difference to a lot of other artists. They often have one or two smash-hits and the rest of the album is very disappointing. Not so U2! Thank you again.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|From the Abba reminiscent tune of Hung Up to the Marmite-esque, Like It Or Not.... This album proves to be a great Madonna album as we see her doing what she does best... <br /> <br />The album starts off with the dancefloor killer (not in that sense) Hung Up. The fusion of the disco beats and the Abba sample proves that this song will be played for years to come... <br /> <br />Then we merge into the the next track, Get Together. This is a smooth, trance tune, which is relaxing and also groovy at the same time. The other thing is that the whole album merges into one big track... that's good because you don't have to have frequent gaps (I hate that). <br /> <br />Then we go into the next single, Sorry. This is a good funky track where Madonna says 'Sorry' in several different languages. The song is very smooth like Get Together but has that dancey feel like Hung Up... <br /> <br />Future Lovers, when I first heard it... I thought it sounded a lot like Ray Of Light. I don't know why... I just did! It's very funky and very dancy... But the extended talking about coming with her get a bit annoying after a while... but still a great track!!! Should be a single. <br /> <br />The merge into Future Lovers/ I Love NY is one of the best on the album. The others are... Forbidden Love/Jump, and Issac/ Push... I Love New York is very good and remind you of waking up in NY on a monday morning and eating breakfast. Lyrics are a bit cheesy though.... 'Just go to Texas.. Isn't that where they golf?' <br /> <br />Let it will be is not one of my favourite tracks. Doesn't really do it for me...sorry! <br /> <br />Forbidden Love is really funky even though it sounds like a ballad. One of my favourite songs on the album.  <br /> <br />Jump is the best song on the album for me. It's unarguably great! The beep-ba-beep beat reminds me of the Scissor Sisters' version of Comfortably Numb. The beat is great... Lyrics too... <br /> <br />After this track, the album starts to go a bit downhill..Don't really like How High and Isaac... But Push is great... Like it or not isn't.  <br /> <br />There are some extra bonus tracks though on some editons of the alb... Fighting Spirit soounds like it should've been on the American Life album... it's still a brill track though!!! <br /> <br />Superpop is the extra rare track (apparently). I don't really know why it didn't make it onto the final album though because this track is just ab fab!!! It does remind me of Jump.... so it is cool!!! <br /> <br />Overall, the album is absolutely brilliant. The highs are Jump, Get Together, Forbidden Love, Hung Up and Future Lovers. Lows are Like It Or Not, Isaac and How High. But these lows don't stop this Madonna album being one of the best one's she's done!
B000002BYD|5.0|Out of all the Pearl Jam albums, this one comes in second behind, of course, Ten. Yield just has such a more mature sound for the band, it shows that they can still rock with Do the Evolution and it shows a softer side with songs like Wishlist and Given To Fly. Given To Fly and In Hiding are my favorite songs from the album, I even have Given to Fly as my ringtone, it just has such a beautiful sound and feeling to it. If you dont have Yield I dont know what is taking you so long to get it.
0812550706|5.0|You know those boks that you just can't seem to put down? Well, this book is one of those. Not only is it gives insight into what the future of Earth may be like, but Orson Scott Card sets up an unique political and military system for \\"Earth.\\" <br /> <br />One aspect of this book is the future of the Earth. Encountering alien life forms is very possible due to the space exploration and technology that we have today. Card's view on these encounters in Ender's Game is one opinion on whether it will be peaceful or not. It makes for a great story. In addition, Card's future world is very interesting. His ideas of future technology and lifestyles create a great mood. <br /> <br />Another aspect that makes this book great is his unique system of government and military. The government runs the whole show much like it does now. However, there is limit on the amount of children that can be produced. In addition, the government can request a couple to produce a child for the government's needs. This was the case with Ender. The military is also different from today's in many ways. One is their new technology and how battles are fought in space. Also, the military has its own space station where children are trained and brainwashed for the military's needs. These two aspects of this book make it very unique. <br /> <br />This is very interesting due to the many distinctive viewpoints and aspects. These viewpoint and aspects include the views on the future of humanity, the military and political system, and the future lifestyles. Overall, I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes science-fiction or fantasy.
B000068CNX|5.0|Season one was great, but this season was even better. <br /> <br />The building tension between Ross and Rachel until \\"The One With The Prom Video\\".  Then soon after the main focus becomes the risk of Joey and Chandler losing their friendship when Joey moves out for a better place. <br /> <br />This season started with Rachel being extremely jelous of Julie (Ross' new girlfriend), then them dating for one day until Rachel finds a list of pros and cons about her and Julie.  <br /> <br />Then Ross desperately trying to get Rachel back until she views an old home video of Ross planning to ask Rachel to the prom, she is flattered by the video, and they get together. <br /> <br />Joey and Chandler were at a height in this season, with the ups and downs of their friendship, and Joey's period of stardom as Dr. Drake Ramoray of Days of Our Lives. <br /> <br />With those two things aside, there were also many short side plots in this season, Carol and Susan's wedding, Phoebe's gay husband, money, breast milk, wierd roommates, job searches, babys left on bus's, and Monkey's in movies. <br /> <br />Here comes the list of episodes in the order that I like them. <br /> <br />The One Where Eddie Won't Go <br />The One Where Ross Finds Out <br />The One With The Chicken Pox <br />The One After The Superbowl <br />The One With The Bullies <br />The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know <br />The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies <br />The One With The Prom Video <br />The One Where Joey Moves Out <br />The One Where Eddie Moves In <br />The One Where Heckles Dies <br />The One With The Baby On A Bus <br />The One With Five Steaks and an Eggplant <br />The One Where Old Yeller Dies <br />The One With The Breast Milk <br />The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding <br />The One With Russ <br />The One With The Lesbian Wedding <br />The One With Ross' New Girlfriend <br />The One With The List <br />The One With Phoebe's Husband <br />The One With Phoebe's Dad <br />The One With Two Parties

Toro: To give the gringo 1-star reviewers a history lesson London Calling came out in 1979 but doesn't sound old. Pancho: Si Toro, Songs like its title cut, Clampdown, The Guns of Brixton and Train in Vain are still classics today. Toro: Joe Strummer and Mick Jones have more talent than those dirty senoritas Mariah Scarey and Kelly Redneck Clarkson. Pancho: Toro, the guys in The Clash owuld have kicked the gringos in Green Day upside the head. Toro and Pancho say BAMINOS to the record store and buy now. Gracias.
0440241588|4.0|Hi, my name is Joe and I'm a sucker for John Grisham novels.  Hi Joe!!!!.....   Whew, that's over with.  Now on the review. <br /> <br />This is the latest installment in the two-word-title-first-word-The department for John Grisham, meaning that it has something to do with lawyers.  In a bit of bait and switch, however, the book has very little do with lawyers, except that the main character used to be a lawyer and a partner in a DC law firm known for its high powered lobbying business.  Otherwise, this is Clancy-lite: little or no profanity, a tarnished hero, and less than believable techno-speak (by the author's own admission). <br /> <br />All that said, it is a compelling and fun read and has the added advantage of an Italian travel guide and language primer.  In fact, the book made me wish I was travelling to Italy, just so I could practice what I've learned before I forget it. <br /> <br />No doubt most of the critiques you will read of this book are accurate, but if you are an incurable Grisham fan you will not be disappointed.
B000089RVX|4.0|This is a pretty good CD.  The only negative thing about it was that the way that it started out, I would have expected the whole CD to be a bit heavier.  The first two songs were a bit on the heavy side, but then it seemed to get progressively softer as it wound down.  The last couple of tracks make up for it though, and if you are a fan of a bit lighter music at times and don't want the whole CD heavy, than this is definitely for you, I just prefer harder music all the way through.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Now in my rap dictionary, this is probably the best Cd from any other Wu-Tang solo artist. Like hus name, GZA is a pure Genius when it comes to making a solid CD like \\"Liquid Swords\\". I can go through evry song on here, and not skip one track. Thats how much I liked it. No matter what genre of music you enjoy, you can appreciate it. You will never find a group and artits liek Wu-Tang Clan and GZA. This CD just shows how much better music was back in the early 90's and mid 90's. The next time you are looking for a classic Cd's by oen of the Wu-Tang members, and you dont have this Cd, tehn by it. You will be amazed of how well done this Cd was. There will never be one like it, ever again.<br /><br />peace
0393307050|3.0|It is difficult to be critical of a novel and of a series that one knows to be as popular and beloved as Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin novels. I read \\"The Far Side of the World\\" a while back; was given the book as a gift so started the series out of order. I had several issues with the construction of that novel, as well as the quality and clarity of the storytelling, but I had hoped that if I went to the beginning of the series with \\"Master and Commander\\", I would find that the issues with which I had struggled in \\"The Far Side of the World\\" would be corrected.<br /><br />They were not.<br /><br />While giving Patrick O'Brian full credit and compliment for the accuracy of his settings and vernacular, these books are simply incomprehensible to me. At no point in either book have I been able to follow the story; O'Brian jumps from scene to scene with impunity, lacing the narrative with so much antique language and jargon that I could go through page after page and have absolutely no idea what I had just read. Obviously, many readers do not have this problem with O'Brian. The secret of their comprehension would be a valuable trait to have published someplace publicly for those of us who just can't seem to get it. In the meantime, I will have to take a pass on any further O'Brian novels.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I stumbled upon Grey's Anatomy quite accidentally. I don't usually like hospital dramas at all, but one sunday night at 10 I was flipping channels and there it was. And as I began to watch, I quickly fell in love. Now, not only am I absolutely addicted to it, and is it my favorite show, but I find myself looking forward to the end of the weekend just to watch it. I tape every episode to rewatch them. I love the development of characters and the chemistry between Meredith and Derek is amazing. The writers of Grey's never disappoint, and I strongly recommend watching (sunday nights at 10 on ABC) and buying this.
0131479415|5.0|Better planning, as Mary Poppendieck (author of \\"Lean Software Development\\") points out, results in a higher standard of living for the individual, for the team, and for the organization. With  \\"Agile Estimating and Planning\\", Mike Cohn delivers a beautifully pragmatic approach for pushing us into the notion that this higher standard of living is completely attainable for our software development projects in this lifetime.   <br /> <br />Mike's earlier book, \\"User Stories Applied\\" has been one of my most cited books when working with teams new to agile software development. Understanding the usefulness of the story concept as  the base unit of function delivery has put these new teams in a good steady stride for being realiably realistic about their work delivery toward feature completion. <br /> <br />With Mike's \\"AE&P\\", I now have a fully referenceable guide that moves the team story planning pragmatics to the next level: bringing multiple planning approaches to bear at multiple levels  for multiple measures of software feature acceptance and completion. In his usual style, Mike delivers his guidance with wonderfully accessible non-software analogies. For example, \\"How long is a football game?\\" and \\"How long will it take me to move my pile of dirt?\\" for understanding the distinction between effort (or ideal hours/days)and duration (total calendar hours/days). These simple mental models set the stage for ruthlessly correcting the many misunderstood atrributes of planning and its life partner estimating. Having shattered the myths of task-based Gantt Charts, PERT charts, and Work Breakdown Structures as completely repeatable prediction models for planning and estimation, Mike rebuilds the planning toolbox with practices that truly work. He buoys his practices (such as Planning Poker and frequent replanning) with the de rigueur reinforcements of appropriate metrics (e.g. how many tests did we complete in the last iteration, how many story points did we complete in our worst iteration, how are we tracking today with our estimates of what is left to do) that really guide teams in how to steadily improve their planning acumen. <br /> <br />Because my passion in agile software development has focused more and more on the importance of participatory decision-making in order to make planning commitments stick, I am particularly grateful that Mike sets a high collaborative bar with regard to how team's must work in order to create effective and actionable plans.  Guidance on collaboration, high visibility, and continuous inspection are woven into all the practices in Mike's book, start to finish. <br /> <br />If I can leave you with only one piece of advice from \\"AE&P\\", take Mike's \\"Dozen Guidelines for Agile Estimating and Planning\\" (Chapter 22) and nail them to your team's door. In fact, nail them to your business partner or product manager's door. If you allowed me a second piece of advice: read through his excellent case study that follows in Chapter 23. And then, if you forgave me one final piece of advice: be prepared to start enjoying your new standard of living.
0790731479|5.0|awesome<br /><br />I've been watching Beatlejuice for as long as i can remember. ive seen it so many times its now easy for me to quote lines. this is a great humorous movie that will forever and always be even better the more times i watch it. definately a classic.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is ghoulishly funny in this wonderful blend of horror and humor. Enjoyable family viewing on a Halloween night. Invite the neighborhood goblins over.
B000001ED1|5.0|Joan Osborne is the real deal and she has it all: a voice from heaven and songwriting abilities that are unmatched. This CD covers an amazing range of styles and messages, and you'd think five different women performed here. Her work is smart and sexy, and she doesn't enjoy nearly the fame and respect she deserves. Relish is a relevation. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen her in \\"Standing in the Shadows of Motown\\", put that movie on your hit list.
B00004W48G|5.0|Strongly suggest this movie to everybody. The character is so fascinating, very athypical and sensible, sometimes even weird. He had never put his feet on earth, literally, he always lived on board the ship.  <br /> <br />The story is very original and unpredictable with great features. Supporting actors are also superb, the trumpet player is fun to watch, and how can i not mention the rival pianist - awesome. my best shot is when he lights his cigarette with the hot piano chords. <br /> <br />(still can't believe it that i'm the first person reviewing this movie) <br /> <br />I've already watched it some 6 times and I always look forward for the next opportunity.
B000683VI4|4.0|Truly Amazing<br /><br />There is much more chemistry between the older couple than the younger couple, but the chemistry is still there, and that's very important if you want to make a succesful romance movie. All the actors and actresses do an oustanding job in the movie. I cried at the end, its very touching at the end. Deffinately a good movie and I recommend it for ages 13 and up. There are some scenes that are a little much for a PG-13, but its not too bad. This love story is very original and though it is different from the book by Sparks, it was only changed to make the movie better. It's a remarkable story and I hope you all enjoy it! Hey, just make the guys go watch football somewhere else so you girls can relax and watch this movie!
B00000DFSK|5.0|I am on top of the world that a group as hugely talented as U2 got so many awards which they richly deserved.This great compilation features most of their big hits from the 80's like WITH OR WITHOUT YOU and WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME.No collection will be complete without this superb collection.highly recommended.five stars.
0316236535|5.0|I love this book.  I am an early intervention teacher and children absolutely look this book.  They love how the parts of the face appear and disappear page by page and they love to read along.  Excellent for kids with language delays.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Hilarious!!!<br /><br />Being the Coldplay addict that I am, I originally only wanted to see Shaun of the Dead because I knew that Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland were making a cameo in it somewhere. But three minutes into it, I forgot all about that because I was laughing so much. Very entertaining film. I've seen it six times already. There's comedy in the smallest of things, is that the definition of British humor? Because if that's so, I'm just one of the few Americans who understand it. You should certainly watch this flick if you're looking for a dose of non-stop comedy, drama,and horror rolled all into one. Also if you have a good sense of humor.
B000007492|5.0|Supertramp happen to be amongst my favourite groups and are like immensely in 2006 as they were in the eighties.This contains most of their big hits like THE LOGICAL SONG,BREAKFAST IN AMERICA and TAKE THE LONG WAY HOME.No collection will be complete without this jewel.five stars.
B00005JOFO|4.0|Sorry Brokeback Mountain, but Crash should win best picture this year. However after watching brokeback mountain I was pleasantly suprised. I was expecting the worst as I had heard from the conservative Christian side, but I was suprised with a good story which was almost believable if I could put myself into the early 1960's. The story is a story of love and infatuation and of infidelity, but at the same time it brings issues of prejudice and the boundaries of love into question. The movie doesnt give us answers, but leaves the viewer with little resolution. I like this becasue it made me think and process the many ideas and boundary breaking ideas that are presented. See this movie if you are willing to think outside of your standard framework.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I loved dirty dancing for so many reasons some of which include the great acting, the excellent plot lines, and the view on the world during the 1960's in america. I think the movie personafied the changing times of america and how that era effects us today. I also love the dances and that is why I am going to do the dances with my best friend in my high school cafeteria with a boombox starting with 'Nobody puts baby in the corner' to the lift.<br /><br />Also Recommended: Ghost
B00004BZ0N|5.0|London calling is the qiuntessential punk album after never mind the bollocks from the Sex Pistols.this fantastic album contains masterpieces like RUDY CANT FAIL,JIMMY JAZZ and SPANISH BOMBS.CLASH ARE GREAT WITH A CAPITAL G AND ARE LIKED BY ALL FANS OF GOOD ROCK MUSIC.very highly recommended.Get both albums and have a blast.
B00005JOGU|3.0|However, it was a good movie. I enjoyed watching this movie and the brilliant lead role of Truman Capote played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Unfortunately, the story wasnt what I was expecting, as I had no prior knowledge of this story. It was eerily similar to Dead Man Walking, but Dead Man Walking was much better. It was well done, but definately wasnt one of the best of the year.
B000059TEP|5.0|Ghost, is without a doubt, one of the finest films of all time. The music, the way evil people die and the way good people die is wonderfully crafted. The scene when Whoopi Goldberg's character hears Sam's voice for the first time is wildly funny. See this movie and you will not have a dry eye in the house at the end of the movie.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|5 stars hands down. Rest in peace to one of the greatest hip hop producers of ALL time. My favorite track is \\"Time: The Donut of the Heart.\\" I have been playing it on repeat all day, and it's still repeating. This man is a genius. I fell in love with his style the moment I heard it, back in the late 90's, and it stuck with me; never went away. He just had this ear for great music; and what great music should sound like. He's a legend in his own right, and if you're a true hip hop head, or you just love the Jay Dee \\"signature\\" sound, you MUST buy this album. His spirit will FOREVER live on in the hearts of all his fans, family, and friends. Detroit for life. RIP Dilla. Your music will continue to make me smile. Yes...We will miss you more than you'll ever know.....
0060516402|5.0|I thorougly enjoyed this book by Jim Collins. You can tell how much research and effort went into both of his books (Good to Great and Built to Last). I could see the huge benefit of all the work he did to bring the ideas and concepts that most formed the visionary companies. The one thing that he kept saying was that the best companies preserved their core while at the same time stimulating progress. This was the key concept from the book that should be applied to any company that wants to succeed in the long-term. He also had a huge emphasis on creating mechanisms that align with the core and to fix misalignments. He said that this is easier to do when you are starting, but it can also be done with a long standing corporation. I think that his emphasis on action coming from the core values was really instructive.<br /><br />Here were some quotes I found to be particularly instructive<br /><br />\\"The continuity of superb individuals atop visionary companies stems from the companies beings outstanding organizations, not the other way around.\\"<br /><br />Here Collins is saying that the great companies make great leaders because of their values and set up.<br /><br />\\"Walton didn't just preach these values, he instituted concrete organizational mechanisms to stimulate change and improvement.\\"<br /><br />For example he started the store within a store concept, created cash awards and public recognition for associates with cost saving ideas, etc...<br /><br />\\"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function\\" -F. Scott Fitzgerald<br /><br />\\"Our research indicates that the authenticity of the ideology and the extent to which a company attains consistent alignment with the ideology counts more than the content of the ideology.\\"<br /><br />-This is a fascinating idea. It proposes that having the right vision isn't the important thing, but rather that living consistently with the vision is the key.<br /><br />\\"Intentions are all fine and good, but it is the translation of those intentions into concrete items-mechanisms with teeth-that can make the difference between becoming a visionary company or forever remaining a wannabe.\\"<br /><br />-This is a key concept from the book; we must create mechanisms that encourage the core instead of deviating from it. Everything in the organization should be pointing to the core, and I mean everything. This is the same in the church. When your value is that mission is why the church exists then everything in the church should point to that value.<br /><br />\\"Nordstrom is only a great place to work for those truly dedicated-and well suited to-the Nordstrom way.\\"<br /><br />-This should be true of our churches. If we have people who don't align with the core they should get weeded out quickly. This isn't a call for conformity except in dedication to the core.<br /><br />\\"Visionary companies tend to be cult-like around their ideologies instead of around their leaders\\"<br /><br />-This is huge for the church. I saw this problem at Mosaic with about half of the people buying into Erwin and half buying into the vision. However, this is very hard to do.<br /><br />Examples of concrete mechanisms to reinforce the core p. 136<br /><br />\\"It means getting the right actors on the stage, putting them in the right frame of mind, and then giving them the freedom to ad lib as they see fit. It means, in short, understanding that cult-like tightness around an ideology actually enables a company to turn people loose to experiment, change, adapt, and -above all-to act.\\"<br /><br />-This is the kind of company that I want to work for or to be leading. I want to hire the right people or be the right person with the freedom to be creative and innovative while being passionate about preserving the core.<br /><br />\\"Visionary companies develop, promote, and carefully select managerial talent from inside the company to a greater degree than the comparison companies.\\"<br /><br />\\"Comfort is not he objective in a visionary company. Indeed, visionary companies install powerful mechanisms to create discomfort-to obliterate complacency-and thereby stimulate change and improvement before the external world demands it.\\"<br /><br />\\"What is the true meaning of the black belt?\\" \\"The black belt represents the beginning-the start of a never-ending journey of discipline, work and the pursuit of an ever-higher standard.\\"<br /><br />\\"The basic difference I see between the two companies is rhetoric versus reality.\\"<br /><br />\\"The real question to ask is not \\"Is this practice good?\\" but \\"Is this practice appropriate for us-does it fit with our ideology and ambitions?\\"<br /><br />\\"It's not what you believe that sets you apart so much as that you believe in something, that you believe in it deeply, that you preserve it over time, and that you bring it to life with consistent alignment.\\"<br /><br />\\"Creating alignment, which is a key part of our ongoing work to help companies transform themselves into visionary companies, requires two key processes:  1) developing new alignments to preserve the core and stimulate progress, and 2) eliminating misalignments-those that drive the company away from the core ideology and those that impede progress toward the envisioned future.\\"ective in a visionary company.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Another one of my favorites. This movie is entertaining next to The Lord of the Rings. The movie is about a beginner sorceror who finds a baby girl then sets off to some castle meeting a warrior person and other unlikely allies. The final battle is neat and the special effects look like good and the whole story is interesting. They should make a sequel or something instead of concluded ending. Great film<br /><br />Also Recommended: Labriynth, Legend, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Origin of Symmetry is nothing short of a masterpiece. Muse's sophomore album really shows their incredible talent. Every track on this album is unique and true alternative rock. \\"Space Dementia\\" \\"Micro Cuts\\" \\"Screenager\\" and \\"Dark Shines\\" are some of the best songs by Muse. The voice of Matthew Bellamy on \\"Micro Cuts\\" is awesome, perfectly in tune, high and low pitch, like nothing you've ever heard. Muse is not temporary music, its timeless alternitive. \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" is probably like no other album you have heard before, so I strongly recomend this album to anyone who want to listen to an album in a class of its own.
B0006399FS|5.0|How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb was album of the year and deserved every one of its 8 grammys.  Bono lyrics are as good as they have ever been and the band has finally found harmony within its music.  The guitary riffs are amazing and even the slower ballads are great.  Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own won song of the year and is a heartfelt tribute to Bono's father who died several years ago.  In case you are wondering what the \\"Atomic Bomb\\" title is all about, it refers to his father.  The title refers to the atomic bomb in all of our lives that has to be dealt with so that we can move on.  City of Blinding Lights is also a wonderful song that was criminally underplayed by radio stations, but was recognized as rock song of the year at the grammys.  Pick this album up, you will not be disappointed.  \\"Bomb\\" is an outstanding collection of outstanding songs.  The only problenm I have with is the tracklisting, it doesn't make much sense and the songs don't flow very well into eachother.  I recommend listening to the album in this order: <br /> <br />1. Somtimes You Can't Make It On Your Own <br />2. City of Blinding Lights <br />3. Crumbs From Your Table <br />4. Miracle Drug <br />5. One Step Closer <br />6. Original of the Species <br />7. All Because of You <br />8. Vertigo <br />9. Love and Peace or Else <br />10. A Man and a Woman <br />11. Yahweh <br /> <br />To me this order is much more fluent and the songs compliment each other better.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|Jarhead is a war movie made by and for people who have grown up on other war movies.  Sam Mendes' film version of Anthony Swofford's vitriolic memoir of his service in the first Gulf War chronicles the his service out in the Middle East during a war in which he and his brothers in arms saw the least amount of action by virtue of being in the eye of a storm where most action took place in the periphery.  Despite some wonderful scenes depicting budding camaraderie and competitive testosterone, Jarhead is primarily a movie not about going to war, but wondering where the war is.  \\"You are here,\\" the film says, but \\"here\\" remains remote, unfamiliar, and inconsequential.  The waiting, as Tom Petty said, is the hardest part. <br /> <br /> And since much of the action is forced to take place in the windmills of these soldiers' minds, Mendes relies on some derivative tactics to tell his audience what to expect and how to feel, including showing clips of such Vietnam-devoted movies as Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter.  That Apocalypse Now featured editing and sound effects by Jarhead's own splicer, Walter Murch, makes this film feel more self-congratulatory than self-referential. <br /> <br />Although familiarity doesn't necessarily breed contempt here, Mendes should allow audience members to create their own mental cues of when we should feel moved and enlightened rather than having him do it for them.  We are familiar with the stock figures - Swofford, the discipline problem (Jake Gyllenhaal), his cryptic buddy, Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), the hothead Kruger (Lucas Black), and the proud father with a newborn son at home, Cortez (Jacob Vargas).  <br /> <br />William Broyles, Jr., who adapted Swofford's book, makes a mistake similar to the one he made with Cast Away.  He does not know how to depict the toll a long passage of time takes on his characters.  Weeks, months, go by but the audience never really feels how arduous the men's service really is or the mental toll it musttake waiting in the arid desert stripped of the women they love and the only language they understand.  Mendes' hat trick is that not until the final reel, when the boys do see a little action, so we realize how long we have gone without any. <br /> <br />This is due in large part to Swofford's recall, and it allows for much believability by his cast, including a bulked-up Gyllenhaal who not only looks, but fills the part of the hotheaded lead character, and Black, in the most plausible of roles.  Unlike his above-the-title co-stars (including Jamie Foxx as the tough, patriotic drill sergeant, an artlessly didactic role) Black gets no big Oscar-clip moment; he merely delivers a consistent performance as a disillusioned soldier on the front line.   <br /> <br />Broyles, Jr. commits a few other gaffes as well.  Much of the first two acts of Jarhead demonstrate the soldiers' ever-growing bloodlust, a motif that eventually just fades away.  Structurally, he bookends the film with clunky narration and a disappointing denouement that feels almost like a non-sequitur.  The script is a marked lack of poetry compared with visual eloquence of cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has plumbed depth of psyche in both the bleakest (Fargo) and most sumptuous (The English Patient) of vistas.  He is an excellent choice to take over reins of Conrad Hall, Mendes' not-so-secret weapon. <br /> <br />Make no mistake, Jarhead is a mainstream movie, and its core never gets too gritty.  There is no real political statement to be read here, despite the relevant timing of its release.  Jarhead is a movie about experience, and though Mendes fashions a solid recreation of that experience, it is never an illuminating one. <br />
B0000028SR|4.0|This is a sublime album. Very sublime. Listening to it puts you in a mood. People say it is bad - it's just hard getting adjusted to the different sounding backing sections. But still, this is a wonderful album, with \\"I Wish I Were Blind,\\" which might be the best song of the decade. Very good album.
B000002JR8|5.0|OK, so this might not be the best metal album ever, but you have to understand that these guys tried to create something heavy as hell yet commercially acceptable, and they did a good job. The guitars are as heavy as hell, although they might not be the best (courtesy of Dimebag Darrell R.I.P). The drummer is excellent, his playing is good although it doesnt match vulgar display of power. the bass is good, the singer matches the music well, with plenty of emotion. what else can i say except you wont lose much by buying cuz at the end of the day the album is good and even if you dont like it it will stand firmly alongside bad albums that you might own and think to yourself 'its not that bad'
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you are already a fan, you don't need to read this.  If you aren't familiar with Firefly or Serenity,  than I envy you...cause I'd love to discover them all over again!  Serenity is the best, freshest movie to come along in a generation.  My wife hates sci fi and minutes into the movie she was so lost into it that she didn't feel it mattered if these characters were in a space ship or riding a horse in the old west. Serenity borrows from the best of Sci Fi (shades of Blade Runner, the original Star Wars) and succeeds blending it with an old fashion western in ways Star Trek never did.  Buy it,  share it with your friends...
0120884674|5.0|This manual is a somewhat more consise version of Dr. White's Osteology textbook. Excellent for anyone with any need to understand the human skeleton in depth. Clearly and assessibly written and includes fantastic pictures, indexes of directional terms, etc. Used widely on archaeological digs the world over.
B00008CLOA|4.0|I bought this album wondering what it would sound like. I could just hear the superb quality of the guitars in Speak to Me as I looked at the cover. After listening to the first track I was pleased and eager to hear the whole album. The stereo tracks sound crisper than the orig. I have to say I'm glad I bought this album in this format. I nor my parents own a SACD player,so for now we'll be happy listening to it in 5.1 stereo and on reg 2.0 channel stereo's. I have the orig album, and my parents both have the DSOTM records but this just blows them away I think. You can hear sounds and voices in the tracks you couldn't with the orig records or CD's. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Mine is this is a good buy. It's worth $21.00 at Virgin record store.  I recommend this to anyone just getting into PF. This version sounds like it was released this year that's how good it sounds. Another band that won't ever be outdated they were ahead of their time  due to the spacey sound some ppl call space rock. I give this CD four stars due to the mix. In The Great Gig in the Sky there are some noticeable changes that I didn't like. Besides that it's an awesome buy. GO and buy this today!
B000BTDMDC|5.0|You know when you're distracted doing all sorts of things and then your attention suddenly turns towards one thing alone and you forget about everything else? When I first listened to Arctic Monkeys some time ago that was exactly what happened.  <br /> <br />Their debut single \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" and the follow up \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" are the best songs I've heard for a very long time. Not just that, but I don't remember being as thrilled as this with a band since I started to search for more underground bands. <br /> <br />Arctic Monkeys proves that a simple guitar riff can be much more exciting than one filled with all sorts of effects. Add a strong and independent bass and heavy drums (with a bit of resemblance to keith moon way of playing...) and there you go: the best band to show up in a number of years and that, if continue this way in the albums to come, will probably be the best for a very long time.
B000002U8G|4.0|This album doesn't sound like a Floyd album at all. I like the fact that the band switched gears on this one and were daring enough to make something different. The songs are catchy and the trippy insturmentals are there like on any Floyd album. I give this one four stars due to the lack of tracks on this one. They could have recorded more tracks for this album. Overall it's a good purchase. I just listen to the copy my Dad has. If your a beginner to Floyd I recommend getting DSOTM and The Wall to start out your collection.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|I hadn't listened to this album in a while but it took a whole 30 seconds into the opening title track for me to remember why this is my favourite King Crimson album (from those I've heard, which admittedly isn't many). For that matter, it didn't take any longer for me to remember why it's one of my favouriote progressive rock albums period. Red is an astounding piece of work and one that defied the genre. It's almost scarey to think this is over 30 years old.<br /><br />The album opens with Red, a viscious, guitar driven intrumental. Bill Bruford's drumming has rarely sounded better. Fallen Angel is a ballad done Crimson style. Filled with mournful guitars and crying wind/brass instruments, it also has uplifting spirit to it. One More Red Nightmare is probably the only song on the album that could be described as upbeat with being dark and omnious at the same time. Then of course is Providence, a free-form avant-garde jam between Fripp, Bruford, Cross and Wetton. Its the least accessible track on the album and arguably the weakest but its powerful in its own way. Lastly we have Starless, arguably the greatest track on the album and one of the best King Crimson songs I've ever heard. The saxophone and guitar work on this track is mesmerising.<br /><br />King Crimson are one of the few progressive rocks bands with such a nasty and experimental edge to them that also became one of the defining and most popular bands in the genre. Most of the weirder prog was left underground while most of the well known bands were accessible and relatively easy to listen to. They're also pretty much the only prog band from the 70s still making forward thinking and original music today. King Crimson are a treasure in modern music and Red is one of their crowning achievements. Highly recommended.
6305949980|5.0|I'd just like to express the deep emotions this movie is able to provoke.  When I was just 4 years old, I would visit my best friend.  Almost every time, we would watch this movie.  I loved it.  A few years ago, I decided to watch it again for the first time in years, since I was very young.  All I had to hear were the very first notes of the superb musical score and I experienced the most powerful feeling of nostalgia I've ever known.  The movie is beautifully dark (that is why it's often considered \\"goth\\"), but also lighthearted, so it reminded me of some of my happiest childhood memories all at once.  I've grown up with musical rhythmic intelligence, and I believe it is because of this movie.  I guess I'm just trying to say that just because the company with the rights is sort of milking every bit  of cash they can out of this wonderful film, and because many of the people who buy the merchandise are supposedly \\"goth\\", don't avoid this gem.  It's absolutely magical for children.
B000005J08|5.0|Although I didn't know it at the time, if Naked City hadn't have happened there's a good chance the likes of Mr Bungle, Secret Chiefs et al would never have existed. Its hard to believe that this album was made in the late 80s considering how crazy it is. Even if it was released today it would still sound fresh and exciting.<br /><br />At times placid with stirring piano and smooth sax work, at other times crazy beyond belief like a cross between free jazz and grindcore, Naked City is a phenomenol album. While it takes a few listens to sink in, those of you open minded to even consider getting it in the first place will find that it grows on you surprisingly quickly. Zorn's saxaphone is brilliant throughout the entire thing. On The Silican Clan he sounds soulful and tasteful whereas on all the vocal tracks with Yamatsuka Eyes he sounds like he's having an epileptic fit. I've heard avant garde saxaphone work before and I have to admit I'm not always impressed, largely because it often sounds like noise that anyone could do. But Zorn's work on this album is so intense and on the ball with the music that it's hard not to have admiration for it. It is of course balanced out with 'typical' sax work, proving that the man is far from a one trick pony.<br /><br />The music itself is all over the place. Sometimes melodic and almost peaceful, at other times upbeat and catchy, then noisy and aggressive, sometimes within the same 30 seconds, it's completely schitzophrenic and so unbelievably eclectic that one has to wondor what on earth possessed him to create such a thing. The whole band are clearly tuned into his vision though as they move in an out of moods and tempos with him at the drop of a hat. It's not easy to imagine how much practice they must have had to become so tight together.<br /><br />This is simply an incredible record. If you're prepared for a challenge that's worth the effort then buy Naked City.
B00006LI4S|5.0|David Gilmour shines in this wonderfully produced and filmed live concert.  Every song is special.  If you like Pink Floyd or just good guitar, this is a must buy.  The extras are also quite spectacular.  Hearing David sing a Shakespeare poem was a real treat.  The home movies really give you insight into his life and music.  Oustanding!  Then, of course, there are the funny bits!  Like when Bob Geldolf can't remember the words for Comfortably Numb and has to read them off of paper!  OMG!  He really needed paper!  Thankfully, that was an extra and not part of the main concert footage.  Buy and enjoy.
B000062YAZ|5.0|I bought this cassette in high school when it came out and now 20 years later it is the most listened to cd I own.If you like fast heavy metal this is the one.Nobody has the matched this cd.If you don't own it buy it today.
0804115613|5.0|I must admit to falling in love with the characters of \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" first in the movie version.  I should have KNOWN that the book would be even BETTER!  What a heartwarming, endearing book.  Written in flashbacks, one becomes acquainted with the gray haired and feisty Mrs Threadgoode who tells her story of her growing up years and the mysterious murder of a man in Alabama to Evelyn, a woman who is in a middle-aged slump.  Both characters are irrepressible.  There is humor, sadness, and truth as the past unfolds for Evelyn and for the reader.  This is truly a CLASSIC.  If you have (or have not) seen the movie, that's okay, because the book offers a lot more!  I have read this book many times and still enjoy the movie version.<br /><br />Was this helpful to you?
B00005JOFO|5.0|HOW? I still don't know yet. THIS is a masterpiece!    The music is astounding. I bought the soundtrack first because I love Gustavo Santaolalla music - incredibly poetic guitar chords that enhances the movie for a higher ground.    The story of Ennis and Jack does not leave my head. I was touched in so many ways by this movie that I could not believe myself. Just can't stop thinking about those guys (and girls). I was a long time Ang Lee's movies lover - just remember how good is 'The Ice Storm' - but I never thought that a movie - this movie - could be so deep. It's Like a wound. It really hurts my heart. I will not forget this story as long as I live!    From the start - the truck on the highway - to the unforgettable final scene, this movie delivers art in every image, in every scene, in every sequence. Wether in the mountain, in a bar or in the character's houses, everything is perfect.    Heath Ledger, Jake Gylenhall and Michelle Williams (and also Linda Cardellini and Anne Hathaway) are truly amazing! Heath's performance is absolutely mesmerising, memorable and magnificent.    I have never seen before a love story so beautifully told, filmed and played. This is Cinema.    Please meet Ennis & Jack. You'll not be disappointed! And watch this movie with your heart.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|great movie! this is a great movie it has everything, action, exorcisms, demons, angels, great acting.  Highly recomended
B000007WNN|5.0|This is by far the best album by the Cult. If it weren't for the Pixies, this would be a shoe in for best rock album of the 80's. Overall it's one of the most well crafted, pure ROCK albums out there. Fantastic vocals by Ian. I challenge anybody to top his baritone howls. Billy's solo's are awesome, not to mention the fantastic, though simplistic riffs all over the album. Drumming is great, and the bass fits perfectly. I could do without \\"Born to be Wild\\", but the rest of the album is 5 stars in every sense of the rating.
6305428042|1.0|The movie is fantastic; that is why I purchased it.  However, at scene topic 12, the video suddenly stopped playing.  There was nothing to indicate a damaged DVD, so I assume it came from Walt Disney Production.  I tried to play the DVD in my computer where Disney's own player was installed.  However, the player shut down my virus protection; I had to restart my computer to clean up the mess.<br /><br />As I had to open the DVD to play it, I am unable to return it.<br /><br />My rating only reflects on the poor condition of the DVD, not the movie.  That I give 5 stars
B000007MVU|4.0|Long before it was fashionable for rock stars to record albums of American standards, Ringo released this in 1970. Linda Rondstadt, Boz Scaggs and Rod Stewart were all just getting their \\"rock\\" careers started and doing this type of work was many years away for all of them. <br />As for Ringo's standards, they are well chosen (many would turn up on later standards releases) and well produced by the likes of George Martin, Paul McCartney, and Quincy Jones. Ringo sings them well , maybe surprisingly well to some, and proves he can drum to something other than rock. He hasn't done another set of standards but it would be welcome.
B000059QY2|5.0|I didn't want to love the opera, Rigoletto, because I found the plot implausible:<br /><br />How could a girl continue to love a worthless philandering man who thinks women exist only to be used?<br /><br />Yet, I decided to give it a fair shot--to watch it clear through to see if the plot could make sense.<br /><br />OK. Maybe you'll say I was just under the spell of the gorgeous music and the incomparable precision and passion of the singing of Edita Gruberova as Gilda. Or perhaps it was the exhilarating experience of hearing Pavarotti at his peak, just dominating every scene.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the excellent performance by Ingar Wixell as Rigoletto, or the superb supporting performances by Ferruccio Furlanetto and Victoria Vergara as Sparafucile and his sister, Maddalena--I can't imagine anyone doing those roles any better.<br /><br />I remember a song where the theme, and perhaps the title, was \\"Just My Bill.\\" It was a woman singing about her Bill and his habits of running around, drinking too much, and abusing her--but she still loved him with all those faults.<br /><br />Offensive as that kind of love seems to me (and to Rigoletto) that was Gilda's kind of love--and she proved it.<br /><br />I just have to remind myself that this is opera, that the point of it all is beautiful music, beautifully sung, as it tells a story.<br /><br />Because of what seemed to me a plot that strained credulity, I did not want to like it, but the singing, acting, costumes, sets, and Verdi's just beautiful music made me love it.

6305131090|5.0|Bizarre but Beautiful , June 19, 2005<br /><br />Okay, this film does appear very strange at times, as it shows Austrian composer Gustav Mahler smashing a Star of David, taking a sword to symbolically kill a dragon (the old traditional German masters), and eating pork washed down with a mug of milk to show his renunciation of his Jewish roots, just to get ahead on the music scene.<br /><br />If you can't stand an anachronistic Cosima Wagner goose-stepping back and forth to determine if Mahler is worthy to conduct in Vienna, then you should'nt watch this film.<br /><br />But you'll be missing something valuable. Ken Russell captures Mahler the genius, who was both arrogant, and yet uncertain.<br /><br />Many of Mahler's most beautiful themes are used throughout the film and always at appropriate places. It was in this way that the film captures Mahler's genius for taking what he hears in the natural world and tranforming it into his symphonies. Especially poignant was an English version of a song from Kindertotenlieder, which accompanies a nightmarish fleeing of Mahler's daughters through the forest during a storm.<br /><br />A portion of a symphony which includes the sound of a rattle, is led into by Alma trying to quiet the Mahler children, shaking a rattle. Likewise one of the frightening \\"what the animals of the night tell me\\" phantom monsters of the Third Symphony, appears to young Gustav as a white horse terrifying him in as a very literal \\"night mare.\\"<br /><br />As one who believes Mahler was the greatest of the Romantic composers, and perhaps also a sort of musical philosopher or even theologian, I find more to enjoy in Ken Russell's Mahler each time I watch it. It's a little bizarre at times, but also very beautiful.<br /><br />Two more quick comments: Robert Powell, the actor who plays Mahler, looks astonishingly like the composer.<br /><br />The \\"bad transfer\\" which other reviewers have remarked about, has obviously been corrected, as current copies are perfect.ies are perfect. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000A7DVR2|5.0|It's hard to pick out one favorite line of dialogue in particular for two reasons. One-almost everything said in this film is downright hilarious. And Two-the F word is spoken 281 times so there's not many sentences that don't contain it. 144 sentences also end in 'man'. I also like how the characters unintentionally use each other's repeating catchphrases.<br /><br />Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence. He has no job, no ambitions and no worries. His days, be they weekdays or weekends, are spent bowling, driving around or having the occasional acid flashback. His pals are Walter Sobchak, a security expert and half-crazed Vietnam vet and Donny, a humble, mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversation.<br /><br />The Dude is happy with his easy-going life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the OTHER Jeff 'The Big' Lebowski, the millionaire with a trouble-making wife who owes money all over town. These thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and re-assert themselves by peeing on The Dude's rug.<br /><br />This very much displeases The Dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the 'Chinaman' thug responsible he decides to take it out of the Big Lebowski, as it's now HIM who owes a new rug. The Dude is welcomed into the Big Lebowski's mansion by Brandt the butler, a man so appallingly sycophantic he'd make Weylon Smither's look bad. But his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give hand-outs and basically tells The Dude to get lost.<br /><br />At this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of ex-pop star Nihilist thugs, a powerful pornographer, a dejected feminist daughter, a Brother Seamus (NOT an Irish Monk), a joyriding teenager, a revolting pederast champion bowler, Saddam Hussein, a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make The Dude's life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting. The plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA, going from limo to limo, never too far from a white Russian or a doobie.<br /><br />There are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it. Every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that, like me, you'll be acting the film out for years. Even on a 100th viewing you'll notice dramatic ironies, character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head before.<br /><br />The acting is superb. I am a fan of Jeff Bridges but he completely disappears in this film. He truly BECOMES The Dude and shows little of his recognizable self. John Goodman, in probably the most under-rated role of his career, is the world's angriest man. Bringing frustration and smart-ass arrogance to every scene (though he's almost always right). Set well over a decade after 'nam (and during the first Gulf conflict) Walter seems to be suffering from perpetual, ever-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation. Take a look at his 'minor' confrontation with Smokey for example.<br /><br />It's not about plot, or even characters. It's about a certain moment in time, the early 90s. And the definitive man of that time was the Dude. The rug-peeing just happened to occur simultaneously.<br /><br />The Blu Ray comes in a nice Digi-Book and looks great in 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 5.1 sound and loads of extras.he dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA, going from limo to limo, never too far from a white Russian or a doobie.

B0000046KM|5.0|Review from 2005-  Clearly her best work to date, this piano prodigy and the \\"Here's to Life\\" CD is a front runner as the best album of 2003, but her English rendition of \\"Ne Quitte Pas\\" is phenomenal.     Update- 2006  Shortly after seeing Horn at New York's Metropolitan Complex - in Avery Fisher Hall, Ms. Horn passed away.
0451196716|5.0|I was surprised when I read The Long Walk by Stephen King.  I was always used to him writing horror stories to try and grasp the reader.  But I was glad I read this book, because it taught me a lot about how important characters are when it comes to writing a novel. <br /> <br />The Long Walk is no horror story...it is not \\"suspenseful\\" or \\"creepy\\" or \\"bone-chilling.\\"  This atmosphere of suspense has been replaced with the feeling of being disturbed.  I have read the book once, and I'm going back to read it again.  Once you start reading the first few pages, King builds up suspense as the main character, Ray Garraty, constantly stares at his watch until it hits nine o'clock.  The Walk starts at nine, and believe me, once you know what happens to the losers, and you go back to re-read the beginning, your heart starts to jump a little at the thought of the Walk. <br /> <br />Imagine being drafted into a marathon. Imagine watching TV one day as an army major pulls names out of a hat, and he says yours on television.  If you were in the story, that would mean you get to participate in the Long Walk, along with ninety-nine other teenage boys your age. <br /> <br />Only one can win.  Everyone else gets a \\"ticket,\\" which I won't tell you about.  the most amazing part of the book is the characters; you can post on online forums to hear some of the trash-talk other teenagers say, and that's exactly what they sound like in the book.  I like how King captured realistic dialogue in this novel.  He also added unique personalities to each character to make them seem real enough.  They were for me.  In fact, he wrote it so well that the whole story seemed real enough to me. <br /> <br />The theme of the book is so original and...well, how should I put this...sick and disturbing.  If some of you readers out there like books with happy endings, you won't like this one bit.  The idea of the book (walking in a lethal marathon) is so freakishly created that there were several times inwhich I had to close it for a few seconds because the idea scared the crap out of me.  Think about it; you're walking in a race where only one person will make it out alive.  And the characters seemed so real I felt like I was the main character. <br /> <br />Is this book boring?  Not in the least bit.  Do they walk for 200 pages?  Yes, but it isn't boring at all.  You see, each character receives background information that was inserted perfectly into the plot.  After a while, you feel sorry for learning so much about a character, then having to see them go. <br /> <br />But another interesting part of the book is friendship.  the main character makes friends, yet he knows that he shouldn't, because eventually, one of the friends will have to buy his ticket. <br /> <br />I could easily relate to several of these characters.  This is probably one of my favorite books of all time.  I recommend any King fan to pick it up and read it; it isn't a horror story, but it is an interesting read nonetheless.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|There is so much mystery and confusion. I am going to break this down as best as I know how: <br /> <br />1) I know that there are at least 3 versions of this film. <br />   A) The origional theratical cut. Included on this DVD. <br />   B) The extended TV release. Included on this DVD. <br />   C) The extended Sci-Fi channel TV release, which is not included on this DVD. This version contains additional scenes not seen on this current DVD release. To my knowledge this release has never been commerically available (at least in the US). This is the only time I have seen this version, when it was aired on Sci-Fi about 6-7 years ago. So I am calling it the Sci-Fi channel release. I do not know if the previous foriegn releases of this film contain this cut or not. <br /> <br />2) The producer eludes to the fact of a 4+ hour edit that may be in Universals vaults. Based on the differences between the TV release and the Sci-Fi channel differences, plus the deleted scenes you see included with this DVD, there seems to be enough materail for just such a film. <br /> <br />3) This new disc release is one disc that has 2 sides. It is not a 2 disc set. <br /> <br />4) The extended version screen aspect loses (yes loses) some of the picture frame from the origional cut. This was done to have your \\"wide screen\\" and preserve aspect. Check out this link to see. [...] <br /> <br />All this said as a DUNE fan its a good thing and I enjoy this collection. Its as good as we will ever get I think. You could proably wait 2-3 years and it will be a $10 disc. I dont think we will ever get \\"all the movie\\" or even the Sci-Fi version. If they do it wont be for a VERY VERY long time as Universal has put this together and will want to cash in on it as much as possible. So go ahead ad get this and enjoy. Then dream of the day we get the whole enchalida. Youll love this until we do. <br />
B000CCBCAS|3.0|I had been waiting a long time for a special edition of Four Weddings and a Funeral to be released, and was very pleased when it finally came out 12 years after the film's theatrical run.  The extras make this a much better product than the bare-bones DVD that has been on the market for years.   <br /> <br />Still, I found the \\"making-of\\" documentaries slightly arrogant and self-congratulatory.  The film snippets used in the featurettes were sped-up such that the characters' voices sounded noticably off-pitch.  The deleted scenes were quite short (almost blurbs, really) and did nothing to illuminate the film.   <br /> <br />Most distressing, however, was the lack of care that went into the film's transfer to this DVD.  Both picture quality and audio were sorely lacking.  The screen was marked throughout with dust spots and blemishes that drew my eye away from the action, making this DVD picture slightly worse than the VHS copy I've been using for 10 years.  Moreover, absolutely nothing was done to improve the audio.  Some parts - including the opening song \\"But Not for Me\\" - actually sounded worse than on VHS.   What this great film deserved was a full digital treatment.   <br /> <br />Fortunately, it's low price makes it worth purchasing for the extras alone.  Just don't give away your old copy, because the picture is probably better!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I had never really been a fan of Mariah Carey until she bust out of the scene last year with \\"It's like that\\" and I started feeling her, so i went and bought this cd! All i can say is damn. I love this cd i still play it everyday. My favoite songs are: <br />1.We belong together <br />2.Mine again <br />3.Stay the night <br />4.One and only <br />5.Circles <br />6.Fly like a bird <br /> <br />Now i see why she is the best selling feamle of all time. She should've swept the boards this year at the Grammys! Mariah Carey now has a new devoted fan
B0007GAERG|5.0|Woteva ur views on Mariah, one thing is 4 sure and thats the girl can sing! The EMANCIPATION OF MIMI, is an instant R&B classic and will be remebered for bringin back one of earths best singers. Every track is pure gold and she sings them with sych emotional rawness, that makes you wanna press repeat on every song! Starting off with the butt shakin' \\"It's Like That' this track is sure to get u in the party mood. We Belong Together is R&B's finest tune (according to the Grammy's) its sexy, sultry vocals, mixed with a heavy hip hop beat is sure to make u fall in love with the song, and the singer. The hip hop inspired 'Shake It Off' never fails to satisfy. Pharell and Snoop lend a helpin hand on 'Say Something' and it pays the track is non stop smooth from start to finish. 'Mine Again' is a power ballad that proves Mariah can still sing, where-as 'Stay The Night' (produced by mega-producer Kanye West) is probably the Cd's best track. Other Notable additions include 'Fly Like A Bird' (The Grammy's performance was just amazing!)is a brilliant gospel song, proving yet again that this album truly is the return of the voice! If u buy da platinum edition (A much better edition)includes Mariah's 17th No.1 'Don't Forget About Us' (produced by MC and JD). If ur lookin for a smooth sexy album that satisfies on every level, The Emancipation Of Mimi, is the album for you! Its the best album from 2005. (She should of walked away with all dem GRAMMY'S!!!)
B00008972S|5.0|Just simply amazing from start to finish. One of the greatest musicales to ever be relesed is finally on a great dvd full of great special features and a great booklet. Let me start with the special features there is a 90 minute documentry which is great, the dvd also comes with a great book fyll of triva and the whole movie script. The movie it self is a great achievement in movie making and we have never seen nothing like ti sicne. The story is sad and hauntning, the music is great like America, Tonight, A boy like that, I fell preaty and many others. Overal a great film and one of the best films ever.
B000CECPB6|5.0|The diference between version 1 & 2 are: In version 1 the tag says MINI BEANBAG (no separation between BEAN & BAG). In version 2 it says MINI BEAN BAG (note the separation between BEAN & BAG). The value remains the same. Just 2 versions! One is no more rare then the other.
B0000047EC|2.0|Haden's bass playing is boring and predictable, totally uninspired. Metheny is just above average. If you're planning to buy sleeping tablets, don't. Buy this album instead.
6303418287|5.0|After reading some of the reviews on amazon.com, I was taken by surprise by the dissapointment expressed by some. This movie is one of my personal ALL TIME favorites. I purchased Mary Shelley's Frankenstein after it was newly released. I have watched this movie several times, and always find myself astounded by the tremendous effort that went into its production, including the landscape, architecture and even the soundtrack, needless to mention the talented cast of characters. Robert DeNiro pulled off a powerfully convincing  portrayal of \\"the creature\\". Perhaps I am misunderstanding something, but one reviewer said this would be a good rental for Halloween? It's my understanding this movie has nothing to do with the Horror genre, *not really* because it is more appropriately classed among those rare classic tales which have a_moral_to_teach, it is a powerful story about humanity, and in this case, this story would border on the argument about Science and God: Where does man draw the line? It is a compelling story, the best version that Hollywood has released to date of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. I must give this movie five stars. I'd rate it six stars, if Amazon allowed for \\"extra-ordinarily superb!\\"
B000002LLC|5.0|Hey, guys, I bought this CD when it first came out in 1990 and I have never stopped enjoying it! The song set shows us the kinky Madonna who likes spankings in the bedroom, lusts after super tough and danger-loving detectives like Dick Tracy, wants many millions of dollars, and gets way turned off while nevertheless reluctantly sticking by (at least for the moment) a \\"Cry Baby Guy.\\" There is the very fine and bittersweet ballad \\"Something To Remember.\\" The CD ends with one of her best songs ever, \\"Vogue.\\" \\"Vogue\\" is both a fun dance number and a homage to the greats of yesteryear's Hollywood where everyone had glamour \\"on the cover of a magazine.\\" She sings \\"They had style, they had grace, Rita Hayworth gave good (...)\\" (I was never able to make out that last word with certainty so in case it's a naughty word I am choosing to blank it out with stars. hehehe  GRIN  Note: Congratulations go to Vanna (I assume this Vanna is Vanna White) who makes the \\"A\\" list despite not being from yesteryear's Hollywood.<br /><br />Even though this CD was manufactured in 1990, which was when I bought it, after 16 years the sound quality has not diminished one bit. I can listen to it both on my portable CD player and my stereo in the house and everything (except that one word about Rita Hayworth) is crystal clear and the musical arrangements sound as fresh and crisp as they ever did. Indeed, the music was inspired by the movie Dick Tracy and some of it was taken from the movie itself. Awesome! Madonna's voice is in great form and the musical accompaniments and effects are very well done. For instance, at one point near the end they made a sound as if you were listening to an old 78 rpm record on which the needle was stuck--and then someone, presumably Madonna herself, slides the needle across the vinyl record to stop the needle from being stuck. The song (entitled \\"Now I'm Following You\\") then quickly goes into a more distinctly modern beat--very good sound effects there!<br /><br />The front cover art work has a picture of Warren Beatty looking lustfully at an abundantly sexy Madonna: the allure of sex and danger goes into the artwork as well. The front cover can be removed and opened up into a small booklet (at least it could be when I bought this CD) with a few very well done still photographs from the film Dick Tracy. If you then open the cover further you essentially get a \\"centerfold\\" photo of Madonna wearing a sexy silver gown that covers just enough of her chest. If you like Madonna photos, this photo is one of the better ones of her as she looked when she was a few years younger than she is now. (OK, OK, 16 years younger than she is now. SMILE)<br /><br />Even the CD itself has nice artwork on the side where there is no music data recorded. Great artwork overall!<br /><br />So, if you're a Madonna fan, just getting into Madonna, or a fan of dance music from the early 1990s, this CD truly is for you! The CD is a nice companion to the movie Dick Tracy, too.rt work has a picture of Warren Beatty looking lustfully at an abundantly sexy Madonna: the allure of sex and danger goes into the artwork as well.

0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin's excellent biography of Lincoln and his contemporaries serves as a leadership primer as well as a great work of historical analysis.  Today's leaders face less daunting, but every bit as challenging situations in which they must balance competing interests and conflicting values.  The difficult personalities Lincoln brought together to lead the USA through its darkest days look a lot like the people we find ourselves working with in today's modern management environment.   <br /> <br />Like Ronald A. Heifetz and Marty Linsky's book Leadership on the Line, Goodwin illustrates the high personal stakes facing leaders, ranging from loss of friendship, to family stress, to death itself.  Her characters provide us with compelling examples of how to manage these stresses as well as cautionary tales of the consequences when we don't. <br /> <br />Public and private leaders should not only read this book, but also take its real-life lessons to heart.
0689865384|5.0|I finished reading Uglies by Scott Westerfeld about ten minutes ago. And I was heartbroken. Heartbroken that the book had ended, that I didn't have the second book. The colorful words and suspensful scenes were highlighted by the smaller details, but even the details were amazing. Every sentence could have won a Newbery Honor. Written in third person, it tells the tale of Tally Youngblood, an 'ugly' who is about to turn sixteen. At sixteen, everyone gets an operation that turns you into a stunningly beautiful being. Tally can't wait for the operation, but when she sneaks into New Pretty town, she meets someone who will change her life -- Shay. Shay is an independent thinker and tries to convince Tally that the operation is wrong; Tally just thinks Shay is crazy. But soon enough, Shay runs to a place called the Smoke, a hidden community for other independant thinkers who want to stay ugly for life. Special Circumstances (a bunch of underground buildings with workers designed to handle out-of-the-ordinary situations) has been trying to find the Smoke for years, and when they find out that Shay is missing, they pull Tally from her pretty operation on her sixteenth birthday. They threaten to keep her as an ugly forever if she doesn't find Shay and the Smoke. Tally agrees to betray her friend and makes the hard journey to the Smoke, but once she's there, she can't bring herself to tattle. Tally decides to stay ugly with her friends at the Smoke... until Special Circumstances arrives a month later and destroys her home. They take hostages, but Tally and her very close friend David manage to get away. Now they must fight back for their friends and cure Shay of the brain damage the operation gives you when you turn pretty.
B000002UAF|3.0|I love this album with the wonderful songs the Beatles sang from their first groundbreaking film. But I think the recording doesn't do justice to the entire film. It leaves out all the instrumental music that was integral to the feeling of the film. Everytime I listen to this I keep expecting some small interlude of the \\"in between\\" sounds and feel let down that they aren't there anymore. <br />And I have to agree to those who think the remastered sound isn't at it's best. I just keep listening because it's the best I can do. Wish I still had my original RLP!
B0000047GA|2.0|As I look over the reviews for Emergency!, I notice that only one agrees with me.  So, I'm writing my own review, just in case there's someone else who wonders if they're the only one who doesn't get it:  You are not alone...<br /><br />Tony Williams is one of my favorite jazz drummers, but when I heard this album for the first time 15 or so years ago, I could not get past the sheer horridness of the recording quality.  I listened to it again not long ago, in a last ditch effort to see if I may have simply overreacted to the sound quality.  I did not overreact.  In fact, it sounded even worse than I remembered it.<br /><br />The musicianship is fantastic - the band is truly made up of some of the greatest musicians of their day.  One of the other reviews here make mention of the \\"avant-garde\\" sound of it.  Personally, I have always equated the phrase \\"avant-garde\\" with the phrase \\"hot garbage,\\" and unfortunately, no matter how much I want to appreciate Emergency! for it's musicality underneath the poor recording, I just can't seem to do it.  I give up...
6305313687|5.0|Have you ever watched a movie where you begin to think if the actor's real personality is actually like the personality of his character??  Well my friends, that is the feeling that this movie delivers.    Edward Norton is a highly underrated actor who delivers a mind blowing performance in this film.  The actors performance is so real, it's actually kind of hard to believe that they are NOT truly racists.      The characters in this movie portray what neo nazism in the real world is really like.  They have no mercy and no remorse for the actions they commit, and at one point, one action gets Norton thrown in jail.  While in jail he realizes that he could get along with all races, and that he could be friends and not fiends with everone.  The problem is, while he was in jail, his little brother was out getting himself involved with the nazis, and so a whole bunch of flashbacks happen in Norton's head while he's in jail.    Overall, this is one of the saddest but yet most disgusting movies I've ever seen, and it even brought me to tears at the end of the movie (only other movie that did that to me was \\"Armageddon\\".  American History X is an epic movie to share with the ADULTS of the family, because this movie is VERY, VERY VILE!  = why it wasn't in theaters.  But, it changed the way I watched movies forever, and it sure gave me a higher perspective on neo nazism.  It's a must have, buy it now!    John
0792844890|1.0|Space-Balls? Are you freaking kidding me? I want part of my life back after wasting it on this turd. It's not funny in the least. Definitely one of the all-time worst movies ever. Believe it !!... Pass!!
B000BYA5GO|1.0|I thought that \\"The Hotel New Hampshire\\" would go down as the ALL TIME worst ever movie. This one gives it a run for it's wasted money.
B000002LRX|5.0|An album that is very unique and sometimes hard to approach, Faith No More's \\"Angel Dust\\", the 1992 successor to their 1989 breakthrough \\"The Real Thing\\", is a masterpiece on all levels; an album without a single weak track to keep it down nor a song that breaks its amazingly consistent flow. Highly recommended, one of the best albums to represent the early '90s.
B000002U82|5.0|Mind blowing.  Everytime I hear it I can't help but sit in stunned silence at the pure genious of this record. <br /> <br />The most perfect record of all time.
B00005ATQF|4.0|I served two tours in the Vietnam war and I am sometimes wary to watch a movie about it.  My grandson told me about this movie and so I decided to watch it and see.  Overall the movie at times seems embellished with hollywood but that does not mean they are stretching the truth, perhaps just adding some color to it.  The boot camp scenes were all to familiar as I had a lot of memories come back doing pushups, situps, and getting yelled at for someone else's mistake. <br /> <br />The battle scenes were not far off but not accurate to be applied to all the men and women who were are in combat.  The scene that stuck out in my mind was when the man called \\"animal mother\\" played by Alec Baldwin was wanting to go take out the sniper.  Sometimes these things happen but all to often the first and foremost thing you want to do is make sure you don't get killed trying to be a hero and doing something stupid that could endanger you and your fellow marines around you.   <br /> <br />There is a lot of comeraderie and this movie did a good job of showing that with the men.  It also did show that some damn near do lose their marbles.  Many people watching it probably found some scenes to be resentful or sickening.  That they are, but one has to realize that it's another world over there in the war zone, and how you cope and are able to get through it sometimes would be deemed bad or wrong.  It's easy to judge when your at home in your recliner, and not crawling over bodies in the mud while someone is shooting at you. <br /> <br />The film to me was emotional at the end as the men regrouped and headed out on patrol, where there will be another sniper waiting, another letter from home that won't reach it's recipient, and another friend lost to war.  Full Metal Jacket embodies many things that were common in the Vietnam war.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|Before people start freaking out, I like the Foo Fighters. But in my opinion I think that as a band they have run their course creatively. I think that in this day and age of horrible radio rock that A double album is definantly risky and somewhat cool but it's not like it hasn't been done before. In fact there was a time when it happened frequently. Sgt Pepper, Electric Ladyland, etc. Now that we are on the subject of this as a double album let me just say that the second disk of acoustic is really in my opinion for the fanatics! It is for people who are looking to complete the foo fighter catalog and nothing more. But back to the first disk, it is still without question the Foo Fighters sound, which I enjoy. They definantly havenot changed their sound to impress any new group of people. I will give them credit for that, but in the same breath it hasn't expanded or improved either. Let me say that I definantly don't like knocking this band I enjoy the Foo Fighters, with their fun and energetic music. They definantly have a good time and want their fans to as well. Nothing like most of radio rock with all of this emo/nu-metal whimpy wussy \\"feel sorry for me.\\" Sh*t.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|The book upon which this DVD was based has come back into the limelight in the post-Enron, post-Tyco, post-Refco, post-Worldcom, post-Adelphia world of ethicless business. The DVD gets this part of the book right. Like the major rich characters in this DVD, today's ruthless robber-barons, cheat on their wives, demean their employees, spend money lavishly on conspicuous consumption. But Gatsby never gave a million dollar party like the head of Tyco did. <br /> <br />So much is similar: no one knows where the rich people's money is coming from. Everyone assumes there is something illegal about a few people having all the money and the poor people being pushed further into poverty. But, no one seems to be doing anything about it. <br /> <br />When General Motors steps away from its commitment to employee pensions, and United Airlines, and IBM, this book becomes more and more contemporary. Even more so when executive pay rises in the double digits every year. Tom Buchannan, the adulterer in this classic, would fit right into today's business elite. <br /> <br />Gatsby (Robert Redford) himself is mysterious, but, although his background in the First World War is revealed in the book, it is not found in the film. His background turns out to be similar to many veterans who returned from Vietnam, or Iraq, to find that the rules of business had changed, and for the most part, there was no effective enforcement. <br /> <br />The real lesson of this DVD is that the wages of sin is death. Gatsby dies in a case of mistaken identity. His death is triggered by Buchannan's infidelity. This is a message America needs to see. <br /> <br /> <br />I watched this film when it came out. But that was before Enron. I rented the VHS and watched again after the Internet bubble burst, just like the stock market imploded in 1929, shortly after the book was written, sweeping millions into poverty.  <br /> <br />By the time the book became popular, thousands of people who had hoped to be like Gatsby were living on the streets. If they read the book during the depression they would have been happy that Gatsby got what was coming to him. <br /> <br />What will you think of Gatsby when you see the DVD?
B0006399FS|3.0|As usual I bought this album when it came out and as usual after acouple dozen play's I forgot about it, then sold it. I guess maybe I miss the point about what music is supposed to be about. It's one thing to put alot of thought into an album, but it's another thing to over do it. And once again they did! In my opinion they haven't made a good record since Achtung Baby! But because they were such a great band and put out such kick- a** material for so long I continue to buy their albums everytime a new one comes out. Not that I think much of the grammy's, in my opinion they suck. But if this qualifies as \\" Album of the year\\" Then it's time to go back to the drawing board people. Seriously, I think of the Grammy's about as much as having to wipe my 12 year old dogs a** after she takes a crap. Not that that has anything to do with this album or review but I just felt like saying it. Conclusion= another overdone album. On a lighter note I heard that little prissy Sir McCartney was a big baby and didn't congradulate U2 on winning album of the year and stormed out of the room. Just shows you what  kind of people show up and are nominated for these pathetically pretensious award shows.
B000002BFL|5.0|This is undeniably the boss' best album to date. While not as hollow and rough as Nebraska, Tom Joad is a more polished album, closer in sound to his new Devil's and Dust. Yet it manages to outdo that album as well by avoiding some of the pop aspects that cause it to lose some of the chilling qualities. If you are a music lover, and you want to put on a record and actually listen to the music, the lyrics, and appreciate some genuine American art, then this is the album for you. If you want to dance to music without having a clue about what the songs mean I reccomend Born in the USA.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Man I guess ignorance is bliss. Kudos to these guys for finding an audience so young or ignorant to actually think that this is punk music. I will not even bother trying to write down some real punk bands because I know that it will fall on deaf ears, so I will just continue \\"Punking this band.\\" Which as I said before is about the only time that I will write the word punk and Green Day in the same sentence. I knew more than ten years ago when that album \\" Douchie\\" came out that all was lost in punk music, and man was I right. These guys have given birth to dozens of versions of this type of music. Some of which are even more putrid than these guys. Billy Joe or whatever his name is brought his band to my neck of the woods when douchie, (this is what I call the album, no it's not a mistake.) came out, and there was a riot outside. Some real punks showed up and man were they pissed. There almost wasn't a show that night, in fact if I remember correctly the gang cut their set short because they were shi**ing in their pants the entire time. It was rather amuzing. Anyway crappy band, crappy music. NUFF SAID!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is one of the greatest tv shows of all time.  It's so cleverly written and well directed that I can't even believe it was ever cancelled.  The movie Serenity was amazing as well, but that movie could have provided another season or two since they had to rush the storyline and left so many things unfinished.  When I finished watching all the episodes of Firefly and Serenity, I honestly felt like I had an addiction that could no longer be fufilled.  Many thanks to Joss Whedon for making such an amazing series.
B0002IU988|1.0|I think they sound more like a mix of CREED, and SOUNDGARDEN, than Creed and Pearl Jam. But I don't think it matters a whole lot to be honest. Because if your a fan of Creed you will probably be a fan of this. I have never been a fan of Creed, I think that they were one of the worst bands of the last ten years. I did in fact listen to the entire album and there is nothing exiting in any of the songs, they sound incredibly thought out in ways to maximize their airplay. Which just leads to nothing important or relevant in what they are playing!
B000002LCK|3.0|Let's forget the music for a minute. This item retails for $25. For that kind of money, you could be getting reissued artwork, remastered sound, and an expanded booklet. Instead, you actually get the same release that people bought 19 years ago, in 1987: Two near-blank pieces of paper slipped inside a bulky jewel case and two pictureless discs with primitive sound quality. Being one of New Order's most acclaimed releases, you'd think they'd give Substance a modern treatment by now.
B0002S94OS|4.0|I have been guilty in the recent past of lumping these guys in with nu-meal ticket rock and other forms of radio gah-gah. I was listening to the radio in my car one day with a friend and a song come on the radio and just before I changed the station I turned to him and asked him if he knew who was playing that crap, he said Lamb of God. But after listening to this album there is noway in HE** that it could have been. There is not one \\" Hey fans we are going to write a horrible corporate radio song to sell records.\\" song on this entire record and man does it make me fu*king happy to say that, in fact I never realized that I would ever feel that good saying that about hardcore music in my life. But with what is being passed off as heavy/hardcore music i really had no other option. The only reason, and I mean only reason why I didn't give this a resounding 5 STAR is because there are a few songs where I can't tell them apart. But hopefully that will change on the next project and beyond. Great fu*king umcompromising music!!!!!
B0007VZ9DK|3.0|this has always been my struggle with scorcese. he is clearly one of the most talented filmmakers alive today. Taxi, Cape Fear, Goodfellas, his foray into edith wharton -- all classic movies. but despite the usual brilliance -- the great acting of de niro, pesce, stone & woods, the screenplay, the cinematography -- the brutality of this movie tipped it to the negative for me. <br /> <br />i am not saying it's less than brilliant filmmaking. i'm just saying for this viewer it is too much too watch.
B000006TRV|5.0|Ok, to be honest, I really don't care what this album is about as much as how much musical genius was put into it. I have been reading the reviews and see people using the words asinine and redudant. What the hell are you talking about? This isn't a book you moron. Why would you use such words when you do not have a clue what you are talking about? This whole album was written by a band, who as far as I know, had little if any musical theory background. And they wrote this? Are you kidding me? Gilmour plays with outstanding feeling, he does'nt have the best chops, but this whole band can write some absolutely amazing songs. What really got me into this cd was the song \\"The Trial\\", the whole composition and arrangement of the song is amazing. It can even be really trippy when you are high. Not to mention \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\", the songs progression movies from major chords to minor chords giving it an even darker feel. This is one of the best bands ever, with such an overwhelming amount of talent. Everything on it is amazing, and can be really laid back at times with an almost scary feeling. Get this cd if you like progressive rock or any kind of psychodelic music with actual talent. This is the kind of band that Bach, Mozart, or Pagini would be listening to if they were alive today. And the cd gets better the more you listen to it, becuase I actually didn't like it very much as first. So do yourself a favor, and buy this cd. You won't regret it.
B00003CWL6|2.0|this movie failed to live up to the hype for me. perhaps the title is ironic -- the movie wallows in depression, vapidity and numbness. i bet a lot of people have empty lives; it's not a lot of fun to watch for two hours nor did this movie bring me any new insights or empathy. spacey is unquestionably a great actor but i found him unappealing and occasionally bordering on repulsive.
B00005JOFO|5.0|The film received Golden Globes for best director, screenplay, and drama film (just to name a few of many awards recieved in other conventions). It is no wonder Ang Lee's adaptation of E. Annie Proulx's story Brokeback Mountain is a triumph and a beautiful one at that.     This movie could have very well been a mess, but with the dedicated musicians, producers, director, writers, and especially actors, it left me speechless. Both Jake Gyllenhaal (as Jack Twist) and Heath Ledger (as Ennis Del Mar) in my opinion were spectacular. Two hetrogenically separate characters, that ironically mixes with such grace and beauty. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also presented an amazing roll as the two guys' wives. It touched on such a sensitive and controversial story about the loneliness of homosexuality in society of Wyoming, 1963. But fundamentally, it was more than a gay cowboy film; it was an extremely passionate story about love in which everyone who has been in can relate to, and learn so much for from it. It's an extremely beautiful and poignant film with stunning cinematography that captures the audience in a deep, deep place within. I'm still speechless to this day. I'm utterly, utterly speechless.    The beautiful score by Argentina-born, California-based Gustavo Santaolalla sent shivers down my spine. He provided the film with a true breathtaking western score of crisp and melancholy sounds from violins, banjos, acoustic guitars and other westerly influenced instruments. I literally choke up if I ever listen to the soundtrack, that's when you know there is something special in the music that follows the story. The soundtrack also includes heartfelt music by Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, Teddy Thompson, Mary McBride, Rufus Wainwright (who appeared on Antony and the Johnson's stunning album, \\"I Am a Bird Now\\") and many others.     People say it's slow, but I disagree. I think it's honest and true. I hate drama films that have this relationship with two people meeting on streets cutting to them dating all of a sudden cutting to them getting married. I mean, what's the point of that. I could just easily watch TV (which I don't). The best parts are in between and are always missed out. This movie shows and captures a love relationship that hides nothing, and I have total respect for that. The story, the acting was all so solid. Thus, potentially making it my favourite film of the 20 years I've been on this earth. Honest to god, it was that good. I have never ever been so moved in my entire life.    I'm also amazed how far we have come from having this sort of film leaked into the mainstream - and for the first time of my life time. All I can say is \\"wow\\". Even though I don't agree that we're all compromising and accepting, it is very gutsy and brave of Ang Lee to bring this to the big screen; a start of something revolutionary in cinemas. The most touching part about this film is that even though it's a period film, it is still relatable and put into context gay or straight.     What a incredible multilayered story with such a superb crew. Its truthful perception of a same-sex relationship has generated admiration and controversy. Brokeback Mountain truly proves to be an epic, and should never be forgotten; not only as a great gay story, but as a tragic and heartbreaking love tale between two lovers that couldn't be. An impossible love.    Look out, Oscars!
B0009QTS1M|5.0|where to start -- the absolutely stunning cinematography starting with the very first scene of the romans fighting germanic tribes. the fantastic acting by crowe, phoenix and the rest of the cast. the pungent, exotic, enticing depiction of rome. on and on -- this is filmmaking at its best.
B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah Carey's Daydream is one of the best albums of the 90's as she is the best singer ever and the best selling female artist of the 90's. I highly recommend it, if you are a fan of hers or just a music fan, you will love this album. <br /> <br />\\"Fantasy\\" a great, upbeat 1st single and great song to listen to while driving in your car with your friends on a summer day. 10/10 <br />\\"Underneath the Stars\\" A nice and peaceful song but my least favorite on the album yet it's still great. I still listen to it. 7/10 <br />\\"One Sweet Day\\" A beautiful ballad with Boyz II Men. 10/10 <br />\\"Open Arms\\" This is a remake of the 1980's version and she does a great job with it. 10/10 <br />\\"Always Be My Baby\\" I personally love this song. One of her best songs and it has a great R&B feel to it. 10/10 <br />\\"I Am Free\\" Another ballad she wrote with Walter. Anything with him is sure to be beautiful. 8/10 <br />\\"When I Saw You\\" Another one of her beautiful ballads. 9/10 <br />\\"Long Ago\\" A good song and it has a very R&B feel to it. 9/10 <br />\\"Melt Away\\" I love this song also. She wrote this with Babyface. It's a great mid-tempo song. 10/10 <br />\\"Forever\\" Another great ballad where she really showcases her voice beautifully. It has a 50's feel to it. 10/10 <br />\\"Daydream Interlude\\" This is a club mix inturlude. It's ok. 6/10 <br />\\"Looking In\\" The album ends with this haunting ballad where she sings that she's as normal as all of us. 9/10 <br /> <br />Lastly, I do believe this is one Mariah's best and if you like her get this and all her albums. She's the bomb and to all the haters: dont hate, appreciate the best singer in the world!
1401206905|5.0|Batman Year One was not just a re-introduction to Batman, but my real introduction to its author Frank Miller. Never had I read a comic that came to life and provoked such emotion and wonderment while reading it. The story is an astonishing retelling of the Batman legend, but also filled with that gritty, raw edge that Frank Miller brings to his comics. I found myself not wanting to put the book down; and once finished I only wanted more. This was not the campy \\"Caped Crusader\\" Adam West variety Batman that I grew up watching on TV re-runs (nor is it the annoying Batman as seen in the films by Joel \\"I make the worst Batman films\\" Schumacher). Miller's Batman is the Dark Knight, the shadowy figure scaring the hell out of criminals and staking his claim that Gotham City is his own.<br /><br />What makes \\"Batman Year One\\" so good is Miller's attention to character depth and pathos. I could taste Bruce Wayne's guilt ridden conscience over his parents murder, or the pleasure Batman got from threatening Carmine Falcone as well as the worry and anxiety Jim Gordon felt when his family is threatened. Miller is a master and \\"Batman Year One\\" is reflects this. In addition, the art work of David Mazzucchelli was also a great complement to the world that Miller conjures. When remembering the story, Mazzucchelli's drawing always come to mind.<br /><br />\\"Batman Year One\\" is without a doubt a classic. Definitely one that I love to read and re-read time and again.<br /><br />Caesar says thumbs up!
B00004RJ74|2.0|The film looks good. That cannot be denied. It looks stylish and is directed with flair. Unfortunately, the script plays out like it's the product of an immature adolecent personality who needs to get out more and mix with other kids his own age. The dialogue is just cringeworthy. <br /> <br />One cannot help but think that someone indulged Tarantino based on previous successes in funding this project - indulged him to the point of allowing him to act in it - and made a big boob on all counts. <br /> <br />I scare easy but this vampire horror movie with all its (much trumpeted) blood and guts didn't produce a single goosebump. It was like watching a cartoon. <br /> <br />Disappointing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0380789035|5.0|...no surprise there. He really takes advantage of the space allotted by the novel format (as opposed to the comics, short stories, and children's books he was once more known for). This wildly ambitious book works in several ways: as a fantasy epic, as a satiric look at American culture, as the character study of a flawed but basically good man, as a portrait of a troubled relationship, as a suspense novel, and in creating its own modern mythology out of disparate elements (which do owe quite a bit to Gaiman's earlier work on Sandman, where Odin, Bast, Loki, and a number of the other characters also appear). It is a remarkably fast-paced read, with surprises popping up almost constantly, and occasionally jaw-dropping revelations. Gaiman is a master of plotting as well as characterization.<br /><br />I think that I can say without fear of hyperbole that this book is one of the greatest things of any kind ever created. Ever. (Okay, maybe there was some hyperbole there).
B0002CTQYW|5.0|Before it became a movie the dinning game was a very successful play in France for many years. Jacques Villeret one of the greatest French comedians (he died in January 2005) was playing the same character. When it came out in French theaters in 1998 it was even more successful than the Titanic! No wonder since it is a great comedy. Almost the entire movie takes place in an appartment in Paris and the sequence of funny events is unstoppable.<br />As the movie unfolds it makes you hate arrogance way more than stupidity, although who is smart and who is stupid is an open subject at the end of the movie.<br />It seems that stupidity comes out victoriously when faced with arrogance.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I miss the \\"artistic\\" Madonna that gave us Ray of Light or Like A Prayer, but this album is burning up my stereo and putting me in a great mood when I need it. The songs are short on lyrics but incredible on production and Madonna's singing is excellent (especially when she uses the lower register of her voice on \\"Jump.\\" The two standout tracks here are \\"Jump,\\" and \\"Sorry.\\" Who said dance music was dead?
B000AL730O|4.0|This album has been out for a while now; but for some reason, this ol' Beatle fan hadn't picked it up till just now. I just listened to it for the first time last night.   Wow....OK Paul! <br />  <br />I am really impressed.  I think this is probably Sir Paul's most creative SOLO effort to date. \\"Flowers In The Dirt\\" was a solid album in the late 80's...  and \\"Flaming Pie\\" was pretty good in the mid-90's.  His first solo album is, of course, a classic. A lot of his other solo albums had too much filler stuff amidst the good songs, IMHO. <br />But this album is a different departure for him, and a WELCOME ONE in my opinion. <br />What is missing:  The schmaltzy (silly) love songs we have lovingly become accustomed to...  and I don't really miss that. We have enough \\"Pop McCartney\\". <br />What is new:  Some more imaginative music melody lines layered behind his vocal melody lines, nicely complimenting each other. And lyrics that seem to uncover a more personal side of the man. <br />  <br />In summary, the music AND the lyrics are collectively some of the \\"deepest\\" work McCartney has ever done.  It's mostly a very mellow album, but it flows eloquently. <br />  <br />The storied Beatle's entire life is one big encyclopedia of musical compositions. It is really refreshing to see him entering the twilight of his life, and produce a serious piece of work with so much personal meaning and intelligent sound. I have always looked forward to great new songs on Paul's new albums, even though the albums as a whole never really took me on a \\"journey\\" anywhere. This one does. <br />  <br />Funny how things transition in such an accomplished career. His previous studio solo album (\\"Driving Rain\\") was probably his worst ever in my personal opinion. I was very disappointed in that effort. Now, he may have put out his best album ever.   <br />A must for any Beatle-enthusiast's catalog. This is a work not to be overlooked.
1932100385|5.0|The China Study is the best information on nutrition that I have ever found. It is compelling, interesting, scary, and well written all at once. I beg all nutrition professionals, of which I am one, to read this book because it will take everything learned in school and since and turn it upsidedown. We complicate all things concerning nutrition. We try to compartmentalize each and every nutrient, both macro and micro. And yet every study trying to show the benefit or lack of benefit from a single nutrient fails to show conclusive results. The most recent case in point would be the $400+ million study designed to finally prove that a low fat diet is beneficial to a woman's health. The study did no such thing; there was no quantifiable difference between a high fat or a lowfat diet on breast cancer, heart disease, stroke etc. Why? Because the answer is in the type of overall diet we eat. A diet comprised of all foods of plant origin and no meat or meat products is shown conclusively in this book to be the only answer to both prevention and reversal of all diseases of affluence. All I can say is read this book! Now! Before it is too late for you and your family.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Yep, this CD rocks big time and is IMO the best album VH has done. Only 1984 comes close to rivaling this hard hitting rocker. Eddie Van Halen introduced us to a new type of guitar work in the debut of this classic rock monster group. David Lee Roth provided the vocals that catipulted VH into years of success until the ego of Roth got in the way of the group's progress. \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\", \\"Eruption\\", \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\", Kinks remake \\"You Really Got Me\\", and \\"Jamie's Cryin\\" are a few of the choice cuts. A must have for new fans and classic rock buffs.

B0006399FS|5.0|This is an excellent album and brings U2 back to it's roots. More along the lines of \\"Unforgettable Fire\\", \\"The Joshua Tree\\", \\"Rattle and Hum\\", \\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\". Classic U2 and well deserving of it's Grammy Award. A must have for any U2 fan.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Despite, the story lines to the movie is pretty much a rip-off of \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\". I mean with Lara Croft finishing her father work after he disappers (Ring, Ring). I love the opening scene to the movie. The action's not that great, but I has a good look. Jolie is good as Croft. I don't agree with Roger Ebert, saying that this was better than \\"The Mummy Returns\\". I think it's the other way around, but that another story.  And Graeme Revell's score has it's moments, especially the father/ daughter reunion suite. Plus the DVD has some goods on it worth checking out. The best are the deleted/extended scenes ( That actually would've helped the film story-wise.) and insightful commentary by Simon West on why exactly he made \\"Tomb Raider\\" the way he did. All in all \\"Lara Croft:Tomb Raider\\" is a pretty good movie.
B00004RFFI|2.0|The opening scene was pretty dramatic but it was all downhill after that. Twister lacks in the reality department. The chances of this group of storm chasers chasing so many tornadoes in such a short period of time is slim to impossible. Nobody would survive the \\"gully tornado\\". It sucked the truck up and it would also have sucked them up. Nobody, storm chaser or not, would get as close to F-3, 4 or 5 tornadoes as this group did unless they were on a suicide mission. Lastly, an F-5 twister (or any twister for that matter) has a forward motion (speed) of anywhere from 30 to 50 mph and Paxton and Hunt could have never outrun the storm, avoid debris from all directions or made it in time to tie themselves to some plumbing and hope to live. Special effects were good for the time period but that's where the accolades end.
B00014K5TQ|1.0|This is simply an attempt at making something artistic, which it is not. The acting is horrible, and the story is lame. I fell asleep watchning this. Don't waste your time and money on this steamy pile of crap.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Frantic. Emotional. Haunting. Unpredictable.   <br /> <br />SOAD truly sets a new precedent with Mezmerize and Hypnotize. I'm floored by the symbiotic relationship between the lead singers and the way they bring their distinct stylistic differences to the table along with the melodic irregularity within each song and across both albums.  The smart lyrical weightiness of the songs sets the perfect edgy and powerful mood.  <br /> <br />My favorites: <br />Solider Side <br />Lonely Day <br />Sad Statue <br />B.Y.O.B <br />Cigaro <br />Revenga <br /> <br />I developed a newfound appreciation for Steal this Album! with Roulette, Ego Brain, Mr. Jack, and Bubbles leading the charge.   <br /> <br />Be prepared for an incredible musical and artistic experience.   <br />
B00005K3NY|5.0|Anyone looking for a movie that is anything but plain, look no further. Any Cronenberg fan should own this movie. The man is brilliant, and under rated. BUY IT NOW!
B000001FS3|5.0|This was U2's glory days. After Achtung Baby, U2's greatest effort, we had to deal with Zoopara, October, Pop, All That You Can't Leave Behind, and How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. I can't stand any U2 album after Achtung Baby. I like the political, protestant U2, not the shallow love and romance U2. But anyway, the album...<br /><br /> It deservedly sold over 10million copies in the U.S., it's an incredible album of human angst and harshness. The Edge gets to stand out on this album, and he showed the world that he was a guitarist like no other. The Edge plays a... different guitar, you know? I can't really explain it, but his guitar work isn't something you'll hear in an every day radio song. Adam's bass still sucks, we all know that, and Larry even admits that he's not a good drummer. Bono also gets his share of glory, with his honest songwriting; plus, his voice even improved a little on this record. It's clever that U2 used a joshua tree to represent this album. A joshua tree can survive in just about the dryest environment you can imagine, so I guess U2 are trying to pass of that they can survive in any state. With Or Without You is one of the highlights on the album, as is I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, and they both live up to the hype. My personal favorite song off The Joshua Tree is Bullet The Blue Sky. It is one of the most brutal, most political songs I've ever heard.<br /><br /> So...I don't really know what else to say. The Joshua Tree is one of the best albums of the 80's, and it lives far beyond the hype. Buy it. Now. Please. Even if you're only going to buy 3 or 4 records in your wholelife, make sure this is one of them.
B00006LPEY|5.0|Many have said its over rated which may be true, HOWEVER its is still a must have for all anime fans. There isn't much of anything that I can say that hasn't been already, So I will simply say that it is a great movie that should be in every anime collection.
B00007LTIC|5.0|Going For The One... well, the one must've been musical genious because that is exactly what this album is. Going For The One is an amazing and beautiful progressive rock album that easily ranks among Yes's best. It's right up there with Relayer and Close To The Edge. I still remember the awe I was in after I heard the Going For The One. It immediately became not only one of my favorite Yes songs, but one of my favorite songs period. It's strong from start to finish, and every song will engulf you into it's magic. Wonderous Stories and Turn Of The Century are the highlights of the album, and it would be wise to not overlook them. If you are a Yes fan, I urge you to buy this album as quickly as you can. It's a work of art and one of Yes's best albums; even the bonus tracks are great. To overlook this album would be a big mistake.
B00003CX9E|1.0|No, I am not ashamed to say the above.  It is the truth.  To Each His Own and I'm glad for the five-star reviews who are able to get something from this film.  I am not one of those but I am not sorry.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya is one of those artists that inspire polor opposite reactions in people. I love her music and this cd in particular is my favorite since Shepherd Moons. I didn't care for A Day Without Rain's too samey-sounding tracks and Memory of Trees prior to that was okay with several beautiful tunes (Once you had Gold is outstanding. This recording has many beautiful moments and not a bad cut to be found. Beware Enya haters! You will find nothing hear to enjoy! I thought i heard it all till I read the review here compating her to Charles Manson! Hilarious that such beautiful music can cause such hateful reactions!

B000B7BRMM|3.0|This CD is so different from Diana Krall's other work.  Her marvelous piano work (\\"mediocre\\" says another reviewer -- say what??) and the incredible talents of her band are the feature points in most of her CDs.  That's why they're so great.  Her vocal work is just a little \\"extra something\\" added on to her great instrumentals.   <br /> <br />However, on \\"Christmas Songs,\\" the singing is at the forefront, and frankly, she's not that great a singer.  She's better at punctuating the instrumentals with her voice than carrying an entire song with her singing.  The arrangements are dull and straightforward with none of the jazzy swing Diana Krall is so famous for.  It sounds like this CD was knocked out in a minimal amount of time with a minimal amount of effort.  <br /> <br />Alas, I listened to this CD only twice this past Christmas.  It did nothing for me.  I listened instead to James Taylor's 2004 holiday CD over and and over.  That one's a keeper!
B00028HBKM|5.0|It is the BEST movie that I have ever seen in my whole life. The careful detail that the staff ( and of course, Mel Gibson )follows is simply INCREDIBLE. I thought that I was REALLY witnessing Jesus during His terrible ordeal.  <br />The fact that the movie is spoken in the original language that Jesus spoke, and the Romans spoke, places the re-creation at so high a level that is impossible to describe. You just have to sit and watch. Nothing else for the spectator to do. <br />I never thought that mortal people could reproduce this crucial part of Jesus' life ( and death )with such reality. <br />Concerning the accusations of antisemitism, they just don't fit. With the same logic you might say that The Bible is antisemitic.  <br />To be more specific, for example, when Simon de Cirene helps Jesus to carry The Cross, the Romans call him: \\"Jew\\" and not in a pleasant way. But in spite of being a Jew, Simon helps Jesus and defends Him.   <br />You might say that the Romans are antisemitic. Has somebody said it ?

0671027387|5.0|This book by Dan Brown was suspenseful and entertaining and had me turning pages and sitting on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down until I finished. Although some would find it unbelievable that the U.S. government and NASA would deceive the world into believing they had found a meteor, containing the fossil of an extraterrestrial, because I have never believed in UFOs, I found it well-written and well-plotted. I think Mr. Brown did an excellent job of confirming what I had believed all along--someone made a mistake. I also admired the courage of the hero and heroine of this novel who risked their lives in the Arctic cold, on a shark-infested ship and in the unpredictable political climate of Washington to make sure the world learned the truth. I rated this book five stars, and I don't do that often.

0784011680|4.0|I thought this a fine film with lots of wonderful actors - how can you go wrong with Kevin Kline and Anthony Hopkins?  Never felt long at 2 1/2 hours.

B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden's always been one of those bands, no matter how many ups or downs in their career, have been and will continue to be hailed as one of the best. As much as I listen to Powerslave (Iron Maiden's best album in my opinion!) and try to play the iconoclast, it just becomes more apparent what a great album it is. Impeccable musicianship, highly memorable songwriting, intelligent histrionics, and the delivery is just pure energy.<br /><br />\\"Aces High\\" is known as one of Iron Maiden's most popular songs, and for good reason. Centering around the Blitz, this song is known for highly propulsive and addictive verses, and a high-octane chorus complimented by Dickinson's controversial siren wail. Speaking of which, Bruce Dickinson has one of the best voices in metal in my opinion. He can convey a massive spectrum of emotions in a single fluctuating, vibrato scream. The next song, \\"2 Minutes To Midnight,\\" is my favorite Maiden song. Dickinson spits out a highly sarcastic, patronizing critique of imperialism, and the so-called glamour and prestige of its orchestrators. \\"...The children starving in millions, to make a better kind of gun.\\" Steve Harris' propelling bass becomes extremely prevalent, and even jazzy before the chorus. \\"Losfer Words\\" is a lively instrumental. Highly melodic and driving guitar wizardry courtesy of Dave Murray, but kinda filler.<br /><br />With lyrics like \\"As a young boy chasing dragons, with your wooden blade so mighty...,\\" it doesn't take long to figure out the frenzied track \\"Flash of The Blade\\" is the blueprint for modern power metal. The track wastes no time getting to the kinetic chorus. \\"Duelists\\" is mostly instrumental, but Dickinson's infrequent vocals are dexterious and rapidly ascend into an eerily comfortable falsetto. Lots of admirable soloing. The next track, the underrated \\"Back In The Village,\\" has some incredibly potent melodies in the verses that the chorus honestly can't compare to.<br /><br />The title track has a cool Egyptian motif that's not over-emphasized enough to get corny. The song sounds toxic at points, with omniscient vocals and palm-muted chugging, but the track is mostly melancholic and powerful-- Even the solo half-way through is heartwrenching. Finally, the 13 minute epic \\"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\\" is one of the most infectious songs ever. It makes a transition from harmonically adventurous and catchy to chilling and atmospheric, then back again, much like the gallant poem that bears its name. I can't summon a vocabulary large enough to describe the track without droning on for paragraphs, so keep that in mind if I made it sound bland.<br /><br />Iron Maiden is sort of hit-or-miss. And this album if definitely the former. Essential.<br /><br />- Thus says the Pellingtonool Egyptian motif that's not over-emphasized enough to get corny.

B00005V1Y0|5.0|Simply wonderful movie!  Combination of \\"Carmen\\" (the flamenco film, not the opera, and if you have never seen that, well, do), and \\"The Cutting Edge\\", with lots of hysterical satire thrown in.  Male lead not bad to watch and a very good dancer - his partner was not so skilled.  They were sort've like Torvil and Dean (of Olympics fame) on the dance floor.  This film won the Australian Oscar.  Rather formulaic plot; the dancing is the thing here.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This is an uncompromising and equally graphic adaptation (Rodriguez called it a \\"translation\\") of Frank Miller's series of vivid graphic novels, filled with thoroughly noir images and over-the-top comic book dialogue (some of which reminded me of HEAVY METAL in the old days), shot mostly in black-and-white with color overlays where they serve a purpose (i.e., Junior and blood in general, except when the blood is white). The story lines used were \\"The Hard Goodbye,\\" \\"The Big Fat Kill,\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard,\\"as well as the short piece \\"The Customer is Always Right\\" -- and the story titles all appear in the dialogue. Mickey Rourke is almost unrecognizable as the bloody-minded warrior-god Marv, Clive Owen is terrific as the good-guy-bad-guy Dwight, Elijah Wood is downright creepy as the cannibal-ninja Kevin, and Bernicio Del Toro makes a good Jackie Boy, especially as the dead body version. Bruce Willis does a very good job playing a Bruce Willis character, in this case a vengeful cop. Jessica Alba is always extremely watchable, though her acting this time isn't very impressive. (The only one they missed getting for this film, who really belonged in it, was Christopher Walken.) And Rodriguez is obviously a major fan of Miller's work. There's also a lot of Tarantino-esque recursion in the plot line (not to mention that the character of Miho is straight out the Crazy-88 in _Kill Bill_, and so are her weapons), reminiscent of _Pulp Fiction_: The beginning isn't necessarily the beginning, nor is the end the end. Of course, there's a _Sin City 2_ coming, and then _Sin City 3_. I'm pleased to say this is a film your parents (or, in my case, my wife) will hate, with no redeeming social values whatever.
B000AMMSQC|5.0|This is a must to have Swan Lake version. I bought the CD thinking about Zakharova because I never had the opportunity to see her and I was curious about her. I have to agree with the review below that Russian trained ballerinas are suitable for ballets like Sawn Lake, specially for their arms that they know how use like no other school. Zakharova is no exception. It is a shame film editors don't realized those little details are very important fro ballet fans. I need to see the whole body face, legs (points included), arms, hands, neck, everything Unfortunately those DVDs are made for everybody and not just a selected public. <br /> <br />This edition has a lot of moments where I was really mad because there were so many things happening and the cam was elsewhere, specially at the end of the ballet when Sigfried is struggling to overcome the flooding and Odette is agonizing as she watches her lover from the distant. It's amazing how she can keep her arms, legs the whole body moving all the time, I think it's a very difficult moment for any ballerina. <br /> <br />Zakharova's Odette is full of passion and love, almost too beautiful, esthetically perfect. She has the perfect ballerina body, with long legs, amazing feet and beautiful arms. She also has a powerful technical, I didn't find her cold (although I can imagine she could be) and she was able to sort all difficulties in the ballet. But for me the big revelation was Bolle, I didn't remember he dances in Alessandre Ferri's Giselle (in la Scalla as well) one of the two peasants, a friend of mine remind me about it suddenly strike me, when I saw that Giselle, I always thought he was a better option for Albretch than the principal Dancer, now I'm certain about it. He is the perfect noble dancer he is the right combination between technic, style, beauty and body. He has everything turns, jumps, body control, elasticity. I particularly think he is the big star on this production, he was a real prince all the time andconstantly assisting Zakharova when they danced together. I did some research afterwards and he has danced with Alessandra Romeo and Juliet, I really regret now the version on DVD is with Angel Corella (a good dancer) , I would love to see those two together (Ferri and Bolle) <br /> <br />About her fouttes I think she did a remarkable job considering her feet, it's really hard to turn when you have feet like hers and like Alessandra Ferri, the ballerina tends to loose the center and that's the end. I have to say I've never seen Black Swan fouttes finishes like, but I've seen it in other pas the deux, I have to say it's very difficult to finish fouettes like that, it's harder than the traditional way. In my opinion she was perfect a the end, everything went smooth and they both managed to keep the rhythm which is very important and really hard to achieve <br /> <br /> I honestly don't care much about the ornaments and productions, I need good dancers and logic choreographies to enjoy a ballet.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've seen every one of the versions of P&P that are available: 1940, 1980 and 1995.  I've seen Bride & Prejudice and Pride & Prejudice, A Latter-Day Comedy.  Each one has something to offer, and this new version is no exception.  <br /> <br />I really liked how they cast actors who were very close in age to those in the book.  Keira Knightley's youthful exuberance was endearing, and I enjoyed watching her mature before our eyes. Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Darcy was more nuanced than any I have seen before. This version doesn't need made-up fencing, bathtub and wet t-shirt scenes to show us his intensity and his sensuality.  He and Knightley both have very expressive eyes and an understanding that less is more.  They have a chemistry that is almost palpable.  <br /> <br />It's not everyone's cup of tea (especially for the Firth fangirls), but it is mine, and I love it to death.  I saw it 9 times in the theater, and have seen it twice at home (so far) via the UK edition of the DVD.  I look forward to seeing the extras on the US disc.
B00004TJKI|5.0|It would seem that 1959's ANATOMY OF A MURDER was the first film to break the Hollywood \\"production code\\" in terms of using sexual terminology on screen.  Watching the movie makes one begin to understand how Hitchcock's PSYCHO happened a year later.  Otto Preminger (whose movie about drug abuse, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM, had challenged the code in 1955) in ANATOMY OF A MURDER tells the story of lately unsuccessful bachelor lawyer Paul Biegler, who takes up the task of defending young Army Lieutenant Manion, who murdered his wife's rapist.  As Biegler, who though easygoing (he loves jazz) is no fool, James Stewart gives an intense performance.  The hard-boiled reporter of CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is there in his characterization, as is the Jefferson Smith (of MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON)-type idealist.  As Laura Manion, Lee Remick is perfect, providing just the right amount of ambiguity (did this \\"voluptuous\\" woman subtly lead her rapist on?  Is her marriage really so happy?) to make her character as fascinating as is Stewart's.  Likewise, Ben Gazzara's Manion is hardly a sympathetic convict:  he may have been justified in his crime, but he may also be a wife-beater.  Riveting performances are given by George C. Scott as the prosecuting attorney, Claude Dancer, and Murray Hamilton as a witness for the prosecution.  Just as his surname suggests, the big-city lawyer \\"dances\\" around the issues, rarely posing direct questions - yet he is so suave, dignified, and (at first) deferential in his manner that one scarcely notices how devious he is; his strength lies in this.  Hamilton stands out as the murder victim's friend, who tries to save his memory but who withers in the face of Biegler's merciless questions.  And this realist film contains two performances by non-actors:  McCarthy era attorney Joseph N. Welch is delightfully natural as the judge; Duke Ellington, who wrote the movie's score, has a cameo as Biegler's jazz musician pal.  Some may find Ellington's jazz scorewrong for a small-town courtroom drama, but I think it appropriate on two counts.  First, it is motivated by the protagonist's love of jazz, and second, it fits the sophisticated nature of the film's subject matter.  To sum up:  both as a daring `50's movie and as a standard-setter in edge-of-your-seat courtroom drama, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is essential viewing.   <br /> <br />
6305949980|5.0|The movie opens with Jack Skellington, AKA the Pumpkin King, facing an identity crisis of sorts. Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace \\"Sandy Claws\\" on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.<br /><br />While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, ruins Christmas but never figures out where he went wrong. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.<br /><br />Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -\\"I'm only an elected official here!  I can't make decisions!\\" Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is \\"You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having.\\"<br /><br />Besides being clever and funny, this film is visually intriguing. All of the figures move smoothly and naturally, and the attention to detail is exquisite. The process of making this film required what was then (pre-1993) state-of-the-art computer-controlled camera movement for this feature film's stop-motion animation. Puppets built of a foam latex material covering intricate metal armatures were manipulated frame-by-frame on real miniature sets. The painstaking process took nearly three years to complete, with dozens of animators and crew members averaging only 60 seconds of film per week, because each different pose or position equaled only a 24th of a second of film time.<br /><br />You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as \\"Beetlejuice\\". You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family.very straightforward so that children can easily follow it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you were expecting a star wars or battlestar galactica type sci-fi adventure, this one may not be for you. I found the similarities between the final frontier of space and the western frontier of exploration to work well. The intro music alone explains the mindset of the captain and the humor amongst the crew is at times blurt out funny. The show has so much depth and so many stories to tell that it seems to be crime not to finish those stories. I personally would like to see Shepherd Book's story come to fruition. We can only hope that continued fan support can convince someone to allow this to happen. If you want a break from a sterile vision of the future this one may suit you. This is a different vision of 500 years in the future and it works painfully well. I say painfully because there remains SO MUCH untold and may never be told. what a shame.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|Excellent! I didn't think I'd like the adaptation of the famed creators of strange, and sometimes haunting, fairytales, but I was wrong. The movie was entertaining, humorous, and wonderfully done. There's enough horror to keep your eyes wide open and enough twists to keep the viewer guessing. The acting was superb.

0060989157|4.0|Motley Crue is messed up. There is no other way to describe the four men who make up this 80's hard rock monster. They did drugs non-stop, confused alcohol for water and basically reveled in every hard rock clich&eacute; ever invented.<br /><br />And that is what makes The Dirt such a surprisingly compelling book, because this is as unabashed and clear-cut of a description of the excesses of the rock n roll lifestyle you will ever read. Forget the term warts and all, it's more like giant gashes gushing blood and all.<br /><br />The layout of the book takes you from the beginnings of the band to its highpoint as multi platinum sellers and it just keeps going. Each band member, as well as managers, industry people and even one album wonder John Corabi take turns telling the tales that make up the madness that is Motley Crue.<br /><br />The personalized style of each chapter makes the stories told that much more authentic as each member's section seems to take on its own form, Tommy Lee's chapters for example are littered with dude's that reveal a child like nature.<br /><br />What is so stunning about the book is the wisdom that can be taken from such self-destruction. Nicki Sixx's personal tales of non-stop drug use make his self-analysis of his problem seem more authentic than a psychiatrist as his first hand experiences make you somehow respect him, despite the fact he is clearly a flawed human being.<br /><br />There is also sadness throughout The Dirt as each band member faces what can only be described as real down periods in his life. Whether it is Vince Neil's description of his daughter dying, Mick Mars's daily struggle with a disease that affects his spine, Tommy Lee's time in jail or Nicki Sixx's over dousing on drugs, these guys all have chapters that rip the lid off of the ideals of sex, drugs and rock n roll and drown you in some all too sad realities.<br /><br />The resulting reading of The Dirt is actually a sobering experience. As you come in expecting a description of a wild, non-stop partying lifestyle and instead you are hit with the realities that these hard rock clich&eacute;s are actually fuelled by human behaviour, very flawed human behaviour.n expecting a description of a wild, non-stop partying lifestyle and instead you are hit with the realities that these hard rock clichs are actually fuelled by human behaviour, very flawed human behaviour.   <br />
B000AP04FG|4.0|Pretty good movie and though I dislike Angelina Jolie, I have to admit, she did a great job. Ditto for Brad Pitt. Though a little over violent (not a kiddy movie), Mr. and Mrs. Smith has a good story line. Two secret agents from opposing sides are married and they don't know each other's secret lives.... I would see it again.

B000BYRCH4|5.0|\\"Into the Blue\\" is not a great movie, but it was never meant to be. What Director John Stockwell wanted to do was make a suspensful, and beautiful looking film. He fills his camera with breathtaking underwater shots and the amazing bahamas islands. Also haveing the half naked Jessica Alba and Paul Walker helps a lot. The plot is neat, it combines the old theme of treasure hunting and adds a new age spin of drug dealing. Its not great but really works for the film. \\"Into the Blue\\" is fun, and entertaining. Its great to watch on a snowy afternoon. I dont get how people think this is a bad movie. Its a very servicable film that holds up to repeated viewings. Its not art but was never meant to be. Its just a great time. My rating B+
B00005JO04|1.0|I really don't even know what to say about this film besides: It was horrible.  With the great cast it had, I can't believe the movie was this boring and pointless.  Thank god I saw it at the matinee price, what a waste of time!
0767821769|5.0|I loved this movie.  I saw it at the theatre when it first came out, and was left in the theatre once everyone else had gone trying to mop up after myself.  It was so sad.  The little boy broke my heart when he had his last talk with his mom (Susan Sarandon).  Basically, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris are an item and his ex is Sarandon.  His kids don't like Julia, Julia and Susan don't like each other, but through predictability, a personal tragedy brings them all together (as you can imagine).  So apart from the predictabilitly, this is an excellent film that will make you laugh, cry and bawl.  I thought it was really well acted, and don't read those negative reviews if they didn't like this.  This movie is for people with hearts.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This beautiful tale set on the coast of New Zealand, enspires us to move forward with what we know in our hearts to be right. In big ways or small ways, we all have to go though some of the challenges that the young heroin of the story goes through. This story speaks to unrecognized feminine power and it speaks to all of us who have had to go against an authority figure to find our truth, our personal power, and our place in the world.     The scenery was beautiful, the music entrancing.    Bradley Gilbert, author of the DVD, \\"Reduce Your Stress Improve Your Health, Daoist Healing Qigong.\\"
0060977264|3.0|A love story in which the two main characters, Pilar, who is a student in the town of Zaragoza, and her childhood sweetheart who she new as a girl in the small Spanish village Soria, `By The River Piedra, I Sat Down And Wept' weaves ideas about God, religion, and carnal love into a nice, if not a bit obscure work of fiction.  Perhaps because this book was not read in its English translation and not in its original Spanish, something was lost in the process.<br /><br />Pilar receives a message from her childhood friend that he will make a speech in Madrid.  When Pilar reaches Madrid, she realizes her friend has become a very influential and powerful leader of a religious movement that embraces the femininity of God.  Shortly after the event, her friend professes his love for Pilar, a love that had been a part of his being since the two were children back in Soria, and he bades her to join him on a journey.  On this journey, Pilar learns that her friend has not only become a leader of a religious movement, but that he also has the power to work miracles.  At the same time, Pilar deals with \\"the Other,\\" the part of each of our psyches that manifests itself as fear, regret, and other counterproductive emotional responses that prevents us from achieving our full potential as human beings.  During this journey through the French Pyrenees, which includes stays at hostels and visits to churches and chapels, the two find themselves at the monastery at Piedra where the two had played as children.  It is at Piedra where Pilar's friend must ultimately choose the path of his own life.<br /><br />Often described as poetic, Coelho's prose in `By The River Piedra, I Sat Down And Wept' is artistic and almost dreamlike.  Throughout the book, Pilar actually seems to be in some sort of dream in which she willingly floats from place to place with her friend as she searches for her true self.  At the same time, Pilar wonders and worries, as a result of the existence of the Other that lives inside her, what will become of the love that she has for her friend and the love her friend has for her.  So, what has the potential to be a powerful and moving story of love is actually blunted by the almost ennui of the writing.<br /><br />While the reader knows he or she is not reading a Tom Clancy novel, there is not a great deal of action in the story.  The majority of the action actually occurs inside of each of the characters.  Even the conflict between the two protagonists (assuming either religion or the Other are the antagonist) is muted.  As such, `By The River Piedra, I Sat Down And Wept' is really a nice read on a quiet afternoon in a bathtub drinking chamomile tea and surrounded by lit candles, (ladies), but the story and the message leave a little to be desired, I think, for many other readers.

B00005JNX0|5.0|The work in this film, DVD and the extras really shows; and it's  all high quality. <br />The Film is a simple enough concept, covered well in other reviews. But the packaging of the DVD is a masterpiece. The Menu is entertaining. The Main Commentary is technically enlightening, but not entertaining. The so-called Penguin commentary is actually labelled  Penguin  chat, and should have been feature length; and I REALLY  hope that the Penguins return somehow, since they are the standout gems, and are clearly aimed at an adult viewership. <br />The remaining extras are all  great kids fun. Nothing is really non-family  friendly; in fact this is another film that transcends boundaries in that respect.

B00005JO20|5.0|Peter Jackson's King Kong is a magnificent, fun filled, epic masterpiece! While paying brilliant homage to the original King Kong of 1933, this modern re-telling of the tale is just as thrilling and just as good. The two lead characters, Ann Darrow played by the wonderful Naomi Watts and Kong himself, played in part by Andy Serkis and in part by a team of computer animators will thrill you with the tragic tale of a lonely, giant, montrous ape who falls for a beautiful girl from New York City. Kong is so beautufully rendered in this film, you will swear he is real...the best CGI character ever put on celluloid. And fasten your seat belts when Kong fights a trio of V-Rexes in the middle of the film to save Ann, it's a top-notch, thrilling blend of action/storytelling and CGI animation. As a whole, the film will take you on roller-coaster-like-journey from depression era New York City to Skull Island and back all the way up to the top of the Empire State Building where Jackson directs a finale that will leave you both breathless and heart-wrenchingly sad. The best film of the year in my opinion, and maybe even the best film I've seen in a long, long time.
0895260131|5.0|I read this work with a strong sense of objectivity and, I must admit a certain incedulity. I decided I would research the assertions and claims of the author. After a thorough review of his sources, I found the work to be accurate. I went to other sources and found nothing to refute his assertions or claims. <br />I can remember being in a mild state of denial while reading it and thinking to myself \\"this can't be true\\". So far I haven't been able to refute any of it!
6301792734|5.0|If I could give this series 6 stars I would.  These films were an absolutely amazing breakthrough in cinematography.  These movies, while slightly hokey by today's standards, have stood the test of time with amazing resilience.  This version with the remastered sound but no change in the screenplay or visual effects is by far the best of all of Lucas' films.
044100590X|5.0|I have been watching the TV mini-series on this for some time, and decided to go back to the novel to re-visit my perceptions and interpretation.  It is so strange to picture my younger self reading this with such awe and fascination to the person of today.  My love for this was strong and unchanged.<br /><br />All I can say is that this is one of the most dense and deliciously well written scifi novels that I have ever read.  From virtually any standpoint, the reader can ponder science (ecology, genetic evolution, anthropology), politics (the organization of the great houses and empire, the Bene Gesserit, the jihad), religion, and even human destiny (collective and individual).  Indeed, the book is like a handbook of academic disciplines that culminated in the 20C.<br /><br />This adds up to a fecundity of the story as an adventure of the imagination that is unparalelled in scifi and that pushes this into the realm of a great novel of any genre.  Even the characters are wonderfully full-lived and subtle.  Look at the evolution of Paul and his cryptic utterances late in the book.  Of course, you have history and luck, but then there is the unpredictable X-factor, the spice and its effect on humans, which will change human evolution.  It evoked the same sense of wonder at human possibility and unpredictability that I felt as a youth.<br /><br />What is so much fun is that Herbert does not explain the whole thing, but gives the reader enough clues to interpret it while also creating the seeds of future possibilities.  Though I have read all the books, I saw so much more at this re-reading to know that I will read this yet again, perhaps in 20 years.  Now I will have to go all the way back through the 6-novel cycle!<br /><br />One of the very best.  Warmly recommended.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|The Neo-flex stand might seem pricey to some, but this is a case of getting what you pay for as it is well worth the money.  This stand is versatile: You can remove the extension to shorten it and it comes with parts for either a surface edge or grommet mount. The machined aluminum parts and overall aesthetic of this LCD panel VESA mount are beautiful -- and made to last. The directions have no text, but surprisingly the drawings are so well done that I understood every step of the disassembly and reassembly process (I only did this because I shortened it and then changed my mind later: It comes packaged with the extension and surface edge mount version installed and ready to go). Every joint either pans, swivels or tilts. Nothing but praise for this item (my only minor complaint is that there are no spare parts included, so don't lose any unpacking).
B0006399FS|5.0|Obviously, this album isn't up to the standards the band have set for themselves, but it's still one of their stronger showings - as well as proving that U2 have not lost their relevance or their ability to create an album.  Strongest tracks include \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own,\\" \\"City of Blinding Lights,\\" and \\"Love or Peace or Else.\\"  The only clunker for me is \\"A Man and a Woman.\\"  The album translated brilliantly to live versions, as so I encourage you to check out the DVD live from Chicago as well.  There is nothing like Bono and thousands of fans belting out \\"Oh, you look so beautiful tonight.\\"
B0007PAMR4|4.0|I (like many others) had been waiting for a Region 1 release of the Extended Edition of DUNE for a long time, and when it came out I (like many others) snatched it up with the quickness. All in all, it's a pretty cool package for DUNE fans, but one of my two major \\"upgrade\\" concerns for the new EE was the image quality in certain scenes. The best example can be seen in the scene on the Theatrical Version where Paul talks to Duncan (\\"May the hand of God be with us all.\\") ...on both the standard DVD release and this new EE one, there's a curious reddish tint or wash on the right side of the screen. It's not jarring, but it's subtle enough to just catch your attention, and I'm certain that it's not due to the way the scene was shot, set design etc. It could be a transfer flaw, or perhaps it's just the way it plays on my DVD player/television, but it's there and I was really hoping that it'd have been addressed for the EE release. Has anyone else noticed this?  <br /> <br />The only other \\"gripe\\" I have is the lack of DTS, but it's easily forgivable by simply upping the volume and letting the 5.1 mix do it's thing. :) <br /> <br />Aside from that, it's a pretty good deal, and the tin/plastic packaging is very cool. The extended version is good, but the new narration sucks. The damn fool even mispronounces some of the names (\\"Pitter\\" DeVries?!? Where the hell was the script supervisor?) and is a poor subsitute for Virginia Madsen's Irulan. The making of extras are a welcome addition, but where the heck's the trailer? That was one of my faves... sorely missed here. <br /> <br />All in all, I'd call it even between the goods and the bads. Well worth the upgrade from the barebones standard release. <br /> <br />\\"Usil no longer needs the weirding module.\\"
B00008PX8P|5.0|Up until 2003, the only official footage of Led Zeppelin in concert was the 1976 concert film \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", an intriguing but flawed retrospective of their 1973 tour. For years, many feared this subpar representation would be the only memorabilia of the band in concert.<br /><br />In 2003, things were rectified, when Atlantic released an eponomously titled two dvd set of over five hours of Zeppelin in concert. You heard me right: 5 hours of nothing but Zeppelin live.<br /><br />The concerts span from 1970 to 1979 and were filmed at various different venues. Included is some footage from the 1973 Madison Square Garden show that didn't make it into \\"The Song Remains The Same\\".<br /><br />The firts disc is a 1970 concert from The Royal Albert Hall. Even at this early stage in their career, Zeppelin had already solidified themselves as one of the greatest live acts ever. This is over an hour and a half of pure, unledded Zeppelin. Hihlights include an amazing \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\", Page's lengthly instrumental \\"White Summer\\", the live favorite \\"Dazed And Confused\\" and Bonham's old standby \\"Moby Dick\\".<br /><br />Disc 2 kicks off with a promo of \\"The Immigrant Song\\", before we quickly jump to the 1973 Madison Square Garden show. Kicking off with a rip roaring \\"Black Dog\\", this is the show that proves why Zeppelin is so well regarded. Robert Plant is in particularly fine form here. Just listen to him wail on \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\".<br /><br />Next comes the Earl's Court gig from 1975. The show kicks off with a fantastic acoustic set of \\"Going To California\\" (where John Paul Jones shows off his masterful mandolin skills), \\"That's The Way\\" and \\"Bron Yr Aur Stomp\\". The show really takes off when the band plugs in and launches into a thrilling version of \\"In My Time Of Dying\\". Next comes an electrifying \\"Trampled Underfoot\\", before the show ends with a bkazing \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" that proves why the song is regarded as the greatest rock song ever.<br /><br />The last batch of performances is from Knebworth in 1979. For all the great performances on the disc, this one is probably the highlight. Kicking off with a heartpounding \\"Rock and Roll\\", Zeppelin performs as if it were the last time on stage together (and indeed, the end was nearing). The band is simply on fire. Especially thrilling is \\"Achilles' Last Stand\\", the epic track from their 1976 album \\"Presnece\\" that is made even better live. The best is the finale, as \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" goes under a complete transformation that is absolutely breathtaking.<br /><br />The extras are also a keeper, but even without them, this dvd would definitely be worth the price of admission.nebworth in 1979.

B00013RC8O|5.0|Can't say enough about the movie- so many have already stated it.  But boy does the Director come off like a pompous blow-hard in his voice-over comments.  It ruined what could have been a pretty interesting commentary by just having him alone to comment on it.
B000002JPA|4.0|Dream Theater has always been on the top of my list of favorite bands since I was introduced to this cd and James LaBrie's vocals.   <br /> <br />When you first play this cd, youre introduced to an astounding track called \\"Pull Me Under.\\"  IMO this is the crown jewel of this cd.  5/5 <br /> <br />Track 2 is quite the departure from the first.  Its a slower acoustic medley.  Probably the worst slow song done by DT that ive heard.  1/5 <br /> <br />The CD continues with \\"Take the Time.\\"  More along the style that will show up later on Awake and Train of Thought.  Some short select parts sound a bit like rap-metal.  Not to be turned off though.  This track holds its own, especially with the chorus.  4/5 <br /> <br />\\"Surrounded\\" slows it down once again.  This track also has a... 'happy' tone to it.  3/5 <br /> <br />\\"Metropolis, Pt. 1\\" is a classic track.  Afterall, it spawned a whole album.  There were no plans to make a sequel, but DT got so many requests to do so that they eventually released Scenes From a Memory.  This one is relatively long too.  Over 9 minutes.  Perfect iteration of DT's real progressive style.  Lots of good solos from almost every instrument they play.  5/5 <br /> <br />The next track keeps up the pace after a rather interesting introduction.  If you didnt get enough of the last track, this one will keep you going.  More synth work in this one though.  Vocals are used very interestingly as there is no chorus or classic pattern to them.  4/5 <br /> <br />\\"Wait for Sleep\\" doesnt seem like it would belong, but somehow it fits.  It is the shortest song on the whole album (one of the shortest DT songs ever at only 2:31).  No guitar but dont let that turn you off.  The piano and strings are all this song needs.  Beautiful song if there ever was one (and im definetally into much heavier music).  5/5 <br /> <br />The closing track is another gem.  Much along the lines of every closing track to come after this one.  Wraps it all up nicely and leaves yousatisfied.  Tastes of every previous song are included in the instrumental part.  11 1/2 minutes of pure enjoyment.  5/5 <br /> <br />Overall the album gets 4 1/2 stars if thats what I could give it.   <br />The songs that keep me coming back are Pull me Under and Wait for Sleep.  Although its far from the heaviest album, it has earned my liking.  Although if it lacked those two tracks i probably would listen to it almost as much as I do When Dream and Day Unite.  I only have that one for The Ytse Jam.  But thats another story.  All-in-all a solid album with a few great tracks.  Pull me Under will do just that.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Like other movies in a similar vein to Brokeback Mountain, such as Les Rouseaux Sauvages or several foreign films, this movie has at its center a story of love between two men. With all the debate and controversy surrounding Brokeback Mountain, the uninitiated might think the movie was all about vivid sex between the characters played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Lending itself to that is the tendency of many people to dub this movie \\"the gay cowboy movie.\\" <br /> <br />I rarely watch movies, but when two men, one a co-worker and the other a close friend of mine I think of as a brother, both watched the movie within days of each other, I had to shell out the money and see this movie. When I went in, I was thinking that I might get a charge out of seeing Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger either making out or possibly doing more than that. However, when I left the theater, I left with the feeling that what I saw was an emotionally intense experience. <br /> <br />Let's get the \\"controversy\\" part out of the way early. There is perhaps two minutes of \\"action\\" between Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) out of a movie lasting nearly two hours. More important to the movie is the emotional journey the characters make as the film progresses. Important to me was seeing how the characters handled the love scenes, especially with Gyllenhaal's concern that the scenes be \\"authentic.\\" With Twist being the one more likely to wear his heart on his sleeve, I was especially keen to see how Gyllenhaal portrayed Twist's love for Del Mar. From the deep feeling of love Twist felt for Del Mar in one sex scene to the bitter \\"I just don't know how to quit you\\" later in the movie, the viewer can feel those emotions along with Gyllenhaal, along with the wistful, sunny optimism that sometimes gets in the way of pragmatism forced on him by society.  <br /> <br />I make the distinction between Twist and Del Mar for a reason. Del Mar is by far the more emotionally withdrawnof the two and rarely ever speaks more than a few words, especially in the early going. In fact, when Twist and Del Mar meet for the first time, Twist has to ask twice to get Del Mar's last name after Twist freely introduced himself with his first and last name. Later in the movie, the emotional journey the viewer accompanies Del Mar on reaches a climax when Del Mar meets Twist's parents and leaves their home with one of Twist's outfits. <br /> <br />After leaving the movie, I recalled people saying something about going back to \\"their Brokeback Mountain\\" and thinking about relationships they had with friends or lovers that the movie invoked. If you don't go watch the movie, you won't know how true that really is.
B00000JLWW|3.0|\\"\\"Titanic\\" is a spectacular roller coaster ride\\". What is disappointing is the total lack of a plausible script. Does anyone really believe that a charcoal sketch could survive intacked for 70 + years in a safe in the wreck the Titanic? Has anyone ever heard of hypothermia? Does anyone understand that the sucking wash of the sinking Titanic alone would have drowned  anyone hanging on to the stern in those last minutes.     Also the movie is heavily derived from other films. Obviously earlier Titanic films such as \\"A Night to Remember\\" But what surprised me was the Second half of the film (DiCaprio, Winslet Love affair) is directly lifted from Michael Curtiz's \\"SEAWOLF\\" (1941) with minor changes to blend into Titanic first half. With $200 million budget + you would think Cameron and company could have done much better.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|R.I.P. to one of the greatest beatmakers of all-time. Go out and buy the album to support his memory and his family. Hip-hop lives forever.
B000002GC2|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  Every track is excellent and brings back memories that I love to re-live!!
B00004SZWD|4.0|\\"Songs in the Key of Life\\" is one of my favorite albums of all time. Stevie Wonder fills each of these songs with powerful emotion, most notably \\"Isn't She Lovely.\\" That song as well as \\"Sir Duke,\\" \\"As,\\" and \\"I Wish\\" are the high points of the album. Stevie proves he is one of the masters of the slow jam with \\"Love's in Need of Love Today,\\" \\"Knocks Me Off My Feet,\\" and \\"Joy Inside My Tears.\\" This album is a must for fans of funk, soul, and 70s pop rock. <br /> <br />And I know \\"I Love MTV\\" has already been proven wrong, but I think the fact that this album came out before Justin Timberlake was even born cannot be overstated. You either need to do some research or stop listening to music altogether, because your reviews may deter people from listening to all the great artists who never made a music video and aren't obsessed with image and money. Also, just because an artist has never won a Grammy doesn't mean they're not good. Led Zeppelin is better than you are.
0634089358|4.0|This book is a great introduction to Blues Bass, with both Bass clef and tab. The CD has the bass on the left track only, so when you want to \\"join in\\" you can cut the bass. The songs used represent a good cross-section of Blues, including Chicago, Texas and New Orleans styles.    This book is NOT an introduction to Electric Bass, and it is NOT a complete education in Blues Bass. It is what it says it is: \\"A Guide to the Essential Styles & Techniques\\" of Blues Bass.    My first bass was a modified Kay acoustic guitar with salvaged flat-wounds from a friend's Fender Bass. It was horrible, but a real bass guitar and amp cost $500 in 1962 (about $4000 in today's dollars). After 2 months and 4 lessons, I bought a used '51 Precision bass (built in '55) and joined a rock band. In '65 I put my music career on hold, got a day job and became respectable (wife, kids, dog, job).     A year ago, the Blues bug bit me, and I got a bass and amp. If you get bit by this bug, and you want to play Blues, put on a set of flat-wounds, rip that tweeter out of your speaker cabinet, and buy this book! You'll be well on your way!
B00005JOFO|5.0|It began when I bought the ticket and the fellow who sold it to me said \\"awsome flick\\" as he handed it to me.  He was telling the truth.  <br /> <br />The sexual relationship between the two men could have taken over the whole movie by providing cheap thrills for viewers, but it didn't.  The feeling the two men have for each other provides motivation.     <br /> <br />What I found fascinating was watching the unfolding of the story after the 'interlude' at Brokeback Mountain.  The contrast of their lives after Brokeback and the the impact of their relationship on other characters makes for a fascinating and well-told story that rises above the prurient.   <br /> <br />The acting was great, but I believe the writing and directing in this movie is even better.
3822822558|5.0|i pretty much knew what the book was like since i'd seen it in bookstores several times. i always concluded that is not for me, but time after time i kept going back to it and kept seeing Terry's photos in magazines and so finally i got it.  <br /> <br />the book then...it's huge, with a LOT of photos. i'm still not a fan of Terry but i respect his style and originality and bravery a lot. he uses a snapshot cam, and it shows. that sounds bad...and most people think upon seeing the pics 'these are snapshots! i can do this myself!'. well, think twice, it is not in fact that easy. Terry can handle the medium in a whole different way and as a photographer myself i appreciate this skill. his subject matters are however what usually turns peoples heads...the genitalia shows here and there, and it's not subtle. Terry is a part of the photos himself too sometimes, and he shows he's ready to give just as much as himself as the models. what i like specifically is the humor and brave subjects, daring to show things in a new or different way. or just really bluntly.  <br /> <br />more specifically his photos are of people, often naked and daring, posed or dressed funny. some are celebrities, others are not. the snapshot camera gives the photos a blunt 'in your face'-look and i don't think the photos are in any way manipulated, at least they look very raw and like something from a snapshot camera should. his website shoulf give you a better idea of the content.  <br /> <br />besides the photos, i think this book is worth having because it's a part of photography history, different and i'm sure he will be remembered as such.
0385335482|4.0|This girl gets herself into a hell of a mess with spending and you learn about some wonderful relationships she has along the way with people she meets. It can be really funny at times, but also makes you think about how bad life would be to be in that much debt and have to live in such a world where you are influenced by name dropping. Had a good ending. One thing I will say is that I read another book by this author and the stories seem very similar with similar outcomes. I decided then that I wouldn't continue with the series.
B00005JOII|1.0|Hated it.  Too bad zero stars isn't an option. Dark. Sooooo NOT funny.  And the worst part was, in Woody Allen fashion, the movie dragged in EVERY scene as we were forced to tag along the no-where lives of the characters involved.
B0006L16N8|1.0|So here it is, another album from the overplayed, overhyped, and overrated Coldplay.  In addition, it's another opportunity for Coldplay to justify the deafening praise and adulation that comes from the critics and their legions of fans around the world.  Along with a three-year period between albums, frontman Chris Martin made a statement to the press regarding X&Y, stating that it \\"marks the end of our soft rock phase\\".  Listening to the album makes it apparent that the band was in the very early stages of writing the album when he made that statement, because what you hear is in actuality a continuation of the \\"soft rock phase\\" that Martin alluded to. <br /> <br />From the early part of their career up to today, Coldplay have become ridiculously huge - so huge that it's hard to put into words.  What's the secret to their success?  OK, I'll be frank about it - because they play it SAFE.  This is bland, inoffensive treacly pop music for the masses.  There is nothing bold or innovative about this band at all.  Coldplay basically represent a dumbed-down version of Radiohead circa The Bends.  The Bends was an excellent album, and Radiohead were too talented to continue to retrace their own footsteps, as they only became even better as time went on.  Coldplay, however, is like the dog that continues to chase its tail day in and day out - they simply regurgitate the same tired material (\\"Speed Of Sound\\" is a blatant re-write of \\"Clocks\\") rather than creating something new, because they're only in the business to sell records and make money, nothing else.  The comparisons to U2 are off-base as well - U2 was once a very daring (Zooropa, Pop) band that wasn't afraid to make a statement and break from conventional song concepts.  Coldplay will never write anything as powerful as \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\", \\"New Year's Day\\" or \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\". <br /> <br />Perhaps there is one link between the two bands - some people have said that Bono does Messianic poses on stage.  Martin seems to fancy himself as a Messiah of sorts, the way he says \\"I will try to fix you\\" (on the song \\"Fix You\\").  I've actually heard people describe this song as being \\"delivered from heaven\\" - give me a break!  Between the cheesy lyrics which some people find comforting for some reason (those who get choked up by the repetition of lyrics like \\"tears stream down your face\\" are better suited finding solace in another viewing of \\"Terms Of Endearment\\" or \\"Steel Magnolias\\"), the bland melody and the irritating falsetto (which Martin uses more often now than ever), it represents nothing but an attempt to move units within the Adult Contemporary demographic.  The rest of the album follows suit, with a couple of tracks with a faster tempo in an attempt to break up the monotony, to no avail - bland soft rock with a different rhythm is still bland soft rock.  There's even a surprising influence from groundbreaking German electro band Kraftwerk, (\\"Talk\\" takes influence from the song \\"Computer Love\\") but still it's nothing to get worked up about, taken in context with the rest of the album. <br /> <br />In summary: X&Y has done incredibly well, sold 700,000 copies in its first week, but that's because it's nothing more than a soulless, innocuous collection of pop/rock.  It's basically all just waiting to be used as background music in a luxury car ad.  If this is the future of music, then it's looking very dark indeed.  There's worse music out there, but I can't honestly think of even one band out there that gets more undeserving acclaim than Coldplay.  But at least Chris Martin & Co. have achieved their ultimate goal - making money hand over fist, selling out arenas, and hooking up with celebrities.  That said, I've heard that Martin and actress/wife Gwyneth Paltrow are now expecting a second child, a little boy that they plan on naming Blueberry.  Let me be the first to give a hearty congratulations to the happy couple!
B0006399FS|5.0|I knew very little about U2 until my friend conveniently had a spare ticket to the Vertigo tour and took me along.  I went out and purchased this cd a few days later.  Coming from the relatively objective viewpoint of someone who knew nothing about U2 before, I think HTDAAB is a strong album that improves upon extended listening.

B00026W82U|5.0|Now I know my title is a very loaded phrase. I challenge the listener to hear the first track, \\"Homesick\\" and tell me that it isn't reminiscent of something from S&G's album \\"Bookends.\\" Being a student, I am so grateful to (for once) not have to rely on my parents' music for some good acoustic and carefully blended chords. If you find that you're one of those people who raids your parents' music collection while shaking your head saying, \\"music sure isn't what it used to be\\" pick up this group. I think your faith will be renewed in what two 20-somethings can produce, even in a depressing time of Kelly Clarkson beating Paul McCartney for a Grammy. <br /> <br />\\"Riot on an Empty Street\\" consists mainly of an acoustic guitar, two singers, and the occasional piano, trumpet, and even banjo. Their sound is mostly upbeat, and even their more sullen tracks still have a feeling of nostalgia or hope.  <br /> <br />One of the best things about this group is that they don't try to be loud and intrusive. They're very mild but still have a distinct melody in every song. Even during the punk trend that swept America and the UK (where they located now after leaving Norway), they stayed true to their own sound which has few percussive sounds and no electric guitar. At no point could anyone ever call these two a sell-out.  <br /> <br />Their music in this album is still very similar to \\"Quiet is the New Loud\\"-- coming from that album to buying this one years later I was concerned that the style would deviate from the their first record (which, for years, has been a favorite of mine). I was not disappointed. In fact, I'd even say this album is better than their first. I can only hope Kings of Convenience gets a little more recognition and appreciation in this age of indie, since those who like artists like Iron and Wine or Elliot Smith could easily find themselves in love with KofC. <br /> <br />Admittedly, the lyrics never struck me as being very profound... but the way the sounds blend together is what makes \\"Riot on an Empty Street\\" so rewarding. It doesn't seem to matter whether or not the lyrics are touching to the listener when the instrumentation compensates for it and then some. The two artists could hum the entire time or speak an entirely different language and it wouldn't make a difference. Some music does the thinking for the listener (like Dashboard Confessional, for example) while other music makes the listener think. Kings of Convenience makes the listener think and apply their own thoughts to the music which I think is more gratifying. <br /> <br />While I couldn't imagine playing this music at a party or any social gatherine, \\"Riot on an Empty Street\\" is great for lazy Sundays, road trips (or any time you're in the car and need to de-stress), or even doing schoolwork. <br /> <br />I definitely give this album a well-deserved 5 stars.  <br /> <br />
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|It's wide screen, it's dolby digital 5.1, it has commentaries, but most important the picture quality is excellent! John Wayne fans who have been waiting patiently for a dvd that is at least equal to the authorized VHS from MPI (rapidly becoming hard to find) rejoice! This release in Paramount's John Wayne collection is for you. Yeah, Maureen O'Hara's comments may seem self-serving (she seems a little too aware of her status as a screen icon), Stephanie Powers' a bit too fawning, but at least it does have these features DVD collectors have come to expect from so-called collector's editions. McLaglen's (and others, including O'Hara and Powers) running commentary during the movie is very informative and interesting. Sorry, no extended scenes or  extra scenes here but at least it's not grainy nor is the sound quality awful with dubbed voices that are clearly not the stars', as with Good Times Video's deplorable VHS version which I inadvertantly purchased some years ago. I quickly boxed that back up and exchanged it for the MPI VHS (which I still have and is in good shape). So you Duke fans out there who are uncertain which DVD to get, this one, again, from Paramount's John Wayne collection is the one you want. Oh, and Amazon? You would be doing the folks who are wondering if a good dvd version of this movie is out there a great service if you would point out what DVD version your customer reviewers are referring to. The very first review panning a \\"remastered\\" version of the movie can't be referring to this Paramount edition as the date on the review is 1999. Paramount released this excellently remastered version in 2005. I'm guessing that reviewer must be talking about Delta's so-called remastered version. So here ya go, McLintock fans. Paramount's version is the one you want!
B000002UJQ|5.0|when i first bought this cd back in 1997 i have to admit i didnt get it..besides karma police the rest of the cd bored me, so i didn't listen to it for a few years. In 1999 i gave this cd another chance. I realised that because i was a huge fan of the first 2 cd's I had to almost make like this was a different band. that's when i got it. O.K. COMPUTER now ranks up there with THE WHITE ALBUM, BEGGARS BANQUET, THE WALL, WISH YOU WERE HERE ETC. as one of the greatest albums of all time. Remember, when this album came out,music pretty much sucked. O.K. COMPUTER will be talked about 30 years from now. If you don't own this cd, please buy it or at least borrow it from a friend. You won't be disapointed. i won't even bother ging through all of the tracks because you have to listen to it from start to finish, like THE BEATLES WHITE ALBUM, the sum is greater than it's parts
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The folks who are put off by the \\"dirty\\" scenery are totally off base.  The mid 1800's were anything but sanitary.  I too am a big fan of the A&E mini, but I remember thinking when seeing the opening scenes of this movie that the muddy rural look was probably far more realistic for the times. <br /> <br />This was my favorite movie of 2005, and that is saying something.  I am a 47 year old male science fiction fan!  Will certainly add this movie to my collection.

B000002VCQ|5.0|This album of Whitney Houston from 1985 is one of the best records released during the '80s. From what I learned, when it was first released, it was an instant success and sold millions of copies and stayed on the charts for quite some time. I really love some of the songs on this title. The opening track, \\"You Give Good Love\\" is wonderful to listen to. The same thing applies to \\"All at Once\\", \\"Saving All My Love For You\\", \\"Greatest Love of All\\", and \\"How Will I Know\\". All at Once has a somewhat sad lyric to it, Saving All My Love For You has a romantic lyric to it; the saxophone is a nice addition, making the song have more of a love sound. This song starts out really soft and gets louder from the middle on. Greatest Love of All has a nice sound to it, and How Will I Know is a real jammer. This track has a nice sound to it, and I think of it as dance, hip-hop, soul, R&B, and hard rock combined into one fine smash song. The part where she screams out the title during the climax is amazing; the sax immediately screams out at that very moment. Someone for Me is another great song, where Whitney sings about wanting to meet the right kind of guy.  For those of you who don't yet have this title, go and get it. It will be money well spent. Whitney Houston is a truly gifted entertainer and has a beautiful voice. It really saddens me about the lies and garbage that the media has been publishing about her within the past few years. I don't really believe what they say, in general, she is a great singer NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!!!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I'd have to say that re-re-re-releasing this cd is pretty ridiculous.  I enjoy this music much more than I do enjoy U2's crappy excuse for music (they peaked with The Joshua Tree).  I don't understand why they won five grammys and she got stuck with three.  It baffles me and lends credence to everybody's knowledge that those awards ceremonies are all politics. <br /> <br />I have to give it five stars because she deserves it for her voice alone.  When compared to some talentless hacks like Madonna, she's a gift in the music industry. <br /> <br />--=Teagan Mago=--
B00005JNJV|4.0|The drugs. I mean a Batman movie about drugs. That's all movies are about anymore. Drugs. Can't people come up with something different than drugs. None of the other batman movies were about drugs. Just this one. This was the only flaw of the movie. If the next Batman movie is about drugs in 2008 then I am going to be so mad. Christopher Nolan needs to come up with something other than drugs. And then the train fight. This is pretty much a copy from Spider-Man 2. Correction there are two flaws. Otherwise it had a dark story and great special effects.
B000063DGC|5.0|Like most great guitarists (i.e. Jimi Hendrix, \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell, etc.), Randy Rhodes sounded a little more than awesome in the studio, but, as \\"Tribute\\" proves, he was just freaking amazing live! \\"Tribute\\" was recorded in 1987 (on the \\"Diary of a Madman\\" Tour), so its sound quality can be sub-par at times. Plus, even though Ozzy hits most hooks, his singing isn't quite as good as usual (he can sometimes, as in the beginning of the first track, be somewhat indecipherable.) Fortunately, there is more than enough wonderful guitar shredding to make up for these flaws. Randy (who would, a short while after this was released, die in a plane crash) plays every song perfectly. He plays superb, chunky riffs, skillful and infectious leads, and some of the best guitar solos ever known to man with virtuosic ease.<br /><br />The crowd noise is kept to a bearable minimum. Ozzy frequently tells the audience to \\"stand up and clap,\\" but their clapping is almost never heard over Randy's soaring guitar.<br /><br />The album/concert begins with \\"I Don't Know,\\" which features a fast, running guitar lead and a great, several parted solo. Next comes the world-renowned \\"Crazy Train.\\" It's executed without a flaw, and includes careening guitar work (Randy's fret board must be smoking by the time this song is over!) The next two songs, \\"Believer\\" and \\"Mr. Crowley,\\" are both highlighted by more great, long, technical, classical-sounding guitar solos. Track six, \\"Revelation (Mother Earth),\\" is a power ballad with soft strumming and even a piano. \\"Steal Away (The Night)\\" is very catchy, and ends with an extended, everything but the kitchen sink drum solo. \\"Suicide Solution\\" also has a solo, but this one is performed by the guitarist. This solo, which is very long, is simply incredible.<br /><br />\\"Paranoid\\" is the first song of the concert's encore, and even though it was originally performed by Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne's band play it perfectly. The last track worth mentioning on here is \\"Dee,\\" which is a Randy Rhodes studio out-take. This C.D. is worth buying just for this song, which has beautiful acoustic noodling.<br /><br />So, this is definitely Ozzy's best live album, and it's also probably the best disc for showcasing Randy's sheer, pure, undisputed and unparalleled talent. Essential listening for all Ozzy fans, and heavy metal aficionados in general.y Rhodes studio out-take. This C.D. is worth buying just for this song, which has beautiful acoustic noodling.

B0000057C5|4.0|Though I only have Mutter and Sehnsucht, Sehnsucht is by far my favorite of the two.  Mutter may be heavier, but it gets stale faster than Sechnsucht.  You have your rockers and your ballads.  All spoken in German and many are about disturbing topics.  The American version actually has a bonus track (about damn time we get a bonus track) called Stripped, a cover of a Depeche Mode song and yes it's in English with a very thick accent.  The only song that gets on my nerves is Du Hast simply because of how overplayed it is and how that's the only Rammstein song that EVERYBODY knows.   My favorite Rammstein song has got to be Bck Dich despite its sick lyrics.  Sehnsucht is definitely a good album and should end up in the collection of those who want something different.  I don't consider Rammstein to be a Metal band, more of a German Hard Rock Industrial group.  If you want some real metal bands from Germany, check out Death and Thrash metal bands Kreator and Destruction.  Sehnsucht is definitely a good album but with what people have said about their album Reise, Reise and Rosenrot, Rammstein seems to have lost their edge but you should definitely check out this CD if you want to hear some good songs.
B000002MM8|4.0|This isn't my favorite album of theirs, but overall it is still very good. To my ears, \\"Into The Labyrinth\\" has a bit more of an earthy, tribal sound than some of their other albums. Not every track does, but many. I would call \\"Yulunga\\" the best thing here, with it's beating drums and ancient vibe, and it was a single after all with an amazing video even. \\"The Umbiquitous Mr. Lovegrove\\" is probably the closest thing to a pop song, though not one, and I really love the track \\"The Spiders Stratagem\\", as it reminds me of old DCD. I'd call this disc a must for previous fans, newcomers might enjoy a collection more.
0895260131|1.0|As it has been mentioned in several previous reviews and in encyclopedia, the term non believers refers to the Arabic word in Quran, Kafirs. Kafir litearlly means to cover/hide something.<br /><br />Furthermore, to fully understand Quran you must read the entire Holy Book, not just one chapter or one verse and then you will understand its context and time.
B000301YY8|4.0|Not, is the answer. I bought this cd because I figured if he did two of 'em he must have had a compelling reason. I have yet to figure out what it is. Using f***ing instead of flying didn't do the song, Beautiful, any good and I'm mystified as to why he needed to. Honestly, if you're planning to buy this cd I would go with the other one, not the explicit version. On the other hand, if you do buy the explicit version, then don't gripe about the language. (I mean, what part of 'explicit' do the complainers of the 'f' word not understand?)<br /><br />That said, the cd is worth the price no doubt about it. A couple of clunkers, sure, but very few cds are sterling all the way through and this is no exception. There are also gems and while his voice is not classic, it does convey deep feeling, sadness, and emotion. A great start for the new guy.<br /><br />Thumbs up on this one.
B00005JO1G|4.0|I remember reading a number of years ago in George Orwell's \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" that war was a period of intense boredom interspersed with brief intervals of absolute terror.  Such a view would apply to the movie, \\"Jarhead\\".<br /><br />Here, we see the military life of Anthony Swofford unfold.  As a somewhat reluctant recruit to the US marines, Swofford (as played by Jake Gyllenhall) manages to be selected as a specialist sniper.  The training period is harsh but does succeed in spitting out trained soldiers at the end.  If these men have one common feature it is that they all wish to go to war.  And George Bush Senior obliges by declaring war on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.  The troops can hardly wait.  But wait they must.<br /><br />After landing in Saudi Arabia as a stepping stone to Kuwait, further training continues.  Hopes of war are high amongst the young man.  However, they are destined to train and wait, train and wait.  They are itching to see action but always seem to play a secondary role to the modern war machine that relies upon precision bombs and aerial attack.  The infantry sees little action.  In fact, none of the men in Swofford's platoon gets to fire a shot in anger.<br /><br />\\"Jarhead\\" is not a typical war movie.  There is no direct clash between good guys and bad guys.  The viewer is given a far more ambiguous view of war where politics plays a greater role.  As a result, this film differs from the usual Hollywood fare where good triumphs over evil and no questions are left unanswered.  It is this apparent ambiguity that gives \\"Jarhead\\" real credibility.  It would have been so easy to fall back upon a formulaic production.<br /><br />I can strongly recommend this film.  The story is one that needs to be told.  The acting is first rate and the scenes of destruction in the wake of Saddam's burning of the Kuwaiti oilfields are absolutely mesmerising.  If only Hollywood could adopt the \\"Jarhead\\" approach to other films.
B00005JO20|4.0|Seeing King Kong (2005)reminded why I liked movies in the first place, it takes you on a journey that captures your imagination and carries you through a series of emotions and makes you feel like a kid again. I believe its destined to become a new classic and when people remember the films of 2005, King Kong would definitely one of the most forefront on our minds. Bravo to Universal Pictures and especially to Peter Jackson, for remaking the film that made him want to be a filmmaker in the first place. It's a great film and most certainly one for the books.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|And the hype is true.  Yes, it is one of the best albums of 2005. A sprawling album full of strings and instrumentation; and so, so pretty.  Like if Magnetic Fields got some major label money for some real production work.  And yet this is not a major label album. Covers the state from John Wayne Gacy to Abe Lincoln to Frank Lloyd Wright to oh hell just go ahead and get it.  Fave track: \\"Chicago\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0895260131|1.0|Having spent the afternoon reading this book I decided to contribute a short review.  I have read a translation of the Qur'an.  However, I remain a Christian and I agree that Islam has its problems.  This is particularly true in modern Islam's treatment of women, its intolerance of other faiths and cultures, its views of government, and its philosophical understanding of cause and effect.  (I might add that Christianity has had and continues to have problems in all of these areas.)  That being said, I found this book to be one of the most bigoted, hateful, historically distorted, and twisted tracts that I have ever read.  I will not take the time to go into detail as the book just is not worth it and I doubt, based on most of the reviews that I have read here, that I will change anyone's mind.  There are two points that I would like to make.  It is clear that one of the author's thinly veiled agendas is to disparage the \\"liberal establishment\\" for ignoring and even aiding the \\"Mohammedan menace.\\"  Where have we heard that before?  Will there soon be hearings before the House Un-American Activities Committee?  \\"Are you now or have you ever been a Muslim?\\"  I also found interesting the author taking the words of Christ and juxtaposing them with the words of Mohammed (completely out of context).  Mr. Spencer, why do you not try applying some of the teachings of Christ, particularly with regard loving one another?  In closing, I would recommend that anyone interested in understanding the dangers of religious fanaticism in the world today, read Karen Armstrong's monumental book \\"The Battle for God.\\"
B00005JNEI|1.0|Let me start by saying that this film doesnt tell the truth! About now you think I am a GOP fan boy. However the film doesnt tell the truth because mr Moor doesnt go far enough. Yeah we all know the Bush's have oil dealings with Saudi Arabia. The problem is thats only the surface of the corruption.Following is a list of things this film skips over. <br />On the morning of Sept 11 <br />- Standard air defence mechanisms systematically failed, simultaneously. When a plain deviates from course an attempt is made to contact the plain. If there is no responce Jets are scrambled to intercept the plain and guide it back to the airport. This is actually pretty common. It happens about 60-100 times a year. Without fail there is an innocent explanation for the course deviation nearly all the time. Now the fighter jets that scramble are far faster than any jetliners and if this happened on the morning of 9-11 the fighter jet would have reached the first plain in time to shoot it down. Now assuming the military was just incompitant as the administration would have you think. Than why were they still asleep for the next 3 attacks? The military records of that morning suggest that interceptor jets were scrambled too late, too slowly and from the wrong locations. An interesting side note is usually when there is a failure of this magnitude someone is punished or fired. In the case of 9-11 the military commanders in charge were promoted! Another interesting fact is that fires could not have caused the collapse of the towers. No high rise has ever collapsed due to fires. The idea that the fire melted the steal beams and the towers collapsed is dead wrong. To melt the steal beams the fires would have to be far hotter than 2000 degrees. Experts say the fire from jet fuel is hot but not hot enough. Now assuming the tops melted and collapsed dont you think the floors below would have at least momentarily provided resistance to the collapse? Instead both buildings collapsed in under 15 seconds. For a building that tall that is free-fall speed. Also the first two firefighters that came the closest to the 80th floor where impact was made thought the fires were manageable. They didnt describe a raging inferno. Istead they radiod for two lines to be brought up to put out two isolated fires. Minutes later without warning the towers collapsed on them. Prior to the collapse the seismologist at Columbia university recorded two spikes indicating large burst of energy that shook the ground just before there collapse. They were 2.1 and 2.3 on the richter scale respectivly. You couple that with dozens of survivors who's testimony says they heard other explosians on other floors prior too the collapse. A building colapsing on its own would not have produced all the dust that you see in in the video. Only a high energy explosian can reduce concrete to dust. If you can think back to that day on the news about 5 pm  they announced that building 7 collapsed. It was said that fires once again melted a 47 story steal frame building. Later on the govt changed there story and admitted it was pulled. Pulled is the technical term for demolishing a building. Why did they lie to begin with? Could they have also detonated the towers? We will never know if the steel in the debris tested positive for explosive residue,since before they could be examined the steel was sent on ships to china to be sold as scrap metal! Than there is the stock market.There was massive short selling of stocks just before the attacks. American and United Airlines as well as Morgan Stanly were involved. Somebody new ahead of time that these Airlines were going to down in the stock market. Morgan Stanly had offices in the world trade center. All three were affected by the attacks. Somebody profited millions by shortselling these stocks. Another good question is how could the pentagon been attacked? It is the most highly defended building in the wetern hemisphere yet they say a plain hit it. And thisis after the govt already new we were under attack. <br />Anyways I could give you details forever. I suggest that you just read a good book like The New Pearl harbor. If you cant read go to infowars.com and buy the dvd 9-11 The Road to Tyranny by alex Jones. He is concerned with getting the truth out so there is no copyright on his dvd you can make copies and distribute them for free for educational purposes. As far as Moor is concerned I dont understand why he didnt bring out facts. He probably new no theatre would carry a movie that told the truth so he wouldnt make any money on it. He was more concerned with getting Bush out of the whitehouse by having people vote for Kerry. Let me make this clear the democrats are just as responsible. All they think about is there careers so they wont say anything extreme that might make them look \\"un umerican\\". The truth is extreme though. And that is sad.

1591396190|4.0|Co-authors W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne, two esteemed professors from France's leading business school, INSEAD, have written a sharply insightful book about value innovation in a most readable manner. They lucidly explain that the blue ocean is the unstructured demand that is all around us yet due to lack of proactive definition, remains not served. The blue ocean strategy is about delivering a new value proposition so compelling to these unacknowledged buyers-to-be that companies dedicated to such a strategy will not have to deal with head-to-head competition. Their contention is that because established markets in the developed world are saturated, such competition cannot bring attractive returns. This is the dog-chasing-the-tail concept of red oceans, which encompasses most of existing industries where markets are well defined and heavily populated by the competition. Within this schema, it is about confronting an opponent and driving him off the competitive battlefield. Needless to say, competition is fierce, but because the battlefield is a finite territory, profits are minimized and growth is limited.<br /><br />To write the book, Kim and Mauborgne exhaustively studied 108 companies and found an overwhelming majority, 86%, of new ventures were actually line extensions with the remaining 14% which could be considered enterprises that are creating new markets or industries. To their point, while the 86% generated 62% of total revenues, they accounted for only 39% of total profits. Conversely, while the 14% group produced 38% of total revenues, they generated 61% of total profits. It is this latter group that the co-authors identify as value innovators, those who combine value with innovation as part of their core proposition to the market rather than more superficially in their mind, a marketing position. The authors highlight Cirque de Soleil as one such innovator. The circus troupe has grown its revenue 22-fold over the last decade, despite a spiraling decline in the circus industry. Cirque du Soleil made the competition irrelevant by moving outside the boundaries of the existing industry where the likes of Ringling Brothers have dominated for over a century.<br /><br />Alternatively, the remaining companies, the 86%, focus on value creation on an incremental scale. The sources for their innovation generally come from technology drivers or overreaching the need that economic buyers want and making products and services for which they are not ready to pay. The most valuable insight that Kim and Mauborgne provide is on the other end of the spectrum, that an excessive focus on the customer is detrimental to long-term profitability. Only when companies align innovation with utility, price and cost positions do they more accurately balance the costs of delivering the value proposition with what the buyer values. Instead of compromising the value wanted by the customer because of the high costs associated with delivering it, costs are eliminated or reduced if there is no or less value placed on the offering by the customer. This is the epitome of a win-win resolution that creates a truly compelling proposition, i.e., customers get what they really want for less, and sellers get a higher rate of return on invested capital by reducing start up and/or operational delivery costs. The co-authors base their entire strategy on the leveraging of these two forces.<br /><br />At the same time, the focus seems somewhat limited. For all the thoughtful conclusions Kim and Mauborgne provide, the one area that seems to compromise the validity of the blue ocean premise is presuming that a successful strategy will invite competitors and consequently start creating the inevitable red ocean. The co-authors seem to feel an innate incompatibility exists between blue oceans and uncontested markets. The reality is that once the blue ocean company has invested significantly to create a new market, then it will be an easy target to attack and dislodge. That is a sign of the new millennium, as Thomas Friedman concludes in his book, \\"The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century\\", and it seems idealistic to think that competition as a concept could be irrelevant. The reality of any blue ocean strategy is that business cycled at a much slower rate this past century and such a possibility will be unlikely in the 21st century. Given that any productive blue ocean will inevitably fill with competitors, this leads to a glaring omission on the part of the co-authors, the power of an effective marketing strategy. Without it and the strong execution of one, there can be no successful blue ocean strategy today since it invaluably helps increase market share and provide defense from the competition. Otherwise, the water gets shark-infested very fast indeed.the new millennium, as Thomas Friedman concludes in his book, \\"The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century\\", and it seems idealistic to think that competition as a concept could be irrelevant.

B0000009S3|5.0|It's amazing to think that in August of 1969, as Miles davis was crafting his jazz/rock fusion masterpiece BITCHES BREW in New York, Frank Zappa was in the throes of producing his at least equally spectacular HOT RATS, which would approach the blending and juxtaposing of the two genres from the other side of the fence, in Los Angeles. Seizing on the advent of sixteen-track recording as his opportunity to commit the full range of his musical imagination to tape, the guitarist/composer/arranger/producer proceded to make what in many people's opinion is his finest album, and one firmly on the cutting edge in conceptual, performing and technical terms to this day.     HOT RATS is an epochal, indeed an essential, musical recording. Like the \\"Ode to Joy,\\" KIND OF BLUE or Elvis Presley's Sun singles, it can be thoroughly enjoyed and absorbed by just about anyone of any aesthetic while remaining ever new in its ability to surprise and intrigue.     The musical pivots of HOT RATS are Zappa himself and keyboardist/reedsman Ian Underwood, a fellow veteran of the Mothers of Invention. Around, before, behind and between these two men a shifting cast of inspired and energetic players serves up some of the hottest, tightest jams you're ever likely to hear, incorporating elements of nearly every form of Western music. While Zappa is the creator and official auteur of all six pieces here, the sound of the album is probably almost as much a result of one man's work as another's.     And what a sound it is! Abounding in downright brilliant moments, HOT RATS in fact has no weak stretches and the whole comes off as a remarkably sustained statement of artistic intent and possibility.     The elegant, multicolored power of \\"Peaches en Regalia,\\" at once so carefully composed and so wide open, sets the intelligently ass-kicking tone of the LP; more than thirty-five years later, it still sounds like nothing you've ever heard before but also like something which should have existed from the beginning of time.     Zappa makes full use of the then-new equipment available to him, augmenting the power and range of excellent ensemble tracks with an array of overdubs and atmospheric effects. The rapturously stacked organ and piano runs on \\"Little Umbrellas\\"; the awe-inspiring guitar solo wagging the dog in \\"Willie the Pimp\\"; and the magnificent interplay of the entire band on \\"The Gumbo Variations\\" (which also features a powerhouse solo by violinist Sugar Cane Harris) are just some of the pleasures of this truly remarkable achievement. And with state-of-the-art sound now as then (Zappa repeatedly remastered this and his other albums over the years, producing a final version months before his death in 1993), all are revealed with the fullest clarity.     HOT RATS is not only the greatest of jazz-rock fusion albums, but also one of the finest albums in either genre independent of the other. I cannot recommend it too highly, and once you've come to understand why I'd recommend BURNT WEENY SANDWICH as a follow-up.
0131479415|5.0|I find that I have a growing stack of books on *top* of the bookshelf these days. Those are the books I need when I start thinking, \\"I wonder what X would say?\\" and then I dig through the stack. That's where Mike Cohn's books invariably end up. Just this morning, I was reviewing a paper on estimation and I thought, \\"I wonder what Mike says in his new book?\\" What I like about Agile Estimating and Planning is that, yes, of course, it has good practical advice, but it also has interesting theoretical and business infrastructure and, the stories, the stories, the stories! There's even a good case study in the last chapter. We all learn best from examples! Mike's an enjoyable presenter and writer, so this book should definitely be on your bookshelf -- somewhere :-)!

B0007M22TI|3.0|..but not enough diversity in the songs for me.  I kept waiting for a few of the songs to really strike my fancy but the \\"same\\" kept going on and on.  I like Enya's version of their Sail Away better than this one and found the cd is great when one has problems falling asleep.  Yes, their voices were ethereal but I need to be in a certain kind of mood for this kind of music which means I won't be listening to it that often.  Still am glad I've added it to my celtic collection.
B000A3DFZE|3.0|I have been listening to Clapton's 2005 album, \\"Back Home\\" for a while now, and have found some moments that lifted me up. But then there is so much material which makes you wonder if you are listening to the same Clapton we've learned to love and cry to. In spite of the good tracks, \\"Back Home\\" does Clapton's discography a bit of a disservice. Too bad... I will still be trying, though. A man who has composed and recorded so much legendary music in his life will find his way back into his soul again. He just only partially did it this time around.
B00005JOFO|5.0|As you are viewing the film, notice all of the visual clues throughout every scene. These serve to give us the complete magic of cinema since the movies are mainly visual. One of the most subtle clues was the dead viscerated sheep near the beginning of the film. I knew that was an omen of something to come. Was the coyote that killed it a symbolic nod to certain segments of our society? There were so many more. Did anyone else find any of these as well?
B00005AQGH|5.0|I like most people was wondering when the real PAC was going to come back and not the Death Row produced PAC.  Don't get me wrong I loved \\"All Eyez On Me\\" and the tracks on the \\"Gang Related\\" & \\"Gridlock'd\\" soundtrack produced by Death Row but PAC was at his best early on before Death Row and as evidenced by this Makaveli album and the rumors that he was bolting Death Row to start his own thing, was on to bigger and better.  After selling 7 million + of that double CD, and the first rapper to do so I might add, following up \\"All Eyez\\" was not going to be easy.  But listening to this CD is was clear that PAC wasn't trippin off the record sales, he just wanted to be free do what PAC wanted to do.  Which still lends credence to the fact that I still think Suge had PAC set up.  When have you known someone to drive by a car and rain shots into a vehicle and just kill one person but leave the other person harmless.  When you raining down a vehicle in ammo, you are going to leave no witnesses period, unless it's the witness who paid you off to begin with.  Anyway, enuff of that, now to the LP, <br /> <br />Bomb First I was really feeling but I've never been a fan of the Outlawz and their rap style.  I know PAC loved taking in dudes in his camp who have a little talent and helping them out but it's clear after his death that the Outlawz just aren't that talented. <br /> <br />Hail Mary, A hip hip classic for all ages with an eery sound and an even erry lyrics.  That bass kick in the backround is untouched.   <br /> <br />The only song I probably hated was \\"Toss It Up\\" he did with KC & Jo Jo (who were fulfilling obligations to SUGE for getting them out of their earlier contracts)until I saw the X-Rated video for it.   <br /> <br />To Live and Die In LA was a catchy single/pop tune to show his allegiance to the West.  \\"Blaspehmy\\" was political PAC to a certain degree and lyrically tight.   <br /> <br />Krazay, is the introspective PAC and showed a mature side to him I think fans were on the brink of seeing in his later years along with his usual album tribute to his mother and women in general in \\"White Man's World\\".  The lyrics are really deep and poetic and shows the range PAC has to go from straight gangsta one minute to someone who cares deeply about his community going awry.   <br /> <br />Me and My Girlfriend shows PAC at his rawest and blew up the entire fall/winter 96-97 with this track.  I think it was a dig at NAS's earlier release of \\"I Gave You Power\\", which was also about a gun.   <br /> <br />Hold Ya Head strays more towards the political side of PAC and seems to suggest that he knew his time was near. <br /> <br />And of course he saves the best for last in Against All Odds.  If \\"I Hit Em Up\\" is considered one of the best comeback diss records of all time since ICE CUBE's \\"NO VASELINE\\" diss of N.W.A., then \\"Against All Odds\\" can't be far behind.  2PAC basically pulls no punches on who he thinks set him up in N.Y. the first time he got shot named as many suspects as he could and even ate NAS a new azzhole (which is lyrically not an easy thing to do, ask Jigga Man).  It's not only an angry song, but it seems like a song of feelings PAC had pent up for a long time that he was just busting on everybody's ass who had anything to do with anything concerning the New York shooting.  Vicious song.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately we may never know which PAC we were going to get at any moment.  However, I do know PAC was the last boulder removed that permanently destroyed Death Row.  Suge was able to keep Death Row afloat as long as he had PAC and once PAC was on his way out and later killed, Death Row has crumbled and been rubble ever since.  But if Makaveli was any indication of what was to come, we really missed out and is short dog.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I first saw this BBC production the summer of 2005 and even from my t.v. set, the hero and heroine were \\"smoking.\\"  The love story of these two stars is so beautifully acted and portrayed, and there is only one kiss at the end.  The last scene is so fantastic I had to tape it on our dish satellite's dvr and watch is over and over!  Never has there been such a romantic scene in all of modern BBC or any other drama!  And it is only a kiss - far more romantic and better than the current claptrap of our modern age showing everything!  You will fall in love with the star - what a guy!  And the heroine is so spunky and darling too.   <br />My only criticism was that BBC America cut an hour out of the T.V. version so you have to buy the dvd to see what you missed!  That makes me so mad but I guess they get you to buy it. <br />You will never regret it, and while it is a wonderful story for both men and women, women will especially enjoy it a bit better.   It is also good for children - very \\"G\\" rated and gives them a sense of English history in Dickens' time!  Highly recommend!
B00000055E|4.0|Though, this album was rushed out after the sucess of the Makeveli album, it still contains some gems on it.  Unfortunately, the production (lack there of) is average at best.   <br /> <br />Disc one starts off nice with \\"Open Fire\\" \\"R U Still Down\\" and \\"Hellrazor\\" (which is a headnodder and lyrically tight), I like both versions of I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto but prefer Disc 2's version slightly better w/Brownstone singing backround.  \\"Nothing To Lose\\" is definitely the best track on Disc One.  That track along w/Hellrazor is typical 2PAC at his best.  The next three tracks on Disc One however, needed better production period.  I loved the fact that they added \\"Definition of A Thug Nigga\\" (which was previously only available only on the \\"Poetic Justice\\" soundtrack which is one of PAC's hardest joints.   <br /> <br />Disc 2 \\"Do For Love\\" and the hip hop version of \\"I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto\\" were the chosen singles to be released for radio the obvious bangin track is the reggae flavored \\"When I Get Free pt 1\\" which is the slamminest track on there.  Takes me back to A Soldier Story Pt. 1 days.  Too bad it isn't actually PAC's voice on there rappin but the track is hot nonetheless.  \\"16 On Death Row\\" is typical politcal PAC w/a hidden message of course, \\"When I Get Free Pt 2 was okay but compared to the first version on the same side, it's no comparison.   and \\"Only Fear of Death ends the Disc 2 nicely.  The song almost gives you an insight into PAC's state of mind before his death.   <br /> <br />This album had the potential to do much better with better production but PAC's songs like always, seems to supercede even weak production.
B00006L3S3|5.0|This is John Lennon cutting through like he's on the cutting edge.... <br />he doesn't always give a darn and that's why I love it.... his sense of humor on '(Bring On the Lucie) Free the People' is apparent because he shockingly refers to congressional politicians as tripping themselves up (this is a euphamism) and then in that Dylan sort of way... rasps... \\"free the people... now... do it do it do it do it do it nowoweoweoweowe..)\\".... AND GOLL DARN IT....  <br />You can't really tell if Lennon is stoned out of his mind or just telling it how it is... my guess it that it's both.... but this album has more... 'Intuition' has some of my favorite Lennon Lyrics as he seems to be autobiographically telling us his artistic approach to life.. and then there's the wonderful 'Meat City'... that feels urban and talks about Lennon taking it to the street... it's a great rocker that uses that fantastic harmonic medient relationship that he loved so much.... great album.... great sensitivity... fantastic for new or old Lennon fans or music fans in general!
B000005Z0G|4.0|This probably was one of his most overlooked albums because radio refused to play anything off this damn album until he decided to release \\"I Get Around\\" & \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" months after releasing \\"Holla If Ya Hear Me\\" which MTV, BET, radio and other media outlets couldn't say no to because of demand by the audience.  Though \\"Holla\\" was typical angry PAC, the radio had pretty much been on ignore PAC status.  By this time also PAC had already incurred the wrath of our then Vice President Dan Quayle, was being accused of shooting two State Police Officers, and was being blamed for an individual killing a cop in Texas who said listening to this CD made him do it.  So obviously, radio, corporate america and even all of white america made 2PAC to be villain number one on a level that P.E. nor Luke from 2 Live Crew or even N.W.A. could reach.  If you have the Vice President of the U.S. calling you out by name, you must really really struck a wrong nerve :-).  Though that helped this lp sell records, a lot of bangin tracks never got played like it should have.  \\"I Get Around\\" and \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" was just something for the club, radio and video but the real head banger that got lost was the LP title \\"Strictly 4 My Niggaz\\".  That joint just straight rocked and was lyrically tight.  Eventhough Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys may have started that Rock n Roll and rap fusion, with that track, PAC took it to new levels.  Strictly Representin '93 was definitely tight, Soulja's Revenge was a tad bit disappointing compared to Soldier Story pt 1, but then that's a lot to ask to follow up that classic track from 2PACOLYPSE NOW.  \\"Holla If Ya Hear Me\\" started the album nicely \\"Something To Die 4\\" wasn't really a single (sadly, cuz the music to the track was nice) but more of a ghetto introspective on life was deep, \\"Last Wordz\\" with ICECUBE and ICE-T(sadly, ICE-T was lyrically challenged on this song but PAC wanted to work with both ICE's) was hype.  \\"Papaz Song\\" for anybody who didn't have a real pops in their life, was deep and heartfelt and got much airplay in my rotation at the time.  \\"The Streetz R Deathrow\\" w/ the ICECUBE hook in the chorus was just simply off da chain.  5 Deadly Venomz w/Treach and a weak azz Apache (could have left Apache off) had the potential to be much better without Apache.  Overall, this was a nice sophmore album that should have done much better and lyrically, PAC wasn't really the same after this LP.
B000002KDM|5.0|...there are atleast a few other reviewers here that would collectively agree with the fact that this is James Taylor's best album... and not Sweet Baby James... I mean... it's kind of like a best kept secret.... don't get me wrong... I love Sweet Baby James but many people including me will get Sweet Baby James and then quit after that.... don't do that!!!!!!  I really believe this is a more powerful, potent album... it's magical!!!!
B000005Z0E|5.0|Soldier Story Part 1 alone showed what kind of storyteller PAC was in 1991 before it was fashionable to do so in rap.  Outside of NWA (with and without Cube), Public Enemy, KRS-ONe, and Rakim, can you think of an artist or song at that time in 1991, to tell a better urban gangsta tale as Soldier Story pt 1, a very underrated \\"Violent\\" which is one the biggest speaker blowing tracks ever played in my rotation, a hood classic as Brenda's Got A Baby, When My Homies Call, and of course Young Black Male and Trapped.   <br /> <br />His latter albums may have sold more records (All Eyez On Me & Me Against The World), but this is undoubtedly his rawest, and best album lyrically along with the Strictly 4 My Niggaz lp.   <br /> <br />This is when PAC had me hooked.  A Soldier Story pt 1 still sounds good today as it did in '91 when I first copped the album.  This will always be a five star classic.
B00005JL0I|1.0|Tedious, overlong, hard to follow, and- with the exception of one or two bits by Woody Allen- not funny in the least.  You know a movie is bad when, while watching it, you start to think of the need to get your taxes done and the stuff you have to clear off your desk when getting back to work on Monday.  The last ten minutes or so of the movie are particularly painful, as things explode into a mindless, incoherent mess of action and stupid gags.  And believe me, I'm a pussycat when it comes to reviewing... I always try to give the creators the benefit of the doubt and try to find something good to say.  But not here.  Ugh, stay away from this.<br /><br />There is one interesting aspect to the DVD, however.  Included in the special features is the original 50's television adaptation of \\"Casino Royale\\", and it's fun to see.  It has its own problems (its short length and making Bond an American, for example), but compared to the main feature on the DVD,  this production comes off like Shakespeare.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|This was a great movie.  If you liked Seven, I highly recommend it.  If you didn't like Seven or don't like torture movies, etc. then don't see it.  The ending is so cool and I would definitely watch it again!  I am not going into more detail, because you can read it elsewhere, but do watch it.
0684824906|5.0|This is the first volume on Mr. Lincoln that I have read cover to cover. Ms. Kearns Goodwin has meticulously explored the life of Mr. Lincoln and his contemporaries - Salmon Chase, Edward Bates, William Seward and Edwin Stanton. The first 200 pages move a bit slowly as she sets the stage for the Lincoln presidency. Once Mr. Lincoln is elected the book moves electrifyingly fast. She carefully fleshes out Mr. Lincoln's character so that by the end of the book your heart aches for the loss we have all suffered. THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING BOOK!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|This movie has it all- great story with drama and emotion, wonderful special effects and some great acting by Naomi Watts. I am anxiously awaiting the DVD even though nothing beats seeing this on the BIG movie theatre screen- this was one movie that must be seen in the theatre for full effect.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I love this movie as much as Notting Hill and 4 Weddings and a Funeral. The different storylines keep you laughing and crying. Collin who goes to Wisconsin is absolutely hilarious and you cheer for what he encounters, though unrealistic! Sam, the son of Daniel (Liam Neeson) is fantastic, as is Emma Thompson. You feel her heartache. My favorite is probably Hugh Grant and his Natalie. What a gag she is with a 1000 watt smile. the 'porn' is done in total jest, and anyone who is offended needs to lighten up. It's much ado about nothing. Perfect to see with your honey. My guy even liked it.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|What better place to open a movie titled Sahara then in an Ironclad off the Virginian shore during the Civil War? Apparently our hero of the movie, Dirk Pitt played by bongo enthusiast Matthew McConaughey, thinks that the same Ironclad sailed the Atlantic and wound up in Africa. And that isn't the most far fetched part of the movie because Penelope Cruz plays a doctor from the World Health Organization. And to remind you that her character is smart, they routinely put her in glasses in hopes of fooling you. <br /> <br />Rounding out the cast is go to goofy sidekick Steve Zahn as Pitt's goofy sidekick that he's known since high school. William H. Macy makes a couple appearances as Pitt's boss. And Dwight Schrute himself steps out of The Office to add some comic relief when Zahn's goofball antics just aren't enough. <br /> <br />The film itself plays like as if Indiana Jones was a present day oceanographer. But instead of those darn dirty Nazi, Dirk has to save his love interest of the moment from African Warlords who is poisoning his enemies and sees the WHO as a threat. But it takes a while for the movie to move along and seems as they deleted some important aspects from the movie, which is based on a popular series of books on Pitt, due to time limits. Some of the action scenes are cool including an odd wind-surfing sequence. But really not cool enough to completely save Sahara.
B000002J09|5.0|Hmmm....  I still remember the first time I heard \\"Stairway\\" and the first time I heard this record from beginning to end.  This is an exceptional recording... a must have...
0440241588|3.0|Even though the background of the character is a lawyer, the story is nothing related to court room, judges or law. It's more like a Tom Clancy's - spy and national security. Too elaborate on the Italy's sight seeing, especially Bologna, which doesn't really help building up the story, but a bit of dragging too long. The Broker doesn't have the sophistication like other John-court-room-focus fictions, but it looks like an amateur trying it's first attempt in spy fiction. Story too simple, ending too expected.
6305127689|4.0|Tom Cruise was first noticed in All the Right Movies.  He became a star with Risky Business.  And he became an action star and romance star with Top Gun. <br /> <br />Top Gun refers to an elite fighter pilot school.  Pete \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell (Cruise) is a hot shot fighter pilot.  He is one of the best except he is a showoff.  When the number one fighter on his ship looses his nerve, Maverick and his second, Mack \\"Goose\\" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards), get sent to Miramar to attend Fighter Weapons School - Top Gun.  It is set out early that his main competition is Tom \\"Iceman\\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer).  The boys go out for a little tail.  Maverick meets Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Blackwood and she blows him out the sky.  The following day a new instructor is introduced.  It's Charlie! <br /> <br />The bulk of the remaining movie is about the training and Maverick pursing Charlie.  He catches her and it's intense.  They graduate but there is a crisis in the Indian Ocean and the guys are sent out to give air support with a real enemy. <br /> <br />This film was made at the height of the music video frenzy.  Therefore, it is not surprising that it often looks like a music video.  Its rock score compliments its action sequence.  The fighter sequences don't keep you on the edge of your seat, they knock you off your seat!   <br /> <br />By the way Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone is not only the best song of the year but it is the perfect example of the use a song to advance a scene.  This should have won the Oscar. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise parlayed this role into superstardom. Unfortunately, no one else was as lucky.  Kelly McGillis never made it past second lead.  Val Kilmer decided to go with more character driven roles.  Anthony Edwards didn't find fame until ER. <br /> <br />Look for a young Meg Ryan as Goose's widow and Tim Robbins as Goose's replacement. Like Edwards, some of the supporting actors found their fame in TV including Adrian Pasdar (Mysterious Ways and others) and Clarence Gilyard (Walker Texas Ranger). <br /> <br />This is a great action film and a very good romance.  This means it's a great date film. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B000001ELP|4.0|This album is difficult to review.  I prefer to review it--and pretend I did not know it was Kiss.  There are some stunning vocal productions; \\"Just a Boy\\", by Paul, is a tribute to musical genius.  Ace rips with \\"Dark Light\\" and some of the drums are, technically, outstanding.  There is no doubt that, when I first purchased this record (CD's weren't even available then), I had to read, re-read, and check the album to make sure it was a Kiss album. . .it was so different. . .too different.  Now, 20 years later, I see the genius of Paul Stanley--his unequivocal vocals; Ace's strong guitars, and the drums. . .THE DRUMS--are so well done.  I only give it 4 out of 5 BECAUSE it is Kiss.  If I were to grade it based on concept, quality of music, individuality, talent, and presentation:  it would be a 5--but it isn't a \\"Kiss album\\" for sure.  I treasure this album because, I believe, this is THE album that stands for what a TRUE believer and fan of Kiss believes:  to believe in yourself; to dream it is to do it; to \\"BELIEVE in ME\\".  Gene Simmons song, \\"I\\" is a tribute to everything Kiss is, stands for, and means to anybody who has stuck with this band through the ages.  Kiss is, without doubt, about 'rock n' roll'; but here we have Gene (a college graduate), Paul (a partially deaf, graduate of New York's famed high school class); Gene who has never done drugs or alcohol tell us what we are all about:  \\"I believe in me!\\"  This album is religion to the true fan. . .

B00003CX5P|4.0|JUST WHAT IS THE PHANTOM MENACE?: [plot spoilers BELOW]  <br /> <br />The \\"Phantom Menace\\" opens with Obi-Wan Kenobi [Ewan McGregor] as a young apprentice Jedi. Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) is his very stable mentor. Anakin Skywalker [Jake Lloyd], the future father of Luke Skywalker who will become the evil Darth Vader, is just a 9-year-old boy. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter of the Trade Federation cutting off all access routes to the planet Naboo. Somehow the Trade Federation seems to think they have a legal right to do this. However, when the Jedi's arrive on the Trade Federations vessel for peaceful negotiation, they are immediately attacked and marked for death. Switching to plan B, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escort Queen Amidala [Natalie Portman] from Naboo to a meeting of the Republic's leaders in Coruscant, but mechanical problems with their spaceship force them to land on the planet Tatooine. Here, Qui-Gon meets Anakin who has been living with his mother as the slave of a salvage dealer. Believing that Anakin could be the leader the Jedis have been searching for, Qui-Gon attempts to bargain with the Salvage Dealer for Anakin's freedom. Naturally, Qui-Gon plans to get permission from the Jedi counsel to instruct Anakin about the \\"The Force\\", with aims at making him a Jedi and the ultimate savior of the galaxy. All of this comes to a climax during the pod race which settles the issue of Anakin's freedom and gets Qui-Gon the spare parts he needs to repair his ship. This allows the Jedis to continue on their voyage to transport the Queen and bring Anakin to the Jedi Counsel to seek their approval for his training.  <br /> <br />BUT THAT'S NOT ALL:  <br />Of course, things don't go exactly like they are supposed to and there are many obstacles to be overcome. Many still exist at the film's conclusion. Some characters are notably absent and some are killed off, much to my chagrin, but it is, after all, something that happened long ago and far away!This is okay, because there are two more prequels to follow and settle these issues and, most of all, to illustrate Anakin's rise and ultimate fall to the \\"Dark Side of The Force\\".  <br /> <br />IS THIS A WORTHY ADDITION TO THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE? <br /> <br />Star Wars is a tough act to follow - pure and simple. So what could be more difficult than creating a prequel trilogy for the most celebrated film trilogy in history? Add to that, high space fantasy, huge expectations, and the lack of plot resolutions in each individual segment of the prequel trilogy, and you're looking at a tall order before one even looks at the technology and budget needed to do this thing right. To achieve the ultimate goal of this film -- which is to tie together the original trilogy with the convulsive elements that caused the \\"STAR WARS\\" in the first place -- is impossible until the prequel trilogy is complete. Now in 2006, having had the opportunity to see the prequel trilogy in its entirety, this opening segment [The Phantom Menace] feels and plays much better than it did before the trilogy was completed. The effects are wonderful and very real, the dialogue, never a strong point, still isn't, but the story and the spectacle do get told. As a piece of a 5-star, 6-film saga, this is a worthy component. <br /> <br />A neat film and an even neater DVD with very interesting features. Well worth seeing, but, \\"THE REVENGE OF THE SITH\\" held my attention and interest much tighter throughout the entire film. <br /> <br />

B000BKVQTS|2.0|The Brothers Grimm seems to have started with the germ of an idea \\"What if fairy tales had a real basis?\\"  That's a good start, but the movie went off the rails after that.<br /><br />The story line was muddled, somehow including the French/German political landscape of 1810 in the plot.  The characters are uneven.<br /><br />For example, there is this truly horrible Italian torture specialist who goes from being a terrible and annoying character to a sympathetic character towards the end of the movie with little explanation as to why.  The same happens with the \\"Trapper\\" girl who loses her skins partway through the movie and starts wearing pretty dresses.<br /><br />The conflict between the brothers in unclear and seems to center on one's dreamy nature and the others cynical realism.  But the conflict is poorly managed and doesn't play out well.<br /><br />The ending makes little or no sense.  Overall, a disappointing effort.  Perhaps they ran out of time to hone the script.
B000CBSHK2|5.0|I remember reading somewhere around the time the \\"Daybreaker\\" was released that Beth meant it to conclude the trilogy of albums that included \\"Trailer Park\\" and \\"Central Reservation\\". Not included in the \\"trilogy\\" was a \\"Best Bit\\" EP issued between 1st and 2nd CD but, musically, it definitely belonged there. That body of work appeared to be of dual nature; alternating between electronically colored, hypnotic at times, extended grooves and acoustic, guitar only, folk songs. I absolutely loved that part of her music where she applied the experience gained while with William Orbit or Chemical Brothers.     In the current album, \\"Comfort of Strangers\\", she is more consistent than she ever was. The music is more in the \\"urban folk\\" category (if there is such a term). The frugal instrumentation of bass, drums, guitar and/or piano puts so much more emphasis on Beth Orton's voice. The occasional touches of cello and viola are reminiscent of her prior arrangements. A harmonica or accordion, in couple of songs, just adds to quiet drama of her lyrics. The music on this album swings; swings in the rock sense, of course. The ever pulling rhythm is always there; sometimes loud and clear in front, other times muted yet pulsating behind. I rarely focus on the lyrics but they are a treat here; \\"...I don't care how much religion you've got, you've got to put a lot of love in your heart (whole lotta love in your heart)\\". Was it a concious Led Zeppelin quote? If only the reprinted lyrics in the booklet were easier to read I would have told you more about them. The focus on her voice and lyrics is what probably makes the songs very short. They are tight and to the point. Makes me yearning for more.     The song \\"Conceived\\" received a lot of publicity prior to album's release and it foretells quite well of what to expect. It doesn't necessarily mean that it is the best song. The beauty of this CD is in the fact that people can find their own favorites, and on top of that, the favorites might be different depends on the time or type of day.    In summary, Beth Orton found her own voice, departed from the influence of her prior associations and delivered something that is very personal, contemporary (without trying to be trendy) and speaking to us about what really matters; our relationships.

I don't mind books about marriage. And so the first part, Little Women book I, was a perfect portrait of a family. A good book, despite the heavy prejudice I carried against it, as it was (gasp) A Required Reading Book.<br /><br />The Part II, Good Wives, was -- er....interesting. Let's go through it, marriage by marriage.<br /><br />Meg's marriage. Cute. Same age, good match, and even I, who have decided that my marriage to ANYONE (or dating, for that matter) would be a sign of the Apocolypse, could understand why some less fortunate souls devote their life to another, staying with that person forever (well, not in the twenty-first century they don't - unfortunately). Meg and John Brooke was good. Nice. Sweet. You get it. Now let's move on.<br /><br />Laurie (Theodore's his real name, for all you thinking that to name a male child Laurie is about the greatest measure of torture you can inflict upon a boy) and Amy.

She hits the ripe ol' halfway mark (in a manner of speaking) at fifty, and where is he? Seventy. Ol' granddad over there.<br /><br />Yep. Loved the book, hated the last romance. That's all I have to say.<br /><br />Rating: Very Good
B0001L3LUE|5.0|A very powerful and thought provoking documentary; made even more-so by the current state of affairs around the world. Robert McNamara knows all too well how government can (and sometimes \\"must\\") act like a belligerent and hypocritical oaf when it comes to foreign affairs. There is, perhaps, no other single living human being in the world today who can be held more responsible for & who has experienced as much mass strife, violence and conflict in the world today other than McNamara (an unfortunate shock due to a new awareness of my lack of accurate historical information). His involvement in international conflicts ranges from WWII up through to Vietnam.<br /><br />The director truly does a masterful job in providing an incredibly candid look at an individual who has had such a dramatic impact on our recent history. The honesty McNamara conveys is both shocking and a breath of fresh air at the same time. A most uncommon result of today's political rhetoric. Recounting his past, McNamara's range of emotions are even palpable. The collage of archived film clips and dramatic musical scores cut with McNamara's raw emotion makes for one of the most powerful films I've ever seen on this subject.<br /><br />His insights on perception and \\"reality\\" especially stand out in the context of how the current administration is conducting their mass scale war at home and abroad.<br /><br />McNamara was recently in attendance at a meeting with President Bush at the White house. What a terrific sequel that would make! Attendees at the meeting included a number of former government security officials, in what some said, was an attempt by Bush to show that he was open to outside ideas and criticisms. I hope it worked, but see no evidence to that effect at this point.<br /><br />In conclusion, I must note the recently released documentary \\"Why We Fight.\\"  It opened in limited release last week and is based around the exit speech given by Dwight D. Eisenhower as he left office in 1950's. It looks like the two films would compliment each other nicely.<br /><br />The Fog of War - HIGHLY RECOMMENED!n 1950's.

B00005JO1P|5.0|My wife and I are long time fans of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash.  We went to see the movie a few days ago and were very moved by the movie.  It was well put together, the acting was great and  the singing was was very close to original.  We were amazed by almost exact mannerism's of Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Johnny Cash.  The singing was very good and it was as if Johnny was singing again.  It depicts a very troubled life, full of despair and pain.  But the love and strength of God and of a wonderful woman helps to pull this man from his crying out.  He becomes a great man with incredible strength and a solid life based on his faith in God. We have almost every album of Johnny Cash and will buy this movie also.
B000BTDMDC|4.0|These are UK club/pub tunes and should be heard accordingly.  Are they as great as The Beatles as one reviewer said?  Oh my god no.  But the lyrics are indisputably fun, the drum work is great and the occasional change-ups in the tunes give a live dynamic quality to most of the tracks.  The band certainly deserves 4 stars for such a fun CD.  The singer does not have the annoying high pitched voice that almost all male singers are singing with nowadays.     Note that their are about 10 demo tracks and B-sides that are quite excellent that are floating around in the UK.  Hard to find right now in the USA but the demo tracks really make a case for this band having actual talent.
0553275976|1.0|I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look. <br /> <br />Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc. <br /> <br />I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well.

B00005JOM9|5.0|With all the hype surrounding BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN this year (2005), it was surprising  that TRANSAMERICA clearly got overlooked in many film award categories. Although Felicity Huffman received a Best Actress win from the Golden Globes (and an Oscar nomination), this movie really deserves MUCH more praise. Not only was the basic film better than BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (my opinion), it had stronger supporting roles.<br /><br />I also need to pontificate about the unfairness of independent films and how Hollyweird views them when Oscar time rolls around. If you doubt this, all we need to do is look at THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S reviews of Brokeback (large approval rating) and TRANSAMERICA (a negative ranking). I think this type of inconsistent approval/disapproval of similar films is also because the \\"big\\" movies get more press because they have the money to shove around for promotional purposes, while the little indie's have to struggle on minuscule budgets.<br /><br />If you're man (or woman) enough to sit and open your mind to people's problems, you're sure to enjoy TRANSAMERICA. Dealing with the life of one man's desire to become a woman, this film shows us the internal and external battles one might face. And when Bree (aka Stanley) decides to undergo a final surgical alteration to make her \\"all woman\\" she has to get approval by a medical doctor as well as a psychologist. The movie begins with Bree getting that approval, only to have it yanked away by the discovery of a child of which she/he is the father. Toby (an amazing Kevin Zegers), calls his father - Bree - one day with a request to bail him out of jail. Bree has to travel from L.A. to New York to accomplish this (at the behest of his/her psychologist). Bree then has to bring her 17-year-old boy across the U.S., but doesn't tell him he/she is his father. The tension in the film is continually ratcheted up as Bree struggles to make sense of her own life while trying to keep her/his son from self-imploding. Bree also has to deal with her/his family during their travels across country, and it's both funny and sad to watch the dysfunctional antics of children and adults alike.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, too, the supporting cast is excellent. Not only was Felicity Huffman (DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES TV series) completely believable as a female actor acting like a man who wants to become a woman, but Kevin Zegers pulls in an awesome performance as her confused son. Fionnula Flanagan (WAKING NED DEVINE, 1998) performs the part of an overbearing mother as if born to the part. Burt Young (ROCKY series) sheds his hard-nosed \\"Paulie\\" persona in the Rocky films and becomes the reluctant supporter of his son's choice to change into a woman. Even Graham Greene gives us a tough but ultimately ignorant man who helps drive Bree and his/her son across several states.<br /><br />TRANSAMERICA goes beyond VICTOR/VICTORIA and BOYS DON'T CRY, and gives us the true meaning of what it is to be a person. It's not about the sex. It's all about the other things, family, self-worth, and all those insignificant items that add up quickly to form one giant melting pot we all find ourselves in.<br /><br />What a shame more Oscar nominations weren't given to this terrific character film.lso has to deal with her/his family during their travels across country, and it's both funny and sad to watch the dysfunctional antics of children and adults alike.  <br /> <br />As I stated earlier, too, the supporting cast is excellent.

0316666343|2.0|What a disappointment.   <br /> <br />First, in the interest of full disclosure:  my name is Susie Salmon.  It's not every day that someone writes a book where a character with my name is horribly murdered and dismembered at age fourteen.  I can't say I was thrilled.  For months the first question people had upon meeting me was, \\"have you read...?\\"  I resisted reading the book for a long time, despite recommendations from everyone from my boss's wife to an old high-school acquaintance.   <br /> <br />Well, I finally broke down and picked it up at a book exchange a couple of weeks ago.  Maybe my expectations were unreasonable, what with my name and all, but I found the book trite, shallow, and immature.  Though I was totally willing to suspend my disbelief and accept Susie's version of heaven, I could not accept the inexplicable behavior of the people left on earth.  Conflicts were resolved abruptly and irrationally.  Intriguing characters and relationships were sidelined or sadly underdeveloped.   <br /> <br />I read two other books right before this one - Patricia Cornwall's \\"nonfiction\\" outlining her theory of the identity of Jack the Ripper and another called Good Grief.  The Lovely Bones shared aspects with each book - a serial killer, death, loss, grief.  Neither was a great work of art, but both were better-written and more satisfying reads.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|I have been a fan of the original release for years, though I know David Lynch has said he never liked the way it turned out and I can understand why.  Interestingly though, Frank Herbert was involved in the making of the movie and was fascinated by the process of interpreting a novel in movie form.  He enjoyed this version of his story and saw it as a valid interpretation, and that's the way I choose to see it. <br />     As for the latest release here of that old TV edit, I can only say that it is interesting, but certainly not as good as the original edit.  Recycled footage, poor dialogue that added nothing crucial, none of it was worth restoring.  If you have read the entire series of books as I have, you already understand the plot, and none of the additional footage or narration is really necessary.  It only succeeds in destroying David Lynch's signature style.   <br />     What bothered me most about this new release was the removal of Princess Irulan's voice and replacing it with some anonymous man in the narration.  In the books, each section begins with a quote from various important historic figures in the history of Mua'dib or the Holy War, and Princess Irulan was often quoted from her memoirs, recalling various things about Paul, whom she married later on.  Why they chose to remove her entirely from the movie except as set dressing, I don't know. <br />
B0002STNQ2|2.0|Michael Crichton is one of the best popular writers today. I don't think that's debatable. That fact makes Prey all the more disappointing. In it, Crichton relies too heavily on his page-turning style of writing (similar to Harlan Coben) and abandons what made him a must-read - a plot people believe. Maybe he's a victim of his success. Regardless, the characters here are shallow and undeveloped and the \\"horrifying\\" nanobots are really more of a joke than a threat. Anyone could predict the end if they're paying attention in the first couple of chapters. Unfortunately, you have to read 350 or so pages to confirm that assumption.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I cannot believe some of the reviews for this CD.  I don't understand how anyone could give this CD one star.  This is one of my most favorite CD's ever.  Someone said this CD gets boring, again I don't understand that.  I've listened to this CD about once a day for the last 4 months.  Someone said they couldn't understand the words...they need to get their ears cleaned out.  Someone else said all the songs sound the same...they must have had their cd player on repeat.  None of these songs sound the same.   <br /> <br />This is one of the best CD's for this genre of music.  BUY IT NOW!
B000CBSHK2|5.0|Ever since \\"Central Reservation,\\" and other than a couple of tracks -Sweetest Deline\\" and her collaboration with Terry Callier, I've been missing her full emotional range, her voice and her lyrics back at the center again.<br /><br />Comfort of Strangers is that promised fulfilled. Jim O'Rourke produced the miracle, reaching for Orton's heart, and recording a set of tracks that is both eclectic and finely wrought together. This is an album, that rare species of CDs that contain no duds, it's all great.<br /><br />Still, gems abound. Listen for instance to her voice in the gorgeous Comfort To Stragers, Rectify, Feral Children, Safe in Your Arms, or the lyrics and groove of Worms. She can sings!<br /><br />Jim O'Rourke's gift is in the nuances and details, here he offers precisely what each song needed. Some almost a wisp of guitar and a quiet bass, or piano, strings or horns in those places where it was the thing to have.<br /><br />This is a great album, an obvious choice for anyone who'd followed her career, a perfect place to start in your way to Central Reservation, or just a tremendous addtion to any respectable collection.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Great CD, and you get more than your money's worth in terms of length.  Favorite cuts:  Walking in the Air (hearing this on the radio made me buy the CD) and Walk My Love.  Least favorite: jumpy version of Orinoco Flow.
B000069I1C|3.0|Director Tom Dey evidences with SHOWTIME that he must have passed the Cinematic Academy's Buddy Cop 101, as this movie is a replay of so many movies, they're almost interchangeable.  Robert DeNiro, seeming to enjoy doing comedy, stars as a seasoned veteran who after destroying a tv camera, is faced with a 10 million dollar lawsuit OR...agreeing to participate in a reality tv show partnered with somewhat inept patrolman Eddie Murphy.  Rene Russo fills in the role of the aggressive producer who helms the series, which becomes a hit, at DeNiro's chagrin.  The movie's plot involves a mean and nasty gunrunner and it's up to our heroic pair to get him off the streets.<br /><br />As a comedy, there have been funnier buddy cop movies; as an action drama, it has its fair share of exciting chases and some explosive action, climaxing in a swimming pool disaster.<br /><br />It's certainly not a high point in either actor's career, but there's some fun in watching two talented actors try and make a movie better than it really is.
0385504209|4.0|I believe the Da Vinci Code answers a few questions, but opens more up at the same time.  The \\"Hype\\" derives from the same kind of hype that was for the \\"Rolling Stones\\" or anyone else the first of their kind.  This book is the first of its kind, though like the Rolling Stones, it's STILL pretty damn entertaining.  Yes, the characters are flat, but the myth is the center of the plot, and character developement is held to a minimum since this takes place in only a day (sorry if I gave away some of the plot).  The book is action-orientated, I felt I was traveling along the various destinations and I believe that's what a book should do.  As said in the previous opinion, don't read too seriously into this book, while most of it is factual, the truth can never be certain.  Come away reading from this book not changing your religion but by changing the way you view the world.  As Socrates once put it, \\"The unexamined life for man is not worth living\\"
B00097DXZS|3.0|Yes, three albums in, the gimmick - Carlos Santana inviting a selection of guests from all `cross the musical spectrum to lay vocals atop his signature midtempo guitar-driven jam band groove (an idea that Herbie Hancock poached to mostly satisfying effect with his new record Possibilities) - has grown quite stale, a conclusion made all the more evident by All That I Am's leadoff single, \\"I'm Feeling You,\\" a fun but less-than-substantive collaboration with Michelle Branch (all kidding aside, one of my favorite people on the planet) that was pretty much a carbon copy (a crassly derivative one at that) of their previous teamup, 2002's Grammy-winning smash \\"The Game of Love.\\"  It was sparkling magic the first time around; this time, it just felt warmed over, and radio was right not to take the bait.  Don't be foolish enough, however, to think that the entire record is like this:  there's a fascinating duet betwixt Sean Paul and the hilariously overpraised Joss Stone, and there's bravura work from Aerosmith's Steven Tyler on the set's second single, \\"Just Feel Better.\\"  It's not quite the jaw-dropper that \\"Smooth\\" was back in the day, but played as it will be alongside Fall Out Boy and the All-American Rejects in today's radio environment, it'll still shine like the Hope diamond.
B0009NSE1K|4.0|I definitely consider myself a Clutch fan, but I do feel like their releases can be uneven.  If we start with the first full-length, Transnational Speedway, I would venture to claim that every second album is a bit weaker.  Since this was one of those every-other-albums, does the pattern hold true?  Yes, and no.  Overall, I do like this album alot.  I think that, with Blast Tyrant, this represents Clutch's strongest back-to-back releases.  However, it just doesn't quite measure up to Blast Tyrant, which I think is among their best.  When I say \\"weaker\\" releases, it has alot to do with having spots that sag or bring down the rest of the album.  Whereas every song on Blast Tyrant is a winner, this one fades for me towards the end.  I love tracks like \\"10001110101,\\" but I feel like the Robot Hive loses momentum towards the end, especially since it includes not one but blues covers in row to finish out the album.  This decision, to me, sort of stretches the album out after it feels like it is supposed to be finished, without really adding much.  Couldn't they have released these some other way?  Anyway, I would still unreservedly recommend this to any Clutch fan.  You just might find yourself turning it off sometimes before it is done.
B000000OSE|5.0|Not only is this my favorite Guns N' Roses album, it was also the first I owned. While Appetite for Destruction may be the band's most essential relase I personally found the Use Your Illusion albums to be the most entertaining. There is a tremendous amount of variety on this album, from fast thrashy rockers (Perfect Crime), to epic ballads (November Rain), to sleazy hard rock (Bad Obsession), to completely acoustic music (You Ain't the First) and everything in between. While this album does not boast as many stand out tracks as part 2, it is overall a more consistent album. Not every track is great but they all work together to form a harmonious whole. This is an album that I can return to year after year and still be thoroughly entertained by. Highly recommended listening to anyone interested in the band.
0805076476|5.0|I'm another one of those who read the book after seeing the movie. I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that the book was a tad disappointing to read after seeing the movie. I've read books after viewing the movie before and it's usually a whole different experience, but not this time. I'm not saying it's a bad book, it's just the movie is extremely accurate to the book (one of the most accurate I've come across actually), even to the point of using pretty much the same exact dialog. The movie also has narration so you hear the inner thoughts of the characters. Usually this is the one major aspect of reading a book that makes it differ from the movie, but not in this case. When reading this book, you really don't get inside the heads of the characters any more than you do when viewing the movie.<br /><br />Palahniuk tells a really great and compelling story. There are a lot of twists and flips in the story-line that tie-up into an interesting and unexpected conclusion at the end. There is really great character development. Though most of what the characters do is pretty questionable and very morally wrong at times, you find yourself in complete concurrence with their actions. The only problem I can state is he's not the most descriptive writer. When it comes to describing people, places or things, he's just kind of so-so.<br /><br />Overall, I have to rate the book five stars because it was indeed a great book. I really suggest reading this book before viewing the movie though because it is extremely accurate to the book. I felt myself kind of trudging along in parts of the book because I knew exactly what was going to happen. However, the book itself is brilliantly written and the story is very original and creative.
B00005B36H|5.0|To me, Tool's Lateralus is the most amazing piece of music ever composed. I think Tool deliberately wanted to give their fans something truly amazing, but wanted them to find it on their own. \\"Recognize this as a holy gift...\\" At first, I thought that the song Lateralus was about tripping acid - discovering true color by seperating the body from the mind. At first listen, I imagined the bending envelope as an intense visual. After becoming more familiar with the track, however, I had reformed my interpretation to something broader: think deeper. Lateralus, perhaps because it is the album's \\"title track\\", serves as the central clue for a puzzle that a friend of mine had read about somewhere on the internet. \\"All I know is that there is a different order for the songs - something about two spirals. Oh yeah, and thirteen is in the middle.\\" After scavenging through endless google search results, I gave up on finding more about this 'alternate order'. Intent to figure the album out, and very curious about the spirals - I put on the proverbial 'thinking cap'. I understood how the spirals could have a lot of significance, in that the album's title track offers the inspiring, \\"swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human..........And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been. We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.\\" In my internet scavenging, I had read one review, written by a drummer, who mentioned that Danny Carey's drum beat formed a fibonacci sequence during the song Lateralus. A drummer myself, I decided to get out the graph paper and follow Danny. I can't play like he can, but at least I can hear everything he's doing, and thus was able to construct the drum tabulature. Sure enough, Danny repeats a Fibonacci sequence through the number 13: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13. After 13, he starts again with 1. Bringing in my Algebra 2 knowledge of the Fibonacci sequence, when the equation for the Fibonacci sequence (which I don't actually know) is graphed, it forms a sprial whose vertex depends on the number at which the sequence begins. Coincidence? I began to think not. I had already known of Danny's obsession with sacred geometry and am familiar with Bob Frissell's book, Nothing in This Book Is True, But It's Exactly How Things Are , so the significance of what I had stumbled upon had actually begun to settle in. This is where I just had to play with Lateralus. I had doodled a few spirals in the corners of my graph paper, and in doing so made the first important connection to Lateralus. I knew that if the tracks were in fact intended to be heard in a different order, \\"Parabol\\" and \\"Parabola\\" would have to go together. In drawing my spirals, I had begun with a vertex and 'spiraled' outwards. After writing the numbers 1 through 13 linearly, I could immediately see that Parabol and Parabola would have to be the middle of my spiral (in that 13 / 2 = 6.5). I drew a simple arrow between 6 and 7 and then pondered the next pair. At first, I actually drew a spiral connecting pairs of numbers whose sum equaled 13 (the number of songs on the album). This, however, left the last track in the same position and without anything to connect to. At this time, I had used my copy of Lateralus and Cool Edit Pro to take out the silences between tracks and put the songs in the following order: 6,7,5,8,4,9,3,10,2,11,1,12,13. The transition from Parabola into Schism blew my mind, as the plucks, probably dismissed by listeners as a drawn out rant of an ending, perfectly transition into the beginning of Schism. When you count out beats as the strings are plucked, Schism resumes with the same time signature and tempo - mirroring the progression of notes. The transition from Schism into Ticks & Leeches is equally intriguing. Schism ends with strong double-kick bass and tom smacks, and Ticks & Leeches begins with what many would call a 'tribal' drum beat. The beat at the very start of Ticks & Leeches is slightlydifferent every subsequent time it is repeated - the measures are two beats longer. Yup - you guessed it - those two beats are ACTUALLY the last two beats of Schism. I can honestly say that I never understood the album's fourth track, Mantra until reordering the album's songs. What I had originally heard as whale calls now had begun to resemble the worst imaginable dry heaves - or a stylized choking. Fitting, seeing as how the last line in Ticks & Leeches is \\"I hope you choke.\\" After this transition, none of those following it really seemed to make much sense. I certainly didn't like that Disposition and Reflection had been seperated - as they sound quite good when played sequentially on the album. This was the only real roadblock in my disciphering of the Holy Gift. Then I had remembered what my friend had told me - 13 was in the middle. At the time, probably just wanting to believe that there was more to this cd, I had equated this to the positioning of the song \\"Intermission\\" on the previous release, nema. For the song to be in the 'middle' of the album it would have to be the seventh track in sequence, here having six tracks on either side of it. So I inserted Faaip de Oiad after Lateralus, and almost peed my pants when I discovered that (ever-so-faintly) the fading tone of the last note of Lateralus could be heard in beginning of Faaip de Oiad, and how the distortion of the guitars at the tail end of Lateralus resembled, and later transitioned seamlessly into, the static at the beginning of Faaip de Oiad. The lyrics of Lateralus justify this break in the spiral, almost instructing: \\"spiral out, keep going, spiral out, keep going.\\" I went back to Lateralus to find the next clue. In Danny Carey's amazingly competent Fibonacci sequence, he had stopped at 13 and gone back to 1. This is what I chose to do to finish the sequence. A second spiral was now constucted, and the order for the Holy Gift now became 6,7,5,8,4,9,13,1,12,2,11,3,10. Already many of you are probably fascinated at what I have revealed to you, but I can not even begin to tell you what this new order has opened up for me. The beauty of Lateralus is very, very fragile and has to be viewed with a very open mind. It can also be different when looked at from different points of view. Aside from the fact that the new order of the songs places them in an order where they flow together nicely - often ending and resuming on the same notes or within the same progression, and some times - in the case of Lateralus into Faaip de Oiad and The Grudge into Triad - even overlapping (though admittadly sound much better when actually electronically overlapped, this is kind of cheating. Consider this a hint, however, if you plan on doing this yourself), the two spirals help to tell a story that every Tool fan should hear. In the interest of not boring the only casually intrigued, I will try to keep this very brief. I would also recommend familiarizing yourselves with Frissell's book (yeah - the one I mentioned earlier). I consider Parabol and Parabola to be quite expository. Maynard wants us to know that no matter what happens, we must all know that this is not our only existance. Our very minds and the contents of our subconscious are intended to be immortal, and if we accept this into our lives (be it because of personal or religious reasons), it will be so. As such, pain is an illusion. At first, I called it \\"The Lateralus Prophecy\\" (for reasons you will soon understand), but I have since decided to call the 'reordered' version of Lateralus \\"The Holy Gift\\". As Maynard says, \\"Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing,\\" I take the word \\"this\\" to mean much more than just his simple cautioning. Since Parabola is the second track of the Holy Gift, it can be considered at the beginning (esp. considering the context of it's duality with Parabol), and as such, I interpret Maynard's words as more than just clever lyrics in a song. They are a plead for his listeners to listen to everything he has to say and truly celebrate the chance of immortality offered throughout. I would be lying if I said that each song has a specific translation. On the contrary, Tool's music is designed to make you think, not say something specific. It must be treated like great literature - much is hidden contextually. I will elude to Geometric-Drumming's previous post, where he explains the time signatures of Schism: \\"It represents the title...it's arranged in 12/8 time which is SPLIT into 5/8 and 7/8 - which only really FITS as you PUT THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER.\\" Where Geometric-Drumming claims Schism as his favorite Tool song, I have heard some fans say that it was a retched pick for the album's only single - but I think it was brilliant. Not to downplay the interpretations of those who have posted before me (in fact, I agree with much of what %BlueSoulRobot% has to say), but I think that to the casual listener who knows nothing of Tool, it can be a powerful invitation. Think about it - a lot of dingbats with MTV and a radio would walk around with the words \\"I know the pieces fit\\" in their heads. I wonder how many of them took the time to put the pieces back together to (re)discover what is trying to be communicated. I welcome any feedback. I would love to share interpretations of the songs via email - just too lengthy to post here. I would like to offer the following advice: DO NOT use MP3s to digitally reorder Lateralus. A lot of VERY IMPORTANT information is encoded on the actual cd. Ever notice how everyone who has lost or broken that cd has IMMEDIATELY gone out and bought a new copy? I know I have. It's because there are things encoded on the factory pressing of the cd that are lost in the mp3 compression process and any direct copy onto a cd-r. If you want to do it, do it right - I can't stress how important this is. Use the cda tracks as you put it together and maintain all audio fidelity using professional mixing software.  <br /> <br /> There's a Fibonacci in Maynard's lyrics, specifically the syllables:  <br /> <br /> black [1]  <br /> <br /> then [1]  <br /> <br /> white are [2]  <br /> <br /> all I see [3]  <br /> <br /> in my infancy [5]  <br /> <br /> red and yellow then came to be [8]  <br /> <br /> reaching out to me [5]  <br /> <br /> lets me see [3]  <br /> <br /> there is [2]  <br /> <br /> so [1]  <br /> <br /> much [1]  <br /> <br /> more and [2]  <br /> <br /> beckons me [3]  <br /> <br /> to look through to these [5]  <br /> <br /> infinite possibilities [8]  <br /> <br /> as below so above and beyond I imagine [13]  <br /> <br /> drawn outside the lines of reason [8]  <br /> <br /> push the envelope [5]  <br /> <br /> watch it bend [3]  <br /> <br /> I suppose it's not actually a true Fibonacci, since it does reverse itself.  <br /> <br /> the Fibonacci Sequence. It's basically a string of numbers that when you add a number to the number before it, you get the next number. Starting with the numbers 0 and 1. 0+1=1, so the set now looks like this; 0 1 1. You take the 1 and add the previous number (1) and you get 2. The sequence looks like this; 0 1 1 2. Now you take the 2 and add the previous number and get 3. Now you have 0 1 1 2 3. When you add the 3 and the 2 you get 5. 0 1 2 3 5. 5+3=8. 0 1 1 2 3 5 8. The process continues. <br />
B00005RHGL|2.0|Have tried twice to watch this abomination, and give it one star for each attempt.  Had I endured until the Main Event (something about a gunfight?  someplace near something called the OK Corral?) I might have judged it a three-star mediocrity. <br /> <br />This film fails on its own and fails particularly in comparison to Costner's Wyatt Earp, in which almost everything (after the first hour of wincing at Kevin Costner) seems right.  Everything in Russell's Tombstone seems wrong, aside from its attentiveness to the town's Mexican ambiance.  Curly Bill's Red Sash Gang is wrong because I know of no southwest Red Sashes in 1880-1881. Red-sash outlaws were players, much later, hundreds of miles north in the Johnson County War.  Russell's Laudanum Mattie seems wrong;  Russell's Josie seems wrong;  Russell seems ridiculously wrong while dog-slapping the ridiculous dealer at the Oriental.  Val Kilmer seems like a pouf on a very bad day. <br />Perhaps this movie rises from the ridiculous to the sublime before it ends, but it probably stays stuck on stupid.  It's not a daisy.  Not even close.
B000000H57|4.0|October Rust, the follow up to Type O Negative's breakthru release Bloody Kisses, is excellent from start to finish. While the album seems to lag a bit in the middle, when these tracks are listened to in isolation they are actually quite good. While this album is not quite five star material it is chock full of great tracks like the atmospheric Love You To Death, the humorous My Girlfriend's Girlfriend, the spooky Wolf Moon, and the haunting (pun intended) closer Haunted. This is a more consistent album than it's predecessor but overall I find Bloody Kisses just a tiny bit better. The songs are more streamlined in their arrangments and the production is exquisite. This is a great album to acquire for the Type O novice.
B000DN5W4I|4.0|I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about concerning the audio options for this DVD. My copy includes both a DTS surround and stereo option that both sound outstanding. As a matter of fact, the DTS track is one of the best I have ever heard - deep bass, excellent instrument clatity, and Joe's guitar rips through the mix with incredible power. The short set list is a slight disappointment, compaired to the \\"New Day Yesterday Live\\" DVD, but what you do get is phenomenal.
B000000H6Y|4.0|Back in high school some friends of mine were huge Type O Negative fans. Wanting to give the band a shot I borrowed this album and October Rust from them. My impressions were that it was a hodge podge of boring goth rock and utterly nonsensical tracks. Keep in mind however that I was mostly listening to extreme metal and classical in those days and hence my reaction. On a whim I decided to pick this album up used years later and WOW, what a difference eight or so years makes. I found this album to be thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. The tracks which I found boring before I now find engrossing and the hodge podge material is actually quite amusing. While I feel this album is just shy of five stars I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the band. Best tracks are: Christian Woman, Black No. 1 and the title track.
B0000019PA|5.0|Those giving this album a negative review seem to be missing something important: Just because you don't like something doesn't mean that those who do are wrong. I'll give you an example: I don't care for Radiohead. I've heard tons of their music, but I just don't care for it. Nonetheless, I still respect that the band members are talented artists. I don't leave negative reviews criticizing them or their fans just because I don't happen to care for them.  <br /> <br />Without question, this is one of the finest albums of the 90's. I've had it for about six years now, and it still moves me in a way that few other albums ever have. But like many of the finer things in life, NMH are an acquired taste. And like a craft brewed beer or caviar, not everyone will acquire that taste. Some people will find Mangum's voice abrasive, but it's no worse then Dylan or Neil Young. Regardless of your personal impression, I can't imagine listening to this album without realizing that there's something important going on, even if you don't quite get what it is. If you don't like it at first, I suggest putting it away for a month, then try listening to it again with an open mind. Still don't get it? Wait another month & try again. Repeat a few times if necessary. Assuming you are at least in the ballpark with your musical interests, I can't imagine it will take you too long beore it will just click.  <br /> <br />One final comment... To the reviewer who complained that they sound too much like the decemberists: The Decemberists are a great band, and there is a resemblence in the music. Unfortunately for your point, though, the decemberists released their first album in 2001, three years AFTER this album was released. While it's certainly possible that Mangum used a time machine to imitate the decembersists, I suspect that it's more likely that the decemberists were inspired by NMH.
B00005JO9J|5.0|When my roommate and I heard this was being released we sprint-surfed to Amazon to go on the waiting list.  Can't wait to get our copy so we can relive all of Season 1 again.  This is a great show and it is amazing to find out how many fans are out there for this show.  Normally a series has a few good shows and starts to falter slightly, however, GA improves each week.  It's the first time you actually look forward to Sunday night! If you missed Season 1 or just recently got hooked (that Superbowl episode probably scored in a big way for GA), rent or buy the DVD.  It really has just gotten better and better as the series progresses.  Best drama and a fabulous cast will ensure this series will stay around for a long time.  We can hope.  Now how to deal with waiting for them to release Season 2 next...SERIOUSLY!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I don't know what it is but there's this thing that happens with Hollywood where when something is big or something upcoming, then you re-release the previous stuff, and sell it as \\"special editions\\". So after Spirited Away won the Oscar, is it any surprise that Hayao Miyazaki's films got a bigger release than previously? But that's ok since Nausicaa is actually a very good film anyway but still, it's odd how we get wind of it only after he won a big award. <br /> <br />Years after the Earth got decimated by the Seven Days of Fire, people live in fear of a jungle, which happens to contain poisonous spores and massive insects. The princess of the Valley of the Wind, Nausicaa, wants to investigate and study the jungle rather than exterminate it. This poses a problem since a well meaning but wrong way kingdom wants to resurrect a giant Warrior, huge beasts that are incredibly powerful. So Nausicaa and her friends have to stop not only the kingdom from using the Warrior but saving the Earth from poison. <br /> <br />With Miyazaki films, you can obviously expect big wondrous locales and extravagant worlds and of course Nausicaa has them all. With airships, giant insects and an ecological message, it's undoubtedly a Miyazaki film. Even character designs are quite similar with big eyes and small noses. In fact in one scene, a character is able to slip by a guard by pretending to be somebody else even though he's basically the male version of her face. <br /> <br />What's quite a good surprise is the English VA's. Alison Lohman is perfect as Nausicaa and for once there's a strong female protagonist and Alison is quite capable. Then we have also reliable Patrick Stewart, Edward James Olmos, the Bride herself Uma Thurman and Chris Sarandon, best known probably for doing Jack the Pumpkin King. Each actor doesn't overplay their part and if a line of dialogue may be up to snuff, at least the emotion is. <br /> <br />You can probably make a strong case that many of Miyazaki's films are rewritten: many of the films are characters experiencing or living in a world beyond simple reality with fantastic elements and taaalll things. But that's ok, Nausicaa's a great film anyway and an anime highlight.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder's masterpiece \\"Songs In The Key of Life\\" may have been his best work but boy, he has had some great albums. A blend of soul, rock, pop, jazz and funk; Stevie drew an audience from all genres of music. A must own album for any collector of music.

B00003CXA2|5.0|I don't usually care what the critics say about movies but in this case I agree with them and as result I feel \\"Forrest Gump\\" is one of the top movies of all time. It's a timetable of events in US history that are seen through the eyes of a less than smart FG played by the versatile Tom Hanks. Segregation, race riots, JFK, Vietnam, war protests, LBJ and Watergate are all covered here in new perspectives. Gump achieves greatness as a football hero, war hero, ping-pong champion and a shrimping millionaire but the love of his life, Jenny, shuns him until the end of her life when her abuses catch up to her. Sally Fields plays his Mother and is wonderful. FG is a great blend of comedy, drama and sadness. A marvelous achievement in film making.
B000641ZA4|5.0|This is, indeed, an excellent collection of Genesis videos spanning a period all the way from A TRICK OF THE TAIL to CALLING ALL STATIONS. Excellent. I only wish there had been a video of the band doing Blood on the Rooftops from Wind and Wuthering. Oh well. To my way of thinking, the  most interesting videos were the ones from CALLING ALL STATIONS featuring the great Ray Wilson on lead vocals. CONGO, SHIPWRECKED, and NOT ABOUT US are excellent songs and videos. They are all dark and moody songs and the videos complimented them perfectly. I only wish Genesis could have continued with Ray Wilson. So they were no longer the biggest attraction in the world, so what? It was a good line up and should have been given a chance. At least, there's SHIPWRECKED, a great song if I ever heard one.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|The plot for this movie went off on tangents, but even before taking the tangents into account the plot was incredibly weak. Maybe its a good scary movie for elementary aged kids. It wasn't scary, it wasn't funny, it wasn't intelligent. It was all I could do to even finish the movie, which I did, in the hopes that it would somehow redeem itself. It didn't. It was beyond a waste of time, it killed brain cells.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This is a CLASSIC teen movie. I remember watching this film non-stop when I was a preteen and began to be interested in boys, sex, relationships, and yes, even Shakespeare. I got my cousins hooked on it too, and they were only 10-12 years old. It somewhat became a tradition for us to watch it together when we spent the night at each other's house. So this movie really does have a special place in my heart. It's fresh, modern, and entertaining. Unlike most teen movies, all the actors can act, and even though there are many one liners, they work. The overall script is clever and weaves in lines from Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew in such a way that's natural. If you haven't seen this movie before, see it now!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood is a wonderful series, but after viewing the first season via purchased video tapes, I didn't want to get ahead of myself and watch the 3rd season live, before seeing the 2nd season.

0805047905|5.0|This is an absolute MUST HAVE if you have have a child. This is still among my 3 1/2- year-old's favorite book.  In the beginning, she was fascinated with animals themselves and was mesmerized while you were reading.  Now, she \\"reads\\" it to her 17-month-old sister.  This book has been so used and so well-traveled, that we are now on our second copy.
B000002MP2|2.0|Why do people like Green Day? After purchasing American Idiot and this album, it's been confirmed that Green Day has no substance in their music. All they've got are \\"one-hit wonder\\" songs which make you bob your head for about a week before you get bored and take it out of your cd player. Billie Joe Armstrong knows how to capture his listeners with quick beats and strong lyrics that apply to everyday audience, but he just doesn't know how to hold them. <br /> <br />I got American Idiot and Dookie after hearing that Weezer's top influence was Green Day, but was greatly disappointed by their lack of substance. \\"Longview\\" is the only song worth mentioning on this album.
B00007K02F|4.0|A somewhat slow but overall rewarding version of the Bronte classic , 'Jane Eyre.' Beautifully filmed as all Franco Zeffirelli films are, we are taken on a journey of contrasts as Zeffirelli explores the darker nature of human suffering, regret and memory as played out against the lush, natural beauty of the English countryside.<br /><br />William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg deliver wonderful, though rather subdued performances as the two star-crossed lovers and Anna Paquin is absolutely marvelous in her all too brief role as the young Jane Eyre.
B0007TB38C|4.0|\\"Roots to Branches\\" isn't Jethro Tull's best album.  But it is among the most creative and interesting.   <br /> <br />Good songs on the album are: Roots to Branches, Rare and Precious Chain, Valley, Stuck in the August Rain and Another Harry's Bar. <br /> <br />This album rocks heavier than most in Tull's catalog.  So you shouldn't buy this album expecting soft accoustic numbers like \\"Skating Away,\\" \\"Wondering Aloud\\" or \\"Dun Ringill.\\"   <br /> <br />Think more along the lines of \\"No Lullaby\\" (from Heavy Horses) or \\"Ears of Tin\\" (from Rock Island).
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Quiero recomendarles este soundtrack, porque c&aacute;da una de las canciones son recuerdos de las escenas de la pel&iacute;cula, sus bellos acordes, compuestos por el Argentino Gustavo Santaolalla, nos recuerdan los momentos agradables y las tragedias de los protagonistas, unas letras que llegan a lo m&aacute;s profundo de nuestros sentimientos, y un bello booklet con unas fotos incre&iacute;bles.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|Like many Rent fans, I was both elated and worried when I heard they were turning my beloved musical into a movie.  I was further worried when they handed it over to Chris Columbus, a director who's edgiest material (that I'm aware of) is Harry Potter.   <br /> <br />Overall, I feel Columbus stayed true to Larson's masterpiece.  The acting is amazing. With the exception of Rosario Dawson and Tracy Thoms, these actors MADE their roles. Anthony Rapp and Jesse L. Martin were beyond unbelievable, and stole every scene they were in.  Adam Pascal plays the most heartfelt Roger I've ever seen, even if he can't act in anything else. As for the newbies, Tracy Thoms did an amazing Joanne, but I'm a bit unhappy with Rosario Dawson's performance. She turned a heroin-addicted HIV positive stripper in a bondage club to the girl next door (or down the stairs).  Her dancing was excellent, but her singing only passable. Frankly, I didn't believe her \\"Out Tonight.\\" <br /> <br />I disagree with Columbus' cuts, but I understand his reasoning.  What I thought strange was the few changes Columbus conspicuously did to single words; more often than not, they wound up changing some aspect of the character who said them, and differed from Larson's vision.  An example of this is the gender of the engineer Joanne hires.   <br /> <br />Despite the few disappointments, this movie is a breathtaking tribute to a great man, and successfully brings the musical to the big screen.
B000CDINOK|4.0|Muse's headline performance at Glastonbury 2004 was widely regarded as the high point of the festival and their very best gig to date, in a year that led them to pick up a number of awards for Best Live Act.  Their third and Apocalyptic-edged album Absolution had expanded their repertoire with a variety of dramatic soundscapes and further cemented their place as one of the finest and most innovative rock bands around.  Watching this performance, it's easy to see why.  The sheer virtuosity of Matt Bellamy's musicianship as he moves effortlessly between virtuoso piano and raucous guitar work in \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" is quite stunning, and certainly marks a highlight of what is a flawless set.  This three-piece make one of the biggest sounds on the live circuit, and this transfers well to DVD with sound and picture quality that are both mostly excellent. Included in the extras is a performance of \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" from Earls Court in December of the same year, but it's here that the DVD seems only to tantalise.  The live act seems honed yet further in the intervening months and benefits too from some spectacular stage effects.  Glastonbury was superb and certainly merits adding this DVD to your collection, but Earls Court looks to have been even better.<br /><br />--Adam Chamberlain<br /><br />Revelation Magazine
1400034779|5.0|The book is a series of stories of a dear African Lady who happens to be a detective. Some of them are funny, some of them grim, but overall the books are so uplifting. The author loves Botswana and its people and makes you feel that way too. <br /> <br />The books took me to a simpler, kinder place.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I'm not a professional music reviewer, just a fan, but I think this is a terrific effort and solid departure from his past releases.<br /><br />While the sound of this cd may be somewhat derivative from those influencing John Mayer's musical style (Dave Matthews: Vocal similarity, Stevie Ray Vaughn: seering guitar, and other rock-blues greats)....so what!  Most musicians reflect their influences in their own music.  Call it a homage.  Clearly, some don't like Mayer's voice or it's similarity to Matthew's.  That's personal preference, and in my opinion, doesn't alone justify giving the cd one star, as some have done.  If you don't like it, don't listen.<br /><br />For those that don't think this cd represents John Mayer's own style from his previous two release, you're right, and that's a good thing.  Listen to the lead-off track \\"Who did you think I was\\" and you'll see that Mayer doesn't want to be pigeon-holed into the \\"Your body is a wonderland\\"-type balladist (is that a word?).  In fact, to my ear, this cd sounds more like the way Mayer probably perceives himself as a musician than in his past recordings.  Let the man stretch out and find his space.<br /><br />This CD rocks.  As the title suggests: Try!
B00097DXZS|5.0|I think this is a great cd.  And I am also a fan of old school Santana having the cds \\"Moonflower,\\" \\"Caravanserai,\\" Santana's \\"Best Instrumentals\\" Vol. 1.  Santana has simply added more pop, but its not like he didnt do that before, just more of it.  <br /> <br />Also, i played this cd on both a mac and a pc and it played fine. sooooo.... <br /> <br />bewteen the people who only want to hear 1960s santana, and the anti-copyright protection crowd, these personal vendettas are whats ruining the music industry as much as anything. <br /> <br />you know, the net has given everyone a chance to voice there opinion which is really a good thing, its just the law also lets everyone drink over age (fill in the blank________) but that doesnt mean you drink and drive.  Some things should be done responsibly. <br /> <br />Even the grateful dead, who promoted tons of free music to the masses over the decades, has always said, do not make a profit off of selling bootlegs or trading tunes.  Millions of people benefited from it, and the companies didnt give a hoot.  <br /> <br />Since all that freedom has been abused, when people went to the old napster and charged for illegal downloads.  plain and simple, those people screwed EVERYONE. THE GROUPS, THE COMPANIES, AND YOU AND ME.  THAT is why the protection crap. Personally, none of this copy protect stuff has bothered me and many people I know who collect tons of music arent complaining.  We pay for legal downloads or people turn each other on by letting them listen to their cds...for free....get the picture people? <br /> <br />I agree I dont like the hidden cookie crap but that IS being address by the companies.  sooooo....can we just keep the musical reviews about the music and not \\"company policy.\\" <br /> <br />ps oh there is good and even great music after the 60s and 70s, and Santana has created, and is creating, some of it. <br /> <br />cheers and enjoy. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|I hardly know where to begin.  Words are useless, it seems, in describing this story.  There ARE none to explain the gut-wrenching feelings in my heart.  I am a 67 year old grandma and I have NEVER felt like this about any other movie.  Brokeback sits in my heart...like NOTHING else ever has.  I saw this movie three weeks ago and I can't get it out of my mind.  I've tried...believe me.  It's brought forth the lost loves in my life...the pain and torture I've felt and the warmth I feel when reminiscing.  Every emotion I've ever felt has been SLAMMED back into my heart and soul.  Ennis...was ME!!  'Words always escaped me...I was always unable to voice my thoughts and feelings. Love would slip through my fingers because of my inability to hold on....FEAR...RAGE...LOVE...and sadness.  Heath Ledger has accomplished, in this movie, what no one ever has before.  He conveyed all these emotions without the inane chatter that most actors depend upon.  And Jack...what can I say about Jack?  He was all my loves...wrapped into one.  Loving, caring, open, honest, wanting but not 'getting'.  Broken hearted and SOOO hurt by Ennis' inability to open up to him.  It matters NOT that Ennis and Jack were men.  What matters is...the LOVE between two human beings.  Everlasting and true!!  I've never been so effected by a movie...EVER.  It will sit in my heart forever.  Thank you Ang Lee..Heath...Jack..and all the others for bringing this forth.
B00005JO1P|4.0|When I learned of the movie, I attended it not because I'm a country music fan (I'm not necessarily), but because of the performances of the 2 stars. I had read of their instruction time to prepare for their music performances and was intrigued by their dedication to the roles.  After viewing the movie for the 1st time, I was not disappointed!!  Instead I have become a very interested \\"fan\\" of Johnny Cash, and Mr. Phoenix and Ms Witherspoon.  I have since been back to view the movie again, purchased the soundtrack and am eagerly awaiting to add the DVD to my collection.  It also spurred my curiosity about Johnny Cash and am currently reading his autobiography.  If you enjoy music and appreciate the talent musicians have, you will love and appreciate this movie.  Reese and Joaquin deserve all the honors they have received and may receive!!  Great entertainment!!
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|The excellent composition of middle eastern and metal tune. This is excellent for Opeth, Dream Theater and Paradise Lost fans.<br /><br />Experience the blend of Symphony and Metal in the track \\"Mabool\\" or listen to the Opeth like vocals in \\"The Birth of Three\\", and embrace the beautiful voice and melody of \\"A'salk\\".<br /><br />This is a must get album, it's much more better than their previous album and the theme of the album is excellent...<br /><br />2 thumbs up for this.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|alas, i have to admit that once upon a time i was a fan of this band. i picked up waking the fallen and was impressed. so then i checked out sounding the seventh trumpet and i feel in love. that was a cd to be mentioned. not this cd. this cd is horrible. i waited days in and out for this cd to come out and when it did i just had this horrible taste in my mouth for weeks. like i just ate crap. the two senses of listening to this cd and eating crap go together synonymously. such an UNinnovative step from their past two cds. they lost the screaming and attempted to incorporate early metal into their guitar riffs. i understand the desire to want to stray away from the whole OC HxC scene, but messing up this horribly even baffles me. oh yeah, and i've learned that one of their singles form this cd went to number one on TRL. hahahahaha.   l  a  m  e  moral of the story, dont buy this cd unless you want your mouth to taste like crap.  if your looking to buy good hxc get \\"shut your mouth and open your eyes\\" by afi, \\"promises kept\\" by champion or \\"wake the dead\\" comeback kid.  if your looking to by good, innovative metal, then get \\"miss machine\\" dillinger escape plan, \\"art damage\\" fear before the march of flames, or even \\"show no mercy\\" by slayer.      but for the love of christ, DO NOT GET THIS CD.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I have lived in the US for 10 years, and this is the BEST TV show I have seen in this period of time. The cast is excellent, the writing keeps us on our toes, both by allowing the characters to \\"grow\\" and by being quite to the point (Izzie telling George he needs to learn how to use a plunger or he is going to have to \\"crap\\" in the backyard definitely got my husband's attention!!) and this show is simply the best! I really cannot find anything to compare it to, because there really isn't anything like it, period. <br />Keep up the good work and I will keep my Sunday nights free to watch the show...
0451528956|4.0|This is another classic that has seeped into popular culture.  And, although the ending is a foregone conclusion, this book is still an enjoyable read.  Stevenson does a stellar job of keeping an air of mystery about Mr. Hyde and his vile acts.  He presents vivid imagery that enhances the overall environment.  Throughout the novel, the supernatural conflicts with science and logic.  It is not until the very end when the full scope of Jekyll's experiments and actions come to light. <br /> <br />It's also interesting to think about what Mr. Hyde's terrible actions were, that lent him an evil aura in Victorian London.  Let's see. . . He describes countless acts of undignified and secret pleasures, youthful indiscretions, highly irregular behavior, a morbid sense of shame.  Couple that with the fact that all the men are unmarried bachelors .  . . Hmmmm . . . . <br /> <br />Anyway, there are a couple of weak points in the book.  The idea that Dr. Lanyon would become ill and succumb to death after seeing Jekyll's transformation seems far-fetched, even for this tale.  Also, Utterson's lack of desire to find the truth seems a bit odd, although perhaps it is a reflection of the Victorian era which put respect and honor above truth. <br /> <br />This novel is still relevant to today.  Although there are no magical elixirs, the news wires are, unfortunately, littered with stories about the dark underside of man.  A seemingly normal person can suddenly go \\"postal\\" and destroy countless human lives.  Overall, I would highly recommend this book for a quick and easy read. <br />

B000002J1M|5.0|Released in 1972, this was the second album from the classic 1971-1974 lineup and will forever remain as the album that got me completely and hopelessly addicted to Genesis.  Right from the start, with the atmospheric mellotron/organ overture to Watcher of the Skies played by the great keyboardist Tony Banks, to the closing moments of the cyclical 22'58\\" epic Suppers Ready, this is amazing progressive rock.  The pieces on the album cover a wide dynamic range, and span from the delicate Steve Hackett solo acoustic guitar piece (Horizons), to the charming piece Time Table, through the thunderous and highly syncopated 6/4 workout on Watcher of the Skies and finally, the incredible epic Supper's Ready, which cycles between loud/soft passages.  In fact, Tony Banks was always big on sharply contrasting quiet and loud bits for a dramatic effect and this pattern crops up throughout the album.  I really should not forget Can Utility and the Coastliners though, which features a great workout on the drums by Phil Collins over which Tony lays down some nice mellotron pads, and another personal favorite is the mini-epic Get Em' Out by Friday.  As was characteristic of Genesis during the classic period, the ensemble work and individual virtuosity is staggering (the standard time Hammond organ solo over the 9/8 rhythm section in Suppers Ready is a good example) and there is the abundant use of pivot chords that make the transition between sections in different keys seamless.  The subject matter is deeply \\"cosmic\\" with surrealist touches, and is wonderfully delivered by vocalist Peter Gabriel - based on what I have read, Peter premiered the pieces on Foxtrot by marching out wearing a fox head mask and a red dress (in a Dublin boxing ring no less).  One last note - David Hitchcock (rather than John Anthony) produced Foxtrot and the production quality is much better than that on Nursery Cryme, although the sound quality of Selling England by the Pound (1973) would blow both out of the water.  All in all, Foxtrot belongs to the canon of progressive rock albums released in the early 1970s and is certainly one the early high water marks of the classic period of Genesis.  Very highly recommended without hesitation.e water.

B000055ZDT|5.0|The definative Electric Wizard release, Dopethrone, can be enjoyed simply for its crushing noise and groove.  The riffs are great- could be enjoyed outside of the context of hypnotic doom.  The production is buzzing and overloaded, but the notes are clear.  All 8 of these songs just ROCK.  The occasionally ambience (usually created by a guitar) comes in at times to improve the psychedelia.  High end minimalist solos are also occasionally present.  Electric Wizard are masters of creating feel by using a minimalist set of notes and just letting them reverberate into your skull, each chord punctuated and powerful.  The guitar tone is perfect, unimaginably thick. My favorites on here are \\"Funeralopolis\\" for its brilliant main riff, \\"Barbarian\\" for its droning power, and \\"I, The Witchfinder\\" for the extending jam that builds and builds in its intensity.  \\"Weird Tales\\" is also great for its dark, hot atmosphere.  This recording almost sounds live in its energy and power.  It has more energy, seemingly (from videos), than the band ACTUALLY HAS live.<br /><br />Recommended for those who appreciate drugged out, hypnotic metal jams or anything really heavy.  Stands out from the rest of the doom genre.
B00005UEAR|3.0|It would be nice to see some more objective reviews, but Dream Theater fans are hardcore and often don't criticize the band for releasing weaker material. This is the case with the 2nd disc of this album which suffers from a lack of continuity and meandering instrumental sections. With the exception of \\"Solitary Shell\\" and its Solsbury Hill vibe I found the 2nd disc to be forgetable and boring. I know the band is talented but the solo's and, especially keyboards, on disc 2 have no life or soul. I have no idea what the message is and I don't think I will take the time to figure it out. I think this was put together to excite the fans who must have these epic songs and give them a reason to charge a high price for the double disc. I only say this because it seems that DT has been milking the hardcore fans in recent years with a constant stream of live albums and ridiculous \\"packages\\" if you want to sit up close at one of their shows. <br /> <br />The 1st disc is a different story. These are some of the best songs the band has ever written. I am even willing to forgive the blatant Metallica-esqe \\"Glass Prison\\" because its fun and forces you to bang your head. After reading dozens of other reviews that trash the 1st disc and love the 2nd I now understand why the band still writes overblown epic material and its unfortunate that more people don't appreciate their songwriting ability over neverending, pointless solo's. Anyhow, the 1st disc has some very beautiful and poignant material that I consider to be among DT's best, particularly Misunderstood and Disappear. If the 1st disc was issued alone I would have given this 5 stars and rank it only under Awake and Falling Into Infinity.
B0006399FS|5.0|The title alone reminds this U2 fan of War which was the album that began it all for me.  Despite its commercial association with Apple and its massive coming out party \\"Vertigo\\" is legendary stuff from Bono and the boys!  Even SNL teased Bono for counting in Spanish poorly.  Everytime I listen to this song I am amazed how The Edge finds new stuff after 25 years of playing the guitar.  A song like this comes along rarely in rock.  \\"Yahweh\\" is hauntingly similar to War's \\"40\\" and I'm not the first one to make the comparison obviously.  Then there's the song dedicated to Bono's Father, \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own,\\" which is very touching when you listen to the dvd made in Chicago.  The same can be said for \\"Original of the Species\\" written for Bono and The Edge's daughters if I understood the concert footage correctly.  I will say the Vertigo dvd is a must for appreciating this album.  In fact the concert reminded me of my pre-parenthood concertgoing days when I saw U2 perform live in Sacramento during the Achtung Baby tour or watching footage of their other concerts.  Bono gives it his all in the Chicago concert.  Even Adam and The Edge switch axes on the finale \\"40\\" (which I've never seen before) which may symbolize how mature and how far this quartet have come over the years...
B000BYA5G4|3.0|This is a story told by Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) as an international arms dealer. This seems to be a movie with an educational and ethical mission about the international situation in arms dealing. It includes the fall of the Soviet Union to conflicts in Africa. Cage goes through his paces as an arms deale, with no real excitement. Cage aquires a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) who uses selective denial, and Ethan Hawk represents the law that is always on his tail. Eamonn Walker does a great job as Andre Baptiste - leader of an African nation who plays Cage's main customers. Walker is great at playing a bad guy.  This film is emotionally cold in that it is told from the viewpoint of someone who caters to cold blooded killers. It is intense at times, some tension and enough action. This movie deals with ethics, however it is not a fun movie. It is not a feel good movie.
B000002HMH|2.0|Hardcore Metallica fans despised this album when it came out because Metallica had 'sold out' by changing their musical style to a more common '90s alternative rock sound. The real problem with this album was not simply the change of their sound, but simply the fact that this album sounds stock, predictable and boring. <br /> <br />It's only natural for a band to change its sound with time, and for Metallica, what they would do with the more experimental Reload proved they could still make good music, but Load just seems like an entire record of filler with a few radio-friendly mainstream rock songs intended to appeal the popular public. <br /> <br />There's nothing wrong with the style of music that they were playing at this time, and I don't believe they were 'sell-outs' to play different music as time passed, but the songs on Load are dull, uninspired and sound like cookie-cutter, manufactured rock put together because Metallica hadn't quite figured out where to go musically. <br /> <br />This is Metallica's lowest rated album for a reason. It is their worst. If you like the more mainstream, '90s alternative sound from Metallica, try Reload, which has better songs, and is more developed.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|The pharmaceutical mafia in Africa is striking everyday, or nearly everyday. Remember the polio vaccinations. Public research and testing in France by Institut Pasteur in West Africa, Private research and testing in the USA in the Ex-Belgian Congo. The two species of monkeys used by the two labs were monkeys that are carrying the AIDS virus without being affected. To say that is already an anti-pharmaceutical crime. There used to be an article in an English medical magazine about that experimentation. All traces seem to have disappeared. Only Mandela used that practice to get some rebates on the anti-AIDS drugs in the early 1990s. The only way to find out would be to get all the old issues of English medical magazines, and American ones at the same time, and check over the last 25 years (at least) provided one issue has not been accidently lost in some shredder. Even the Internet is a pretty dumb tool if you are not more informed than it is, at times. This film is about such a scandal in Kenya. To get drugs the people there are ready to do anything. If it can save the life of their children, and eventually made their life easier, they can accept any experimentation. And that happens all the time. Be sure that it happens in our countries too, but in our countries we use the final product after extensive testing on animals and with computers. The difference is that in our countries there are strict rules before, during and after that experimentation and if something goes wrong the responsibility of the lab is entirely complete and total. In Africa... ! Can you repeat please, we seem not have heard what you said. A girl gets involved in such a fight against a pharmaceutical trust and she disappears one day, and a few other people. Her husband tries to find the truth and does find it but he did not leave Africa where he was the victim of an accident: bullets from eight different guns. That's a good well organized and efficient accident. He had been prudent though and a certain clandestine secret report will finally come to the public, thanks to a little money under the table to a comprehensive black pilot: the man did not need that money since he did not plan to get out of Africa. That's probably the worst thing you can imagine about Africa. It is the most fascinating continent on this planet but it is also the most dangerous place to survive in. Gun smugglers are a horrible band of monsters but I believe pharmaceutical guinea-pig hunters are definitely a lot more inhumane and we cannot say we are not directly concerned: we are using these products everyday and most of them have been tested on African children, most of the time without them even knowing about it. By the way why is it said that Aventis is closing some chemical operation in Switzerland and opening the same in their factory next to my village in the Central Mountains of France? I guess regulations are not the same or if they are, the regulators may need glasses in France. The pharmaceutical vampires are everywhere and you cannot escape them.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDcertain clandestine secret report will finally come to the public, thanks to a little money under the table to a comprehensive black pilot: the man did not need that money since he did not plan to get out of Africa.

0895260131|5.0|Of the several books by Spencer I've read, I found this one the most readable and entertaining.  That's because it's not too long, and it's in a sort of multi-media format: on almost every page there is some kind of sidebar with interesting tidbits of information to complement the narrative of the text itself, and the book is often funny.  For example, the cover of the book has a blurb from an actual Islamist's review of the book:  <br /> <br />May Allah rip out his [Spencer's] spine from his back and split his brains in two, and then put them both back, and then do it over and over again.  Amen.  -- \\"praise\\" for the author on RevivingIslam.com. <br />If you are interested in an objective appraisal of Islam, you'll want to read people of various viewpoints.  Robert Spencer should be one viewpoint you consider carefully.  He has been a close student of Islam, the Koran and other Muslim documents for at least a couple of decades, and though he may not have the whole picture on Islam, he just might have the essence, and he is a brilliant and honest writer and researcher.  He finds in Islam's doctrines, practices, history and current adherents much that threatens the West's civil rights and civil liberties more radically than other major religions have done.  He presents evidence and references and citations to back up every statement he makes.  He might turn out to be wrong, but one must be a person of ill-will, or have blinkers on, not to see the earnest, careful and literate way in which he presents his case.  <br />

B000BW7QWW|4.0|I really liked Serenity.  Why?  I look as the show as more related to Babylon 5 than to Star Trek, where the universe if perfect and everything turns out just nice.  This movie is about the spaceship Serenity where you're lucky if the spaceship just plain works.    Serenity does a good job of projecting people into the future in a believable future.  The producers of the movies have slightly changed the way English is spoken.  Personally, I though this was a wonderful touch to the movie.  It gives a viewer a sense that things really have changed in the future.  I thought the speech patterns were quite believable.  I'm so bored of \\"Picard\\" and \\"Data\\" perfectly speaking the King's English.  On Serentity you'll get introduced to a form of English that seems like a cross between the old West and the Future.  The pattern of speech takes some getting used to.     Serenity does a good job of showing the problem with a future government, the Alliance.  In the Alliance all people are equal but the civilized planets are just more equal than the uncivilized outer planets.  The basic cause of the problems in the universe is an out-of-control central government that wants to control all human behaviour.      The plot of Serenity is the Alliance finally decides to hunt down River because River had the opportunity and ability to mind scan some high Alliance governmental officials.  I shall not give too much away to the Amazon.com reader.  Why?  It will wreck your viewing of the movie.    The effects on the big screen are a lot better than what was done in the TV show of the movie.  Also, because this show was made for the big screen a little more could be done with the cast of characters.    Serenity is a fun movie.  I gave it 4 stars out of 5.  I grade DVD movies much harder than books.  This movie will not go down as the best Sci-Fi ever made.  But this movie is a solid grade B+.  And what is wrong with just seeing a good movie?      Serenity has action.  It explains the sourceof the Reavers.  It cleans up the back ground on River.  A long standing ship board romance gets going.  And we get to see some regretful goodbyes.    Also, the movie has some parts on the design of the Firefly class ships, the crew of Serenity, and how the series was make.  It was quite good and informative.    If you liked Firefly then you'll really like this movie.    My only wish is Firefly had been picked up by the Science Fiction channel and made into a series.  A replacement for some of their more elderly shows is badly needed.  But life isn't perfect.  That is why I liked this movie; it isn't perfect either.    4 stars.  You'll like it.  The movie makes a good addition to your video library.

B000BT97AO|4.0|Mirrormask, from writer Neil Gaiman and the Jim Henson Company, is sure to be loved and admired by fantasy fans, however others with more mainstream tastes will likely not be interested. The film will particularly appeal to fans of 1980s fantasy movies such as Labyrinth (which it is often compared to), The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Stroy, Time Bandits, Return to Oz, etc. If you like those movies, chances are you will like Mirrormask as well. <br /> <br />Mirrormask presents the classic Alice in Wonderland/Wizard of Oz concept of a girl from our normal world suddenly finding herself in an unusual alternate universe. In this case, that universe is inhabited by mask-wearing citizens, stone giants, sphinxes, flying fish, talking cats and dogs with human faces and any number of other creatures that look as if they stepped out of a surrealist painting. In fact the whole movie looks a bit like a painting come to life. Mirrormask's key strength is its amazing visuals. After the 20-minute mark or so, you won't go more than 5 minutes without seeing something that will make your jaw drop. Viewers interested in art will be particularly interested in the movie. The stunning visuals alone make the movie worth checking out, particularly if you're interested in weird, surreal type stuff. A big chunk of the movie is computer generated, and it looks it, but being a fantasy movie it's okay. It's not supposed to look realistic. It's supposed to look surreal and dreamlike and it certainly succeeds at that. The most common complaint about Mirrormask is likely to be the story. The movie does not have a highly original story to go along with its incredible visuals. It's your typical \\"girl trapped in dangerous fantasy world and must accomplish task or find mystical item to return back home\\" story that we've seen many, many times before. Viewers will either be able to look past that fact and enjoy the movie for what it is, or they won't. The wrap-around story about the girl, Helena and her sick mother takes up a bit too much time and doesn't quite provide the narrative drive that it should. But once you get past the first twenty minutes, the stunning surreal special effects take over and the movie is highly enjoyable from then on.  <br /> <br />It's certainly not a movie for everyone, but I would highly recommend Mirrormask to fantasy fans and anyone who enjoys artistic visually stunning movies with highly imaginative and unusual content. It's pretty rare to see movies with this much imagination in this age of cookie-cutter Hollywood movies, so anything that strives to bring something unusual and wondrous to the screen is certainly welcome in my opinion.
0440418569|2.0|THE AMBER SPYGLASS offers many well written passages, and in that respect is no worse, and possibly even a bit better, than the first two volumes.  But the whole is considerably less than the sum of its parts, and it is in this volume that many readers will realize this for the first time.  Being forwarned, I actually enjoyed this volume a bit more than the first two.  I laughed at the gay angels.  I began to like Lyra again as she began to reassert herself more and to be guided by her compassion.  I enjoyed Mary Malone's adventure among the Mulefa.  I noted that plot advanced mainly by author's fiat -- for instance, if Pullman needed widely separated characters to implausibly show up at the same place at the same time, he simply had some mystical force tell them where to go and what to do.  But since I already had an idea where Pullman was going, I was free to enjoy the little episodes along the way.<br /><br />But some readers who allowed themselves to get sucked in may feel a deep sense of betrayal as they approach the end of Volume III.  Pullman, it seems, has minimal interest in fantasy storytelling as an end in itself, and in fact (judging from his public statements) seems to be generally hostile towards the genre.  His trilogy has been an elaborate setup for a series of heavy-handed messages, which by themselves would immediately seem inane, ignorant, dishonest, hypocritical, elitist, and inspired by a spirit of contempt not only for the fantasy-reading public but also for the bulk of humanity.<br /><br />In this book, we are early introduced to two naked male rebel Angels, who immediately start making love to each other in front of Will, our 12-year old hero.  Will, instead of telling this pair to show some consideration and find a bush to hide behind, is \\"touched\\" by their erotic passion.  This in-your-face message of gay tolerance juxtaposed with religious iconography seems custom-designed to annoy conservative Christians; and perhaps on some level I appreciate the joke.  But I doubt the gay community should be grateful, for these gay angels are otherwise so ineffectual and petulant as to be laughable. I guess Pullman has contempt for these characters because he associates them with Christian theology, and not because they are gay.  Pullman does not really believe that Angels exist, and does not really want them to, even in his fiction.  He has included them, nonetheless, mainly to mock them.  His Angels, good and evil, are almost powerless - the next best thing to non-existence.  Problem is, Pullman never explains how such ineffectual beings as these could have maintained tyrannical rule over the universe for so long.  The Angels loyal to the Kingdom, are just as ineffectual as the good-but-gay characters just mentioned, and therefore end up being unworthy opponents for an \\"epic\\" fantasy.<br /><br />Patterns similar to this are repeated as the story draws to a close.  Fantastic elements that Pullman believes do not exist are either portrayed as completely ineffectual, or manipulated so it is the obligation of the heroes to destroy them, or both.<br /><br />(The next paragraph contains \\"SPOILERS\\" of a sort.  However, in my opinion these elements are unlikely to enhance the enjoyment of a reader, who may as well be forewarned).<br /><br />For instance, it is evident Pullman believes God does not exist.  Unfortunately, the non-existence of God (or indeed, anything) cannot be illustrated by normal story-telling methods, so Pullman tries the next best thing. He says, \\"Well, even if God did exist, He would not be God at all, but would REALLY be just a powerless senile ghost in a glass coffin who would dissolve the minute the coffin opened, and then he would not exist any more SO THERE.\\"  He also disapproves of the idea of an afterlife, so he tells us \\"but even their were and afterlife, it would be so horrible that it would be the duty of our enlightened heroes to sabotage the afterworld, destroy its tormented phantasms and grant them merciful oblivion, and then it will not exist any more SO THERE.\\"  Or how about \\"Travel to other worlds is not possible, and it is silly of you irresponsible children to seek happiness through reading escapist fantasy (which you thought this was - fooled ya ha ha); but even if it were possible the consequences would be so horrible that it would eventually lead to the destruction of the ENTIRE UNIVERSE; so it would be the duty of our enlightened heroes to make sure it NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN, so now it is not possible any more SO THERE!  NO MORE SEQUELS FOR YOU BWAHAHAHAHA.\\"  The end result is an anti-fantasy \\"fantasy\\" that lacks conviction, by an author more intent with destroying than creating, where the endings seem contrived, anticlimactic, and even perversely tragic.  But perhaps the most absurd punch-line focuses on the method by the heroes must reverse the drainage of Dust and thereby save the Universe.  All the hints and mystery surrounding the nature of Dust; and the nature of Daemons, were all concocted for the sole purpose of leading up to this ridiculous moment.  Many readers on this forum have complained that Pullman never clearly explains the precise nature of Dust, and indeed seems to have multiple meanings in mind.  Do Daemons and Dust represent higher consciousness?  Or do they represent human sexuality?  The two notions have little to do with each-other, but it is on the confusion of the two that Pullman's agenda depends.  Religions want to forbid some sex; therefore religions want to forbid all sex; therefore religious people hate all conscious life.  Readers who were unable to decipher this logic should be grateful that the ending remains mysterious.  Meanwhile, they should stop reading silly fantasy novels, and hurry up and have sex before all conscious life drains out of the Universe.<br /><br />When Pullman is not making his points through anti-climactic battles against non-existent enemies, he instead makes his points by arguments and preaching (mouthed by sympathetic characters).  And what inane preaching it is!  Sex is good, therefore God does not exist.  Christianity is bad because (Pullman alleges) it teaches we should judge others.  (Pullman, one must suppose, has never actually read the Gospels).  Christianity and all other theistic religions hate life and sex so much that they would rather destroy all sentient life than permit anyone to have any fun.<br /><br />Pullman never gets around to proposing a coherent moral system.  But he is not satisfied merely to suggest that belief in God is not necessary to be truly moral.  He is not satisfied merely to suggest that organized religion is often corrupt and headed by leaders who consistently violate their own moral rules.  Nor is he satisfied merely to suggest that traditional morality restricting sexual activity is out of date in the modern age, when contraception and prophylactics are readily available.  Rather, he strains to imply that the whole of the Judeo-Christian moral system is part of a vast tyrannical conspiracy, and that we should devote all our energies to fighting this tyranny.  Does this include the Golden Rule?  He does not say.<br /><br />Pullman offers few clues as to how he thinks we SHOULD act.  There seems to be a \\"follow your feelings\\" approach to conduct.  One should (as Lyra sometimes does) behave altruistically when overwhelmed by feelings of compassion for those who are suffering.  One should have sex if one feels like it (unless one is a priest and has dirty fingernails in which case one does not have the right to live anyway so it does not matter).  It is usually okay to kill if you feel frightened, or angry, or if someone gets in the way of something you think is really really important.  Since our heroes always follow their feelings, they never engage in any real moral reflection.  They are usually able to tell by instinct who the other good guys are.  When in doubt, they consult a mystical aetheliometor, or the IChing, or some other elaborate variant of the Magic 8-Ball, to receive orders and advice from the Universal Cosmic Consciousness.<br /><br />Even the sacrificial murder of an innocent child seems ultimately forgiven by the author as something serving an allegedly higher purpose.  The consistent undertone of admiration for raw ruthless power that I noted in earlier reviews, remains largely unchallenged.  Lyra is filled with love and admiration as she watches Will express his \\"contempt\\" for a pair of tiny humanoids and practice political one-upmanship over them. The murderous Lord Asriel emerges as a hero, and the unspoken message is that political leaders (or at least some of them) are above moral laws.<br /><br />What seems scary to me that such inanity is winning so many critical awards and accolades, either despite or because of its virulent and hysterical anti-religious hate messages.  For me, the phenomenon of Pullman's success carries a vague Nazoid vibe.  Do we really think that, in this day and age, organized religion is the greatest threat to human freedom? Who is wanting us to believe that, and why?  But I go too far perhaps.  I personally spoke over the summer a very nice female acquaintance of mine who assured me that she absolutely adored these books.  I myself was able to appreciate many well-written passages.  Perhaps there is such a sea of poorly-written tripe out there that this itself is enough to explain the success of these novels.<br /><br />I would like to end by countering a stubborn piece of misinformation that this novel is partly based on.  The sin of Adam and Eve had nothing to do with sexual intercourse.  The literal text of Genesis makes their sin simply one of disobedience, motivated by pride, ambition, and the desire to become like gods.  Nor does the \\"sexual temptation\\" theory make sense even if one moves beyond the literal text.  It is true that after their sin they became ashamed of their nakedness.  But please consider that children start becoming shy about their bodies at a fairly early age -- several years before puberty -- and it is at about this time that they start internalizing a moral conscience (i.e. gain \\"knowledge of good and evil\\").

B00005KARK|5.0|I loved this movie as a child, and bought it for my 3 year old for Christmas.  I didn't really think that she would like it, because it seems that these days the only movies that kids are into are the new fangled pixar films, and computer generated films of the like.  Imagine my suprise when, of all the movies she got for Christmas (including Madagascar and Barbie Pegasus!) that Dumbo is the movie that she asks to watch more than any other of her movies.  I don't feel bad when she watches it that she's watching too much television, because it is such a short film by today's standards, and I love to watch it too.  The pink elephant sequence haunts my memories to this day as one of the best Disney moments in its history.  Great movie, then and now!
0380977788|2.0|This has been compared to ALICE IN WONDERLAND, but the comparison is only minimally justified.  Like ALICE, it is more likely to be enjoyed by adults than children, because the alternate reality presented is unpredictable and frightening.  The difference is that ALICE contains much cleverness to entertain adults and perhaps to stimulate children as well, whereas CORALINE offers little beyond horrific imagery and jarring disorientation.<br /><br />It features a female child hero who is forced be self-sufficient and save herself and her parents from an evil supernatural creature known as the Beldam.  Little girls, I am sure, enjoy wish-fulfillment and power fantasies as much as anyone.  On the other hand, children are not in fact self-sufficient, and are smart enough to know it.  A book like this, which confronts them with a stark otherworldly horror beyond anyones comprehension, and then tells them must face it completely alone (and perhaps survive by making lucky guesses) is unlikely to be reassuring.<br /><br />I am a person who, as a child, was very much attracted to horror fiction.  It is hard to put my finger, exactly, on what is wrong with this book.  It is creepy in a subtly empty way.  Evil in a sea of nothingness.<br /><br />Whenever it is not horrifying, it is bland, bleak and boring.  It contains nothing insightful or clever.  Not merely satisfied to tell us that Coraline is bored, Gaiman spends pages describing all the boring experiences she has to endure.  At one point, she is forced to listen to a boring adult conversation that she does not understand.  Unlike Coraline, we can understand the conversation (which we are forced to read) but it is still boring.  I suspect there must be something deeply cynical about a book which portrays life as a choice between boredom and nightmare, and suggests the reader settle for boredom.<br /><br />This is far too creepily scary for most kids, and too dumb for anyone else.  Anyone (child or not) with the stomach for weird horror is likely to find much better horror stories to suit their taste and stimulate their imaginations.d much better horror stories to suit their taste and stimulate their imaginations.

0385512058|4.0|It took me more than a month to read and digest Never Eat Alone. <br /> <br />I borrowed the book from the local library; at a time when I was thinking how my life was taking a path so different from my friends. <br /> <br />I was eating alone because I do not work in BIG CORP... and meeting people for gossip lunch was not on my habbit. <br /> <br />This book, Never Eat Alone, change my perception about eating alone. <br /> <br />Never Eat Alone is about how one can go about building great relationships with people and helping them in the process.  <br />How such relationships can affect the outcome of your career and business. <br /> <br />Never Eat Alone is easy to read. It does not set a lecturing tone,....  <br />rather Keith shares with us how he relationships that he had in place help advance his career and business. <br /> <br />It is those interesting stories that he shared that cause me thinking...about the change that I need to make.  <br />It is the thought process within your mind that will slow down the reading....something that I think it is well worth it. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to people starting out on their business and start to think about relationships and helping out.

B000002UA9|5.0|Despues de haber debutado en 1962 con los sencillos \\"Love me do\\" y a principios de 1963 con \\"Please, please me\\", The Beatles lanzan este magnifico primer disco titulado \\"Please please me\\". Con la mitad de los temas que son covers y otros de autoría de Lennon y McCartney. <br /> <br /> El primer tema que es \\"I saw her standing there\\", un tema puro rock and roll, cantado por Paul McCartney, luego la balada \\"Misery\\" que se destaca por su melancolía y un piano que al parecer es de George Martin. Luego vienen tres covers: \\"Anna\\", \\"Chains\\" y \\"Boys\\", estas dos ultimas cantadas por George Harrison y Ringo Starr. Despues, viene los dos temas que fueron parte del segundo single del grupo: \\"Ask me why\\" y el eterno \\"Please, please me\\", esta ultima influenciado por Roy Orbison. <br /> <br /> La segunda parte del disco, comienza con \\"Love me do\\", con una letra simple, pero efectiva, principalmente por la harmonica de John Lennon; esta version  no es la versión single, y es tocado por un baterista de sesión llamado Andy White, y Ringo Starr en los panderos. \\"P.S. I love you\\", tambien cancion de amor simple, Paul dijo que se baso en una chica que tenía los nombre iniciales \\"P.S.\\"; este tema fue el lado B del single \\"Love me do\\" en 1962. Entre casi tema por medio entre covers y temas originales,  siguen siendo excelentes como \\"Baby it's you\\", \\"A taste of honey\\". \\"Do you want to know a secret\\" uno de los pocos temas de la dupla compositora, cantado por George Harrison. \\"There's a place\\", un tema no muy menor, gracias a las harmonías vocales y especie de secuela de \\"Love me do\\". Al final, \\"Twist and shout\\",  un tema clasico de lo cuál es imposible que nadie lo sepa. <br /> <br /> Al final, este gran disco debut del cuarteto de Liverpool, mantiene esa linea hasta \\"Beatles for sale\\", ya que \\"Help!\\", aunque todavia estaban en la etapa beatlemaniaca, comenzaban a surgir nuevos estilos.  <br />
1932100385|4.0|The style of this book is great for the average person wanting to learn more about health and nutrition. Campbell utilizes simple analogies to explain disease processes which are very easy to comprehend even for a layperson with no science background.  I think the book is worth it for this alone--if you really want to understand how cancer and heart disease actually work, at the cellular level, this is a great source.<br /><br />I found Campbell's research intriguing, but no matter how much he protests that he doesn't have an agenda, he does.  The purpose of this book is to promote a whole-foods vegan diet.  He says he does this because he's concerned about public health, and I believe that he is.  However, I don't agree that a 100% animal free diet is the healthiest way to go for everyone, and I don't agree that his China study actually proved that it was.  The Chinese he studied do in fact eat vastly less animal products than Americans, and they are healthier, but they aren't vegan. He concludes that since people who eat low amounts of animal products are healthier than people who eat high amounts, then eating none would be healthiest.  I don't necessarily agree with this logic.<br /><br />He also contradicts himself, saying we should always get vitamins from whole foods and not pills.  Then he acknowledges that vitamin B12 is currently only found in animal products, but quickly dismisses this by recommending a vitamin supplement.  ???<br /><br />The famous study that got this all started was one in which rats were fed known carcinogens and then given a diet that was either 5% milk protein or 20% milk protein.  The 20% milk protein rats always got cancer, the 5% never did.  Then he tried it with wheat and soy protein, but the cancer rates were low across the board.  Thus he concludes that animal protein promotes cancer growth whereas plant protein does not.

To this day, the role of nutrition in disease prevention is vastly under-emphasized because the drug and surgery based medical industries have a vested interest in keeping Americans sick, and the FDA is still influenced by dairy and meat money into recommending an absurd amount of these products per day.<br /><br />I think the overall premise of this book has merit--eat more fruits and vegetables, legumes and whole grains, and cut down on fatty animal crap.

B000BYA5G4|5.0|The last work about arms dealing that I grappled with was \\"Major Barbara\\", a play by George Bernard Shaw. It was a morality tale of a young woman, a Major in the Salvation Army, who finds her work supported by an arms dealer. Surprisingly, the arms dealers in the play and the movie have some of the same rationalizations for their work. They don't kill anyone. They don't start wars. They are only in business. If they don't do it, someone else will. Everyone does it, including governments. <br /> <br />So, not much has changed, except the venue. Shaw set his play in England. The DVD, written and directed by Andrew Niccol, is set mainly in Africa, in Utah made to look like Africa, with scenes in New York, and the Czech Republic made to look like the Ukraine. <br /> <br />This is a work of art as compelling as \\"Hotel Rwanda,\\" and just as bleak, if not more so. It broad brushes Africa as the \\"dark continent\\" as much as Josef Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" <br /> <br />However, a hundred years have passed since Shaw and Conrad wrote about gun-running and Africa, respectively. Surely something has changed, has it not? <br /> <br />Maybe not. Shaw's arms dealer, Undershaft, is charming, generous, and ruthless. So is Nicholas Cage as Yuri Orlov. The world of both the play and DVD is a complex web of moral ambiguity, hiding the most murderous of crimes. <br /> <br />The scene in the DVD in which refugees in a tent city are set upon by wild marauders armed with machetes and the ubiquitous AK-47s seems more similar to what is happening in Darfur than anything in Liberia, where the scene is supposed to take place. <br /> <br />Africa no longer needs to be painted with such a broad brush. True, the DVD is about arms dealing, not per se about Africa, but still, give the continent a break. There is tourism. There are some economies that work. There are a couple of democracies. It is not all war lords. Isak Dinesen did a great job of writing about the beauty of the continent in \\"Outof Africa,\\" albeit in colonial times. However, to include travelogue and contrast within the DVD would have not been feasible because the DVD is a thriller. <br /> <br />And the Liberian dictator played by Eamonn Walker is a classic character as well. But do we need another \\"Emperor Jones?\\" Probably not, but just the same, the title comes from the dictator's shaky English. Cage points out that when the dictator says \\"lord of war,\\" he means warlord. \\"Just the same,\\" says the dictator, \\"I like it my way.\\" <br /> <br />As often happens in thrillers, the government of the United States is shown as ineffective enforcing the laws against gun-running, and actually supportive of it. It is true, as Cage tells the erstwhile agent who has arrested him, the government is the biggest arms dealer. I'm not so sure about Cage's further assertion that the government needs freelancers, to keep their fingerprints off.  <br /> <br />The moral glimmer here is that Yuri, with all his wealth, connections, and power, still goes to Hell. What a way to make a living. <br /> <br />This DVD illuminates a business that is practiced, quietly, by people among us, who may look no different than you or I. Better to see what it is like than to be caught unawares.
B000CPH9I4|4.0|The Irish songstresses are back with a less pop oriented affair. Home is a collection of traditional Irish songs reinterpreted by The Corrs. This is an acoustic album that blends in orchestral elements. The songs are ten times better than any Irish pub song (you'll recognize a few of those), and the vocals are simply angelic. When the songs on Home aren't bringing a tear to you're eye, they're sure to make you smile.
B000067G3C|5.0|this is next to die hard one of thwe best action movies ever made. everything just clicked on this movie, the cast the script and the direction just make this the best way to spend some time watching a movie.a mad man(hopper,type cast now as the crazy villin,but here he just knocks the part out of the park)puts a bomb on a bus so that if it slows down below 50 mph it will blow-up. keanu reeves(in full blowen action hero glory) is the cop who must find a way to save the day as he gets on board the bus . sandra bullack is the love intrest and unlike most action movies she has a very important part to play in this as she is forced to take the wheel of the bus. this is one of those films that starts in 5 gear and never slows down and just when you think it's over you get one last bit a action in the almost unknown l.a. subway system. the extras are great and that makes this one a great part of my collection <br />

B00005JO9J|5.0|I will start with I have not missed an episode yet-- and will make sure to be near a TV on Sundays when it's on because i am completely and utterly addicted! This is the most addicting show that has been around -- EVER! It's not your typical hospital show....it is so much more. It has so much more of a story line than any other hosp show on TV. It has the intensity of a real life ER, the love stories of a soap opera and the addiction level of cigarettes. When you combine these things(and only god knows how they did it so perfectly) you can't help but be on the couch or favorite chair on Sunday nights just waiting for the show to come on. I haven't ever had a show i just absolutely had to see but this one has done it....like i say in the title...i am hooked!
0895260131|5.0|One of the questions which puzzled the ancient Arabs was, \\"Where did the sun go when night time came?\\" The Qur'an gave them Allah's answer. <br /> <br />He [i.e. Zul-qarnain] followed, until he reached the setting of the sun. He found it set in a spring of murky water. <br />(Surah XVIII ( Kahf) vs. 85-86)  <br /> <br />We agree with Muslim scholars that Zul-qarnain refers to Alexander the Great (see Yusuf Ali's appendix on this subject in his translation of the Qur'an). According to this surah, Alexander the Great traveled west until he found out what happened to the sun. It went down into and under the murky waters of a pond. When it was completely covered by the water, darkness fell upon the earth. <br /> <br />To the early Muslims, this surah gave the divine answer as to why darkness fell when the sun set in the West. They assumed that the sun, like the moon, was the size perceived by the human eye, about the size of a basketball. Darkness came when with a mighty hissing roar it went down under the dark waters of a pond. They boldly and proudly proclaimed that this marvelous answer proved that the Qur'an was indeed the Word of God. <br /> <br />Today, modern Muslims are quite embarrassed by this passage and try to ignore it or to quickly dismiss it as poetry. But the passage is not part of a poem. Thus it cannot be dismissed as figurative language or poetic license. In the context, it is part of a historical narrative which relates several historical incidences in the life of Alexander the Great. <br /> <br />The mistake was based on the erroneous assumption that the earth was flat. The authors of the Qur'an did not know that the earth was a sphere which revolved around the sun. <br />

B00003CXC7|4.0|Hitchcock remembered that Joseph Cotten`s wife almost panicked toward the end of the film when they watched it at the premiere.<br /><br />The film owes a lot to script, Edith Head, scenic design, James Stewart, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr. Grace Kelly is visually right, but her speaking voice is phony and a letdown. Indeed her siblings teased her when she came home to Philadelphia on visit. She sounds like Norwegian actress Greta Gynt in the thriller TAKE MY LIFE.<br /><br />But the suspense is great and it IS HITCHCOCK at his very best.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This is a excellent movie with a excellent cast Not only do you get De Niro & Pacino but you get Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore<br /><br />The movie goes throught plots of a couple different hiests and Pacino the cop and De Niro the villian that he is looking for actually sit down and have a cup of coffe and De Niro tells the cop Pacino that he will strike again !!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />this is so intense and on the edge of youre seat the story is so great and you do end up picking sides however Pacino is the cop De Niro, Kilmer, and Sizemore are the robbers I picked De Niro I dont know I always route for the bad guys in movies sorry but Iam sure you will too<br /><br />I love this movie and now Iam going to go watch it again<br /><br />Highly Recomended
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second effort, 1984's Ride The Lightning, is yet another amazing effort by the most succesful heavy metal act in history. Though I like Kill 'Em All just a little more for its raw energy, this album is just as successful in gripping your in one tight heavy metal package. <br /> <br />The album's intro, Fight Fire With Fire, starts with a beautiful acoustic intro. Don't be fooled by it; no early-era Metallica tune lasts this way for long. It is eventually destroyed by the breakneck riffs and heavy, complex drumming found throughout the rest of the record. <br /> <br />Even if you prefer Master Of Puppets of AJFA more, you must still appreciate the effort Metallica made here. Highly Recommended.

B0002BO0AS|4.0|this is the second really good metal band I have reviewed today, the other one being All That Remains. After listening to this album I can say that this is no-frills in-your-face metal, and it fu*king rocks! Perfect for when you get tired of emo charged nu-meal ticket rock and the bad musicianship that goes with it. And the lyrics probably make the little emo kids pi** in their pants. We need more bands like this to squash out all of the radio metal music being played everywhere!

B0000029GA|5.0|Nas is one of the first to rap like this with rhyme after rhyme, kind of like a Big Daddy Kane. Nas talked about the streets but had that rhyming flow in him. This is new my review on Illmatic, because I was wrong before giving it a 4 out of 5.   <br /> <br />\\"Representing It's Illmatic.\\"  <br /> <br />1. The Genesis- The intro to the album.(5/5)  <br />2. N.Y. State Of Mind- Nas kind of tells of story of him in the city, this track is crazy.(5/5)  <br />3.Life's A B****- This is the only track with somebody featured on it. They were both going back n fourth. (4/5)  <br />4.The World Is Yours- He got this idea from \\"Scarface\\" But he gives you reasons why the world can be yours.(5/5)  <br />5.Halftime- This is suppose to be like a half time show for the album. I think this is where Big L got the beat from for 8 Iz Enough.(4/5)  <br />6.Memory Lane (Sittin' In Da Park)-Good Song.(5/5)  <br />7.One Love- Nas is flowing hard as he wants to on this song(5/5)  <br />8.One Time 4 Your Mind-Good Song. (4/5)  <br />9.Represent- Represent! Represent! (4/5)  <br />10.It Aint Hard 2 Tell- Nas is just is just killing this song. (5/5)  <br /> <br />The best album of 1994 and maybe the best lyrics buy a rapper. The best album of 1994 . . . until Ready 2 Die came out. Peace  <br />

0156027321|4.0|Amazing story telling skills on display. Sometimes it reads like a travelogue, sometimes a biography and often you get feel a hollywood thriller. It is this mix that makes it so exciting that you wouldn't want to stop once you start reading. Above all, it is an inspiring story of mankinds fight for survival in extremely trying conditions.I would have given it 4.5 stars. 0.5 less because I thought the author could have concluded this otherwise classic work in a more acceptable manner. Overall, it has been a memorable experience.

1563890119|4.0|This is probably the most gory and fightening of Sandman comics.  If you can swallow your bile and get past that, you'll find an eerie and mystical story that speaks deep about humanity (and often things we ourselves would rather not know). <br /> <br />A magician tries to capture Death.  He does not succeed, and instead, he captures Dream, Death's younger brother.  And for nearly a century, the universe is unbalanced because of Dream's imprisonment.  This is the first in the Sandman series, where Dream bounces back from his imprisonment, enters hell, fights a few battles, and reclaims his kingdom in the dream world.   <br /> <br />He also encounters a few DC characters along the way, which is why I gave it four stars.  The same could have been accomplished with original characters; the intrusion was not neccessitated.  It's also a bit incongruous because what Gaiman has created here is so very different from any 'superhero' comic. <br /> <br />And if nothing else, this is worth reading for the last portion, where Dream has a little chat with Death, hsi older sister, while she's out doing her job.
B00005QGAX|4.0|It is obvious that \\"Bad\\" was not on the same level as \\"OTW\\" or \\"Thriller\\". And it's also obvious that \\"Bad\\" would not surpass \\"Thriller\\" in records or sales. The music here was just too different--still superior--just too different. This one actually had \\"filler\\" per se (Speed Demon, Liberian Girl, Just Good Friends), though it did have 5 #1 hits (thought their chart longetivity was not as long as \\"Thriller\\"'s cuts). It all appears that Jackson tried too hard to beat \\"Thriller\\" (hence the 5 year waiting period for \\"Bad\\") and it shows in the result. Regardless of how funny some of \\"Bad\\"'s music may seem (this IS the late 1980s, so I'm not picking on just Mike), particularly the title song, it is still fresh and enjoyable today. Standout tracks include: \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"I Just Can't Stop Lovin' You\\", \\"Man in the Mirror\\", \\"Smooth Criminal\\", and the lashing-out-at-the-media \\"Leave Me Alone\\" (which would become all too serious in later years). Overall, this is still quality music.
B000021XR5|4.0|This album may not be as good as \\"Core\\", but it easily comes in 2nd.  Down and Sour girl are classics. Every song on this cd is good.  A must have for all S.T.P. fans!
6305280762|5.0|The Towering Inferno had an unusual genesis.  Two books about a high rise on fire were written, The Tower and The Glass Inferno and two different studios optioned them.  But due to the cost, the studios decided to make one film.  I read both books (I don't read a lot because I am dyslexic.)  And both books were used equally for the film.  The one dominant thing was this film would be an Irwin Allen film and a follow-up to the mega hit The Poseidon Adventure. <br /> <br />In the late 60's and early 70's there was a proliferation high rises.  The one thing was that most fire departments had no plan or ability to fight a super high rise fire.  This film addressed this. <br /> <br />A new super high rise has been built.  But to get it completed on time and on budget, the builder's evil son-in-law has cut corners.  It is opening night and all the towns' dignitaries are there.  It is the first time that the building is fully functional and operating.  But the circuits quickly overload and cause a fire in a storage room.  The fire quickly spreads and traps the guests on the top floor restaurant.  Who will survive, who will die and how! <br /> <br />The following is the cast of characters: <br /> <br />James Duncan (William Holden): The developer of the tower and turned a blind eye to the cuts during the construction. <br /> <br />Susan Franklin (Faye Dunaway): Divorced oldest daughter of James Duncan who is in love with Doug Roberts. <br /> <br />Doug Roberts (Paul Newman): Architect of the tower and boyfriend of Susan.  He just got back from another assignment to discover the cuts that were made. <br /> <br />Patty Simmons (Susan Blakely):  Daughter of James Duncan and wife of Roger Simmons. <br /> <br />Roger Simmons (Richard Chamberlain): Husband of Patty who was the contractor of the tower and cut every corner possible. <br /> <br />Dan Bigelow (Robert Wagner): Head of Marketing and Leasing having an affair with his secretary. <br /> <br />Harlee Clairborne (Fred Astaire):  Conman looking for one last score. <br /> <br />Lisolette Mueller (Jennifer Jones): Retired widow who lives in the tower and looks after the neighbor children who are deaf. <br /> <br />Senator Gary Parker (Robert Vaughn):  Local dignitary attending the opening party. <br /> <br />Michael O'Hallorhan (Steve McQueen):  Head of San Francisco Fire Department, incharge of the fire at the tower.  <br /> <br />Singer Maureen McGovern appears as the singer and performs the Oscar winning song \\"We May Never Love Like This Again\\" by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn.  <br /> <br />All the performances are top notch but Fred Astaire was robbed of the Oscar for a beautiful and complex characterization.  <br /> <br />Stirling Silliphant wrote the screenplay, John Guillerman directed with producer Irwin Allen directing the \\"action\\" sequences. <br /> <br />This is a well crafted action film that will keep you on the edge of your sofa eating buckets of popcorn. This is the perfect for a cold winter's night or a date film where you want to snuggle.  Sit back and enjoy the last great disaster film. <br />
B000AADYYO|5.0|For my money, Opeth is pretty much the best metal band still going right now.  They are each amazing musicians on their own, and together, well, just listen.  I was a little worried when I saw the Roadrunner logo on the cd, but Ghost Reveries continues on the path set by recent releases (say, Blackwater Park through Damnnation)sounding like Deliverance with a bit more influence from Damnation (there seem to be more clean vocals, though I couldn't swear that is true).  The keyboardist who has been on tour with them in the past to reproduce touches on the album is now listed in the booklet as a band member, and plays a much more prominent role.  Opeth purists needn't worry though--while the keys are used more, they are far from overwhelming and do even appear on all of the tracks.  So, no, Opeth hasn't made an Arcturus album.  What they have made is something that at first listen sounds somehow more straightforward than in the past but yet retains the complexity and technicality for which the band is known and loved.  I have heard some people criticize it for being too long, but I think if you listen to it as a whole, it has a good ebb and flow to it, even if I don't always know where individual tracks begin or end (and is that a bad thing?).  Wherever they are on the track list, large portions of this album will get stuck in your head, and for me, that is what sets great music apart from the merely good.

So when i first heard about Nightmare Before Christmas i just had to see it...what i had not expected was to see so many others eager to see it. I grew apprehensive, thinking perhaps i had been tricked by the title, and was about to see the usual sickly sweet holiday shlock usually served up for the season. As it turned out, both I and the crowd were in for a rare treat. The story is very much at it's core the sentimental story of the 'spirit of christmas', but it has never been told in quite this way before. the claymation characters were familiar to us that remember frosty and company, but we never envisioned claymated 'clowns with tear-away faces' singing about thier favorite holiday. <br />Which brings me to the songs. I can not praise Danny Elfman enough for the sheer magic he brought to this film. I am a professed fan of musicals both new and old (told you i was odd) but it is rare in the extreme for the music of a movie, or even a musical play, to so fully capture the mood, emotions, and playful flavor of what is at heart a childrens' story. Elfman not only does this, but also manages to make the songs enjoyable and even memorable for adults too. <br />This combined with a witty and bubbly brand of humor, that is only partially directed to the kids, comes together to create a film worthy of any DVD collection.
B00004STPT|5.0|....yet not contrived but somewhat derived. I'm trying to recall all the elements that I've picked out which 'contributed' to this composition! There is Siegfried's funeral music from Wagner's 'Ring' (towards the end of track 13, 'Barbarian Horde') there's also Prokofiev's 'Lieutenant Kije,' Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 (track 14 'Am I not Merciful?'), Holst's Mars, Bringer of War from 'The Planets' (track 13 'Barbarian Horde')..... but this is fundamentally a soundtrack, not anything being paraded as a new and completely original composition. Yet I must even now paradoxically say that it somehow amounts to even more than a soundtrack! Besides, back in the day when composers 'borrowed from' others, it was said that their music was 'influenced'. Well, Zimmer was 'influenced' and thank God he was!    But this is all trivia. This soundtrack is powerful and simply timeless. Gladiator is one of my favourite films of all time. I was struck by the music separately, however. I rushed out to buy the soundtrack as soon as I could get my hands on it. I vowed there and then in the cinema that I had to get it. I still listen to it many times over and I'm transported by it every time. So evocative is the music that is consistently rouses sentiment: awe, humility, bravery.....passion. This is truly moving music.    Noone moans more about atonality and dissonance than I do but I find the score completely melodic. BEAUTIFULLY melodic. As for it's accessibility? Well, as I said, I grabbed me from the start and I've been held in rapture since.    Liza Gerrard's voice adds a quality that is difficult to quantify. It is DEEPLY moving, sonorous, soulful....God! It's beauty pains my heart!The instruments are lush, exotic and brilliantly orchestrated. Some of it is, I believe, synthesized but heck- when it sounds this good, who really cares? Call the technology a 'modern instrument' and have done with it.    Hans Zimmer has made a towering achievement here and like a gladiator about to die with each hearing, I salute him!
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|It is however, in my opinion, much closer to the original books than the clasic musical. <br /> <br />Now before you break out the flame throwers and turn me into extra crispy, I am in no way bashing the MGM classic. It was for me, like it was for many, my first exposure to the colorfull and magical land of Oz. It will always carry a special place in my heart, and in my DVD collection. <br /> <br />On the other hand, having been inspired by the movie i went out several years later and read the books. What i found was a much darker Oz than the one Judy Garland skipped through arm in arm with her newfound friends. Had i read the books at 5 (the age when i first saw the movie) I likely would have been terrified by them and never have wanted to have anything to do with Oz again. Luckily for me, this was not the case when i did read them (at about the age of 9 or 10 i think).  <br />Return to Oz is definitely in the same vien as the books, and intended for audiences that are able to deal with it's bits of darkness, both in Oz (such as Jacks abandonment issues) and the real world (dorothy's electro-shock experiance). There is also a more sinister mood here, this is not the technicolor cotton candy world of Oz that was clear cut about who is good or bad. Queen Moombi's manipulative ways brings these shades of grey into sharp relief, as does the oh so reasonable manner of the Gnome King. <br />For all these reasons I rate this movie highly and recommend it for everyone's collection, with only the caveat that it is not meant for the younger kids or those looking to relive the musical numbers of the MGM classic. It is a new story that has a more grown up Dorothy dealing with more grown up things.
B0000VD04M|5.0|As close to perfection as this American life allows.  Anyone alive fifty years ago, who got pulled into the black-&-white rattle & hum of fabulist phantoms coming from a plugged-in box in the living room, will meet this movie like an old forgotten friend.  Burton's Ed Wood is a friendly old freak show.  Depp's Ed Wood is a friendly old freak who has every hopeful twitch of the hopeful Fifties vamping on the edge of the age of anxiety.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I last saw Phantom in London in June 2004 with John Owen-Jones as the Phantom, Ramin Karimloo as Raoul, and Katie Knight-Adams as Christine.  The London production is the most impressive in the world and I believe there is no other subsequent stage cast that can compare (then again, I haven't been back to London yet). This is especially true for John Owen-Jones (I have to give him a bra-VISSIMO kudos as I write this review, even though he has nothing to do with the movie).  His voice was so powerful and exploding with passion that when he sang \\"Music of the Night\\", I nearly had to be scraped off the floor and was under a spell for the next 3 days. <br /> <br />Then I heard the movie was coming out and was not very happy. My first thought, like so much common sentiment, was that Hollywood would make a train wreck out of the integrity of a story that just did not belong on film.  I turned up my nose. <br /> <br />And then last month, I happened to stumble across and be grabbed by the 2nd half of the movie on HBO one night. I made sure to catch it the next time a few nights later in its entirety, which turned into watching it again and again, and I'd keep looking for the next time it was scheduled to air. <br /> <br />Okay, I LOVE this movie.  Everything about it is a beautiful work of art - the cinematography, sets, costumes, acting, talent, etc., etc.!  It even clarified parts of the story I had otherwised missed or did not understand during the stage perfomance. Gerard Butler is BEYOND sexy, definitely a younger and more contemporary sort of Phantom, and that is A-okay in my book!  Like so many other reviewers here have said, how could have Christine resisted him!!!  <br /> <br />Some scenes of interest:  1.  The Don Juan scene and \\"Point of No Return\\" is hypnotic and HOT HOT HOT! 2. The traveling carnival/history of Phantom as boy is disturbing and sad. I'm not sure how I feel about that particular twist/rendition being made part of him. 3. Christine in the graveyard gave a stellar performance of \\"Wishing you Were Here Somehow Here Again\\", but I don't know that I liked the swordfight scene between Raoul and the Phantom, nor that the Phantom was nearly defeated.  <br /> <br />I still cannot believe how this movie not only proved me wrong, but far exceeded my expectations.
B000055Y0X|4.0|Every 40 years I try to watch Dr. Strangelove, just to be sure that I didn't miss anything earlier, so last Saturday was it.  It's still a good show, and it's still amazing how influential it was in '65 & '66.  Its antic, manic repudiation of Cold War conceits and of militaristic pieties helped push many of us into nihilism.  Vietnam made it easy to loathe the military (Clinton's words) and to see even good men as Rippers with a happy face. <br />   <br />But repudiation isn't refutation.  Now I think Strangelove was mostly wrong about the Cold War & military power;  we nihilists were mostly wrong about Vietnam.  But rather than refight the last bad war, here are some apropos Cold-War notes: <br /> <br />Stanley Kubrick's nightmare fantasy Dr. Strangelove was worryingly close to a real doomsday scenario.  A US commander goes mad and orders an attack on the Soviet Union.  No one can call back one of the bombers ... <br /> <br />(F)our hydrogen bombs from the B-52 [that collided with a midair refueling tanker at 30,000 feet over Spain in 1966] fell to earth around the village of Palomares.  Although the safety devices prevented a thremonuclear explosion, the high explosives in two of the bombs went off;  radioactive particles were scattered over several hundred acres of farmland.  A third bomb landed intact near the village.  The fourth landed in the sea.  [It took an intense search of 80 days to find it.] ... <br /> <br />On 26 July 1957, while practicing a touch-and-go landing [in England], a US B-47 bomber crashed into a storage depot housing three nuclear bombs.  Blazing jet fuel threatened to ignite the TNT in the trigger mechanisms of the bombs, but fortunately firefighters extinguished the blaze. ... The event was kept secret until news of the accident leaked in the early 1990s. <br /> <br />On 24 January 1961 a B-52 bomber came apart in midair over North Carolina, and two 24-megaton nuclear bombs were released as the bomber fell to earth.  One bomb parachutedto earth and was recovered.  The other landed in waterlogged farmland and was never found. ... (W)hen the recovered bomb was examined, it was found that five of its six safety devices had failed.  North Carolina was saved from a nuclear explosion a thousand times more powerful than that at Hiroshima by the one remaining safety system. <br /> <br />On the afternoon of 21 January 1968, a ... B-52, carrying four hydrogen bombs, crashed into the ice seven miles away from the Thule [Greenland] base and exploded.  Although the safety devices prevented a nuclear detonation, the conventional high explosives in all the bombs went off;  radioactive debris was scattered over a large area. ... <br /> <br />Even more terrifying were failures of the complex systems developed and designed to respond to a nuclear attack and to trigger retaliation. ... At 4:00 AM on 26 October [1962], at the height of the [Cuban missile] crisis, unknown to Washington an Atlas ICBM was launched from Vandenberg Air Force base in southern California.  The missile was not armed;  its launch was a test that had been scheduled some time earlier and, due to bureaucratic imperative, had not been cancelled.  But Vandenberg was on DEFCON 2 alert status, so other missiles there had been fitted with nuclear warheads.  Had the Soviets detected the launch of this test missile, they could easily have imagined that the firing was for real.  Their response might have been to order an immediate nuclear retaliation against the United States.  Again, at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, the first squadron of Minutemean missiles was about to be deployed when the Cuban crisis erupted.  In the haste to get them onto alert, we now know, several routine safety procedures were overlooked.  Miswirings or short circuits could have led to an inadvertent missile launch.  Moreover, the crews who were rushed into taking charge of their deadly payloads had not been fully trained or certified for these launchers. <br /> <br />Inthe tensest moments of the missile crisis, ground defence forces at all US air bases were vigilant against sabotage attempts by Soviet agents.  On the night of 25 October, an air force sentry on patrol at a base near Buluth, Minnesota, spotted someone climbing over the perimeter fence.  He fired at the intruder and counded the alarm for sabotage.  At bases throughout the region a series of synchoronized alarms went off.  But at Volk Field in Wisconsin the wrong alarm was triggered.  A Klaxon was sounded signalling that nuclear war had begun.  Pilots ran to interceptor planes fully armed and primed with nuclear weapons.  These men, who had been told there would be no practice drills during the Cuban crisis, immediately started their engines and started towards the runway.  Fortunately, the base commander had checked with Duluth and ordered an officer to drive his car into the middle of the runway and flash his lights to abort the takeoff. <br /> <br />Back in Duluth it was discovered that the suspect intruder was a bear. <br /> <br />The most chilling incident of all took place on 27 October 1962, the Black Saturday of the missile crisis, the day on which both sides felt that a nuclear confrontation looked unavoidable.  Just before 9:00 AM radar operators at an advance warning station at Moorestown, New Jersey, were carrying out a regular check of their computer systems.  They inserted a software test tape in which a simulated missile attack from the Caribbean activated an advanced level of alert and then aborted the system automatically, after assuring that all responses had been correct.  At the exact moment the Moorestown operators inserted their software test tape, a \\"friendly\\" space satellite crossed the horizon from the direction of Cuba.  According to the command-post log, the computers and their operators \\"became confused\\" as to what was real and what was part of the test.  They reacted as though under attack.  Moorestown informed NORAD at Colorado Springs that a missile had just been launched from Cuba.  They calculated that it was targeted on Tampa, Florida [just up the road from Sarasota] and would detonate at 9:02 AM.  The Strategic Air Command in Omaha was alerted that a nuclear attack was under way, as was the command room at the Pentagon.  But there was no nuclear detonation in Tampa.  ... <br /> <br />This scare sounds impossible.  Who could have anticipated that during a test a satellite would come up on a radar screen at the precise moment and exact location where a missile launched from Cuba would have appeared?  No fail-safe system could anticipate such a coincidence -- and on the tensest day of the entire Cold War.  But it happened. <br /> <br />Apocalyptic fear of nuclear disaster gripped East Europeans and the Soviet peoples far less dramatically.  All they heard was reassuring government propaganda, even if few believed it.  The Cuban missile crisis scared millions in the West who followed the news of it day by day.  Many key events were carried live on television.  But in the Soviet Union not a hint of the crisis was revealed until it was nearly over, and then only on an inside page of Pravda.  It was only the party elite who had any idea of what really was going on. ... <br /> <br />[Deep background]:  Eisenhower [years before the Cuban crisis] approved a system by which, if the conventional command and control system were destroyed, local commanders would have authority to launch nuclear weapons if, in their view, the country was under nuclear attack.  In the Cuban missile crisis, accordingly, one fighter squadron of the Twenty-eighth Air Division in California, armed with nuclear weapons, flew with all safety devices removed.  The division's official history noted, \\"Only the pilot stood between the complete weapon system and a full-scale nuclear detonation.\\"  Fortunately, the top guns desisted from starting a nuclear war. <br /> <br />In addition to this, the head of Strategic Air Command had specific \\"authority to order retaliatory attack ... if time or circumstances would not permit a decision by the president.\\"  At the head of SAC had been the bullish Curtis LeMay.  [LeMay was derided by the liberal Left as a warmonger, and was probably the model for General Jack D. Ripper in Dr. Strangelove.]  In 1957 he was replaced by the even more bullish General Thomas Power.  LeMay later admitted that he was concerned about Power.  \\"He was mean;  he was cruel, unforgiving, and he didn't have the time of day to pass with anyone.\\"  LeMay used to \\"worry that General Power [who testified that we would be winners of any war if there were more of us alive than \\"the bastards\\" on the other side] was not stable.\\" <br /> <br />======================================================== <br /> <br />[This material is from Cold War: An Illustrated History, 1945 - 1991.  It was a companion volume to the CNN Cold War series, and was written by Jeremy Isaacs and Taylor Downing, both British, hence \\"defence\\" instead of \\"defense.\\"   <br /> <br />Can't find it now, but the book includes an obligatory reference to JFK's speech at Washington University in 1963, after the missile crisis, in which he used the crisis as a pretext for advocating talks to control nuclear weapons & to reduce the threat of war.  That speech is often cited in just that way, and is an implied happy ending to the world's moment of maximum danger in 1962.  We went to the brink, somehow survived, and were impelled by survival and a visionary president to move into the sunlight of sanity. <br /> <br />But a few paragraphs earlier, Isaacs & Downing correctly noted that the take-home message taken home after the Cuban crisis by the Soviets is that they needed more bombs.  In 1963, and for the next 25 years, the Soviets were almost invariably willing to talk about limiting weapons while they were building weapons at an unprecedented pace. <br /> <br />We in America became enamored of talk & treaties.  We confused words on paper with accomplishment.  In the early 1970s President Nixon talked up a treaty in which the US and the USSR agreed to stop producing biological weapons, weaponized smallpox and anthrax and ebola. <br /> <br />The bio-warfare treaty sort of worked.  The United States stopped all research on the development & production of bio-weapons.  The USSR didn't.  Even as the Soviet economy was collapsing in 1990 and 1991, millions of rubles were still being diverted to secret bio-weapon programs.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|This was more of a disturbing eye opener than an enjoyable movie for pure entertainment's sake. However, it makes a valid point, which may have been Hollywood's goal. The power of greed and the futility and brutal price of war. I would have liked a more hopeful ending, but perhaps the intent was a realistic lesson in political unrest and the hands that feed them weapons of 'mass destruction'.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

0374115370|4.0|Regarded by some as the essential literary representation of 1980s America, \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" was written during the economic boom and urban crime waves of that decade and published almost as the stock market crashed in 1987. It follows the lives of a group of characters who express New York City's ethnic, socio-economic, and political rivalries through their involvement in a highly-publicized case of hit-and-run. A car belonging to Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue, one of Wall Street's most successful bond brokers, accidentally strikes a young black man in the Bronx. With the injured man in a coma, Harlem preacher, politician, and general rabble-rouser Rev. Reginald Bacon sees an opportunity to advance his agenda -by delivering the racially charged case to ambitious District Attorney Abe Weiss and to unscrupulous tabloid journalist Peter Fallow. Prosecutor Lawrence Kramer jumps at the opportunity to bring down a wealthy WASP in the name of equality. And streetwise Irish lawyer Tommy Killian may be McCoy's only ally in a city where truth and justice take a back seat to just about everything.<br /><br />\\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\"' flaw is ironically the source of its strength. The book is over 600 pages long. It follows too many characters and spends a lot of time describing the world from their point of view. The book's insights rely on its many perspectives, but at the same time, the descriptions are cumbersome. Tom Wolfe generally does not cast his characters in sympathetic light. His willingness to call it how they see it draws the reader into the story out of an almost perverse curiosity. The blunt talk and peek inside the worlds of city politics, tabloid journalism, criminal law, and Park Avenue lifestyles keep us interested. The story is found in the self-serving hostilities and interdependencies of New York's many factions more than it is in the sequence of events. And it's all thoroughly plausible, sadly.
B0001GL3KE|5.0|Son historias que motivan en creer que el amor est&aacute; en cada lugar que vivimos. Los grandes actores que participan lo hacen de una manera soberbia en el ambito de la comedia, no obstante denotar algunas escenas de drama asociadas a la tristeza de la realidad que nos puede tocar vivir, como la soledad y el amor no correspondido. La banda sonora que acompa&ntilde;a a cada escena adiciona emoci&oacute;n y el Director me hizo compenetrar con cada uno de los tantos personajes e historias que nos muestra.<br /><br />Esta es de esas peliculas que aparece cada cierto tiempo y que nos motiva con el ideal de que el amor lo podemos encontrar en cada lugar.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I admit, I am a Joss Whedon Fan. I own Angel, Buffy, and the FireFly series.  However, when I first watched Firefly at the request of another rabid fan, it took me a while to get \\"into it.\\"  The same is of the movie.  However, the more you watch, the more you like this flick.  River kicks butt.  Mal is awesome.  Jayne is brutal.  Inara is just gorgeous.  This movie has realism that surpasses any sci fi movie or tv series.  A space cowboy adventure with laughs, chills, and thrills galore.
6301966562|5.0|I rented this movie over and over when I first saw it at the video store. I was never able to buy it anywhere, and it seems it's A must to have this on DVD! Please publish this classic on DVD for the good of humanity!<br /><br />Happy valentines day!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|No female writer has ever written a story quite like Jane Austen, and so, with every release of the newest interpretation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" I hold back to see whether or not the filmmaker stays true to the story. Jane Austen wrote from the perspective of the upper class of her time. Though this interpretation lacks that wonderful British English from Jane Austen's pen and plays a little more to an earthy feel, it captures the story, the differences in Darcy's and Elizabeth's situations in life and is a \\"must see\\" for any Jane Austen enthusiast. The cinematography is wonderful. Keira Knightly runs away with the show.
B00006AUIG|5.0|&#34;Session 9&#34; has everything you could ask for ... a real insane asylum that's 100X scarier than any Hollywood set/top notch acting/moody atmosphere/chilling soundtrack/good pace (though it drags in a few places). There are no scantily clad teen girls running around. Instead we get an all male cast ... most of whom are living on the knife's edge emotionally. Performances are taut and realistic. Only major complaint = ending was a bit too contrived.
0307276902|4.0|Regardless of whether the book was the truth or not it was good. Although, I do believe that if it had been marketed as fiction or as \\"based on a true story\\" it would have not seemed as powerful. Frey's \\"experience\\" was empowering and uplifting, I would have never figured and experience in rehab to be as challenging as Frey suggests it is. I liked the book and encourage others to read it.
B0000026VZ|4.0|Toto is a \\"perfect\\" band, in that sence that soundwise it`s overall perfection. The reason for not 5 stars, is that on some tracks the perfection is to much. You can`t eat sweet cackes every day, sometimes you have to eat some dark rye bread if you want to feel good all over. But anyway. Here we go. Track 1 Love has the power, start`s with a weird choir song, which sound`s not to good. But when the instruments and the vocal kicks in gear, it sounds great all trough, with enough space between the different instruments to make<br /><br />it a good listen. Track 2 Africa with it`s ethnical drum beat in the beginning, and the cool \\"low key\\" vocal  set`s the standard for this 80 ths hit song from Toto. Overcool studioperction this one.  Track 3 Hold the Line has it all, from the beginning with the hammering on the keyboard to the last drumbeat, it lift`s you up. One of the few tracks with \\"fuzz\\" on the guitar`s which makes  a glimmer touch with a small breezee of \\"light heavy metal\\" for a change. Track 4 Out of Love, sorry to say is a let down. A big one too. When this Cd came out in 1990, this track was unrelased. This ballad is a stream of cliches. Anyway with Track 5 Georgy Porgy we are back in business again with this funky song, with fresh rythmic drum beat for a change. Track 6 I`ll be over you is a nice ballad for but has much of the same problems that Track 4 has, some boring perfection elements that drag`s it down, but other wise fine.<br /><br />Track 6. Can you hear what i`m saying is also a previously unreleased track, but this one shine`s for a change. It` has  a certain \\"jazzy funk rock rythm \\"beat  which lift`s it up. Track 8 Rosanna is a classic. Classic Toto at his best. It`s a well composed gem, which shines on every beat. Track 9 I wont hold you back is anyway a stream of cliches, when it comes to ballad sing/song writing. It`s slow ok,but this is to much \\"sugar cake\\" to spark a shimmer. Track 10 Stop Loving You, has a great instrumental synth beginning, but then it`s suddenly change`s into an ok funky beat song, with some great instrumental elements included. Track 11 99, is an early ok funky song, which sparks here and there, but it`s easily forgotten. Track 12 Pamela is a likeable song which hold`s the standard, execpt for the overkilled synth sound from the 80 ths which pop`s up here and there. Track 13 Animal is total out of t line. This sound`s like poor man`s \\"disco funk\\". The theme goes around and around, and doesn`t kick off. But anyway. Toto shines most of the time and is a great introduction to the band for beginners.

0679422714|5.0|I am not a historian so I cannot comment on other reviewers and their claims.  I read MAO to learn something about him and the events I had heard so much about, including the Long March and the Cultural Revolution.  The authors paint Mao as someone bent on power and domination, exclusive of any ideological thought.  He is portrayed as an uninspiring speaker who excelled at political chicanery, showing loyalty to no one. <br /> <br />According to this account, he was responsible for at least 70 million deaths.  Most were by starvation because China's food was exported in exhange for the ability to procure weapons.  The peasants were overworked and existed on very little food,, often resorting to eating leaves, grass and insects.  Mao also had large numbers of people tortured and killed to instill fear in his perceived enemies as well as the general population.  Suicides were common. <br /> <br />MAO is a long book but surprisingly easy to read.  It is heavily documented, including a summmary of interviewees in addition to the footnotes.  Unlike most history books, I found MAO to be even throughout.  The parts that chronicle Mao's early years were just as interesting to me as the highlights of his ascension to power and the end of his life.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I caught a rerun of the pilot late at night and now I am hooked.  The quirky dialogue, intriguing mysteries and smart characters make the show a great joy. <br /> <br />Veronica Mars is not your typical teen girl.  A social phariah at Neptune High,  Veronica tries to solve the murder that changed her life and the lives of those around her.  It is amusing to think that if this murder had not happened, then Veronica's circumstances would not have changed and she would be a clone from all those other shows.  I am glad that things went as they did in Neptune, California or we might not have the Veronica Mars we have today. <br /> <br />If you love this show, please visit [...] and sign the petition.
B00001P4RI|5.0|I was stunned by how beautiful this album is.  It's not Dead Can Dance which is, frankly, a good thing.  Enough with the DCD worship already.  It's time to move on and he has with this amazing album. <br /> <br />Exquisite sound: fragile, lovely, sad.  His voice has never sounded better.  The absence of percussion is refreshing.  Just beautiful songs in gorgeous minimal settings.  I'm sad he hasn't done any more.  I love this album!
B00097DX3U|5.0|First of all im not a kid, I just didnt want to sign up. But hey i disagree with most of the reviews, it only took me one listen of the whole cd to love it. I think it is just as good maybe even better than their self-titled debut album. I think this album has flow and chemistry unlike their last one which just seemed kind of mixed and scattered. Chris Cornell's lyrics are great and probably the best he has ever written before. I believe that they have showed people or at least me that they are no longer a lingering Rage Against the Machine but they truely are and always will be Audioslave
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is probably the single best CD I own.  Tool isn't even my favorite band, but this album is the the best of the best.  They are awesome in concert and amazing on CD.  Their videos are unbelievably artistic and the music is beyond imagine.  Perfect album!!!!!!!!!
B000002J1S|5.0|This album gives me chills all over everytime I listen to it, and not a lot of music can do that to me. This is the GREATEST Album of ALL TIME!!!
B00005JOFO|5.0|Just want to tell those of you who think that this is a pure fiction, well, the story line happens to strike a cord with me. Other than the fact that I'm not a cowboy, it is definitely very close to home. This movie deserves all the nominations it received. Go see this movie with your friends or loved ones. It will open up your eyes, especially if you're straight.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|It only took about 2 listens to realize that this is the same Madonna schlock wrapped in a shiny new package.  Same boring songs (can we have another about what fame means or doesn't mean to her?) with slick production.  She is completely out of new ideas so she has to rely on a producer to make it sound fresh.  This CD is lousy.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This is more stupid poser punk rock. I hate bands like this. If I could give this zero stars, I would. If you absolutely have to listen to this &lt;obcenity>, listen to their earlier stuff. It sucks, but not as much as this. This music IS NOT punk rock, for you out there wanting to purchase this CD in an attempt to be \\"cool.\\" This is just another band looking to make money, that doesn't care about the music as long as some kid buys it. This is horrible pop music, which stupid shows such as MTV idolize and try to brainwash you into thinking that \\"THIS IS MUSIC. BUY.\\" I used to like Green Day (earlier stuff), but now I hate them. If you want to listen to punk rock, listen to stuff like Black Flag, Adolescents, ect. None of you would probably want to listen to my style of music, but if you really want to, try: MU330, Streetlight Manifesto, Spring-heeled Jack, Less Than Jake, Slapstick, Operation Ivy, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Madness, Selecter, Pietasters, Catch 22, Reel Big Fish, Big D and the Kid's Table, Buck-O-Nine, and others that I'm too lazy to write right now. OK, don't buy this CD or download it.

I tought he did justice to the topic of negotiations, which can trouble the best in the business at times.  Even tough this book was written long time ago; the advice is relevent and easy to grasp. This book helped me and it is one of those books which leaves some sort of an impact on the reader.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|BEHEMOTH - Demigod <br />- <br />When Brutality is the defining mark of your genre sometimes it is hard to stand out...  <br />Behemoth, luckily, has little problems standing out.  This is due in part to their superb musicianship, (which shines in their actual song writing ability as well) their unique `darker than the norm' atmosphere, (Listen to the intro to track one... sounds as evil as `Today is the Day') and distorted Vocals. (Which even though I'm not a big fan of the vocals they do set them apart, as opposed to all the generic gut growlers.)  <br />  <br />Poland's, Behemoth has given me faith in modern DM...  Honestly with the exception of Morbid Angel's Domination and Death's last few albums (Which we all know were way more then just DM...) Behemoth's Demigod is one of my favorite that the genre has to offer...  And easily one of the best DM released this Millennium... Generally I'm more into stuff like Opeth, Dillinger Escape Plan, Tool, stuff with a bit more depth... but Demigod is one of the few, relatively straightforward Death-Metal Albums I can listen to start to finish...  <br /> <br />If you like any forms of Brutal Music... I have only one question: <br />Why don't you own this CD?   <br /> <br />Favorite Songs: Sculpting the Throne ov Seth, Conquer All and Slaves Shall Serve. <br />-4.5 Stars <br /> <br />IF YOU LIKED, AGREED OR APPRECIATED THIS.

B00005JNTX|5.0|This film was beatiful. The hyper violence, sexual dicptication of women, and pulp literay style of diction is what makes this film geared toward a specific audience of both the orignal comic and film noir. The film is not the the easily squimish, and in fact may be shocking to the causual viewer. For fans of noir, pop culture, john woo/terentino, and pulp, this is pure candy.If you couldn't get enough of the film, rest assured that the source comics will not dissappoint as well.
B000E1YW0E|2.0|Okay, people who didn't like it: stop saying that it's just for RENT fans.  While I'm sure a lot of RENT fans liked it, a lot of them didn't.  And it's certainly not for every musical fan, either.  We might even hate it more than you do because we know about the stage version, which is superior to the movie. <br /> <br />Anyway, like most hardcore musical fans, I was a RENThead for about a year.  Also like most hardcore musical fans, the phase wore off rather quickly and when I saw the stage production not much later I was bitterly disappointed.  I don't think that RENT is a bad show (in fact, I am listening to the OBC's \\"Without You\\" as I write this,) I just think that it is horribly overrated.  It's always annoyed me that it's about, as I like to put it, people with no jobs who complain about having no money.  The blatant hypocrisy also has really bothered me: the movie doesn't have \\"Contact,\\" but in that song they make fun of safe sex.  I'm sorry, but with that kind of attitude it's not really surprising that you got HIV.  I also hate most of the characters, whom I find to be shallow and quite selfish. <br /> <br />Anyway, onto the movie itself.  For the record, I hate Chris Columbus.  I have not seen one movie of his that I like.  People say that he is too faithful to the source, but that is entirely not true.  He adds what some would consider minor changes, but these changes are enough to completely warp something into something else, something that it entirely shouldn't be. <br /> <br />First off, setting it in 1989.  WHAT was he thinking?  RENT does not belong in that year.  It belongs in the 90's.  There were so many anachronisms and inconsistancies that it was ridiculous.  Thelma and Louise is the one that critics have pointed out the most.  Now, if Chris Columbus had a good reason for setting it in 1989 I might be a bit kinder, but I believe he set it there because that's when he lived in NYC.  Uh... yeah. <br /> <br />Second off, all or nothing.  RENT isconsidered a rock opera.  That means minimal dialogue.  That means including the recitative-like \\"Tune-Ups\\" and \\"Voicemails\\" which were dispersed throughout the score to unify everything.  Without those interconnecting \\"dialogue\\" songs, the score became a jumbled-together mess: songs started, randomly and abruptly.  That also means leaving in \\"Christmas Bells\\" and \\"Goodbye, Love.\\"  Taking out \\"Goodbye, Love\\" removed the important development of Roger's reason for leaving, which was because Mimi was ill.  It also took out Mark's development, when Roger says that all he does is hide behind his camera.  The ommission of \\"Halloween\\" did that, as well.  I won't even begin to talk about how they depleted Benny's character. <br /> <br />Third off, the \\"staging\\" for some of the songs.  \\"Another Day\\" should not be sung from Mimi and co. on the ground to Roger on the balcony.  I kept thinking \\"If she's bugging you so much, go back inside!\\"  It loses its impact if it's so distant.  I was really mad about that, because I love that song.  The scenes with Roger in Santa Fe were so darn cheesy I cannot even begin to explain what was wrong with them, and setting \\"What You Own\\" right after he comes back is quite stupid to me.  My favorite part of the song has always been when Roger sings \\"The filmmaker cannot see\\" and we're like \\"OMG!  He's back!\\"  Chris Columbus TOTALLY ruined that effect.  And setting \\"Out Tonight\\" at a strip club?  What the heck?  I'm so thoroughly perturbed by that I won't even begin to nitpick about how Mimi is an S&M dancer, not a Go Go Dancer. <br /> <br />Fourth, what was with the rent notices being burned and thrown into the street?  Maybe it looked cool, but all I could think was \\"Fire hazard!\\"  <br /> <br />Fifth, and my BIGGEST issue which gets its own section... the gay wedding!  What the heck!  Not only was it completely random and there for no purpose other than political soapboxing, it was OOC.  Maureen isn't a commitment kind of gal.  Joanne's parents, who hate Maureen in the original musical, would NEVER approve.  The scene itself was really just uncomfortable.  If they wanted a gay couple to marry, why not Collins and Angel?  At least they were a good couple.  Ugh ugh ugh. <br /> <br />Now, onto performances themselves.  I'm sorry, but the OBC was too old.  They were tired.  They had played the roles a gazillion time and had nothing new to say.  If you compare them to the OBC recording, there's a multitude of difference.  I'll review each individually, though: <br />Mark - Anthony Rapp did all right, but nothing special.  <br />Roger - Adam Pascal just can't sing anymore; he's been beating his voice up too much.  It has deteriorated and it shows.  He lacked passion.  Roger's a hard character to play without making him whiney, and while Adam succeeded in doing this on the OBC he didn't so much in the movie. <br />Mimi - Boring.  Rosario's acting itself was good, but RENT is a musical.  That means acting alone won't suffice: you need to act when you sing.  Also, she didn't have the vocal chops for it.  Her voice was pretty enough, but Mimi isn't a pretty little ingenue.  Also, this isn't her fault, but she was too sweet and pretty to be Mimi; Mimi needs to seem more... rough and used.  And she straight-toned the entire time.  Drove me nuts.  She lacked the sheer passion and edge of Daphen Ruben-Vega, who sang the heck out of those songs. <br />Maureen - I am no fan of Idina Menzel, I will admit that right out.  Like Adam Pascal, her voice has deteriorated.  I blame her smoking and bellowing at the top of her lungs in Wicked.  Anyway, personality-wise she was fine, though I hate Maureen. <br />Collins - Very good; he made me cry during \\"I'll Cover You (reprise)\\"  And his voice is wonderful. <br />Angel - Awesome as well, but I've always loved Wilson in that role.  <br />Benny - Poor guy didn't get much of a part, but what we saw of him was good. <br />Joanne - Tracy Thoms was FANTASTIC!  I like her even betterthan OBC Joanne!  This is the first time I'd ever seen Joanne \\"win\\" in \\"Take Me Or Leave Me.\\"  Also the first time I've ever really liked her. <br /> <br />In this movie's defense, it was better than the Phantom of the Opera (not that it's hard.)  And, though they performed better back in the day, the vocal performances were (with the exception of Rosario Dawson) at least passable.  That's hard to find in musical-movies nowadays. <br /> <br />But I agree with other people who said that this movie came far too late.  HIV isn't as much of a problem anymore, after all.  Without really great characters (which RENT has never, ever had IMO) it's hard to give us a reason to care about people who, as I said earlier, have no job and complain about having no money.

B00005JOFO|4.0|I was expecting this movie to be overrated and kind of a chick flick, but it was actually really good.  Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall gave outstanding performances.  The two played cowboys, Ennis(Ledger) and Jack(Gylenhall), who fell inlove while tending to sheep over the summer.  Living in a time and place where homosexuality was unnaceptable, they each got married and had children.  However, their love for eachother never ended and they would go on \\"fishing trips\\" a couple times a year to be with eachother.  This was a good love story and you really feel for the characters.  Aside from a couple overly dramatized scenes, this movie really didn't have any major flaws.  The acting, writing, and cinematography were all perfect.  I was surpsied by Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams' acting ablities, they were great!  This movie pretty much did everything right and lives up to the hype.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Ever since I heard of this movie three years ago, I was shaking in anticipation of it. How could I not be? I still consider Final Fantasy VII the best game ever, with one of the most in-depth and emotional stories written. And the characters were easily the most lovable of any of the FF games (come on, who didn't cry when Aerith died). Needless to say, upon finishing the game, I wanted more.<br /><br />Almost nine years later, I'm finally getting what I wanted (me and millions more). Advent Children takes place only two short years after the climax of Final Fantasy VII, and the children of Midgar are suffering from a disease associated with the Reunion. They call it Geostigma, and it causes pain to everyone who has it. Including our hero, Cloud, who continues to fight for these children despite the pain. But when a group of \\"spirits\\" appear, who claim to be three more of JENOVA's offspring, Cloud's fight becomes a little more desperate. What follows is perhaps an hours worth of action interlaced here and there with some emotional character interaction.<br /><br />The action in the movie is excellent. But two scenes in particular stick out in my mind, and that's the battle with Bahamut, where Cloud and all his friends are reunited, and the final battle with Kadaj. I think I like the Bahamut fight because of what happens during the battle. It's instant nostalgia for FFVII fans, and you can't help but smile as the characters pull off some rather super human feats. And as for the Kadaj fight, I'll leave that one unexplained...<br /><br />Another great part about this movie is the surprise appearance by characters thought lost. I won't spoil it here, but at least two characters appear, and have important roles, in this movie when they were thought dead in FFVII (and Aerith isn't one of them).<br /><br />All together, this movie is the best I've seen when it comes to animated features. The only one that even comes close is The Incredibles, and the action in that film is dull compared to what's found in Advent Children. It's far better than Final Fantasy: A Spirit's Within, and I'm kind of wondering why that movie was ever made when this one had been planned. But I think, after watching, I can guess: this movie is for Final Fantasy VII fans only. The story in this is never explained, very specific words are used (like SOLDIER and Reunion) that no one besides players of the game will know. It's kind of a movie geared toward the Final Fantasy VII fan club. But still, if you have even a small amount of familiarity with Final Fantasy, get this whenever if comes out. Even if you don't quite know what's going on, the visuals easily carry this technological masterpiece of an animation.film is dull compared to what's found in Advent Children.

B00003TL18|5.0|This is the best concert DVD I have ever seen. My only negative comment is that it did not last long enough.
B00009M6VJ|3.0|This movie may not have been a masterpiece but it was definately entertainining and had a cool ending.  Former professor, David Gale (Kevin Spacey), is facing the death penalty for murder.  After speaking with him several times, journalist Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) is convinced that Gale is innocent, and tries to stop his execution.  I don't want to give much else away because the way the story unfolds is suprising and fun.  Some of the plot elements were kind of unrealistic, but this really wasn't a bad movie.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|Easily one of the best films of 2005, Peter Jackson's King Kong is now officially one of, if not my absolute favorite movie of all time.<br />Of course, I'm not just gushing to be one of the \\"in crowd,\\" because King Kong really IS something unique amoungst cinema. While the original set the standard (also available here on Amazon), PJ's Kong takes everything to the next level. The SPFX are Oscar-worthy (at the very least), the writing and acting is all rock-solid, and the directing is inspired, as is Jackson's style. The only flaw might be the length, but if you care enough to know about the characters, then the first hour will fly by.<br />The best aspect of the film, aside from one of the best giant monster battles in pop-culture history, is the wonderful relationship between the mighty Kong (Andy Serkis) and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts). The two lost souls find comfort with each other, trying their best to stay together (and alive) against a world that wants to rip them apart.<br />No movie fan's collection will be complete without this dvd! A must-own!

B000BVD460|1.0|Thank god Eminem is slowly but surely making his departure from a genre he has only flawed since he's become a part of it. His fan base is also coming to realize that he's completely fallen off. One day they will all look back on this sorry excuse for an emcee and realize that they were just stupid kids that didn't know what good music was. If you want to listen to hip-hop that gives the genre a good name, listen to Eyedea & Abilities, Edan, Aesop Rock, or any of the countless other underground emcees with real talent. Out.
0142000663|5.0|This is a novel of terrific genius and pathos. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a humble, fascinating story of hard people in hard times. Heartbreaking, full and exceptionally beautiful in its scope, it is a singular American classic that is equal parts literature and lesson.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Now this is interesting: is Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' worth all the hype?  In short, yes! However the film has many issues that keep it from becoming an amazing accomplishment along the lines of, say 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or even 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, which dominated almost a decade of Jackson's life before. <br /> <br />Let's start with the fun part.  The movie has some of the most spectacular and breathtaking effects ever put on the screen. (I'm not one for CGI, so it says alot if a film really wows me.)  This film jumps from action sequence to action sequence at a breakneck pace, throwing the audience into visual assualt after visual assault.  By the end of each sequence, I was out of breath. <br /> <br />We begin our story in New York City of the 1930s-- one of the best visions of a past New York ever filmed. It's almost surreal, the images of the Great Depression, and they stick with you well into the movie. (The film was shot in New Zealand.)  We meet the beautiful Ann Darrow, (Naomi Watts) as she performs her vaudville act in front of a trickling crowd. Box office income is low, and soon, she's out on the street. (Let me also say, that Naomi Watts gives one of her best performances here, and she's absolutely adorable as the 'Beauty' in this tale.)  Fate intervenes when she meets a young filmmaker, Carl Denham (Jack Black, unusually surpressed.) He despretely needs a leading lady in his new film he's shooting and when he sees Ann, he decides she's the girl for the role. Ann joins Denham on the ship 'Venture' with an assortment of characters who'll be introduced, and most will be ultimately forgotten. We meet Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) who is the writer of the movie they're filming. There is a love connection between Jack and Ann, but they never fall TOO in love, because the real love story is between her and Kong. <br /> <br />Carl Denham and company reach an island consisting of dense fog and harsh stones and foliage: Skull Island.  After an hour, the film kicks into high gear at this point.  After a terrifying navigation through jagged rocks and smashing waves, the crew of the Venture go ashore and are almost killed by hostile natives who want to give Ann to Kong as a prize. Ann is taken by the 25 foot gorrilla and is subjected to what can only be described as visceral whiplash as Kong runs through the jungle. <br /> <br />Skull Island is beautifully concieved: a place time has forgotten and dinosaurs thought long-extinct still roam free. Giant apes used to rule the jungle, but now Kong seems to be the last one alive. He is now the king of the jungle.  The crew of the Venture must survive stampedes and attacks from raptors, bugs - (LOTS of bugs, not for the squeamish!)-  and yes, Kong himself.  Kong, we understand, loves Ann. He'd do anything to protect her, but he doesn't care much for Ann's other human counterparts.  Jack Driscoll takes it upon himself to bring Ann back, when everyone else gives up. <br /> <br />Carl Denham decides to bring Kong back to New York. He becomes almost a villian -(well, he's responsible, no?)- when Kong - you guessed it - escapes and terrorizes the city.  He grabs his love, and ascends to the summit of the Empire State Building. <br /> <br />We know the rest.  Back to those 'issues' I told you about. The main problem is the film's length. At 3 hours and 7 minutes, you begin to wonder why they couldn't cut some stuff. A little cosmetic surgery can go a long way.  There are, like I said, characters and subplots that come and go with no payoff, such as Jimmy the Cabin boy (Jamie Bell) and his relationship with Mr. Hayes (Evan Parke). There is also a subplot that ties in with the book 'Heart of Darkness' that ends up being nothing. <br /> <br />The movie does however follow the 'Jaws' rule: it doesn't show a single monster for a little over an hour. It works better this way, so when we first see Kong, it's so powerful and terrifying. There are amazing scenes, quiet scenes between Ann and Kong, that you really start to see Kong as a character.  Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, is again using the incredible technology 'motion capture' to provide animators with the 'performance' of the Kong character. It's amazing, and the Academy needs to nominate Serkis for his work (although they never will, chuckle.) <br /> <br />All in all, I expect everyone to know the story.  But that doesn't diminish the journey that Peter Jackson and the awesome WETA Workshop has  created.  Next time, I think Peter Jackson should slow it down for awhile.
0553801503|3.0|A Feast for Crows is the fourth book in George R. R. Martin's epic series A Song of Ice and Fire.  As detailed on his web site, as Martin wrote the book he found that it was taking too long and growing too large, but instead of editing down the material, he decided to create two books (this book and A Dance of Dragons), each one telling the story of half of his characters.  That's not necessarily a bad idea, but despite this being the \\"good\\" half, with its emphasis on what happens at King's Landing, the book is just not very interesting.  It is definitely a transition book with a lot of setup and very little payoff. <br /> <br />So what went wrong?  The short answer is that Tyrion is missing from the book.  The long answer is that Martin created a book without putting any interesting characters in it.  With the Starks largely dead or scattered, Martin decided to give point-of-view chapters to the Ironmen and the Dornishmen, but he picked the least lively people possible for these chapters -- what could possibly have motivated Martin to focus on Damphair rather than Asha?-- and their threads don't really go anywhere.  In fact, if Martin had simply left out the Ironman chapters, the book wouldn't have been any different.  Just shorter. <br /> <br />And so I'm giving A Feast for Crows a narrow recommendation.  The first three books in the series were excellent, and I'm confident that later books will be excellent as well.  It's just that not much happens in this book.  Martin spent too much time plotting out what will happen two or three books down the line, and forgot to concentrate on this book as well.
6305744793|4.0|A recent re-run of the Addams Family movies on cable convinced me. They have now wormed their way into my permanent DVD collection. (if you'll pardon the pun.)    Why?  It's one of the few occasions when the modern movie revival of a TV series is actually better than the original.     The casting and performances are exquisite.  The male actors chew the scenery, and they do it wonderfully, especially in the case of Raoul Julia.  But the women steal the show with their--pardon the pun again--deadpan delivery.      Anjelica Huston was born for the role of Morticia--and has since made something of a specialty of macabre women, playing the villainess in Roald Dahl's \\"The Witches\\", a British kids' film.  And even as a child, Christina Ricci proves that she has creepy down to a fine art.      I was a little disappointed in Lurch, though.  Perfect physical casting, but the actor (whom I suspect doesn't speak English as his native language) was never given the opportunity for Ted Cassidy's notorious double-takes from the TV series.  Or those curious noisdes Lurch made, which were kind of a cross between a groan, a moan, an uh-huh, or a yeah, maybe.  Call me an Addams purist, but never did I hear him say the famous \\"Yes, Mr. Addams\\".     Thing makes up for it, in part.  Freed from his box, he is the source of sight gags galore.  Though I do kind of miss the cleverness of where Thing popped up in the TV series...    By the way, Ted Cassidy (who played Lurch in the TV series) had such big, gracious hands that he also played Thing.  In scenes where they appeared together, apparently Thing was a hand in.  Gosh, that's the third pun for which I need to apologise...    The original series was a shock to the world of 1960's family sitcoms, full of saccharine kids and sexless married couples.  Every time Gomez uttered \\"'Tish, that's French\\", middle America was treated to its only taste of genuine televised passion.  And when the outside world threatened to close in, Addams family solidarity closed ranks--real family values.      In the aerobicised, tooth-capped, greed-is-good world of the '90s, when the movie was made, it served the same purpose.  Maybe it still does today.

B00005KKC8|5.0|King Crimson, Queen, Genesis... ABBA?  I never would have guessed it, but they all fit.  I'm a prog rock fan at heart (you know... weird songs with lots of different movements, classical overtones and challenging chord structures), and I'm not sure how this CD came into my possession, but I love it!  It's very intelligently done.  Song arrangements are majestic, full and orchestral unlike the standard 80s pop.  And of course they effortlessly slide back into simpler arrangements when necessary. <br /> <br />The title track is sung in a harmonic minor \\"Eastern\\" scale that at once reminds me of Led Zeppelin & the Beatles. Don't deprive yourself of this great track. The song \\"Soldiers\\" has a rather unconventional, brooding drumbeat in 3/4 which may be recognized as a precursor to the 90s alternative genre.  But to me, the standout tune is \\"I Let the Music Speak\\", a powerful operatic piece not unlike Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" but with a darker, haunting melody.  The last 2 songs \\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" and \\"Like an Angel Passing\\" wrap up the album beautifully like the end of an exhausting adventure. <br /> <br />It becomes tragically apparent to me that ABBA was on the verge of a great musical evolution had they continued in this vein.  Unfortunately this would be their last, and you'll be hard pressed to find another 80s album as progressive as this.  \\"The Visitors\\" is to the 80s what \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was to the 60s--a fleeting glimpse of something deeper than the norm.

0064471837|4.0|KIND OF A SPOILER, DO NOT READ IF YOU DON\\"T WANT TO KNOW CRUCIAL PIECES OF PLOT!<br /><br />I loved this book, and indeed love everything of Garth Nix's, but I do want to point out the general aura of clich&eacute;-ness.<br /><br />Ex. 1: It's tough for anyone to believe that loved ones are gone, especially when they're your only living relative, so when Sabriel's father dies under mysterious circumstances, her reaction isn't unexpected. She refuses to believe that her father is gone forever, and goes on a quest to find him. Although no other stories come to mind where this happens, it seems a little clich&eacute;; guardian dies, orphan goes on quest, finds destiny, and new burden. What really tops things off is that he was the Abhorsen, a necromancer who binds the Undead back to death, and she must now take his place. Of course, Sabriel goes on a wild search for her father, and ends up wiser, finds true love, and defeats an ancient evil.<br /><br />Ex. 2: Sabriel and her monster-turned-cat get trapped in a very deep pit, replete with the burial ships of old royalty whose bodies are magically turned into wood and placed as the figureheads of their burial boats. While examining the bodies, she stumbles across a young man called Touchstone who is trapped between life and death. Using her magical tools, she brings him back to life. Amazingly, he just happens to have a grudge against the same ghosty who killed her dad because the evil spirit slaughtered his whole family before his eyes. Real surprise there. He in return helps her defeat the vile beast that killed her father, and then they fall conveniently in love.<br /><br />Ex. 3: Sabriel and Touchstone have one big thing in common; they both want to kill the same man. Of course, he doesn't exactly qualify as one anymore, because he's been dead for hundreds of years, clinging to the realm between life and death, and now he's back as the strongest Undead creature ever. Like any evildoer, this dastardly demon has hundreds of evil minions to do the dirty work, such as try to polish off the two teens that want revenge for their dead families. In the end, love triumphs as always, and Touchstone and Sabriel obliterate the Undead fiends with the help of the old Abhorsen's spirit, sending the bad guys bye-bye.<br /><br />I liked this book a lot, however snippy and snarky I may seem.nions to do the dirty work, such as try to polish off the two teens that want revenge for their dead families.

B0002S947K|5.0|The first time I heard Ray was at a live show in Seattle.  His style is so pure and simple. His Lyrics clear and concave. Listening to this CD takes me a way to a magical place.  Giving me a sense of peace.  I listen to it when I need to unwind after a long day.  Reading a book or just answering email.<br /><br />Ray you have just created a classic that will live long and forever.  Trust me amazonians this will fit in with your jack johnson collection or island music like jon cruz.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Whoever thinks John Mayer isn't a great guitarist oughta get ther head outta their a*#.  This guy is a brilliant blues guitarist, step aside Buddy Guy......you've got nothing on this kid.  Just like a fellow reviewer pointed out, John's critics are the same people who knocked on Stevie Ray......people just won't give the new kid a chance, regardless of how good he may sound.  Just listen to his virtuosity on \\"outta my mind\\", the guy just tears it up.  I live for hot guitar playing and John Mayer is an absolutely wonderful guitarist.  His voice still may be a bit immature.......but the guy gives me chills.  He's the most promising 20 something out there, and he's already delivered a LOT so far.  THE REAL DEAL
B00097DX3U|5.0|Ok, in some instances I am a crusty old miser who is stuck in the past, and in those instances I have to say that the past was better. SOUNDGARDEN and RATM, obviously where I'm going with this. Now, I know, its time to move on and let in the new, but I have a hard time with this. After all, those old SOUNDGARDEN and RAGE albums were pretty damned solid. They were also heavy duty music that filled a lot of my teenage youth with the desire to rock, fight, and screw chicks. The new stuff by this blend of the two bands in their older years sounded a little more I don't know, aged. I didn't like this initially, when the A-SLAVE released their first album. I liked one or two songs, but that debut was too much of not what I expected it to be mixed with a lot of carbon copy of the days past. In other words, it didn't have any solid personality. The album was confused.<br /><br />But maybe I didn't give these guys a chance. Maybe I'm the one too caught up in the past. Now that the second one has been around for a while, I finally shook off some of my miserly ways and decided to check out this second stint by the band. Well I have to say, I dug it this time around. Maybe,.. maybe because, I myself have grown up a little more, or maybe because, I feel something new happening on this disc, that I wasn't open to the first time. This isn't SOUNDGARDEN or RAGE, this is AUDIOSLAVE, and they play some rich and full melodies that are perfect for gracing our heads with beautiful noises and soothing rock strategy. Nice, I can dig. If you want to rock hard, you can still go the route of the BADMOTORFINGERs, or the EVIL EMPIREs that we know are always out there, but if you want to rock something different (no one says you can't still fight and screw if you want to..) with some obvious pro's in the biz.. well, they pulled it a little tighter this time around. OUT OF EXILE is good listening, and it finds the band coming into their new phase in life. Nice job.

1932907009|5.0|...this is indeed the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need.  And every script coach, producer, screenwriting professor I've mentioned it to--a few rather famous ones, in fact--concurs.  It's something of an underground phenomenon, in fact, this book.  And it deserves to be.  Having read nearly all the classics from Field to Trottier, and as a professional writer just getting started in the screenwriting game, I can attest to that.  First, Snyder knows his business--he's a legendary spec seller, and a child of Hollywood whose father was an award winning producer as well.  Second, it's a slim volume that skips the anedotal filler and gets to the formula from page one.  And that formula seems so \\"organic\\" that the writing process feels natural, logical and, because of this, less daunting.  In fact, Cat stopped me in mid script and gave me a process that felt cozy and crystal clear from jump.  Suddenly, I could chart my path with confidence--the mumbo jumbo was gone, and in its place, a way to expedite the entire process.  Best yet, the highly knowledgeable Snyder is incredibly accessible--USE the email address in the book.  He really means what he says, and responds at once and quite graciously.  Better yet, he's giving away tools to make the job easier on his web site.  So, if you're really ready to write that screenplay that sells...this is your guide.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|With all the acolytes coming down like hard rain from his colleagues,lovers,the poets..the fans..from all sides Dylan near at the end of the film says \\"I Just wanna Go Home\\"...he did, to a motorcycle accident..since then the spark and genius remained constant as David Van Ronk says Dylan was able to tap into the collective unconscious or as Allen Ginsburg said Dylan became one with his breath, his movements between mind and body became synchronized into this non-dual being of total unity of spirit and physicality...the defiance of time..Dylan talks about constant becoming...<br /><br />What a treat the great Scorsese gives us with all his films and now this tribute of Dylan added to the arsenal.The journey is well captured, the process is clear and vital and one gets the feeling much has not changed and stays the same despite the new meanings that time bestows yet the movies abrupt ending at this point in Dylan's life kind of disappointed in me .indeed, the most creative or formative part of what we know Dylan as is here in full glory with a totally outrageous flow capturing a very talented man's life between past and future.<br /><br />I wish the movie did not end,not thinking it would when it did since it would have been interesting to see the man's take with marriage,children,religion,middle age..and beyond..the ruminations,the dreams,recollections,reflections,memories are all on display here...very humble..<br /><br />Great footage flows seamlessly,great interviews...
B0006399FS|5.0|I was one of those fans who put off buying the new album, thinking \\"It's U2, it'll be entertaining, I'll get around to it eventually..\\" and then I saw them on the Vertigo tour. I ran out and bought the album and it right away took me hostage. I couldn't put anything else in the CD player for at least a week! Anyone who doubts the soul of the album and its songs needs to hear them live(Chicago DVD for starters..) As for the songs themselves, some hit you right away and some are growers. Overall it's a solid piece of work and with incredible depth and range. Just like on any other great U2 album, there's a song or lyric that speaks to any mood you might be in. It definitely has parallels to their earlier work, but manages to stay contemporary and fresh. That's what I love about this band. Whether or not they always manage to get it right, they're always pushing forward, trying for a different angle or direction. I'd go on and gush some more, but you get the idea. One thing I wanted to point out though, is that City Of Blinding Lights is not quite a love song as someone thought in an earlier review. Not in a traditional sense at least. Bono wrote it for U2's audience, specifically NYC after 9/11. \\"Oh you look so beautiful tonight\\" refers to the raw emotion displayed by the audience at a post-9/11 U2 show. Anyone who's seen this song live knows how great it is. Easily one of their best......... okay I'm done ;)
B00004STUL|4.0|Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, two household names that are very successful Hollywood filmmakers often renouned for releasing that \\"same old cliched garbage\\" and \\"those movies with the 'splosions,\\" bring us Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, box office magnets themselves, in what can only be described as a vastly entertaining romp through Miami as two cops try to reclaim their career-long stash of stolen heroin.  It also involves Tea Leoni in very attractive outfits.<br /><br />With films like these, it's a race to see the newest and most intriguing way of getting our heroes into those situations we know and love (and love to hate): car chases, gun-fights, explosive climaxes, and evil meanies with foreign accents and the inability to shoot anything that's not a vase, a column, a window, and maybe the occassional wall.<br /><br />However, to mix it up a bit, we get a nice little subplot about mistaken identity, as Martin Lawrence's character tries to mimic Will Smith's character, and vice-versa.  Such provides just enough humor and acting to leave the whole thing worth it, and what do ya know but you can't help but feel for these bumbling heroes as they run along getting into mishap after mishap before saving the day by blowing up everything in site (which includes some of their friends which the film failed to acknowledge at the end, but whatever).<br /><br />So for the visual bonanza and exciting demise of warm, sunny Florida, look no further: these are the bad boys.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0783233477|5.0|Clever plot twists coupled with some outstanding performances. Brad Pitt is here for the ladies viewing enjoyment. Claire Forlani for the lads. (This gal has some serious acting chops!) Anthony Hopkins is Class personified. This movie did not set the box office on fire and I don't understand why as it is a true gem. Buy it or rent it or whatever, just make sure you watch it. Very Highly Commended!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've never seen a tv series where all the episodes were top-notch stories. Firefly would be a first. Extraordinary story-telling, special-effects, and character-development throughout. You'll love the constant humor, which would sometimes appear in unexpected situations. The last episode about the bounty hunter sort of leads into the Serenity movie, since we are given a sneek peak into River's \\"special\\" abilities.<br /><br />Let me just comment on the packaging: A+, best I've ever seen. The 4 dvds are enclosed in attractive ultra-thin plastic cases, each one containing episode descriptions - simply beautiful. All this for a reasonable price, can't ask for anything more.<br /><br />On the opposite end, have you seen the horrendous packaging for Star Trek Voyager? Scuff-filled dvd holders held together on the side by tape, enclosed in cheap clear plastic, with bonus disk hanging on the side, wrapped around with a piece of paper & sticky residue. You'd think with the money they charge, the packaging would at least be semi-decent.

B000DN5W4I|5.0|Okay, like other fans of Joe's concerts reviewing this release I've had the great fortune of seeing him perform more times than I can possible count.  Yes, I'm biased, I'll admit it, but take my word for it, if you like great blues playing, THIS belongs in your music video collection, trust me.  <br /> <br />So, let's get down to the nitty-gritty, shall we? The Rockpalast performance catches Joe Bonamassa last year on his first major European tour with Eric Czar and Kenny Kramme playing to a packed, slack-jawed audience of new fans.  It's a stunning concert, filmed close-up and in anamorphic WS, with crisp, clean recorded sound (DTS & Dolby options).   <br /> <br />Joe plays a selection of tunes that showcases a wide range of his techniques and touches on everything he's done as a solo artist to date.  This concert captures all of the delicate nuance of Joe's heavy and soft styles and varied blues rhythms as he selects from his arsenal of guitars just the right instrument for the given song; if Joe were playing golf, even Tiger Woods would be envious!  <br /> <br />One other thing I should probably mention about the impressively recorded sound is how well balanced the music is with the ambience of the concert venue.  Not only are the musicians and their instruments recorded cleanly, but the warm atmosphere of the room is perfect (it's very 'live,' as opposed to cold or dead sounding venues); well, maybe I should've said that the atmosphere was HOT judging by how much Joe, Kenny & Eric are sweating. <br /> <br />BTW, one reason that this set may be abreviated (my speculation) is because the Rockpalast folks were apparently trying to promote this as a televised one-on-one \\"battle of the bands\\" and it resulted in filming/scheduling conflicts for both the groups and attending audience.  <br /> <br />So, what are you waiting for, ...more opinions?  <br /> <br />If you've ever taken a chance and purchased a music DVD based on one of my reviews before, and those of you who've read my comments know that I speak my mind at length and pretty much \\"calls 'em as I sees 'em,\\" then please take this recommendation to heart.  I promise, you won't regret it! In fact, buy several copies as I did and give them to your closest friends with similar or adventurous musical tastes.  Yeah, I know, I probably seem a little obsessive/compulsive right now, but just remember what Monk says: \\"You'll thank me later!\\" :o) <br /> <br />

B000007SPT|4.0|In 1984 when this record came out, the 4AD label was releasing music that no one had ever heard before.  Gothic bands such as Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance, and Wolfgang Press were breaking ground in the underground music culture.  Coulorbox was just taking English pop to new realms.  These bands got together with a few of their friends and made an album together.  It was really cool.  A bunch of our favorite bands doing an album together, we loved it.  It was played at parties and at the clubs.  It was not the best things the bands had ever done but it was different.  We loved the bands so of course we loved what they did together.  It is kinda like if the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and The Who all did a record of songs from the 40s together. If you didn't like all three of those bands then you are not going to like that record, but wouldn't that have been something.something. <br />If you are not a fan of eighties gothic then you may not like this record (Stone).  It is quiet in some parts and rocking in others.  It depends on who is playing on that song.  If you have a wide taste in music that includes Big Star and The Cocteau Twins, then you will probably like this record and the ones that came after.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold writes a mystery equipped with special effects.  Susie Salmon, in her own special Heaven, takes us on exciting encounters with her family, friends and her killer.  She makes you think about what life would be if we could manipulate the people who are still living on earth from faraway heavenly borders.  I liked the quirky way that she describes her friends and her family.  The strong characters come alive in her descriptions.  My favorite person was her grandmother, who jumps to the family's rescue when Abigail runs away from her husband to immerse herself in the baptismal waters of the ocean.  The ending was bizarre with Susie's best friends sharing with Susie another heavenly enounter.  It didn't make much sense to me; it might have been the adolescent Susie fulfilling her dreams.  Mr. Harvey's departure was a perfect success and the lovely bones of baby Abigail Suzanne brought the memories of Susie to rest.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|I was not expecting much when I saw this movie on TV a while ago, but I was amazed by it. The Butterfly Effect is a great movie on every level. Great storyline, compelling characters, great acting, (even from the young cast,) great soundtrack, great directing, great storytelling.....just a great movie.     Evan realizes at a young age that he has blackouts during some disturbing events in his childhood. After a seriously messed up childhood, the movie then cuts to him at college. He finds some old journals, and learns that he can go back in time using them to view events that were previously blacked out. He eventually learns that he can change events in the past. Every time he tries this, though, to save the life of a friend, he ends up making things much worse for everyone, including himself. Each time he travels back in time to change something, something goes very wrong in the present.     This movie isn't for those who can't take disturbing themes. There's a lot of them in this movie, and plenty of violence too. But there's something admirable about how this movie completely avoids doing what's usually expected of a Hollywood movie. The endings, (both theatrical and director's cut) are not happy endings, both involving sacrifice by the main character to make those he loves live happy lives.     The Butterfly Effect is always interesting because it goes to both the young life, teenage life, and adult life of its main characters. Luckily, the acting is great for each part of the movie, and the tight storytelling always keeps the film intense and interesting. (Especially in the theatrical version.) Overall, a very good film that leaves a great impression on you after it's finished.     The DVD comes with 2 versions; Theatrical version, (the one shown in movie theaters) and the Director's Cut version, which features the movie \\"how the directors would want to watch it.\\" This includes about 6 minutes of additional scenes and a different, MUCH darker ending. One version is on one side of the disc, and the other version's on the other. It was a great idea to include both versions, because people will definitely disagree on which ending is the better one.     Since I saw this movie on TV, (Which was the theatrical one,) I was luckily spared the difficult choice of which version to watch first. But I highly recommend the theatrical version. By eliminating some scenes that completely slow down the plot, the theatrical version's pacing is much better. And the ending...well, yeah, it's definitely the less dark of the 2 of them, but somehow, despite usually liking dark endings, I thought the theatrical ending was better. I know it wasn't how the directors originally planned to end the film, but it just seemed so much more well-thought out than the Director's Cut ending. The Director's Cut ending, while attempting to portray sacrifice and make it heroic, just ended up coming off as depressing and the \\"easy way out.\\" If I had seen the movie with the Director's Cut ending first, I would have thought that they \\"just didn't know how to end the film, and this was an idea that they came up with the last minute.\\" The theatrical version, though, gets the same message across, but it seemed to fit much more organically into the clockwork plot. And to tell the truth, the way Evan \\"fixes everything\\" in the theatrical version (at that party) was more sad to me than the events that took place in the director's cut ending, which just seemed cold and unnecessary.     So anyway, some will like one ending, some will like the other one. I thought the theatrical ending, while not as dark, was definitely the better ending. But the good news is that both versions were included on this DVD, so you will get to decide for yourself which ending you prefer.     The Butterfly Effect is definitely worth checking out if you haven't already.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Although I am a product of the eighties, I treasure the music of the 1990's the most. And what better way to end the decade thanwith this album. This is by far RHCP's best collective effort. This album proves itself day in and day out with the hits on this album. Scar Tissue, Around The World, and best of all Californication. RHCP could not have ended the decade in a better way. If I have to explain this album to you then you wouldn't understand. This is the creative pinnacle for all of the members of the band. From the funk of Around The World, to the melody of Scar Tissue, and the force of Californication. This is the Album. Trust me, if I could have only a few albums this would be one of them.
B00002ND77|5.0|This is probably one of the best coming of age black movies ever. (Or should I say Black History movies ever).  <br /> <br />This movie has a stunning appearance by Denzel Washington. The first half of the movie is about how he was a pimp and gangster, and how when he went to jail, he found his senses. I remmeber when I was at the theater in 1992, I clapped at the end for like five minutes.  <br /> <br />Let me tell yall this. Any kid doing a project on Malcolm X, BUY THIS MOVIE. I repeat, BUY THIS MOVIE. Don't get that 1972 biography documentary. Buy this 1992 spike lee joint. I think it is the second best movie Spike Lee made. Denzel's appearance is comparable to Jamie Foxx's in RAY (2004) and Will Smith's in ALI (2001). (Note: THey need to make movies on MArtin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mendela, and Ghandi, all being wonderful black leaders.)
B0000TB050|5.0|Since the mainstream of DVDs, 5.1 surround sound, I have stopped buying CDs and have bought DVDs instead. I play them through my DVD player, with my stereo system connected. It sounds better, plus I get the video to go with the music. This should have been one of the first DVDs I added to my collection. This turned me from a fan of U2's music to a U2 FAN. This video was filmed at the famous Slane Castle, which adds to the mood of the live DVD. You get all almost all of U2's great songs including, One, Sunday Bloody Sunday, With or Without You, Angel of Harlem, and many others. I would have to say that although Sunday Bloody Sunday is not my favorite U2 song, it is by far the highlight of the concert. It is the best recorded version of the song I have ever heard for starters. Plus the drummer shines. When everyone kicks in and the crowd of thousands jump up and down in unison with the castle in the background, it is a breath taking sight. Although U2 is abouit midway down my list of fans, this video ranks in my top 5. If you collect concert DVDs and you don't have this one, buy it today.
B000069AUI|5.0|<br />I like to crank up their music and just feel the power of it; it makes me smile. The song \\"clocks\\" that describes...sings....says about a feeling of home and coming home... ah, be still my heart.  It makes me think of my favorite place in the world.  In fact, whenever I drive into that state, I like to play the song.  &lt;sigh>
B0007OCG56|5.0|As others have noted, Spanglish was mismarketed as a comedy and consequently cost the movie revenue in theatres.  However, the true story here is boy meets girl and the heart-wrenching truth behind these kinds of stories in the real world--things don't always work out for the best.   <br />      <br />The cast was excellent and by the end, those who understood the underlying themes of the film have grown attached to Sandler and Vega's characters and their struggles.  These are two individuals trying to do all the right things for the ones they love regardless of their own happiness.  That is what makes the ending all the more tragic.   <br />      <br />Caring people exist out there who together would find amazing happiness.  Unfortunately, the responsibilities of life and the committment to following socially acceptable paths to fulfillment leave potential soul mates alone and unfulfilled.  Spanglish is the equivalent of Romeo and Juliet for today.
B0000508U6|5.0|<br />Okay, so Chris Martin sounds like he's the son of Jim Morrison, no doubt.  But what a tight band, in general!  I picked up this one after I had enjoyed a few later releases so much, and I am happy to say that I've enjoyed this one as much as any.  They're so gooood!  :)
B000005RU2|4.0|this is superior to Deep Purple's studio recordings for this   early 1970's era because this is the way that this music   should be enjoyed--loud,deep,and spacey.the live show   allows the skill and precision of top flight musicians playing  at their peak and enjoying every moment to come through  with clarity.Ritchie Blackmore, (SLASH WHO?--you MUST  be kidding) the original black top hat guitar hero, moves his  fingers across the fretboard with machine like precision.Ian  Gillan shows us he may be the top rock vocalist of any era.  the entire band crackles and snaps through a well chosen  showcase of everyone's talent.this one makes you wish you  were actually in the arena for the show(s).an excellent choice for a new fan   or for everyone else.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED--especially  at the bargin price it is selling for at the time of this writing.
B0006L16N8|5.0|<br />This release is just as wonderful as the other two.  I actually started with the one just before this; so I've jumped around.  As I said before, I LOVE the power that comes through in their music, and really enjoy listening to it very loud!  Makes commute times actually enjoyable!  Truly, if you like either of the other two of Coldplay's releases, you'll like this one as well.
B000002KET|5.0|Since it was a big departure in sound from their first four albums most consider Black Sabbath's fifth disc the one that most divides critics and fans. Some think that the newly discovered keyboards (by Rick Wakeman, a member of the band Yes) and orchestral arrangements made \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" too artsy and soft. But others (like me) think that, while this album may be \\"more progressive\\" than usual, it is also their most creative effort to date. And, of course, like all Black Sabbath albums, the guitars are still very much involved. \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" does not skimp on the type of sludgy, rumbling riffs that Tony Iommi made Black Sabbath famous for. The catchy, churning main riff of the first track (the title song) helped to break the band out of the creative \\"dry spell\\" they were in, following the recording of their last release, \\"Vol. 4\\" (after Iommi discovered this guitar lick, the rest of the songs came easily.) This song also has a couple of acoustic breakdowns. Next, \\"A National Acrobat\\" has shimmering, wah-wah guitars, and \\"Fluff\\" is an instrumental. It's an interlude-type song, with serene, twinkling, acoustic jangles and cool, pretty piano keys. The synthesizers are most clearly evident on tracks four and six, \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" and \\"Who Are You?\\" (the latter track, which has a melodic string arrangement, is very spacey--it sounds like it's the soundtrack to a laser or light show.) But \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\" is heavier and more up-tempo, as is \\"Looking For Today,\\" which features a catchy, rhythmic hand-clap pattern. Lastly, \\"Spiral Architect\\" is where the orchestra joins the scene. Its lively, almost uplifting violins contrast Iommi's guitar solos well. So, \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" is a true gem which proves Black Sabbath were successfully able to expand on their sound and add creative touches to their music, while still remaining true to their roots. The sound quality can be a little dated at times, but this is yet another classic in Sabbath's catalogue.s catalogue.

B000051Y0G|4.0|This is an 80's classic if there ever was one. Truth be known, I'd even keep this over one of her collections. Sure I'd miss \\"True Colors\\" and \\"Drove All Night\\", but this is pure Cyndi front-to-back. Half her hits are on this one album, like \\"Time After Time\\", \\"All Through The Night\\", \\"She Bop\\", and of course \\"Girl's Just Want to Have Fun\\". But what makes \\"She's So Unusual\\" is the lesser-knowns. I totally love \\"I'll Kiss You\\" and \\"Yeah Yeah\\". Plus this is remastered with extra tracks! Then there's the classic cover photo. You don't get that in 2006. A must for fans.
0893860220|5.0|After over 70 reviews there is little to add. But I write these words as an act of gratitude and in the hope that perhaps even 1 person will be brought to this book by what I have written. <br />I started reading this book over 30 years ago. No matter what other books pile up by my bedside, I Am That is always there. I have had an active inner work for a vey long time and studied several teachings in depth. This book bolsters and in some ways surpasses all of them. It is the ultimate teaching. <br />I come back to it again and again and again and it is like a clear mirror, always showing me where my understanding is. This teaching can never be engulfed, surmised, abbreviated or destroyed. It is what is. Given the small place we spend most of our time inhabiting, how could a teaching such as this not seem to be contradictory? It contains everything! <br />If I were to be cast upon a desert island this would be the one book I would want to have. If you have ever sat with an illuminated being you know that the moment of that exchange could never be captured with words, but this is the text that best distills that energetic experience. It is not an elaborate cosmology or detailed explanation of the many levels of manifestation. It cuts through everything right down to the bone of space.
B00005JOGU|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />With his trademark curling lisp, high-pitched, squeaky voice and flamboyant mannerisms, it would have been easy for almost any actor to build a portrayal of Truman Capote on a foundation of studied mimicry and impersonation alone.  But in \\"Capote,\\" Phillip Seymour Hoffman goes far beyond surface recreation, plumbing the core of the inner man and bringing him to palpable life on the screen.  Most eloquent in his silences, Hoffman mesmerizes us with his performance.<br /><br />Based on a book by Gerald Clarke, \\"Capote\\" deals with the period in which the author struggled through to create his literary masterpiece, \\"In Cold Blood,\\" a book he claimed as the beginning of a whole new genre of writing, the \\"nonfiction novel.\\"  In November 1959, a family of four was brutally slaughtered in their Kansas farmhouse by two drifters in search of cash, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith.  Capote, a successful writer and bon vivant of the literati set in Manhattan, found himself drawn to the case, venturing to the heart of the country with his lifelong friend, Harper Lee (author of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"), to interview the accused killers and try to make some sense of the whole thing.  The screenplay by Dan Futterman zeroes in with stiletto-like precision on the complex relationship that develops between Capote and Perry, the more \\"sensitive\\" of the two killers.  Capote is drawn to this man in so powerful a fashion that even he is unable to figure out exactly why.  Is it because he senses something in Perry's past that reminds him of his own (both suffered from abandonment issues), thus creating a sort of kinship between them?  Is he attracted to Perry sexually and romantically?  Or is he being subtly manipulated by an evil man who senses in this author a weakness and vulnerability he can exploit for his own nefarious purposes?<br /><br />It is a tribute to the complexity of the filmmaking that we feel that none of these and all of these possibilities may be true simultaneously.  And what is so great about Hoffman's performance is that he builds on this ambiguity.  We are never entirely sure if Capote truly cares for Perry or if he is merely using him to get what he needs for the book.  And the way Hoffman plays him, Capote never seems quite sure either.  He is obviously drawn to Perry with a sort of grim fascination, as anyone might be who encounters a person whose actions are as inexplicable and yet larger-than-life as Perry`s.  But when it all becomes too much for Capote and he begins to ignore Perry`s demands for attention, is he doing so out of indifference or disgust at himself for being so drawn to this person in the first place?  Is this fascination with Perry revealing dark truths about Capote that the man himself is unwilling or unable to acknowledge?  The film never answers those questions - as well it shouldn`t.<br /><br />Clifton Collins Jr. is also very powerful as Perry, providing the sensitivity and charisma the character needs to make the story convincing.  In a rich performance as Harper Lee, Catherine Keener serves as the moral center of gravity to which Capote must continually return in order to finish his work and maintain his grip on reality.<br /><br />In his first non-documentary film, Bennett Miller demonstrates remarkable control as a director.  His spare filmmaking style perfectly reflects not only the harsh Midwest setting but the chamber-like drama that is unfolding within it.  It is a very \\"interior\\" film, and Miller is not afraid to linger long on his scenes, allowing the actors free rein in establishing their rhythms and building the drama.<br /><br />Although come Oscar night, I will be rooting for Heath Ledger to take home the trophy (I believe his performance in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is the high point of acting in recent times), I will certainly understand it if the Academy chooses to honor Hoffman's work here instead.  It would definitely be my second choice.true simultaneously.  And what is so great about Hoffman's performance is that he builds on this ambiguity.

B00000I3JO|5.0|I have had this CD ever since it's release in 1989. Even at a young age, I was impressed by its maturity, its sense of heartache and longing, and the sparse beauty of the melodies. It spent a lot of time in my CD player that summer, droning out the sounds of the \\"Batdance.\\" It lay dormant for several years in my music collection until I rediscovered it again. It so perfectly creates a mood and atmosphere as one song ends and the next begins. It needs no accompaniments, and is even better when you're alone. It feels like an old friend, but one who still has mysterious aspects waiting for you to discover them. I don't generally attempt to wax poetic but this CD is worth the effort.
1863513418|3.0|If you don't have a lot of stumpwork or embroidery experience then I suggest this is not the book for you. While the designs are lovely and there are step by step instructions (and it is great value as it is two books combined in one), as a beginner myself I am now looking for something a little easier before tackling projects from this book again.
B000E6ENP8|5.0|First let me say that this movie is GREAT!! Second, to those who didn't like the movie, let's not forget that John and June themselves took part in this movie before their passing. And I have no doubt that they are very pleased with the outcome.
B0009ETD4G|4.0|This dvd follows a few of the strippers at Scores and outlines the familiar stuff of why they strip...what they do to stay in shape...how their families feel about their job...so on and so forth.  If you've seen one documentary on strippers, you've pretty much seen it all, and this sentiment is true of this dvd also. There's just nothing new here for those of us who've been in the business or around it.  I think this video would appeal to people who are looking to find out about strippers and what they do, but if you're looking for pure stripping action, you'll have to find other performance tapes.
B0009VY0OM|1.0|Vin is this tall, strong guy that looks like he can kick almost anyones ass  and Ice Cube is a short fat guy who looks like he could get his ass kicked by anyone.    are we actually supposed to believe that this fat out-of-shape short guy can jump off a building & grab onto a helicopter? give me a break.    At least someone like Wesley Snipes would've been believable.
B0006399FS|1.0|I havent really liked anything from U2 since the 1980's, but they have always had my respect as they have really tinkered around with different music styles over the years, and have a \\"couple\\" of good songs since the Joshua Tree, but nothing that would make me want to go out and buy their albums. \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is the worst thing that I have heard from the band. When \\"Virigo\\" was first released, I thought, Its not a bad song, maybe the next album that this single came off of will be pretty cool. I was dead wrong. Not only is the entire album horrible, (with the exception of one other song) U2 sounds like a train wreck. The album is painful slow and whiny, and every song sounds exactly the same. Well expect for the opening track which is at least somewhat upbeat. I mean this is even worse then sitting though REM's newer material, which is slow and whiny, but this takes the cake. I have no idea what the Grammies were thinking, which such artist as The Rolling Stones and Foo Fighters up for Grammies in the same catogories. Those bands are WAY more talented and at least thier newer albums aren't duds. I always thought that U2 were silghty above average musicans, but not they are really nothing special. The Edge isn't doing anything spectacular, and Bono is a good front man when hes not whining on this album. If U2 released a dud, this is it. Maybe its time to call it quits, or try to find the groove of \\"The Unforgetable Fire\\" again. Its your call on this one, I mean if you a die hard U2 fan, otherwise dont waste your money. Buy Blink 182 instead. A least its happy
B0007TKH66|4.0|This show, although good was not great during the first season. There were episodes which I thought were really good. There were five star episodes but the show really deserves a 41/2 stars but that is not an option. The DVD I bought was good, but sometimes it would jump a little on the screen. I am not sure what caused this but it seems that the company could have done a little better job recording the DVD's. However, I would recomend this show. It isn't the best Star Trek made but it still rocks. If you have not seen all the shows or if you are like me and want to enjoy the show without commercials it is well worth the money. It is also worth it because you can watch the to be continued episodes right after each other if you want.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Shockingly cruel scenes, extreme violence, and harsh language. Bravo! It's about time someone exposed the nature of humanity brooding beneath the thin skin of what we call civilization.<br /><br />A true, creative work of Art. Yeah, this film is all of these and a lot more. Tarantino reveals the violent nature of our age, the anger that we hide behind in the form of political correctness.<br /><br />pure genius<br /><br />Don't go looking for the story??? ... sounds like someone might have missed the boat. Maybe they were looking for the Titannic instead of the eight-foot canoe next to the dock. Actually, there is a very ancient and simple storyline at work here, the same one that worked for the cheesy Hong-Kong kung-fu movies of the 70s. The same one that worked for a lot of old westerns, namely the quest for revenge, in this case, a mother's revenge. The story is simple and traditional, but like all great stories, that is not where the art lies. The art is in the satirizing of violence itself, the art dwells in the subjective abstract. The violence is extreme to the point of absurd, just like revenge is absurd, or is it? Perhaps it just is, whether we choose to embrace it or reject it, human beings are absurdly violent. Perhaps this is what Tarantino is trying to tell us.
B00014NE62|5.0|I could go on for days extolling the virtues of this great film but so many reviews posted here have said it much better than I ever could. I will say this; in this year of the GREAT \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" and everyone talking about straight actors now being unafraid to play a Gay character we must not forget the  superb preformances of the three leads, especially the brilliant and devastating performance by Rupert Graves in this film which was made almost 20 years ago and please let's not forget the electrifying and Oscar winning performance of William Hurt in \\"Kiss of The Spider Woman\\" back in 1985. By the way, why isn't \\"Spiderwoman\\" out on DVD?
B00005EBPC|5.0|<br />    This album is packed with incredible technicality, perfect guitar riffs, amazing bass work and mind blowing vocals. Riff after riff, this is the center of attention, the guitar work. The drums makes a great contribution to the songs, with a non-stop change of tempos. This album along with \\"Character\\", are the Dark Tranquility's best in my opinion.
B0007GAERG|4.0|This is a very nice Mariah Carey album- it contains some very great ballads. although this album is not that Compelling its still very nice to listen too . some of these songs sound as if 10 year old Micheal Jackson was singing them- as in the tunes of the Vocals.    1.It's Like That- a really good song that has this really great beat and Infectious  lyrics. 9/10    2.We Belong Together- Amazing Lyrics and Beat- although some people might've thought that Mariah can sing cuz of this song(it's not true) she sang from her throat not her diaphram- along with most of the songs on this album. other than that The Best song on this Album 10/10    3.Shake it Off- A Nice Upbeat tune that you will find yourself singing it all day- althougha Great song- its one of those that you get tiered of in a month or 2 9/10    4.Mine Again- GREAT VOCALS, Amazing song- this is possibly my 2nd favorite song on the album- i hate the first 15 sec. but the rest of this song is WOW 9/10    5.Say Somethin'- Lame As$ song that shouldnt have even made it to earth, Scobby Doo or whatever his name is cant rap and he just made me hate the song even More.

B00007LTIB|4.0|Yes's \\"Relayer\\" seems to be the one album that is the least known, except for Die Hard Yes fans. Even though its no where near the greatness of \\"The Yes Album\\", \\"Fragile\\", and \\"Close to the Edge\\" it still is worth getting to add to your Yes collection. Its only has a handful of songs on it, and it seems to be written more in the style of \\"Close to the Edge\\" with complex songs and sheer energy. Even though its not perfect, its pretty damn good, and I cant recommend it enough for fans of Yes, and for those that aren't that familer with the band. Yes were the kings of progressive Rock, and this album, along with thier many others, will always be a classic.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly. There is and was only one. It is hard to describe the attraction of this film, yet it still captivates me every time I view it. I think it has something to do with the time and place when it was made, a carefree time that exists no longer and a time when new mores were coming into vogue. It has an IN quality about it, yet underneath it all, there remains a search for what life is really all about and what really makes us happy, in a fulfilling way, after all those cocktails have been downed and the cigarette smoke has cleared. I suppose there is some comment being made about the morality of the lifestyles of both Holly and Paul (George Peppard) Varjak. Both seem to subsist on the money of others (Holly from her numerous men friends and Paul from his older female sexual benefactor Patricia Neal). Hepburn gives her character a glossy veneer of sophistication and a detached indifference for meaningful love and relationships from the opposite sex. Peppard in a very good and underplayed performance seems to be her conscience even though he has a difficult time putting his own life in order. Through all the partying and merriment I found Buddy Ebsen's performance as Doc to be the most touching and moving. He seemed to represent a yearning for a much more simpler and tranquil lifestyle, truly loving his Holly to make it all complete. Ebsen's performance is heartbreaking, as he must leave his Holly in a world very foreign to him, leaving the void in his heart still empty on his journey back home. I think Peppard sees this and knows he must change his ways and also those of Holly for whom he is so attracted. This is a truly wonderful entertaining and rewarding film working on so many levels. Adding to the overall effect is Henry Mancini's timely score that is so vibrant, elegant and sentimentally moving and captures the essence of the story so satisfyingly.
B000002JS6|5.0|I don't know what some of you aholes are thinking, This is easily the best Ac/Dc album and one of the best rock albums of all time. The energy and emotion in the album stays constant throughout the album. Yes the songs may be simple, Yes Angus and Malcolm only use a few chords, but, they stick to their guns and came out victorious. This a good example of a band in dissaray and turning it around into something amazing. To everyone who denies it's greatness, F**k you, Ac/Dc is greater than any of your death metal bands, death metal is a piece of sh**. At least AC/DC didn't have to sell out to become great. Buy this album, give it a chance, and I promise you you'll like it.
B000BT97AO|2.0|Charmless and ineffective experiment by illustrator Dave McKean and  vastly overrated Douglas Adams clone Neil Gaiman. Who is this film for? What is it about? One is never sure. It just goes on and on, toying listlessly with commonly misconcieved   'fairy-tale' elements in ways that have been done better elsewhere, running in circles until it runs out of tropes and abruptly ends. The characters are flat, the writing self conscious and empty and the visuals eye-tiringingly cheesy and monotonous.
0790733226|4.0|I liked CONTACT a lot when I originally saw it in the theater and my opinion hasn't changed despite numerous viewings since I got the DVD. Apparently I'm not alone. Other reviewers have brought up a number of good reasons for their enthusiasm. Reasons such as top-notch acting, a thoughtful and thought-provoking story, and dramatic moments like the initial appearance of the alien signal and the destruction of the alien device.<br /><br />I'm on board with all of these observations. In particular, the intelligent treatment of the controversy that erupts over the human response is plausible. This is a more thoughtful scifi movie than most (not to take anything away from space operas), and that's a good thing. Beyond this, however, there are some things in CONTACT that are special for me that haven't been noted by others.<br /><br />First, there's the opening sequence. It begins with a view of earth floating in space. From there the camera seemingly falls away at an accelerating pace, zooming past the other planets in our solar system, flying backward to a position looking back at the Milky Wat galaxy. It's a breath-taking sequence and the DVD is worth having just for that alone.<br /><br />Then, there's the great scene when Jodie Foster's character enters the capsule and waits to go wherever she's going. \\"Good to go\\", she keeps repeating. \\"I'm good to go.\\" I can never watch this part of CONTACT without reflecting on what a terrifying yet exhilarating moment that would be. Foster's character has no idea where she's going (if she goes at all) or what she'll find when she gets there. It's the moment she's waited her whole life for, but she's facing the ultimate unknown. The scene is, for me, an incredible one and I never tire of seeing it.<br /><br />Finally, the trip Dr. Arroway finally goes on is visually gorgeous and emotionally satisfying. What happens is very much open to debate, but the journey is eye candy from beginning to end. The \\"contact\\" she makes is a nice culmination of her touching relationship with her father.<br /><br />I hesitate to call CONTACT a great movie, but it's certainly a very good one. It's one I'm happy to own and I strongly recommend it to you. Further, as I write this, it's selling here for just $9.99. That's a bargain in my book. Don't pass it up.nice culmination of her touching relationship with her father. <br /> <br />I hesitate to call CONTACT a great movie, but it's certainly a very good one.

B000002KB8|5.0|After much debate, and according to some reviewers, many claim that Black Sabbath didnt invent Heavy Metal. Other bands that have been thrown into the mix are Steppenwolf, Mountain, Led Zepplin, Henrix, and some other bands that were underground in the late 1960's and early 70's. I guess that we could all debate in who started it, but all the bands mentioned above, I cannot see ANY comparison to those bands and Black Sabbath. Lets just forget about the music for a minute, and go to the lyrics. No One at the time was writing music about Satan, Black Magic, Witches, and the Occult. Ok, The Stones wrote Symphony for the Devil, which one reviewer mentioned, and thats about as Heavy Metal as Britney Spears. The Stones werent Metal, but a combination of Country and Blues, with of course, Rock and Roll thrown it. Back to the Lyrical part though before I get to far off track. Lyrically, I believe they were doing what no other band was doing at the time, and even though musically, the first Black Sabbath record might have been more Blusey then anything, it would only take a few albums more in the 1970's to write some great Metal Material. IF Iron Man, War Pigs, Faries Wear Boots, Sweet Leaf, and Paranoid isnt Metal, then maybe you should check your ears. And of course, all of the Metal Bands that talk about them as influences never mention Mountain, Hendrix, Cream, or The Stones. Thats because these bands were GREAT rock bands but not Metal bands. IF we take another example, lets look at the band Venom. They were the first to invent \\"Black Metal\\"....yet Sabbath, Dio, Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden all put out albums before their 1981 classic. Yet Venom was the only band at that time to have that sound, people labeled it \\"Black Metal\\" and the rest is History. I guess some of us will always debate who invented Metal, but please give us a reason why you think Zepplin, The Stones, or any of the other bands mentioned in these debates have anything to do with Heavy Metal.

Best not watch movies on WW2 because Germany looses in all of them!

You will see this even more in saw2. \\"jiggsaw\\"\\" shows that you must have a near death experience to love life and charish it the way it should be.

The second chance is to get out of his games alive.<br /><br />its good and smartly written for the meaning behind it, because i'm tired of some of these remakes originality in hollywood writting must be at an all time low<br /><br />I just wanna say you have 2 types of people on amazon, the type who really likes something and the type who hates on everyone for liking it...<br /><br />Also Recommended: saw2, the village, skeleton key

B000BW7QWW|5.0|What Joss did for Buffy: The Vampire Slayer - bringing a failed movie to the small screen - he has done with Serenity.  Only reversed.  But with the same outstanding level of achievement. <br /> <br />Without diving into a rambling plot description that gives far too much away, Serenity is exactly what any Firefly or Whedon fan would want, and then some.  Love Firefly?  Then you'll wet your strides during Serenity.  All the fantastic elements that made that series and all of Whedon's TV endeavors so loved by fans are on full display here, only on a larger scale, with the antes severly upped. <br /> <br />Here we finally learn the dark secret that River (the stunning Summer Glau) had carried with her throughout the series and are introduced to the mysterious Operative, the Alliance's number one agent, played with force by Chiwetel Ejiofor.  The final act of the movie is pure exhiliration.  Intense.  The underlying themes resonate.  Smart dialogue permeates. Conflicts abound.  There is a darkness and an adultness here.  Nary a cliche in sight. <br /> <br />And fear not anyone who isn't familiar with the series.  Serenity wraps up the basics in the first two minutes of the film.  From there on in, it's prime Whedon.  Fun, fun, fun.  The signal marches on!    <br /> <br />The DVD includes insightful director commentary with Whedon, an introduction to the film by Whedon, deleted scenes and a fun gag reel.  <br /> <br />
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This is a must own collection for Romero fans, and even zombie fans.  This is one of the classic and greatest zombie films ever made with great story, remarkable effects by Tom Savini (given the era and budget of the film) and even interesting comments on our society and our obsession with material things.  The Ultimate edition is just that:  You get the theatrical version, The Director's cut (with some more scenes and gore, though George Romero has said that the theatrical is his \\"Director's cut\\"), the European version (made shorter by producer Dario Argento for Europe audiences) and a whole disc of extras including 2 in depth documenteries.  Each film also has its own commentary track which all are entertaining and interesting.  The packaging is nice and sturdy with a nice booklet packaged with it.  A great deal to own one of the best zombie movies made.  In my opinion this is only second to Romero's Day of the Dead film.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I'm listening to this album now. I would have rate 2 or 3 stars because it is simply another piece of mediocre pseudo-rawness, tolerable however. But just now I heard this song named \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" and I repeated it for three times and I got this conclusion. <br /> <br />THIS SINGLE SONG (MOSTLY ITS INTRO) IS THE MOST PATHETIC, CHEAP, SHAMELESS, RETARDED, WANNABE, INSULTING NIRVANA-RIP-OFF I'VE HEARD IN MY LIFE. JACK WHITE DON'T TELL ME YOU NEVER HEARD \\"RAPE ME\\".  <br /> <br />So, what I am doing here is rating one star(seems too high) because I witnessed an awful robbery.
0312330529|5.0|Let me start by stating that my favorite author is Rosamunde Pilcher.  So you can't get much farther away from hot tea on the Cornwall Coast than this book!  Reading the author's short bio on the back of the book sparked my interest enough to buy it.  I read it this past week as I was sick in bed and it certainly was a great use of the time.  There is a ton of action in this book if that is the kind of thing that interests you.  (I'm sure the upcoming movie will be a sure-fire hit with the action types).  For me the best part of this book was the characters - they are multi-dimisional people who you can't help but care about.  In partiuclar, Prabaker is someone who will stay with me for a very long time.  I also felt the sense of the Indian people and how loving they can be under the conditions in which they live.  I am grateful to Mr. Roberts for sharing this novel with us as I'm sure I'll never work up the courage to visit India myself.  Reading Shantaram was a very memorable week in my life and I intend on purchasing several copies of this book as gifts.

Why even come on to this site then? You all are SERIOUSLY so stupid!Britney IS really talented and she wrote almost every song on this cd. Take it for what it is. A fun dance cd!
1556587864|4.0|I hadn't seen this in a while until recently, & it still had me on my toes.  This came out when I was in high school, but I didn't see it until after I had graduated... but I remember the hype about it being \\"racy\\".  I really didn't know what to think of it at first... but after seeing it a few times, it grew on me.  Maybe it's the sex... or crime drama thriller... killers getting away with killing... or a combination of the above.  I remember hearing & reading about Stone's mixed-review performance beforehand, but after seeing it for myself, I personally thought it fit the character.  You can never really trust her, although at times you almost want to.  I hadn't even really seen Douglas in any movies before this.  If you liked this, than Fatal Attraction is a must see as well (I didn't see FA until after this one).  Throw in here a beautiful score by Jerry Goldsmith (which as a classical musician I noticed), as well what has become one of my favorite dance tracks since I heard it in high school, La Tour's \\"Blue\\" from the dance club scene with Roxy.<br /><br />As far as flaws, I have to agree with another reviewer about the realism of her antics as she's getting questioned.  What's wrong with these guys, & what really makes her so special?  They really haven't seen anything like her, as the polygraph guy says?  That's the main thing that bothered me, but it's a movie, & as long as you know that, don't take it too seriously.  There are lots of funny moments, esp. with Curran's friend Gus... \\"that's that magna cum laude ***** that done fried up your brain!\\"  I didn't know this was the same director as Starship Troopers & Showgirls, but this is by far better of the 3.  I think this is one of those movies where you either like it or you don't.  Again, movies aren't always supposed to be realistic, so just appreciate it for what it is.  Some movies keep you watching it more than once, & others don't... & you don't always have to have a valid reason why.  For me, this is just one of those movies :)is just one of those movies :)
B0000019PA|5.0|There are abstract albums. There are concept albums. There are confessional albums. There are albums about love, and albums about loss. Albums can be centered around disturbing childhood, or the demons that haunt the adult life. Albums can be narrative in nature, albums can be metaphorical. The list goes on and on. Most albums are one of these things, and many of them are quite good. Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is all of the above and more.    There is little I can say about this record that hasn't been said 200 times before. This is the most polarizing record in my collection. People either worship it or abhor it. There is no middle ground. Jeff Mangum's off-key vocals, often nonsensical lyrics, and odd song structures will have one either reveling or reviling his music.    There are few other records that can encompass such a variety of my personal moods, as well. The title track is for sunny days, feeling chipper and ready to sing in my car as loud as I can. \\"Oh Comely\\" takes in the days I'm feeling sinister, low, or need to hear something bleaker than I feel. \\"Holland, 1945\\" can cheer me up almost regardless of whatever else is going on in my life.     I know every word on this album, but I won't pretend to know what half of them mean, or even speculate on Mangum's intended message. Time travel seems to be key to understanding at least a few of the twisted lyrical passages, as well as his intense remorse over the life and death of Anne Frank (his reading of her diary between the making of On Avery Island and this record profoundly moved him).     The bottom line is this: enough people love and hate this record to almost demand the formulation of an opinion on it. And for your sake, I hope you love it, because it is amazing.
B00003CXUM|4.0|I would strongly recommend the readers to get the DVD with extra features in it.  After watching the \\"Interview with the Director\\", then, we would come to appreciate more the subtleties in this movie.  To put it simply, the Chinese title for this movie was \\"Hua Yan Yuan Hua\\" which implied \\"the flower at its gloriest moment\\".  For some, it's interpreted as a woman's finest moment but for the Director, it meant two things, Hong Kong's finest hour (Director's nostalgia towards the 60's when he was growing up as part of the Shanghainese community in Hong Kong escaping from Cultural Revolution in mainland China) and the finest hour between Maggie and Tony's characters.  To get the \\"look\\" in the movie, he scouted for locations in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Cambodia.  He also explained the rationale behind \\"2046\\" and that some scenes from that movie was shot simultaneously together with \\"In the Mood for Love\\".  It's more due to logistics rather than creative interest.  He was not afraid to admit the argument that he had with Tony and Maggie on how to portray the characters through gestures rather than dialogues, and the necessity of doing this movie with a \\"point of difference\\" when there were already many other movies made about affairs.  Then, there were clues been left for the viewers to understand that time was moving on with different vegetables and dishes been consumed by the Shanghainese in different seasons of the year in the movie.  It's also quite interesting to note that this movie evolved from another movie that he originally wanted to do about food, and involving three different group of people only to be refined into this one particular story subsequently.  Obviously, the Director had enormous passion and love for this movie and he specified that if he didn't set a target to show this at the Cannes as a closure, this movie would have gone on forever.  Without a doubt, the framing, the intimate angles and close-ups, the lighting, the composition of the movie layered with the \\"Yumeji\\" soundtrack (Dreamlike) followed the rhythmic movement of the actor and actress scene were achingly beautiful to watch.  Don't be startled when he indicated that he was inspired by Kurosawa who was specific about details and in this instance, he wanted to emulate that through subtleties but the clues were always there.  Some friends of mine found this movie daft and boring because of the thin storyline: two persons converged together to cope for the infidelity of the spouses and yet, they found love from one another and was never meant to be.  Then again, God is in details.  Perhaps, it's a visualist movie and not meant for everybody's liking at the first place.  All I know is that I love it and that's enough.  I think it's ideal to watch this movie with no expectation in the beginning but soon after, with commentaries given by the Director, then, we would be able to see this movie from a new light.  Highly recommended and one of my top pick of the year.  An unmissable experience.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Hung Up is with out a doubt one of her most classic dance tunes already! Its just so hot! I wish the rest of the cd was that hot! It comes close tho... Some songs just sound too serious though to be considered a really dance tune. Isaac and Like It or Not just dont do it for me. They just dont have the fun vibe like the rest of the cd. But still really great cd by Ms M! Long live the Queen!
6304578482|5.0|This movie was actually a LOT better than I thought it would be.  I watched it on TV out of mere curiousity, esp. since my own reunion wasn't too far off at the time.  It really does make anyone reflect on their high school days & wonder what really has changed.  Romy & Michele \\"like totally\\" remind me of the relationship I had with my best friend & how we were like in high school... best friend loners that just wanted to be noticed and accepted.  The thing that always blew my mind was that for some reason, there were only the select few that were \\"popular\\", but who really gives them that position, only for it to not to even matter after graduation?  Other than just mere wishing, I never actually tried to be apart of the \\"in\\" crowd, I was too busy being a band nerd, & that was what my high school life was centered on so I wouldn't have to dwell with the social aspects.  Even still, I tried so hard to be the best, which I succeeded in, but what was I really doing it for, myself, or for everyone else's approval?  That's exactly what Romy & Michele want is approval, & they're gonna try as hard as they can to get it...only to realize, what were they actually doing it for in the first place?  I think a LOT of people can relate to this.  Another question still weighs my mind... \\"What's the point of going if we're not gonna impress people?\\"  For the most part, you should go to a reunion because you want to, not just to impress people... but wouldn't it be nice at the same time to make someone gasp at your envious life?  Just for the record, I did have mine, but I didn't go because of various (convenient) conflicts.  If I did go, I at least wanted to talk & reflect with those classmates of mine (mostly in band) that actually did make that difficult period worth while.<br /><br />Kudrow & Sorvino make a cute, awesome pair...I can't really think of anyone else able to pull off their characters as well.  Janeane Garofalo's character is equally amusing with her uber sarcastic comments.  There are so many funny scenes & memorable lines, like the hilarious \\"Oh Ramon\\" scene, esp. when she says \\"you wanted it to be believable\\"....yes, smile if you wish.  Romy had her voice all too well planned out for when she announces: \\"I invented post-its\\".  Then when they try to impress the A crowd, you can't help but laugh when Michele says \\"We're not the ones who got fat,\\" or \\"I hope your babies look like monkeys!\\"  Very very silly, but you can't help but laugh and agree.  You also can't help but feel for the girls' relationship, like when Romy realizes that they can't accessibly find new jobs & boyfriends in 2 weeks, & Michele says in her encouraging voice, \\"But I thought you said we could?\\", & then later she also tells her \\"I thought high school was a blast\\", referring to the fact that it was a blast because of Romy... which I totally related to.  And who can't help but love the 80's tunes!<br /><br />The main drawback to the movie is the audience it caters to... which, of course, is female.  I even made my mom watch it, and she liked it.  I certainly have never met any men who have admitted to watching it, but I'm sure some could find it enjoyable once they get past the girly-ness.  It does seem overly girly at times, like all the fashion talk (I'm not much of a fashion buff myself), but this is overlooked for me because I'm always drawn to the various points the movie makes, like how it pokes fun at stereotypes & how materialistic society is.  Quite possibly I liked it so much because I related to the characters, and if you don't relate to the characters, you might not \\"get it\\"... or maybe you will.  In a way, they reminded me of female versions of Beavis & Butthead... where they're in their own world, one's smarter, but they still have lots of witty things to say.  Who knows, it may have been really boring if the girls had been extremely intelligent... but who cares, it was fun the way it was.  Either way, even though the movie may seem silly & simple on the outside, on the inside is a lot of laughs & thoughts to stay with you through each viewing.  Highly recommended!!& simple on the outside, on the inside is a lot of laughs & thoughts to stay with you through each viewing.  Highly recommended!! <br />
0131479415|5.0|We use estimating and planning practices from this book every day, that's how I know that they work.  There's no 'one right way' to do anything, so it's cool that the book gives alternatives to choose from.  Some chapters in the book can get complex, for example, those on prioritizing.  But most of it is straightforward, with helpful examples.  I've also applied some of the practices explained by the author on projects at companies that aren't doing 'agile', and they worked there too.  You won't regret buying this book, and it won't just sit on your shelf gathering dust.
0140131558|5.0|Not the usual novel or detective story, The characters exist in a different dimension than those in other books and you keep trying to pull back the curtain to see them but just as you do, you spot them leaving by the back door. <br />A true mystery I think. Exhiliarating and cuts through the muck of the modern world, while putting that muck front and center. <br /> <br />I read the City of Glass first and then found out it was the first of a trilogy. Get all three. Read them in order. Now I have to go back and start over. <br />I want to read all his other books, but afraid of being disappointed. No one could do this again? <br /> <br />I should say I don't usually like \\"experimental\\" novels with no plot. There is a very compelling story here. I want to know how he did it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This cd is so awesome! Its the first time Britney really re-invented herself. Slave is truly the HOTTEST song EVER! Nice work Brit...
B00005JOFO|5.0|I had no expectations when I went to see this film.  I was completely blown away.  The worst part was that I couldn;t get the film out of my head.  I read somewhere that the author of the short story had the same problem, she said that it took a while for the characters to leave her.  I can understand why.  This movie brought back alot of memories and feelings in me that lay dormant.  No other film has done that to me ever. The music was appropriate, the cinematography was breathtaking, and the acting and directing was superb.  The best thing about this movie is that the it really doesn't hit you during the film, it hits you really hard right after.  I watched the film a third time with a friend of mine who said she enjoed it.  The next day, she told me that she kept thinking about the film and it had affected her later.  That to me is the mark of a great film, not only is it good when you watch it but it gets better afterwards.  I think I will be thinking about this movie for a long time.  It will be very hard for me to see it again.
B000BO0LLS|4.0|This is no doubt this is an excellent album - circles, stay the night, and FLAB are clear standouts.  Indeed, it is her most consistent album since her debut. <br /> <br />The problem is the deteriorating voice.  Really, if you listen closely to all her CD's the damage is noticeable from the Daydream album - her voice begins to be raspier, and sounds stiffer when it modulates. The power also began to die with Daydream - compare her Fantasy concert to that of MTV Unplugged and particularly Here is Mariah Carey. <br /> <br />It is fair to say that Mariah's voice has really had 3 phases -  <br />1990-1994 (flawless) <br />1995-2001 (loss of power and clarity on the high chest notes (e.g., notice how she struggles in Diva's live to compete with Aretha on \\"Chain of Fools\\"), but still relatively polished live performances) <br />Post glitter (no ability to belt in the chest region, airy vocals particularly when live, often out of tune in live performances). <br /> <br />Glitter is often looked upon as her downfull, but vocally, it was actually her best album since Music box although far inferior to Music box (notice how on Glitter she is relatively clear on the high chest notes in Lead the Way and Never too Far away).  I'm not sure what she did to herself on those post breakdown days that destroyed her voice. <br /> <br />As her grammy performance shows, I hope if Mariah is reading this she retires from performing live unless she can do something to fix that voice.  It's not that her performances are objectively terrible, but if she keeps performing live people will forget that she once was known for her voice.   <br /> <br />I suspect her only choice is to see a surgeon to remove those nodules and ensure that she spends more time with a vocal coach to prevent their reoccurrence
B00079FUI6|5.0|This is seriously the best show on tv! I didnt think it looked very appealing but I bought the first season any way and I am telling you I was hooked til I finished every episode. Just when you think it cant get any better it does! Every episode is amazing, loaded with suspense and humor. Its hot hot hot!
0307276902|4.0|I found this book interesting after watching all the hype about the controversy over it on TV and I must say I did enjoy this book despite all the saying that it was stretched BUT I will tell you someone out there has went through this EXACT thing it may not have been James Frye but it has been SOMEONE and I would suggest this to everyone to read to mix up your usual taste in your reading genre it makes you think and it also makes you thankful for what you may have or not have in your life so to all the nay sayers all I have to say is open up and don't be so judgemental on this one
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This is one of her best CDs in years. Jermaine Dupri and other producers along with Mariah Carey, helped make this CD very successful. I highly recommend this CD. Mariah Carey has evolved and added a new twist to her style. If you are looking for the old Mariah Carey, you won't find it here. I'm really not a Mariah Carey fan, but really enjoy this CD.
B000002LND|5.0|Into the Groove, Vogue, Like A prayer, Material Girl, Like A Virgin, Express Yourself, Holiday...nuff said!
B0000028M7|5.0|The best album recorded in the 1990s. Period. <br /> <br />Alice In Chains' \\"Dirt\\" was so far apart from the rest of the Seattle sound, thus being head and shoulders above all the others. I know Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" was what started the sonic revolution known as Grunge, but it does not hold half the substance and quality DIRT contains. DIRT is a masterpiece that can withstand the test of time because the themes of DIRT(death, drugs, sickness, and sadness) will be obstacles prevelant in humanity until the end of time.  <br /> <br />The music is so heavy; dwelling in the dark, murky areas of human emotions. The only song that doesn't fit in is \\"Rooster\\", and the reason I say that is because Rooster is a song about survival. When all hope seems lost and everyone else around you is dying, you find the strength to persevere through adversity. The themes on DIRT coincide with the order in which the songs are played. The first four tracks-Them Bones, Rain When I Die, Dam That River, and Down in a Hole are all about misery, and hopelessness. They set up the next theme-drugs and the intense hell they bring about-from Sickman, Junkhead, Dirt, God Smack, Iron Gland, Hate to Feel, Angry Chair, and finally \\"Would?\\", a song with a glimmer of hope that promises redemption-\\"If I could, would you?\\". The songs and themes set up a hidden storyline: sadness and depression leads you to drugs, which only leads you to rock bottom, after you have acheived the absolute lowest is when you can begin your ascension back to the top. <br /> <br />My personal favorite on this album is \\"Would?\\". With its thundering bass line, and intoxicating sound, it alone will put you in an altered-state. <br /> <br />Layne Staley's lyrics may be a psychiatrist's dream job, but his vocals are phenomenal. His tortured screams and haunting chants are what sets this album apart from anything else I have ever heard. You can feel the emotion in his voice, you feel the torment in his soul. Listen carefully to the eerie prophecies that are the lyrics in \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Rain When I Die\\", and \\"Down In A Hole\\". Prophecies that Layne ultimately fulfills when he is found a decomposed corpse on his couch, an apparent Heroin overdose from being surrounded by intraveinous drug paraphenalia. What is so remarkable is that everything from DIRT is fulfilled--he died all alone, rotting in his own exile and decay. <br /> <br /> Also, this was the last album recorded with original bassist Mike Starr, which in my opinion is what led to A.I.C.'s demise. When Starr left, the energy he brought with him left also. Although Mike Inez was a very skilled musician, he was a business decision and never really seemed to fit with the band.  <br /> <br />If you had only $15 bucks in your pocket, was stranded in the desert, dying of starvation and someone offered you the choice of buying a meal or Alice In Chains' \\"Dirt\\", you should buy \\"Dirt\\". <br /> <br />Its that damn good.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Ok enough of all you retards who have no life and dont even buy this cd and talk crap about it. You really need to get a life and stop b----ing about Britney. If you dont like her why are you even reviewing this cd? You obviously have waaaaay too much time to waste so you come to whine about her here. It's time for everyone to shut the hell up! This cd rocks! Every song is hot and so fun to listen to and it makes for the perfect workout mix. The two new songs are really good too! So to all the lame haters, you suck, go find somewhere else to whine. To everyone else this cd is hot!
B0009QZ4CE|5.0|You know, for \\"geezer\\" fans like me who have already bought \\"Godbluff\\" and many, many other prog classics over the decades twice or more as new improved formats become available, these reissues are starting to get annoying.  That is until we pull the shrink wrap off and experience again everything that made these recordings worth our investment of time and money in the first place.<br /><br />I am not completely familiar with the full story of \\"Godbluff,\\" but I do believe that this was their 1973 \\"comeback\\" album, after a brief break-up; singer/songwriter Pete Hammill had become wrapped up in his solo career, while keyboardist/drummer/sax-flautist Hugh Banton/Guy Evans/David Jackson retreated to Italy (where VDGG was a #1 chart-topping act) to record their interesting but not-spectacular \\"Long Hello\\" album.<br /><br />Reuniting with \\"Godbluff,\\" the quartet roared to life again in a HUGE way with this (skimpy by modern CD standards) 40 minute reaffirmation of their collective power.  All four tracks are lucid, mighty testaments to the visionary talents of Hammill and company, but I most especially want to direct your particular attention to the track that scorches with the most frightful intensity: ARROW, track 3 (1st cut side two for us LP era neanderthals).<br /><br />This is STRONG stuff, here folks, and not in a profane or cartoonish death-metal sort of way.  Rather, it's all intensity and execution, starting with the fade-in bass & drum intro, skipping along nervously as Jackson's sax bleats in over the top to add some high-plateau drama to the soundscape.  The musical suggestion of traveling by horseback across a barren landscape is evoked vividly before a single word is sung.  Banton's Fender Rhodes (probably Hammill-there is NO GUITAR in this song) joins to bring this atmospheric stage-setter to a close, settling down to a sinuous opening statement of the song's theme, sustaining the final note like a snake poised on a desert stone waiting to strike--<br /><br />Enter Hammill, roaring: \\"Stub towers in the distance, riders cross the blasted moor against the horizon.\\"  Simply transcribing the line can hardly invest it with the skullcrushing force of Hammill's delivery, in surely the most extreme match of material and performance of his career.  \\"Arrow\\" is 9:47 of pure blood & thunder on trampling hooves, with Hammill riding high in the stirrups and screaming into the maelstrom, \\"what a crawl against the slope, dark loom the gallows--one touch to the chapel door, how swiftly comes the arrow.\\"<br /><br />And of course the band is at full gallop alongside Hammill, with Jackson & Evans stomping mercilessly with massed saxaphone & percussion.  Save for a brief synthesizer break (fully in accord with the near-panic mood established at Hammill's first words), Hugh Banton keeps well to the background, but with the other three wailing at \\"11,\\" the restraint becomes a valuable contribution in its own right.<br /><br />Van Der Graaf, as I am again obliged to state, is NOT for everyone, and \\"Godbluff\\" (like their other CLASSIC record, \\"Pawn Hearts\\") is almost sure to scare off timid or casual listeners.  To unattuned ears, it's rough, Hammill's voice is not \\"pretty\\" in the Michael Bolton sense, although Hamill was definitely capable of it.  Here I recommend their second record, \\"The Least we can Do is Wave to Each Other\\" as a starting point for curious listeners; Hammill's voice is beautiful by any standard, especially on the plaintive \\"Refugees,\\" a song that some movie director will eventually make a gigantic hit with when he leases it for his soundtrack.<br /><br />Still for those adventurous enough to try something with some real brains & brawn, you've definitely stepped up to the Phd. level here.  Van Der Graaf were not looking for chart-topping smashes, they were (are) artists fortunate enough to be chasing their muse at a time when commerce favored musicians in that pursuit.  For those of us coming of age during that late '60'searly '70's flowering of progressive rock, we now have a rich and vast body of work to discover (or rediscover) and reflect on for the rest of our lives.  Including among many others but with special distinction, the great Van Der Graaf Generator, who after a 20 year hiatus have now fired it up again to release yet another reunion CD, \\"Present,\\" now available on Amazon...<br /><br />Let's give the last word to Peter, reflecting in his unique way on our mayfly existences; \\"How long the night is, why is this passage so narrow?  How strange my body feels, impaled upon the arrow!\\"age during that late '60's early '70's flowering of progressive rock, we now have a rich and vast body of work to discover (or rediscover) and reflect on for the rest of our lives.

B0000033P0|4.0|This album was released in 1971 and marks the point at which ELP decided to tackle a large scale composition in the form of Tarkus.  Apparently, Greg Lake had problems with the piece and felt it was over the head of the average listener - he eventually was convinced and ended up co-authoring several of the sections.  The 20'35 minute Tarkus suite has been declared by many academic musicologists as the finest example of progressive rock on record.  They usually cite the sophisticated quartal harmony (based on the interval of a perfect fourth) and bitonality, which lends it a very edgy and dramatic feel.  Although Keith Emerson is a musician of astonishing virtuosity and a superb composer, as a bassist I am drawn to Greg Lakes bass playing and Carl Palmers drumming.  They are really locked in on the Tarkus suite and I think it is some of Greg's best playing since his performance on the debut by King Crimson, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969).  With respect to the shorter pieces on the album, I generally liked the playful Jeremy Bender and the piece Bitches Crystal, and loved the pipe organ introduction to The Only Way along with the jazzy section and rolling acoustic piano work.  Infinite Space is also incredible and appears to reiterate themes from the Tarkus suite (at least to my ears), while A Time and a Place is a heavier piece that features some great drumming by Carl and positively wild organ and moog synthesiser work.  Unfortunately, I really could have done without the album's silly closing track, the raucous ode to producer Eddy Offord \\"Are you ready Eddy\\" and the Jerry Lee Lewis inspired boogie-woogie piano.  Maybe I just don't have a sense of humor but Jerry Lee Lewis on an ELP album just sounds out of place - especially given the heaviness and dark mood of the album.  All in all, this is another defining moment in English progressive rock and is highly recommended to those interested in exploring the style.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh soars to stratospheric emotional heights in this CD, always maintaining the melodic integrity of the songs he chooses through his simple, sensitive vocals. The pieces he sings here in other languages are just as enticing, both to the heart and the ear, as his performances in English. The strength of his vocal talent is matched perfectly by a musical soul aged well beyond his years.
B00024YVJU|5.0|German progressive space rock band Eloy perfected the combination of spacey, atmospheric synthesizer work and a thunderous rhythm section on this 1977 album, which many Eloy fans consider to be their best work.  This concept album details the rise and fall of Atlantis through four longish pieces including the 11'42 Poseidons Creation; Incarnation of Logos (8'23\\"); Decay of logos (8'17\\"); and the final track \\"Atlantis' Agony at June 5th 8498 13 p.m. Gregorian Earthtime\\" (15'38\\").  The musicians on this album are excellent and include Neil Peart influenced drummer Jurgen Rosenthal, bassist Klaus Matziol (he uses a full-sounding trebly Gibson thunderbird bass that really lends added punch), keyboardist Detlev Schmidtchen (Arp and Moog synths, Hammond organ, and mellotron, and finally bandleader Frank Bornemann on lead vocals and electric/acoustic guitar.  Although this has been stated by many other folks when discussing this band, it is worth reiterating that Frank sings in English with a very heavy accent.  I personally don't mind it one bit but some people have been especially unforgiving.  The music itself alternates between very spacey, synthesizer led passages and heavier sections dominated by the powerhouse rhythm section of Jurgen and Klaus.  The compositions are all quite good and develop according to a well thought out logic, with wonderful melodies and enough sprightly ensemble work to keep most proggers entertained.  The lyrics are very cosmic and add to the overall 1970s charm of the album.  This EMI remastered album is quite good, and boasts nice color photos spread throughout and excellent sound quality - unfortunately the (copious) liner notes are in German so I have absolutely no clue what is being said.  Although copy control technology was used on the remastered album, playback problems have not been a problem for me.  All in all, this is a great album and a personal favorite.  Recommended as a good starting point for exploring this great band.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time if you havent seen it buy it or rent it  <br />This is a story of a man being in prison for a crime that he did not commit and how he makes friends on the inside and then his friends and him finallly get the proof of his innocense watch this movie  <br /> <br />Highly Recomended
B000BJS4SU|5.0|John Mayer is an incredible guitarist, no doubt about it.  Some reviewers are actually claiming that as a reason not to like him!  Agreed, many good guitar players were self-taught, but how refreshing to hear a GREAT guitar player who actually understands what he's playing!  Enough ranting...on to the music. <br /> <br />This CD is not what you expect from John Mayer.  It is, however, John Mayer.  Explanation follows: <br /> <br />This CD is not particularly radio-friendly as every song on every one of his previous CDs has been.  They are all, however, in the usual extremely well-written, well-played, well-sung John Mayer style.  This is John Mayer getting back to the roots of what he loves.  There's nothing wrong with writing radio-friendly songs, which he excels at, but this album shows that he is an amazing blues musician with a great love for the blues.  This is not a far cry from his other material, which is always obviously blues-influenced.  It has simply removed all the \\"pop\\" frills. <br /> <br />Here's the disclaimer: Mr. Mayer's voice is not particularly well-suited to the style in which he is trying to sing.  He is a very talented vocalist, but his voice seems out of its element.  His guitar, on the other hand, is a whole different story. <br /> <br />An excellent player backed up by equally amazing musicians in Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino combine to create some incredible music.  Teenage girls: you won't like this one, go back to your boy bands.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|It is often said that there are flicks, movies, and films.  If this hack phrase is true, then The Good, the Bad and the Ugly surely fall into the last category.  This is much more than a John Wayne Western you might find on AMC every day.  These characters are rich and full.  You find that even the Good is not so good, which is wonderful.   <br /> <br />I must be honest and tell you that I liked the Sergio Leone \\"Once upon a Time in the West\\" more, but his work is incredible.  From the first shot the the man staring into the lens, you can tell this will be something different.  Add a score that is wonderful, my favorite being the orchestration in the cemetary, and you have cinema gold.   <br /> <br />Whether or not you enjoy westerns, fans of film will enjoy this classic, as well as a very young Eastwood and a brilliant Wallach.  Fans of Kurosawa will find similarities in certain characters.  The shining example of the spaghetti western.
B000777J2S|2.0|\\"Yes, this album isn't for those used to top 40\\" <br /> <br />Just because someone finds the overly syrupy, oh-so-tired coy shy meek morrissey trip a little more than past its due date, doesn't necessarily mean they listen to Black Eyed Peas. <br /> <br />Furthermore, I've listened to this album in passing (I skimmed through it) and there was nothing engaging about it for me.. that's usually a bad sign in my books, as I always give most albums a few shots (ie: Fiery Furnaces - Blueberry Boat) and let them grow on me.  Well, I've tried and tried... if it ain't love at first sight, just move on. <br /> <br />Hey, personally call it a phase but I'd much rather put on some music where it sounds like the band members have grown a pair, Boris?  Deerhoof?  Boredoms?  hell, even Xiu Xiu manages to prove engaging AND emotionally genuine.
B000000W5P|5.0|The one half of this album confirmed everything the punks were saying about them at the time, and the other half outrocks the Pistols.  So just cue up \\"Faraway Eyes,\\" \\"When the Whip Comes Down,\\" \\"Respectable,\\" \\"Lies\\" and \\"Shattered\\" and then attempt to remain seated.  Wyman said it's the first album they ever did with the bass recorded right.  Indestructible.
6305313687|5.0|This is a movie about how life's experiences can create you, break you and change you.  It is a story about a family and it's struggles to survive in a world that not fair or kind. When forced to confront their choices to choose violence and hate to cope with difficult life situations the outcome becomes tragic. <br /> <br />It is very difficult to see and hear the hatedred that is so powerfully portrayed in this film and even more difficult to think that this hate can be alive today.  This is a film that takes moviemaking beyond entertaining.  This movie teaches, changes minds and makes people think.  The images and story will stay with you long after the film ends.  Edward Norton is excellent and has once again proven that he is a great actor.

0156027321|2.0|Many parts of Life of Pi are well written and Martel has a unique writing voice. This story lagged in the middle and about halfway through the book, I was hoping that either a shark would eat Pi, the tiger would drown or they would both get rescued. The book is definitely based on a good idea and it sticks with the reader. However, the book wasn't worth my time and I don't understand all the hype about it.
B000002KMV|4.0|Controversy, the follow-up to his masterpiece 'Dirty Mind' functions as a bridge between that album and the techno-heavy '1999'. This is in my opinion his most underrated album. It's enjoyable from start to finish. True not all the tracks are great (Annie Christian for example) but they all have their place on this strange yet very fun album. This album also features two of the greatest songs he's ever written namely 'Do Me Baby' and the title track. For those of you only familiar with these songs from the single versions you are in for a real treat to hear the full uncut versions. This album ranks in my top three favorite Prince albums. Get it.
0446577383|1.0|I was a Baldacci fan until I read this book. However, his page after page of Anti-American, pro-Muslim preaching and juvenile political rhetoric finally got to be just too much of a distraction. His book ended up in the trash and his name off my must buy list. Very sad, the plot had much promise but could not compete with the rhetoric.
B000062YB1|5.0|Seasons in the Abyss was Slayer's last studio recording with original drummer Dave Lombardo and alas their last great album. As many others have pointed out this album combines the speed elements of 'Reign in Blood' with the slower more melodic material of 'South of Heaven'. 'War Ensemble' is a perfect example of the former while 'Dead Skin Mask' is a great example of the later. In my opinion this is Slayer's second best album, just behind the mammoth 'Reign in Blood'. The only thing keeping this album from being perfect is that it contains some filler in the form of 'Skeletons of Society' and 'Temptation'. Everything else is fantastic with 'Spirit in Black' and the title track being two of my personal Slayer favorites. If you are already a Slayer fan you most likely already have this album. If you are new to the band then I highly suggest you make this your first, second or concurrent Slayer purchase along with 'Reign in Blood'.

0694003611|5.0|Clearly this was my daughter's favorite as evidenced by her requesting this nightly read for 4 months in a row. Further evidence of the quality is that I actually enjoyed reading it to her for 121 consecutive nights. <br /> <br />Fun story, great illustrations, catchy and precise prose, sturdy board book, all composed to a gradual winding down that has my daughter sleepy and ready for bed when we finish.  <br /> <br />What more can you ask for in a bed time book? <br />
0679777547|3.0|On the cover of this book there is printed a review that claims this novel to be a \\"beach book for intellectuals\\". Well, it is definitely a pleasant beach read; however, I think this particular reviewer fluffs the ego of its audience...<br /><br />It is a typical \\"dude-lit\\" thriller - sprinkled with some supposedly high-brow reflections on the world of literature and books. There are two parallel story lines - one concerning the Three Musketeers by Dumas and the other dealing with a fictious 17th-century occult classic that can be used to summon Lucifer himself. The two stories are interwoven, but in a rather artificial and contrived way. Moreover, when the finale is reached, the mystery of the two parallel stories reaches a disappointing collapse.<br /><br />However, the protagonist - Lucas Corso - is quite a fun fellow to take us through the motions. His mercenary lifestyle as a book dealer makes for entertaining reading, and his \\"inner turmoil\\" albeit a bit cliche for the genre, is quite touching at times.<br /><br />The language is often terribly cheesy... There are several over-the-top descriptions such as \\"her blue eyes were as warm as a Scandinavian fjord at three in the morning\\" and a female character's hips are likened to the midnight sun that never sets and can bear little blond Erics and Siegfrieds. Furthermore, there is constant mention of pretty female legs and busts along with non--stop referrals to the protagonist's drinking habits. Yes, we get it - he drinks gin. A lot.<br /><br />On the other hand, the descriptions of book collecting, classic novels and the way such are preserved were quite interesting. Reading about incunabula, woodcuts, Moroccan leather and parchment versus linen, one gets the urge to reach in and take a feel and have a sniff of this world. I learned a lot of trivia - such as the fact that current cellulose books don't last much more than 60 years!<br /><br />All in all, a decent thriller with the expected \\"unexpected\\" twists and turns. I saw the Roman Polanski movie based on part of this novel right afterwards, and even though it stars everybody's favorite actor, Johnny Depp, it is quite bad. I would recommend the book - even though it is best suited in a cheap paperback binding...ased on part of this novel right afterwards, and even though it stars everybody's favorite actor, Johnny Depp, it is quite bad.

B00005JM8V|5.0|After the Holocaust most survivors' chose for their memories to remain unspoken. They opted to repress the horror and move on with what remnant of life they could. Fortunately, their silence did not persist, for if it did, enemies of humanity who choose to falsify and revise history, declaring the Holocaust never existed, would be armed with devastating ammunition...\\"where is the victims' testimony?\\".   <br /> <br />With Shoah we finally get to hear, en masse, the devastating account of civilization's most heinous crime. While every memory of the horror cannot be captured, most, like the unfortunate lives consumed in the madness, are lost for ever. Yet gratefully we have this document to mark society beginning to come to terms with and document honestly what humanity is capable of. <br /> <br />As the last survivors are rapidly dying off with age, soon we will be without first hand witnesses.  Thankfully through Shoah and other efforts,  we are documenting and preserving in perpetuity the Holacaust to forever encase the evidence in an envelope of truth and righteousness where it forever belongs. Let  Shaoh along with Yad Vashem, The Sorrow and the Pity, and the precious few other venues of masterpiece historical documentation persevere. They have captured the immense odiousness, horror, insanity, and pure evil that humanity is capable of and should not only never be forgotten but taught to all presently and for posterity so all of humanity can bear witness. Only through dedicated vigilance to awareness can we hope to avoid recurrence.   <br />

B00005JLTN|2.0|The 2nd and 3rd Matrix films should never have been made. In fact, they can put you off the 1st if you're not careful. The best advice I had from a friend was to ignore the fact that these sequels had ever been made. You will be amazed how much more of an amazing experience it is to watch the original Matrix - which was a true classic.

B00003CXAW|4.0|Okay, I'm ashamed to admit it, but I saw Peter Jackson's remake of \\"King Kong\\" before I saw the 1933 original.  I went into Jackson's remake hoping for something epic, daring, scary, and adventurous.  When I came out of the theater, I received some good things such as genuine action sequences, nice cinematography, and mediocre acting.  Yet, the bad outweighed the good and I came out of the theater with a headache from all the special effects and preposterous situations the characters in the film were in. <br /> <br />I decided I had to watch the original \\"King Kong\\" if I could ever compare the two films.  After finally buying the film, sitting through it, and liking it, I realized that big computer generated images are really overrated.  The stop-motion animation in this film is outstanding especially for its time.  Although it looks a tad dated now, it still holds up well and is one of the great reasons to see this movie. <br /> <br />Carl Denham (played by a perfect Robert Armstrong) is trying to make a movie.  He gets together a crew and sets out for a remote Skull Island on a boat.  There he will shoot his picture.  Along for the ride is Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), a down-on-her-luck woman who is in need of money.  Carl hired her for his picture and she's eager to begin her adventure.  Also, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot) is on the ship where he and Ann begin to have feelings for each other.  Once the ship reaches Skull Island, they meet the natives who immediately take Ann to be sacrificed to \\"Kong\\", who used to be known only as a superstition to the sailors, but turns out to be true.   <br /> <br />Kong, a 25 foot ape, takes Ann away and the crew sets out to find her and bring her back.  They actually succeed in capturing Kong, where they try to showcase him in New York.  He breaks loose of course and chaos ensues as he looks for the love of his life, Ann... <br /> <br />The story at its time was original, fresh, and exciting.  Today, the story has been done so many times, but it's still an enjoyable experience.  Yet, it really isn't the story that stands out the most, but the characters that help to flesh it out. <br /> <br />Fay Wray does a pretty good job as Ann.  All she does most of the time is scream or fall into the arms of Jack, yet that's what the role asks of her.  Bruce Cabot at first came off too stereotypical.  He plays the handsome, rugged, yet gentle hero Jack and does a fine job.  Yet, the standout performance here goes to Robert Armstrong.  I'm sorry Jack Black, but you have nothing on Armstrong's Denham.  Jack Black was always obsessed with money and power and became a scumbag, while Armstrong wants money and power as well, but does not want to risk lives for his own sake.  Armstrong was perfect in every way possible. <br /> <br />The direction by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack was great.  Many action-adventure fans like myself who were raised on like \\"Terminator\\", \\"Robocop\\", \\"Total Recall\\", and other blockbusters, might find the pacing too slow or the action scenes redundant and boring.  Yet, I found them interesting and not over the top at all. <br /> <br />The main reason people will want to see this film is for the special effects which were amazing during its time.  Today, although they look inferior compared to other films (I'll even say that Kong looks better in the remake), they still are really a sight to behold.  All the movements, although jerky at times and not fluid, are fun to watch and really neat.  It shows how much effort and time was put into production. <br /> <br />Finally, I respected that this film wasn't a clean old film.  Usually, films from this time period, were censored heavily and actually Kong was censored at first because of either violence or sexual content.  Yet, this is the restored edition, and there is good bit of brutal violence (stompings, bitings, people falling to their death) which could frighten some viewers. <br /> <br />Overall, this film was fun.  I wouldn't say it's one of the best films ever made, but it's definitely a classic in its own right.  People who love old action-adventure movies will be sucked into this movie.  For all those who are used to special effects extravaganzas, go see \\"Kong 2005\\".  For me, I think I'll stick with this one. <br /> <br />Not Rated - contains minimal sexual content, disturbing images, sequences of strong violence.
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|This movie was okay at best.  Richard Gere played John Clark, a lawyer who takes up dancing only because he's attracted to the beautiful instructor (Jennifer Lopez) he sees through a window as he's headed home from work.   <br /> <br />John Clark takes the train home each and everyday from work.  One day he spots a gorgeous lady staring out a window.  He sees that it's a dancing school.  The very next day on his way home from work, he spots the same lady again staring out the window.  This time he decides to get off the train and pay a visit to the dance school.   <br /> <br />It is here that his life takes a dramatic turn of events.  He feels that in order to get close to the beautiful lady, he must learn to dance, or should I say attempt to learn to dance.   <br /> <br />Susan Sarandon plays Beverly Clark, the wife of John Clark (Gere).  In my opinion, John Clark is bored with his life and is reaching out for something new.  Not necessarily to have an affair with Paulina (J. Lopez).  But to do something different with his dull life.  He meets a few new friends who are also first-time dancers. <br /> <br />Nice story, but very predictable.   <br /> <br />Stanley Tucci is hilarious as Link, a white guy who pretends to be Hispanic.  Lisa Ann Walter was very good in her role as Bobbie.  She is so down to earth and very funny.  She stood out more than Jennifer Lopez did in this movie, in my opinion.   <br />Also, Nick Cannon makes an appearance in the movie, playing a spy named Scott.   <br /> <br />Not a bad movie, but I kept expecting more.  I give this movie 3 stars because I felt like something was left out.   <br /> <br />
B000BTJCRM|5.0|I picked this up when I was in London recently and loved it right away. Personally I think they sound like Sabbath, The doors, and Zeppelin, but they also have their own style, and a unique new sound that is a throwback to the 70's rock bands.
B00008ADPF|4.0|This may not be as deft as their current album \\"All The Right Reasons,\\" but it's no loser either. Nickelback is refreshing in comparison to most of what's out there that's considered to be Rock music. But to clarify, this album only has 11 songs. So it's definitely not \\"too long.\\"  <br /> <br />What's great about Nickelback is they have their own style and sound. No one is making songs like FLAT ON THE FLOOR or FIGURED YOU OUT. A lot of people try, but the result isn't nearly as catchy. Nickelback is good at what they do.  <br /> <br />Other standouts include: DO THIS ANYMORE, SOMEDAY, SHOULD'VE LISTENED, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, FEELING WAY TO DAMN GOOD, BECAUSE OF YOU.
0451191153|5.0|When I read this book about 8 years ago it completely rocked my world.  Is it realistic?  No.  Does Rand over-simplify the world into mere black & white?  Yes.  Is it preachy?  Certainly. <br /> <br />Now I can see how these aspects of it would turn off alot of readers, but I think the thing that still makes it a masterpiece is that it is such a unique outlook.  Howard Roark is the ideal hero of anyone who tries to swim against the stream in their art, business, etc.  His attitude is not one that you could live by on a day to day basis, and yet, it is a refreshing outlook because the creation is coming from within. <br /> <br />Although Rand oversimplifies the good/evil dichotomy to the extreme, it still works in this book.  It is not trying to be the real world, and yet many of the things you see in this book will certainly remind you of the real world. <br /> <br />There are certainly alot of Peter Keatings in the world.  People who are afraid to think for themselves, or take a stand.  Sadly we often knock down the visionary Roark's of our world. <br /> <br />Anyways, read it for your self and see what you think.  This book is an inspiration to me and I've read it about 5 times.  It certainly has it's flaws (like Dominique), but all in all, if you like a good root for the underdog story, this is about as good as it gets. <br /> <br />Also, from a literary standpoint I think it is pretty masterfully written. <br /> <br />Howard Roark laughed.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Wow, what a stunningly insulting review of a good album written by a Mr. Matthew Cooke. I can only assume this never-heard-of-him internet rock reviewer learned his musical critique somewhere between Wayne's World and TRL. One-trick pony? Teen-Beat-from-hell? Overtly commercial? That's supposed to be positive? I'd give better treatment to A Flock of Seagulls. Let's do Trent some justice. Here's how it goes: The latest NIN album, [with_teeth], hot off the mic and fresh on the wax is a dizzying, everything-I'd-hoped-it-would-be almagamation of spiteful poetry, seasoned composition style, and a retro/modern twist. Hard to define, this album breaks all the barriers set in place by previous cuts, taking NIN to a realm where only the faithful dare tread while remaining at its core the beautiful creature we have known and loved for years. This fantastic dichotomy will keep me coming back to the stereo well past their next release.

0736063684|5.0|The human body is a system. In bodybuilding, if you treat your body systematically -- proper technique of movement, breathing, nutrition, hydration, rest, state of mind, and even clothing, etc. -- you will get good results. If you do not, you won't. It's that simple. Mr. Frederic Delavier's \\"Strength Training Anatomy\\" is an important component to help you to achieve good technique.    Nowhere is the phrase, \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\", more appropriate than with this book, which is a collection of anatomical pictures showing you exactly which muscle, or group of muscles, is used in each movement. In addition, a detailed description of each movement with recommendations is provided below each picture. The book is divided into seven chapters: (1) \\"Arms\\", (2) \\"Shoulders\\", (3) \\"Chest\\", (4) \\"Back\\", (5) \\"Legs\\", (6) \\"Buttocks\\" and (7) \\"Abdomen\\". Each chapter contains many movements/exercises for each muscle group.    In a gym, you will encounter at least 80% of people who absolutely have no clue what they are doing. (You can usually tell them apart by their loud screams, grunts and moans to get attention.) Correct technique is vital to achieve bodybuilding success! If you are a beginning bodybuilder, I highly recommend that this book be your first book to buy, or at the very least one of your first books. This seemingly innocent-looking book is an absolutely invaluable book for any bodybuilder of any caliber!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Porco Rosso is by far my favorite Miyazaki film due to its witty humor and the anti-war theme.  Althrough kids might not fully understand the movie, none of the content is actually \\"mature\\" enough that a whole family cannot enjoy this movie together. <br /> <br />The music and scores are fambulous as usual since Miyazaki and Hisaishi combined both their expertise together FLAWLESSLY. <br /> <br />I admit, I'm the pickiest person when it comes to voices matching personalities, but I really can't complain about the dubbing for this movie.  It is actually enjoyable and believable as opposed to some dubs for other Miyazaki movies.  The script follows the original quite closely.  That makes me happy.  Good Job! <br /> <br />The only thing I had a problem with was that they did not use the original for \\"Les Temps des Cerises\\" and the ending theme.  I liked the voice of the original singer (Tokiko Kato) more so then the one they picked (don't know who), but the new one is not bad either. <br /> <br />Many might think that the ending is a bit of a blur, but that's Miyazaki's signature (i.e. watch end credit of My Neighbor Totoro and Nausicaa of Valley of the Wind).  Miyazaki never does sequel of his films, which I fully agree with since somethings are better left unsaid and left to the imagination (which is a theme in most of his movies), but he does give hints throughout the movie on the ending.  As for the actual ending, figure it out for yourself :)
B000BYA4JM|5.0|This is a Spice Girl Madonna. Fun. I watched this movie as many times I watched Grease and Superman II. This movie was just so amazing visually. It almost looked like the fifties and Madonna was so much like Judy Holliday. <br /> <br />I had a great time watching it. The cartoon Madonna, walking out of prison like Snow White, but then kind of dangerous when she holds that gun. It made me feel good when I was I kid. I preferred it to the critically acclaimed Desperately Seeking Susan, which I didn't enjoy and love until I got older. Fun movie.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I'd say Nausicaa of Valley of the Wind.  Its flying machines, settings and creatures, all wonderfully created that can make you believe, for a second, that these things exist.  These elements all show you a glimpse of how far imagination (especially Miyazaki's) can go... anywhere and everywhere. <br /> <br />As for the storyline, sure, there has been many movies about how we must save the environment and anti-war, and many more storylines dealing with a post war society, but Miyazaki does it in a purely non-preachy way.  Also, the storyline is not just anti-war and pro-environmentalism, but also attacks the deeper questions, such as \\"What kind is sacrifice is really okay?\\" when those retaliating the military plan on sacrificing other people for the 'good' of everyone. It also has its elements of differences from other movies with the same storyline, such as the misunderstanding of the mutant bugs and the Toxic Jungle, which deviates from the common \\"they are here to destroy the humans\\" plot, but instead take a beautifully role in the movie.  This movie was made in 1984, and it still applies to the world today.  Pretty impressive for a movie that old. <br /> <br />Last but not least, Joe Hisaishi does the music, which matches every single shot of the movie, communicating the feelings and emotions of the story.  If you don't appreciate the movie, at least you'll enjoy the music, although I seriously doubt not liking the movie is even an option.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|It seems that the negative reviews for this movie are coming from an older group of people who haven't ever traveled outside the North American continent. If you're young and have traveled outside of the U.S., you'll love this movie. It's just a fun movie that tells the story of a few strangers that become a family for a short time. It's what traveling and going to school abroad is all about. See this movie, share it, because I know you'll love it. <br /> <br />But yes, if you're a hermit that lives under a rock in the middle of nowhere U.S.A., this movie is not for you.
B0000024JN|5.0|<br />Perhaps Licensed to Ill was inevitable - a white group blending rock and rap, giving them the first number one album in hip-hop history. But that reading of the album's history gives a short shrift to the Beastie Boys; producer Rick Rubin and his label, Def Jam; and this remarkable record, since mixing metal and hip-hop isn't necessarily an easy thing to do. Just sampling and scratching Sabbath and Zeppelin to hip-hop beats does not make for an automatically good record, though there is a visceral thrill to hearing those muscular riffs put into overdrive with scratching.  <br /> <br />But, much of that is due to the producing skills of Rick Rubin, a metalhead who formed Def Jam Records with Russell Simmons and had previously flirted with this sound on Run-D.M.C.'s Raising Hell, not to mention a few singles and one-offs with the Beasties prior to this record. He made rap rock, but to give him lone credit for Licensed to Ill (as some have) is misleading, since that very same combination would not have been as powerful, nor would it have aged so well - aged into a rock classic - if it weren't for the Beastie Boys, who fuel this record through their passion for subcultures, pop culture, jokes, and the intoxicating power of wordplay. At the time, it wasn't immediately apparent that their obnoxious patter was part of a persona (a fate that would later plague Eminem), but the years have clarified that this was a joke - although, listening to the cajoling rhymes, filled with clear parodies and absurdities, it's hard to imagine the offense that some took at the time. Which, naturally, is the credit of not just the music - they don't call it the devil's music for nothing - but the wild imagination of the Beasties, whose rhymes sear into consciousness through their gonzo humor and gleeful delivery.  <br /> <br />There hasn't been a funnier, more infectious record in pop music than this, and it's not because the group is mocking rappers (in all honesty, the truly twistedbarbs are hurled at frat boys and lager lads), but because they've already created their own universe and points of reference, where it's as funny to spit out absurdist rhymes and pound out \\"Fight for Your Right (To Party)\\" as it is to send up street-corner doo wop with \\"Girls.\\" Then, there is the overpowering loudness of the record - operating from the axis of where metal, punk, and rap meet, there never has been a record this heavy and nimble, drunk on its own power yet giddy with what they're getting away with. There is a sense of genuine discovery, of creating new music, that remains years later, after countless plays, countless misinterpretations, countless rip-off acts, even countless apologies from the Beasties, who seemed guilty by how intoxicating the sound of it is, how it makes beer-soaked hedonism sound like the apogee of human experience. And maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but in either case, Licensed to Ill reigns tall among the greatest records of its time.
0316666343|3.0|I remember hearing great things about the book, so you can imagine my disappointment when it turned out to be okay. I thought it was sort of... well.. boring.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I can't put my finger on it... <br /> <br />Is there anything in recent history...other than 9/11...that has brought people to the social microphone, telling their tales, bearing their souls, and just rejoicing at type on a page and images on a screen. <br /> <br />This soundtrack captures all the love, lust, pain, heartache, longing, release, and ultimately sadness and transcendence that is Brokeback Mountain. It may be the touchstone movie of the first-half of the first decade of this century and millinium. <br /> <br />Jack and Ennis are, at their core, two strangers who fall deeply, and unforgetably in love. It comes as much as a shock to the two of them as to us, the viewer, judger, identifier, and, in the soundtrack, listener. Every song moves the narative forward. <br /> <br />Those first 2 guitar tones...the mood is set. \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" is Ennis's love song to his lost life-half that may or may not have known before his death, by accident, on a lonely Texas road. <br /> <br />The Brokeback tracks trace the development of Jack and Ennis and the relationship that they didn't seek but found themselves irreversibly caught up in. <br /> <br />\\"I Don't Want to Say Goodbye\\" is Jack's love song to Ennis as he recalls those near perfect days on Brokeback Mountain that they never returned to. <br /> <br />\\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" fills me with all that this fragile, amazing, special relationship reflects...each of us should read these lyrics and remember them when we venture out into the world...that primary relationship is most important, no matter how it manifests itself. <br /> <br />\\"The Wings\\" which makes only two appearances...has Jack realizes that his hope for a live-in relationship is not to be but his love for Ennis exists...he reaches out and strokes Ennis's cheek as this melody starts the first time...then it spans several short but telling scenes. <br /> <br />The second time is of course in Ennis's trailer...the shirts, the final sceneout the window to the lonely, sad prairie...the tears in Ennis's eyes stick with us as he pledges a pledge that only he and Jack know and we the viewer are not to know, as it should be. <br /> <br />Music is an amazing thing and it is used in Brokeback Mountain to its fullest. <br /> <br />\\"The Maker Makes\\" is so perfect. The first time, after the emotions of the shirts and everything that came before it, Rufus just captures it all in his longing, heartfelt, yet hopeful vocal rendition...an amazing reason to stay through the credits. <br /> <br />

0060595183|4.0|Aldous Huxley was one of the deepest and most profound thinkers to ever explore how various chemicals alter the state of one's thinking and being. His varying perceptions and thought processes are recorded in these two novellas with lucid clarity and thought that only Huxley could produce despite his mind-altering states. A fearless explorer and detractor of controlled societal construction, Huxley reveals with poignant depth the frequency and wavelengths of his various psychedelic induced experiences. A must read for those interested in chemical or meditatively induced mind expansion.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|I loved Sufjan's \\"Greetings From Michigan....\\"  so when this album leaked on the internet several months before it was to be released in July, I got so excited but promised myself I wouldn't cheat.. I would wait until it was actually released.  By the time it had finally come out I couldn't believe me ears.  The wait was well worth it.  The album is just so RICH.  I think people don't like this album because it's fattening.  I mean, it's like a triple chocolate fudge sundae with every topping known to man.  There is a little too much going on, but it is no way too bad.  Really, the chaos of instruments and layers just make for a really delightful album.  The songs are singalong-esque and I think that's what Sufjan intended.  I saw him live and it was one of the most fun shows I was ever lucky enough to have attended.  He has a knack for catchy tunes.  I have to wonder if he will get better.  He probably will.  Look at the Sufjan canon...he's come this far with this many great albums...... the only option is to keep going up, which I'm pretty positive he will.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *** <br /> <br />When I first went to see this movie, I wasn't sure whether to expect something great or something mediocre. I had been a little less than impressed with the preview material that had been released. I am happy to say that the film was a near-perfect translation of the musical to the screen. <br /> <br />\\"Near-perfect\\", yes. The film version of Phantom is not without its flaws. Certain lines were converted to dialog, presumably to make them seem more natural or something, but in fact they work better when sung. Gerard Butler has a good physical presence as the Phantom, but he clearly doesn't have the voice. Strangely enough, this doesn't detract from the movie as much as one might expect. Some of the musical cuts actually hurt the pacing of the movie, particularly near the end of the movie after \\"Point of No Return\\", where an additional 30 seconds or so of music was added that slowed (although did not stop) the momentum of that scene. And I think the counterpoint in \\"Wandering Child\\" - cut for the movie and some stage productions - adds a lot to that song. <br /> <br />But these are all very minor complaints, as the overall quality of the movie translation overshadows them all. They are at worst minor annoyances. In many ways, the movie version is *better* than the stage version, in that a greater intimacy is possible on film than on stage, and here that works to great effect. For example, it would be difficult to show Raoul with slight tears in his eyes on stage, and yet in this film we get these more subtle effects, which serve to make Raoul a *much* more interesting character than he is on stage. I couldn't say whether a \\"perfect\\" stage production is better or worse than the movie, because the performance of this musical that I saw on stage had a mediocre cast and mediocre staging. <br /> <br />There are things that happened in the movie that didn't happen in the stage version I saw, and they really made thingsmore effective: the Phantom catching Christine when she faints, the highly sensual nature of \\"Point of No Return\\", Christine closing the Phantom's hand around the ring when she hands it back to him (in the stage version I saw, she held it out to him at arm's length). <br /> <br />I thought many of the cuts in the story actually strengthened it rather than weakened it. While the stage version works well with the Don Juan rehearsal intact, I think that would have made the movie a bit boring, and in fact the move of the Phantom's jabs at everyone from a note (as on stage) to an in-person delivery (as in the movie) makes the Phantom seem a bit more bold yet aloof, which works very well, I think. <br /> <br />All in all, this movie comes down to whether it captured the essence of the Phantom musical and whether it was moving. And on both counts I would say that yes, it did and it was. To me, even more so than the stage production I saw. <br /> <br />The special features are worth it if you're a Phantom fan, so I would recommend the 2-disc version above the single-disc version.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Since their 1981 classic, \\"Moving Pictures,\\" the height of the band's career, Rush has gone in many different directions and alienated a fair share of fans, but grabbed just as many new ones.  It would have been easy to keep churning out their unique blend of hard rock and progressive rock year after year and milking it for all it was worth, but Rush has always been about trying new things and doing the unexpected.  As a result, they have produced quite a few more great albums since 1981...\\"Grace Under Pressure,\\" \\"Power Windows,\\" \\"Roll the Bones\\" and, lastly, \\"Counterparts,\\" my choice for best Rush album of the last 25 years.  On the surface, it is just a good old hard rock album, but it really is much more than that.      The lyrics are some of the best Neil Peart has ever penned.  That is a bold statement considering the lyrical jewels he has composed over the past 30 plus years, but I find the ones on this record to be of the highest quality.  \\"Cold Fire\\" and \\"Everyday Glory\\" are shining examples and are two of my favorite Rush songs, lyrically and musically.      The production is tremendous.  The previous two albums, \\"Presto\\" and \\"Roll the Bones,\\" suffered a bit from the polite sound of producer Rupert Hine, but Peter Collins took the reigns on this one and the result was a cd that sounds as good as any other Rush album.  I have never heard Alex Lifeson's guitar have this much bite before.  Neil Peart's drums sound dynamic and crisp.  And to say Geddy Lee's bass has major punch to it on this record would be an understatement.     One of the strongest elements on this cd are Geddy Lee's vocals.  They have never sounded better.  Granted, they are a far cry from his shriek-happy days of the 70's, but he has matured into a very good singer and this is his finest work to date.  Check out the verses to \\"Nobody's Hero,\\" for example.     And it goes without saying that none of this would matter without having good songs and \\"Counterparts\\" is loaded with them.  In fact,every song is at least very good, even the oft-maligned \\"The Speed of Love.\\"  My personal favorites are \\"Double Agent,\\" \\"Everyday Glory,\\" \\"Cold Fire\\" and \\"Leave That Thing Alone.\\"  However, ask twenty different Rush fans what their favorites are and you will get many different answers, which is the mark of a good album.  Most of the songs are someone's favorite instead of being a disc with three or four great songs and a bunch of throwaways.    When it is all said and done, this is probably the Rush cd I listen to the most.  It is still sounds as good as the day I bought it back in November 1993.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I would say Gone with the wind is the best film ever and then second would have to be Titanic. I remember when this filmc ame out how hugh it was and no one would expect it to become the highest grossing film ever and win 11 academy awards(tied the most with Ben-Hur and Lord of the Rings: Return of the king). The best dissaster film ever to be put on screen. While you watch it espesially when the ship is sinking you are left without words to explain how great this film is. The story is about a doomned love affair aboiard the doomned luckery liner Titanic(which actually sunk in 1912). The acting is good but at times you watch it thinking it could be better acting. The special effects are just excellent. Overall a great film one of the greatest films ever and it will not go away and we will always remeber it.
076781214X|5.0|\\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\" is about a woman, who recently learns of her successful husband's philandering ways. She goes to her high school reunion wearing a 60's outfit and when she sees her estranged husband at the reunion and she's voted \\"Prom Queen\\" at her reunion, then she faints only to awake back in the 1960's!<br /><br />Everything is back as it was. This time she has a chance to change her future. Only to realize that maybe trying to change her future isn't such a good thing, after all.<br /><br />It's a poignant and witty film that allows you to fantasize about \\"What if...\\" I would have done such and such, then what would have happened?<br /><br />To find out exactly just what happens in this exciting and entertaining film with a wonderful soundtrack, then I highly suggest you rent or buy this 80's classic today!<br /><br />You'll be glad you did because the quotes are witty, too!<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone and everyone; although, it does slightly touch on death, so it might be recommended for those children under 13.
0316921173|2.0|I have no problem with authors writing extremely lengthy novels and have read my fair share of voluminous works (Karamazov, Ullyses, The Executioner's Song, Cryptonomicon, The Count of Monte Cristo [Penquin ed. 1300 pp being the longest book I've ever read]). What I've found over the years is that good books leave you unaware of the page count. The good ones do. Good books tend to be interesting. They tend to have interesting characters. This leaves the reader interested. It's something that novelists should, and usually, keep in mind. Wallace forgot it. He is to be forgiven as he was only in or around his late 20's when writing this tome and clearly did not have a clear sense of what the hell he was doing.    'Post-modern' or 'experimental' writing happens to interest me greatly, whether it was written 100 years ago, during the 1960's or in the present. Finnegan's Wake is good experimental writing, as is A Clockwork Orange. These are good books because they were written with a purpose in mind and not written for the sake of writing experimentally. As was clearly the case with IJ. This book is like a smart guy's House of Leaves, which is a dumb guy's Infinite Jest. No story, weak characters, obscenely long footnotes, which are completely misused often times, and just aimless meandering writing going nowhere slowly.    I didn't find the book funny. There are lots of funny books out there that are also considerd to be literary classics. I would use as an example Catch-22 or most anything by Vonnegut. Joyce was amusing in his own way. This was someone without a sense of humor attempting to be funny by creating outrageous scenarios. The scenarios were written in the same monotone voice. Maybe it works with Stephen Wright, but not with this guy and certainly not on paper. Herds of hamsters would be amusing if your kid was writing about them.    Finally, I lived in Allston for a time and the description did not hold true to me. The setting, I realize, was not in the present, but still it lacked realism. This hurt the book for me as well. He would have been much better served having the story take place in a fictional town.    I can't recommend this book for anyone as it is unnecessarily bloated, pretentiously experimental and has no real reason for existing other than satisfying the whims of the author. He should stick to essays, as he is a slightly gifted essayist.

044100590X|5.0|Dune is a five star book because it deserves the honor.  This book is perfect and of thousand of books written per year it's doubtful there is a book of this quality produced every five years. <br /> <br />The main character in the book is Paul, the son of Duke Leto.  Paul and his family have to move to Dune, a desert world.  It is at Dune that the ordeal of Paul and his family begin. <br /> <br />The novel Dune could best be called a science fiction version of Lawrence of Arabia.  But this isn't quite true.  Dune has some plot similarities, such as a stranger in a strange land becomes a leader of a revolt.  However, Dune is so much more than that. <br /> <br />There are lots of politics and opposing forces in Dune.  There is the Guild, this group controls interstellar space transportation.  There is the Sisterhood, a group of women looking to use eugenics in a quest to produce the ultimate human being.  There are the Harkonnen, a vicious group of people who wish to exterminate Paul and his family for a past perceived slight.  Another force is the Fremen, the inhabitants of Dune itself.  Last, there is the Planet Dune. <br /> <br />Dune is a perfect world.  Dune requires perfection.  If you are less than perfect you die.  The enviorment is as unforgiving as space.  Basically, it has no water.  A world like Dune should either keep people away or invite terra forming.  However, this is not done.  It is on Dune that \\"Spice\\" is found.  Spice's other name is Melange.   <br /> <br />Spice is the driving force in this book.  Spice is everything.  Spice allows the Guild pilots to peer into the future to allow faster-than-light spaceships to navigate in space.  Spice allows very long life for humans who take the drug.  The trouble is Spice is addictive.  If you quit taking Spice you die.   <br /> <br />Dune is the only source of Spice.  The economy of the universe depends on the free flow of Spice.   <br /> <br />Frank Herbert's Dune is a perfect book because it takes placenearly 8,000 years in the future.  It removed from our modern world  by sheer volume of time.  Everything has changed.  The Catholic church has survived as the only religion but not as something we would recognise.  The \\"Orange Catholic\\" Bible is an amalgamation of all the worlds religions.  Guilds control working life.  Planets have been populated by people, and have been populated for thousands of years.  An emperor governs the galaxy.  However, his power depends more on alliances power rather than his own monopoly of power. <br /> <br />Herbert's Dune is full of political forces fighting for the planet.  All of them want the Spice and raw power. <br /> <br />What makes the book so timeless, it was written over 40 years past, are some parts read like how the people of today would act them out.   Example, people in the future use personal \\"shields\\" for protection.  If a laser hits a shield the energy release produces an near nuclear sized explosion.  One of Paul's bodyguards rigs up a shield because some attacking enemy troops are using lasers in an attack. <br /> <br />After the explosion a briefing is given to Baron Harkonnen.  You can just see the word \\"spin\\" leap off the pages.  The Baron ends up thinking to himself \\"it was pretty bad\\" despite the briefer's wish to give a different impression to Baron Harkonnen. <br /> <br />The book is full of examples like that.  It's over 10,000 ACE and some basic things about people have not changed.  A Fremen woman steals damp rags, sells the squeezed water to beggars, and commits pilferage against Paul's family.  The Fremen see Duke Leto risk his life to save the crew of a Spice mining machine, the Fremen are impressed with his concern for his men.   <br /> <br />Another thing is thinking machines, computers, are banned in the future.  Why?  They are used to oppress people and a revolt led to their destruction.  Amazing that Frank Herbert in the early 1960s had to foresight to see the oppression that we will be living with in the future. <br /> <br />Paul himself is a perfect character for Dune.  The book starts with Paul as a young teenager.  The book concludes with his as a young man, sure of himself and in control of all around.  We get to see a man who was bred, literally, to be summation of all people in the universe.  Paul makes the connection between the worms and Spice.  Paul builds up the Fremen to be the ultimate soldiers in the Universe. <br /> <br />My poor words do not do justice to this book.  I re-read Dune ever five years.  Yes, the book is that good.  I always find something I miss in the book. <br /> <br />Now, Dune has been made into a wretched big screen movie.  That was back in '82 and I suppose the makers of the film just threw money at Frank Herbert until he agreed to make the movie.  It's terrible.  Avoid it.  Dune has been made into a Science-Fiction channel movie.  It's not bad.  It's not in the same class as the book, what mini-series is?  However, if you don't want to spend the energy reading Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune then they are not too bad. <br /> <br />Warning, I gave up reading the Dune series after God Emperor of Dune.  Past that point, over 5,000 years removed from Dune, you wonder if the government that poor Arrakis (it's not Dune at that point) got would have been any worse if the Harkonnen been in charge.  <br /> <br />Dune is a perfect book.  It should be one 100 best books of the 20th Century. <br /> <br />Five stars
B000002H2H|5.0|I started to get into the whole Metallica thing a little under a decade ago. Then I entered into many phases; latin pop, christian and country; rap; hip hop etc. WEll, it is 2006 and I have circled back to where I began - Metallica and metal thrash. I must say that this CD is a very amazing foray into political disagreement with manyt hings - fear of death ( of many forms ) and death.  First of all, I don't know what a riff is. But I do know good music and good ' let's get going ' music and this is it. So that being said, let's begin shall we? <br /> <br />Fight Fire With Fire - Starts off with a nice little movement and then the drums start. Here is a song about how nuclear warfare will destroy us all if we fight fire with fire aka ' eye for eye tooth for tooth '. I must say, it is an enjoyable and exciting thrill ride. This is the perfect song to get someone pumped up, the devilish laugh is to show HE is winning not any of us. Fantastic joy ride. 10 / 10 <br /> <br />Ride the Lightning - Holy freaking cow. I must say that this song starts off right off the bat as quick and pounding. A little past the midway point comes the amazing solo. This is a song speaking about the fear of dying in the electric chair, obviously, as the name of the song and cd and the pic on the cover indicate. Obviously, the way I see it, they are not coming out for or against they merely are singing about fear of dying in such a way. However we interpret that so be it. The solo is amazing and the song keeps you going at a fast pace. 10 / 10 <br /> <br />For Whom the Bell Tolls - I don't know where this lovecraft thing came from. This is obviously a reference to Heminway's classic of the same title speaking about the spanish civil war - just like the book. The church bells and the guitar start off ominously. It's a little slower but just as aggressive as the first two. This is the type of song that can be played in many different settings and is definitely a concert song. Once the song transitions from the initial segments to the middle you can tell it's going to be a great song that will keep you thinking. Yep you THINK listening to Metallica ) for those who say metal damages the brain HA! ) 10 / 10 <br /> <br />Fade to Black - Suicide. Suicidal thoughts. This is a fine ballad given these things however. I must say it is a great way to slow down after the first 3 pounding songs. It is a song, simply stated, about contemplating suicide and ' fading to black ' ending the life. I can see this song with many montagues in movies although they might have to loop the beginning and forego the lyrics which btw are standout. Just make sure you don't listen to the song while depressed. Int he right mood - THIS is the best song on the cd. In the wrong mood ( or a bad mood ) it's well.... 10 / 10 <br /> <br />Trapped Under Ice - Fear of being trapped under ice and screaming without anyone to hear you is definitely a few some people have. And in fact, the movies go a long way in showing the agony and fear as, like in space, no one can hear you scream under ice. The song is back to fast paced and typical thrash. I tend to not like this song as much as many on here. It seems to just drag on although the drumbs pounding are well. Lead singer's voice seems raspy here ( but it usuallyd oes 0 it just feels raspier.  8 / 10 <br /> <br />Escape - Yep, this is a filler and it is the worst song on the cd. However, it is definitely something that people can remember. I even sung part of this song in the shower so I know it can stay in the head. However, once you move onto the next track, it does feel like ' what did I just listen to? ' hits you. However it does have a classic ' 80's ' feel to it and that, for nostalgia sake if anything else, makes the song decent 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />Creeping Death - Ah here we go. This song is fast paced with amazing 'rifs ' ( WHAT ARE THESE THINGS! ) and memorable lyrics. It is a little ominous with ' ooo death is coming ' and if you listento this song at night with the lights off but candles glowing it's going to be a little too much in terms of the imagination department. One thing that separates this song fromt he others are the transitions ( are those rifs?! ) which, while exercising, keeps you going more than any other song. This is the perfect song to get someone jacked up before a big event. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br />Call of Ktulu - Instrumental. Swoosh swoosh and guitar initially. Then the song transitions. You all know the song, it's been stated many times. There is one thing that tends to make the song memorable, it just SOUNDS like someone is traveling through something ( a forest, space, consciousness what have you ) and that feeling seems to make it all the more thrilling. After it switches to a little louder it just feels Metallicaish. Highly recommend for those with a great imagination feeling as if they are ' traveling '. 10 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0553212478|5.0|An excellent read which stands the test of time.  If you put Mary Shelley & Bram Stoker together in the Boxing Ring of Horror, Mary would beat Bram with both arms tied behind her back.<br /><br />It is not like any of the movies, including the awful \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\\"  This Monster is huge, fast, intelligent, stealthy and ruthless.  Most importantly, he is a Monster first and foremost.  Except for some parts near the end, the story is almost entirely from Viktor's point of view, and the Monster, his nemesis, is a totally evil and horrifyingly unstoppable Enemy.<br /><br />All the movies make the mistake of adopting the Monster's self-pitying, self-justifying point of view right from the get-go, thereby turning him into a sort of tragic hero.  While this material itself is not entirly untrue to the book, it has been presented (in the movies) at the wrong time and in the wrong context.<br /><br />It is, however, a thoughtful book.  If you are looking for all action (or gore) with little depth or poetry, it is not for you.
B000006MV8|5.0|Every track from this rich, warm LP blows you away. Everything from Pete Ham's and George Harrison's slide guitars on \\"Day After Day\\" to Ham's hauntingly aching \\"Take It All.\\" Every rock and pop fan should pick this CD up before it slips out of print. Badfinger initially were on the Beatles' Apple Records label before they moved to Warner Brothers in 1973/74. Every album recorded by this incredibly gifted band is worth it - \\"Magic Christian Music,\\" \\"No Dice\\" (which ties with \\"Straight Up\\" as the best LP, \\"Ass,\\" \\"Badfinger,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Head First.\\" Any fan of the Beatles, The Who, Hendrix, Cream/Clapton and everyone else from the late 1960s/early 1970s should pick up Badfinger's discs. This was the band that Rolling Stone magazine said, in 1970, is the group \\"to watch for\\" in the coming years.  <br />It's a shame their manager, S. Polly, was such a thief and robbed the band of royalties and potential fame, which concluded with Ham's suicide in 1975 and bassist Tom Evans' suicide in 1983. Drummer MIke Gibbons, sadly, passed away late last year, leaving only guitarist-vocalist Joey Molland as the band's sole survivor. Rest in peace guys!  <br />P.S. Don't be turned off by The Beatles comparisons - Badfinger had a sound, song structures and style all to their own, which will please both fans of The Beatles and those who don't care for the Fab Four. Power pop-rock was never better than the early 1970s records from Badfinger. (Actually, Badfinger's output was as good as most of the solo Beatles work in the early 1970s.)

B000002TLX|4.0|The only reason I purchased this CD in the first place was so I could have a copy of Hazard that I could learn the music from.  It is a song that my band is going to be playing soon.  I didn't expect to be so surprised by the quality of the other songs as well.<br />I've heard most of them on the radio over the years, I always knew who Richard Marx was but never paid much attention.  His songs are very personal and full of rich imagery.<br />I threw the CD into my vehicle (that means it plays over and over for a while) and let it go.  I found after a while that I was beginning to sing to the album, and not just the Hazard song.  \\"Hold onto the night,\\" and \\"Angelia\\" come to mind the most.<br />I never was much into pop/rock type music but this guys' personality rubbed off on me.  I liked the liner notes where he discusses where he got the ideas and how to pull them off.  He is a very candid person and I liked that.  I believe it helped me to accept the music in a new light.<br />Thanks to Marx for putting out and having the material for a \\"great\\" Greatest Hits album.  They are rare and most bands don't deserve them.<br />I recommend this CD to people that have heard his songs on the radio but never knew anything about the man.  At any rate, the \\"Hazard\\" song is worth the purchase.

Should you snort any of the concoction God knows what you will experience, probably epiphanies for the kiddies and flashbacks for the oldies, and it's anyone's guess what they will be. Perhaps the first time you listened to Black Sabbath through dodgy earphones. Or that Led Zeppelin concert your mates insist you were at. Aussie aficionados may hear echoes of Russell Morris, Masters Apprentices, even Spectrum. The bad news is that the singing and lead guitar is at this stage not close to any of them. But it's early days, and who knows where these three will go. The good news is that as far as reinventing some of this old source material, this is as good as it currently gets. Hang around for Vagabond and experience a draw dropping conclusion to this CD that will leave you gobsmacked. Five stars and then some.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|(...) one of the albums of the year in 2001 and when news got out about the band producing a double album for their next project, it was happy days for all of the bands fans. Some said that System of a Down had no chance of releasing an album that equated to Toxicity, some said it couldn't physically be done. I personally would have been happy with an album at least close to the quality of Toxicity, but when the band released their double disc album in early 2005 (Mesmerize) and late 2005 (Hypnotise), it fell far shorter of expectations. It wasnt just the fact that the band had 'evolved' into the wrong direction, but it could have easily been said that the band did not NEED to release a double album, and if they had kept it short, they would have had a decent follow up to Toxicity. Instead what we are left with is a rather large collection of badly lyriced songs, some of which sound as if they have been written in about an hour. The guitarist sings more on this album too - which sounded like a good idea at first, but his voice gets very annoying very quickly. This album is best avoided full stop: if you MUST listen to songs from it, try the singles B.Y.O.B. & Question!, or possibly Violent Pornography & Cigaro. Other than that, you're not missing much at all.
B00000ILDF|4.0|An interesting entry for sure. This movie has all of the makings for a good movie, highlighted by the new CGI alien. I really like the movie but after the high that is Aliens, it just doesn't rise to the same level.<br /><br />The end is emotional but felt a little forced. It was interesting to see Bishop, the real person who invented the Bishop cyborgs. He being on here means that this movie must not have taken place that long before Alien vs. Predator, since we see the return of the real Bishop in that movie.<br /><br />Overall good, wonderful story, but it just doesn't come off as good as what preceded it.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|(this is a review for both the Hypnotise and Mesmerize albums combined) System of a Down were enjoying the success of Toxicity, one of the albums of the year in 2001 and when news got out about the band producing a double album for their next project, it was happy days for all of the bands fans.

B000244EMO|5.0|Oh man, I love this movie. I just bought the DVD and it is awesome. There is so much that was cut out on the TV censored version that is still left in the uncensored rated R version.<br /><br />Alien successfully mixed the horror genre with the sci-fi genre, and Predator has accomplished an amazing thing as well, Predator successfully mixed the action genre with the sci-fi genre. And what better way to do that than to get one of the greatest action heroes of all time, good old Ahnold. And what better person to do the special affects for a movie than the legend himself Stan Winston, and they got both. And mix it with a great story and add John McTiernan (the dude who directed Die Hard) as director, you have one awesome flick. That's what this movie is.<br /><br />The special effects are top notch in this film; Stan really out did himself with this film. Outstanding work on the dead bodies and all of the mutilation that the Predator, aka the Yatja, did.<br /><br />The musical score for the movie was fantastic as well. Every time I think of this movie, I think about the song.<br /><br />Last but not least, a lot of the credit has to go to Kevin Peter Hall who portrayed the Predator in this film. He made the character come to life, and his battles with Arnold were terrific. He really does make you forget that this is all fake and begin to think that this is real. He was a very talented actor who will be missed.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is my favorite sci-fi movie. It has it all with some to spare. I actually understood what was going on when I watched the DVD. On the censored TV version, they cut so much out you just don't know what's really happening. I recommend the DVD big time, very much worth getting. I guess there was 20 minutes that were cut in the censored version after watch this uncensored version. Get it!
B000021YQV|5.0|A lowly Armenian/American Quartet's second album...it doesnt sound very flashy looking at the facts does it? System of a Down certianlly silenced the critics, who said they'd never make it after a 'flukey' first album, in style. From the first track to the last, the band chune out song after song of pure quality, suitable for fans of the slightly heavier side of structured music. Any review I write will make the album sound worse! What are you waiting for?! Go buy it!! <br />(recommended tracks: Chop Suey!, Forest, Toxicity, Aerials)
B00000ILDE|5.0|Whatever it was missing in the original movie, it is found with this installment. James Cameron brings his movie magic to this series and makes it explode into something that is unspeakably excellent. It has action and a great story, the two things that I always go for. It is in this movie that the aliens are given a name, xenomorphs. All of the actors are really good and improved over those who were in the previous. I never can place it with this series, but this added what was missing for sure.
0684824906|3.0|I had such high hopes for \\"Team of Rivals\\".  What a combo: Old Abe and Moptop (read DKG's memoir \\"Wait \\"til Next Year!\\").  Alas, \\"Team of Rivals\\" does not add much to the Lincoln canon.  Donald's biography remains definitive.  While DKG starts out strong, the subject and source material appear to overwhelm her.  Wait 'til the next book, Ragmop!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The Foo Fighters are undoubtedly one of the best bands, but the record label is damaging their image.  FF are all about the fans.  Buying a CD you can't put on your IPOD is simply wrong;  I paid for it and own it.  Oh, and now you modify my computer much like a virus or worm; your tactics are as unethical as those you are combating.  The cure may well kill the host--preventing piracy may work against the their bottom line.  Love the music though.
B000BEPLTK|5.0|You can see my review of the album itself on the music-only pages for Intensive Care elsewhere on Amazon...I will not review it here.  My review here is of the supplementary DVD.<br /><br />Robbie and I are the same age.  That doesn't mean anything other than the fact that he and I have the same number of years behind us and about the same amount of time upon which we can reflect.  Other than that, he and I may not have much in common...concretely, anyway.<br /><br />A lot of these supplementary DVDs are scripted or boring or otherwise generally useless.  When I see these DVDs, I want to see a *real person.*  If this DVD demonstrates anything like what Robbie Williams is like \\"in real life,\\" I can say this:<br /><br />I could be sitting around my living room, drinking beer with friends, and Robbie Williams could walk in the room, pull up a chair, grab a pint, and fit in like we'd known him since we were born.<br /><br />In this DVD, Robbie is brilliant.  He is very funny, very loose, very intelligent, and very talented.  The off-the-cuff interview segments show a lot of honesty, humility, and humor.  The shots in various studios demonstrate some very talented artists doing what they do best and, for the most part, having a hell of a lot of fun doing it.<br /><br />The mini-documentary provides a whirlwind tour of about half of the songs on Intensive Care.  For selected songs from the album, Robbie gives a brief background to the song mixed among shots taken during various stages of recording.  The interview session shows a very relaxed Robbie sitting in what appears to be his living room in his California home.  Very informal...seemingly unrehearsed...very candid...very charming.<br /><br />You also seem to get a really good feel for how well Robbie and Stephen worked together for this album.  Stephen is in the vast majority of the shots, and you can see that the two have a great deal of respect for each other.  They go back and forth a lot in the footage...it's just fun to watch their interaction.<br /><br />What really hooked me is the honesty that Robbie (and everyone else in the footage, for that matter) exuded.  Not a lot of public figures are willing to share that much with an audience.  You feel, though, after watching the footage, that you got the \\"real\\" Robbie...not a dramatization or a manufactured product, but the real thing.<br /><br />Some technical details:  the DVD gives you a choice of 5.1 Surround Sound or Stereo sound at the onset.  The video is provided in letterbox format, providing a really nice, rich picture.  The DVD is in PAL format, so viewers in the North America and Japan will need a compatible player and display or will need to watch it on their computers.<br /><br />At the end of the DVD, Robbie says, \\"Does this mean that I've come around to liking Robbie Williams?  Yeah, I have, actually.\\"  Me, too, Robbie...me, too.e...it's just fun to watch their interaction. <br /> <br />What really hooked me is the honesty that Robbie (and everyone else in the footage, for that matter) exuded.

6305972591|4.0|This is a pretty good horror movie. It is how horror movies were made years ago. It is about a couple who travel to a town called Gatlin and meet some creepy kids who all follow a special diety. The children want to add the couple to their \\"collection\\", and give their souls to \\"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\\". Thier is also no gore in the film, exept for the slaughter at the beginning at the coffee shop. A good film that spawned terrible sequals exept for the 3rd and COTC 666.
0743454537|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I shared it with everyone I know who reads.  They all agreed.  I sobbed throughout parts; it was very heart wrenching.  Being a sister, a mother to a daughter, and a daughter myself, I could really relate to the characters.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00000612P|5.0|rarely mentioned alongside the stone's exile or who's next or great zep but this quintessential album by rod stewart is every bit as crucial. forget about the later rod stewart, who while still engaging & worthwhile, became an pop crooner and sex symbol. this is carefree exhilirating rock n roll suffused with blues, folk and r&b. only a handful of bands have captured this feeling.
B000B7BRMM|1.0|I can't post any review about this item cause, although I ordered it on NOVEMBER 5th, 2005  I haven't received it until now, FEBRUARY 14th, 2006.
B000000W5L|5.0|if you had to describe rock n roll to a martian, just give them this album. any top 10 list without this album is garbage. the stones made many great albums but none boiled it down to primal r&b beat, primordial rosetta stone guitar riffs, authentic vocals and bluesy lyrics the way this album does.
B000002J1S|4.0|Not being a fan of prog rock or art rock, I held off for years from exploring Peter Gabriel's work with Genesis, but I'm happy to report that this particular album proves to be an exception to the rule of pompous '70s music.    Of course, Gabriel's voice is as provocative and compelling as usual, yet the musical backdrop here is more modern than on previous Genesis records.  The prior references to baroque, classical, and romantic eras have largely been replaced by a contemporary form of historicity familiar to listeners of David Bowie, Brian Eno, Robert Fripp, and The Who from the same decade.  Listening closely, one can even hear foretellings of the coming punk and post-punk revolution.    Rather than leaving the listener lost in a maze of obscure hybrids mixing period music and overdone \\"musicianship,\\" the mutant soundscape on this masterpiece is playful and bouncy, airy and atmospheric, transporting us to a familiar yet strange world recognizable to our own sensibilities and experiences.  Through the intriguing narrative, we delve into a cold, menacing landscape populated by archetypal characters struggling with contradictory motives and confused desires.    Above all, this veritable time capsule confronts our imagination with the complexity of the mid-'70s along with its complicated social and political issues, reminding us that those paranoid days of rampant drug use, pervasive governmental corruption, widespread urban decay, and general societal decline still resonate today in trace memories from our chaotic and formative past.
B00030590I|2.0|\\"Take, for example, Braveheart, a historically based fiction well-received in the US which extols the heroism of William Wallace. Supposedly Willie fights and dies for Freedom. But does he die for his freedom to go shop at WalMart anytime he desires? No. Willie is a \\"hero\\" because his cause is (supposedly) freedom for Scotland.\\" <br /> <br />Right, the freedom to live one's life, which includes the liberty to shop at Wal-Mart.  Not the \\"freedom\\" of collectivism, which is real exploitation and oppression.  I'll give this movie two stars for beautiful scenery, some good acting skills, and such, but the overall message is one that just goes to show you how socialism isn't progressive at all, but just a return to the old world order collectivism that enslaved so many people to massive suffering and stagnancy for so long. The \\"needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\\" doctrine has always failed to realize that what all \\"no just the many\\" NEED is freedom and natural rights.  This are what serve people's needs the most.  The whole collectivist \\"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\\" has always been the ideological basis for the institution of slavery, imperialistic wars, tribal warfare, etc.  Self-sacrifice for a cause or ideal isn't noble if it's sacrificing others for a cause.  The warmongering warlord in this movie isn't any more credible than the other warlords.  <br /> <br />\\"To the ones that called it communist propaganda: The story takes place 2 centuries prior to Communisim (I don't think Karl Marx was even born yet. Don't quote me. I may be wrong).\\" <br /> <br />It's actually nearly two thousand years prior to Marxism.  Yet, Marxism shares the essential same tenet as the warlord in this film.  That being the \\"society\\" is more important than the individuals who make it up.   Collectivism of the past is hardly any different than collectivism of the present.
630522577X|5.0|Well, Julie Andrews never recreated her stage Eliza Doolittle, but Audrey Hepburn(singing dubbed by Marni Nixon - who also dubbed for Deborah Kerr THE KING AND I, Natalie Wood WEST SIDE STORY and found herself finally up on screen, playing a nun in THE SOUND OF MUSIC) is just wonderful as Eliza.<br /><br />To my mind, Julie IS a LADY and would never convince as a flower girl transformed to a lady.... Even her wonderful voice lets her down in that respect. Lately Julie said she only in later years regretted and was saddened not been able to play that part - but she got MARY POPPINS....<br /><br />MY FAIR LADY nevertheless is a classic and deservedly so.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I'M SO GLAD THIS SHOW CAME OUT ON DVD! THIS HAS 9 EPISODES OF THE FIRST SEASON. IT IS WRITTEN VERY WELL, AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS. THE ONLY THING THAT I THINK COULD HAVE INCLUDED , IS CAST INTERVIEWS, BUT EVEN THOUGH ITS NOT FEATURED ON THE DVD, I STILL LOVE THE SHOW!
B0006399FS|1.0|This CD is a bomb alright, a STINK BOMB! <br /> <br />I have not heard one good song on it.  The music industry is truly in a sad state when this thing sells as much as it has.  Then again, look at how it costs less than anything else.  That has to be why people are willing to listen to it.  The music stinks so the record company had to lower the price to fool people into buying it.
B00007ELEL|5.0|And yes, I'm glad he's out there!   <br />I first saw this film after viewing Fargo and I was impressed with it from the start.  Quirky, funny, totally Cohen brothers! <br /> <br />The cast they assembled is impressive.  Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, John Turturo, Steve Buscemi,Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Ben Gazzara, Sam Elliot along with Peter Stomare make this film one of the most memorable films I've seen.   <br /> <br />One of the most memorable characters (if not the most) is \\"The Jesus\\" portrayed to the hilt by John Turturo.  Even after having seen the movie at least 20 times I still laugh every time he comes on screen. Honestly, Turturo desreved an Oscar nomination for this role (if not the award).  He is that good! <br /> <br />The plot is convoluted, but not very hard to follow.  The Dude is a laid back pot head who lives for bowling with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donnie (Buscemi).  The Dude is mistaken for a \\"rich guy\\" also named Jeff Lebowski.  He is attacked and his rug is urinated on.  Before long the Dude is investigating a disappearance, being attacked by nihilists and porn kings, and it goes on from there. The ending is classic and worth the cost of the DVD itself.    <br /> <br />Memorable lines, memorable characters, this film is great fun.  If you enjoy the Cohens and you don't own this movie, you need to get it.  No DVD collection is complete without this film.
B00008WT5C|4.0|Yes, music fans of today (and the cynical music industry) are still waiting for 'the next big sound...' Well, I hate to tell you, there will never be another big sounding album that rocks like this one...Bon, Angus, Malcom,Phil, and Mark Evans (Cliff will replace him later on)made a legendary pulse pounding album that includes classics like the title track, 'Problem Child' (also on Dirty Deeds) and 'Whole Lotta Rosie'(also as an inside 'joke'was put on the 'Highway to Hell' album)This album  <br />is loud,nasty, and mean.It makes no apologies for songs about boozing, sexual conquests, and an overall bad attitude. This is AC/DC in top form and also marks their second U.S. release. Back in '77, big names like Zeppelin, Floyd, Styx ruled the airwaves.AC/DC actually had to cancel a few gigs in Australia because of rumors that they had 'a bad rep' and were confused with those 'Punk-Rock Riff-Raff'. The greatest true story about this album was while they were in the studio. Angus was belting out his solo for 'Let There Be Rock' when his amp caught on fire.Brother George, who was producing, yelled to Angus, \\"Keep playing!Just keep playing!!\\" That is the mantra for AC/DC. Thank God they just keep playing and continue to put out great albums.As for those cynical suits that run the music biz, look no further. This is your original 'next big sound' and its not coming from wussy, depressing Seattle. It's been here for awhile. Maybe somebody could point out to them where Australia is located on a map! I doubt they even know!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|DO we need another `Pride and Prejudice'? When we have already the excellent 1995 BBC TV mini-series? It depends solely on this - Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy. Without the chemistry between these endearingly headstrong characters, there is no point in making a new film, no matter how much money you spend on the sets and the costumes. <br /> <br />The newest version of Jane Austen classic (`Pride & Prejudice') will be met with skepticism, but as far as Keira Knightley's portrait of this feisty heroine goes, it is a perfect success. Forget her terribly miscast role in `Domino,' and enjoy the film's spirited heroine who learns a thing or two about romance in the late 18th century England.  <br /> <br />Compared with her, Matthew Macfadyen who plays the laconic Mr. Darcy is less advantageous from the first. We have seen impeccable portrait from Colin Firth (and another impeccable one from Laurence Olivier), and who can forget them? Surprisingly, Macfadyen's Darcy turns out a convincing one, the aristocratic image of a person with something repressed deep inside. Unfortunately, he is not allowed to do much in this running time.  <br /> <br />[MODERN TOUCH ALL AROUND] I personally do not find the modernized dialogues exchanged between the characters so irritating as some viewers say. I know the film focuses the original book's romantic side, and gives less attention to the class structure of the Regency Britain. But if you have to make a 2-hour film, something must go. If romance must go, then ... what is the point of making this film anyway? <br /> <br />But I thought first-time director Joe Wright did some missteps during those two hours. He uses too much showy camera works (there is a long one-take sequence in which the camera glides on the dancing floor) while more orthodox way of shooting the scenes are more effective. As to the portraits of the Bennet Family, some might find the eldest sister Jane (Rosamund Pike) is less impressive than she should be, and I for one thought Donald Sutherland, amusing as he is, might be too old for the role of Mr. Bennet. <br /> <br />I know `Pride & Prejudice' should not be compared unfavorably with the previous versions though I was, and am, tempted to do so. Still I heartily enjoyed watching this beautifully-shot, well-acted film, and Ms. Knightley's Elizabeth is genuinely lovely and vivid.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is another incredible example of how Madonna can breathe life and emotion into Electronica.  Her lyrics are one the money and tell about things that everybody can relate to.  Also, unlike a lot of Pop/Dance music, she always has prefect diction so there is no guessing what she is saying. <br /> <br />The music itself is extremely complex, blending classic instruments with synth.  She is constantly pushing the envelope on what can be done with music. <br /> <br />To those who don't like her, I have to say: \\"Your jealousy is transparent, and will never make you better than the sole of her shoe\\".  Obviously, you are not listening with an open mind, and your hatred will destroy you.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Often times, good films will get hyped-up to the max due to word of mouth, and will ultimately dissapoint the audience, because while it may be a good film, it did not live up to their expectations.<br /><br />Even with all the hype, Brokeback Mountain aviods this, becoming not only the most heartbreaking and memorable film of the year, but also of this decade.  There really cannot be enough good things said about this film.<br /><br />It tells the story of Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, two simple cowboys who one summer go up to work at Brokeback Mounatin, and long story short, end up falling in love.  The rest of the movie follows their relationship and the few times they meet over the next 20 years.<br /><br />The direction is perfect, what else can be said?  Ang Lee deserves the Oscar, as he will likely get it.  The scenery alone is worth the price of admission, and I gasped several times just seeing it.<br /><br />The performances will break your heart as well.  Who thought Heath Ledger was capable of giving such a powerful performance after his recent movies, but he does.  Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams, and my personal crush Linda Cardellini also do magnificent jobs.<br /><br />Overall, Brokeback Mountain should be seen by everyone; not just for the political message, which is in itself important, but also to see the best movie of the year, and a landmark cinematic experience.  Anyone who sees it will never forget it, and it has earned all the hype.
B000002KDO|3.0|I'd like to start out by saying that I'm a huge Sabbath fan.  They are one of my favorite bands, their music is some of the best I've ever heard, and most of their albums I'd consider on a genious level.  This album could have been on the level as their other albums, but there is one problem with this album that is so bad its almost unforgivable, and certainly lessens my appreciation of this album - After Forever.  What the hell is this?  The king of freakin' darkness, singing not only about how much he loves Jesus, but HOW MUCH HE HATES PEOPLE WHO DON'T!  This pisses me off beyond beleif, I would have thought that of all people who wouldn't buy into all of that religious bs, it would be Ozzy.  But instead he sounds like some retarded redneck preacher. I keep reading over the lyrics, trying to see if this is possibly some sarcastic joke aimed towards the Jesus freaks, but no I'm pretty sure that Ozzy himself IS A JESUS FREAK.  Ughghhgghghghgh......I'm gonna go barf.  The worst part is that the music of that song isn't too bad, JUST THOSE LYRICS!!! <br /> <br />Lord of This World is awesome.
B00000K2UX|3.0|I wouldn't call this the ultimate 80's soundtrack like some do, I even like \\"Footloose\\" more, and there's too much filler here. But there's no doubt it was huge, and has alot of 80's anthems. Obviously \\"Danger Zone\\" was the song for many a maverick, though I like the almost-gay \\"Playing With The Boys\\" as much. \\"Take My Breath Away\\" was a massive hit for Berlin, even though they were more of a new-wave band really. There's also the minor hit \\"Heaven In Your Eyes\\" from Loverboy. I'll admit the bonus tracks here are a huge bonus, because a few of the added songs are much better than some of what was here before. Truth be known, unless Tom Cruise is your favorite guy ever, or you're Air-Force bound, I'd get the best of Kenny Loggins or Berlin first. That's just me.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Seeing as I have been a fan of Eminem from the very beginning, you might be a bit surprised that I just got this CD a few weeks ago- and it hasn't left my (portable) CD player since.  I got this CD for his smash hit single Stan (the absolute best song on the CD), but quickly fell in love with Bitch Please II and Kill You, two other sweet songs.  Eminem's second CD is what I think started him on the track he's on now: establishing himself as a world-famous rapper with more skills in his left pinkie finger than most other rappers combined.  From a guy that's sure to be a lifelong fan of Slim Shady, adios and rock (or is it rap) on, Em.
068484267X|5.0|A must-read for all ages and cultures. I loved the humour in this heart-breaking narrative. Frank McCourt is a genius and master story-teller. The problem is this is no story. It is a memoir, real-life story. I cannot believe he had such a hard time as a child and turned out so great as a man. All my admiration and of course five fiddlers' farts as stars to this one
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Well this just kicks ass, some ones been watching the matrix.  I am so glad they gave this to the guy who made the game, from the first fight the movie just gets better and better.  You think how can they out do the last fight scene and then bang, they do, right down to the hour or so long fight that just does not end, i am a computer animation student and create CG for a living , this is by a mile the best i have seen, dreamworks etc are so far behind Square Enix in fact everyone is.  I cant just explain what your missing if you dont get this, its just brilliant and pure genious of the imagination, buy it, u wont regret it!
B00005JNX0|5.0|A WONDERFUL animated comedy, Madagascar, brings to the screen the story of four animals who escape from the zoo in NYC and the \\"sheltered life\\" they had been living there only to end up in the wilderness on the island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa, with all the ups and downs that that entails!   <br />Madagascar is a film about friendship, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, integrity and inner strength.   <br />Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT! <br />In short, Madagascar is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek movies, Antz, and Monsters Inc. <br />
B0002IQEHI|4.0|The film starts in late 1950s Manhattan, showing an &#34;advertising executive&#34; Roger Thornhill who is skilled in lying to the public as part of his employment by corporations. Roger attends a meeting, calls for a pageboy, and winds up being abducted in plain view of the public! (Danger in public is a common theme in thrillers, as is mistaken identification.) Roger cannot tell his captors what they want to hear (even if they used torture), so they fill him with bourbon and take him for a ride. This provides an entertaining interlude until Roger stops for the police and is arrested by Sgt. Emil Klinger. The Judge orders an investigation, but they find nothing amiss at the borrowed estate. [No check with the local police?] Roger discovers that no one has actually seen George Kaplan. The abductors show up at the hotel, but Roger escapes one again. [No back-up?] When Roger meets Lester Townsend at the UN, a knife silences Townsend permanently, and Roger is blamed for it.   The &#34;Professor&#34; discusses this at the Agency in Washington, where we learn what is really going on - decoy spy. Roger must become his own detective to solve this mystery. The film shows travel on the famous New York Central railroad to Chicago, a bit of history long gone. Roger meets a woman, Eve Kendall, who helps and befriends him. [Was this a theme in the old E. Philip Oppenheim stories?] But we soon learn she is working for Van Dam! Roger arrives in Chicago, then travels to a spot in a flat prairie, and waits. Could there be any danger in the wide open spaces? A crop duster appears to answer this question; there seems to be no escape. The plane crashes (!) and Roger escapes once again. [Wily Coyote could take lessons from him.]   Roger meets Eve but is told to go away and never return. There is something mysterious about Eve. Note how Hitchcock was able to create suspense and tension from ordinary life. Roger follows Eve, meets Van Dam and his flunky Leonard, but escapes again. Now the&#34;Professor&#34; meets Roger and takes him to Rapid City SD. There is yet another meeting with Van Dam, Leonard, and Eve. Eve shoots Roger, who is carried away by the &#34;Professor&#34;. More events follow as the details of the spy ring are brought out. Eve and Roger make a getaway by climbing down the sculptures of Mount Rushmore. They escape from their pursuers who are caught by the authorities. And so the film has a happy ending, if forced.   This was a top film in its day, but now it seems terribly out of date. Films such as &#34;From Russia With Love&#34; or &#34;Goldfinger&#34; are better and less dated than what was Hitchcock's best film. Roger complains against the &#34;Professor&#34; for sacrificing people like pawns, although we learned more in future years. [The &#34;Professor&#34; was a fictionalized version of Allen Dulles, some say.] This film is an updated version of &#34;The Thirty-Nine Steps&#34;.  One of the problems in this film is the crop-duster plane. It would be more probable to send out a car with two men to take Roger for a ride, but less spectacular. This comment also applies to the helicopter in &#34;From Russia With Love&#34;. Do they copy each other's mistakes?
0316779237|5.0|I was sitting on an airlpane reading this book and the gentleman next to me asked me if I was \\"OK\\". I was uncontrollably laughing. Even after trying to put it down for a few minutes and gaining my composure, it was a fruitless attempt because within seconds I was embarrassing myself again.
B0006L0LOS|2.0|How did this ever get made?  Oh this movie was so so bad.  While Halle Berry seems to have worked hard enough to make a name for herself, this movie set her back past Square One.  She has to reestablish herself all over again thanks to this tripe. <br /> <br />Halle Berry plays a churchmouse clerk named Patience at a cosmetics company that is about to introduce a new beauty cream.  When she discovers that this new miracle product has tragic side effects, she is done away with by the top executives of the company.  She survives the attack and becomes the inner vamp, Catwoman. <br /> <br />While this is certainly true to the roots of Catwoman in the comics, this movie is so terrible it's almost painful.  Halle Berry is acting like a cat (the jerky movements watching fish in an aquarium, liking sushi, etc.) and it looks ridiculous rather than insightful method acting.  The plot descintegrates as she is attempting to battle the evil corporation from releasing this product, her relationship with Bejamin Bratt goes to weirdness, and we are treated to little if anything than looking at her perfectly fit, cut body in those skin tight leathers with a whip. <br /> <br />Why 2 stars rather than 1?  Sharon Stone was pretty good in this movie, despite what she had to work with she is a great actress.  Plus on the special features section, we see a history of Catwoman hosted by Eartha Kitt which is very good.  Catwoman is a great character, the inner vamp that no one, not even Batman himself can catch, but this movie was weak, campy and just plain bad.
0064407667|5.0|I thought that this book was a good book. I liked the way its said if you like nice ending stories then you should not keep on reading but if you liked it then that was the kind of books that you would like to read. <br /> <br />This book takes place in different parts of the United States, there is a family named the Baudelaire's the oldest is Violet,Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire were intelligent children, they were charming but also resourceful, and had pleasant facial features, but they were unlucky children, and most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune, misery, and despair. All this misforutune happened on a day at the Briny beach. This book is about there parents dieing in there house because of a fire and so they have to move with there realitives since they have no were to go. <br /> <br />Towards the end of the book there uncle finds out that they have a big fortune and wants Violet to marry him so that he can get his hands on that money. So he tries everything so that they can leave there other realitives and make them go with him. So I cant tell you the rest you will just have to read the book yourself.
B000056NX5|5.0|First let me say that comparing this to the Norman Jewison 70's movie version is like comparing apples and oranges. The staging of this movie is completely different from the original, as is the feeling- it is a much darker version and gives a much more chilling feel of the political factors in place during the time of Jesus. It is also much more violent and graphic in its depiction of the torture and crucifiction of Jesus. <br /> <br />That being said, I enjoyed this every bit as much as I enjoyed the 70's movie and the original concept albumn, although for completely different reasons. Jerome Pradon as Judas is absolutely incredible and manages the extremely difficult job of turning Judas into a character we like and have sympathy for. He and Glen Carter do an excellent job of showing the depth of their relationship; it is clear that both of them are wrapped up in something over which they have no control. <br /> <br />Renee Castle as Mary Magdalene has an amazing voice and completely upstages the terrible portrayal by Yvonne Elliman in the 70's movie. She and Calvin Cornwall as Peter sing a haunting version of a song missing from the 70's movie and the concept albumn, \\"Can We Start Again Please?\\" This movie shows the shock and helplessness felt by the apostles. <br /> <br />Rik Mayall's interpretation of Herod as a Las Vegas-style performer is brilliant, and is later recalled during Pradon's performance of Jesus Christ Superstar. <br /> <br />A discordant note for me was Fred Johanson as Pilate- he bellows out his songs but is just not convincing as the Roman regent who is also swept up in something beyond his control. <br /> <br />My first thought on watching Glen Carter's protrayal was that he is a mighty touchy-feeley Jesus. The more often I watch the film, the more annoyed I get by the way he constantly tosses his hair around and remains ever conscious of his role as a martyr. <br /> <br />My family and I like to speculate on our dream cast for Jesus Christ Superstar. We would definitely take the Mary Magdalene, Judas and Peter from this movie and Barry Dennem's Pilate from the 70's movie. We are undecided as to which Herod we would use, Rik Marall or Josh Mostel, but we run into a real problem when trying to pick our favorite Jesus. The jury is still out on that one as far as I'm concerned-- if only Glenn Carter weren't quite so vain and Tim Neeley weren't quite so wimpy. <br /> <br />However, the strong performances of the other actors for the most part make up for my annoyance with Carter. Is this movie better than the 70's version? No. Just different. They seem like completely different musicals. My guess is that people who love the music and who loved the original will love this one as well. My speculation is that many people who were offended by the first version will find this version much more to their liking. I like both of them.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Shawn Ryan's raw, gritty and excellent The Shield on the FX Channel gives the well-worn cop-drama genre a lethal dose of adrenaline. The Shield is not your dad's old type of cop show. Where shows like Law and Order (and its many spin-offs) shows cops at their honorable best, Ryan's series shows that there are also tragically flawed men who wear police blues.<br /><br />The Shield and its main character Vic Mackey (excellently played by Michael Chiklis) shows the dark, seedy underbelly of police work in a multi-ethnic district of Los Angeles. The show uses the real-life, scandal of the LAPD's RAMPART Division and runs with it. Instead of South Central, the show primarily uses the fictional LA district of Farmington as their base of operation. It is an area rife with gang activity, violence and drug-dealing. There's also the racial divisions between the Latino and black communities always in danger of bursting into open violence. Through all this lies Vic Mackey and his RAMPART-like Strike Team. Right from the pilot episode we see that Vic and his men are the true power in Farmington as they try to hold the peace between rival gangs and drug dealers. The Strike Team's intentions are noble, but they've also become so much a part of the problem that they do not see their amoral and corrupt tactics as anything bad. They see things in their district on the verge of anarchy and decided that the only way to save it is to use any means necessary.<br /><br />The Shield pushes the boundaries of basic-cable shows and teeters right over the edge. All the episodes are well-written with stories and topics seemingly ripped from the headlines. The first season runs the gamut from police corruption, child pornography, rapes, murders, gang violence and cop-killing. These stories are not doen with the aim of titillation and gratuitous violence and sex just for its sake. Ryan and company create the stories to show that all the news of downtrodden neighborhoods and Wild West-styled policing are all too real and can be ignored. The ensemble cast surrounding Michael Chiklis also needs to be commended for keeping the gritty and realistic tone of the show from ever becoming over-the-top and sensationalist. Stand-out performances by Walter Goggins as Vic's reckless, racist partner in the team and that of CCH Pounder as the mirror opposite of Vic just shows that all the accolades heaped upon this show has been well-deserved and well-earned.<br /><br />I can't say enough about The Shield to convey how excellent a show it is. The show doesn't pull its punches in dealing with its characters and its controversial topics. Instead Shawn Ryan and his actors infuses the show with realistic grit and uncompromised storytelling. A new series usually grows on me overtime as the early episodes tries to find the show's personality, but the pilot and its shocking cop-killing by a major character hooked me from the start and I have been a loyal devotee of Vic and his Strike Team. The Shield and Vic Mackey have become the Dirty Harry of the new millenium.olicing are all too real and can be ignored.

B00008EY65|3.0|I liked this movie. I never read the graphic novels or anything so I didn't know the story but when I first saw the trailer I thought... this looks cool. I wasn't wrong. I thought Ron Pearlman was perfect as Big Red and the cast was really good. Even Selma Blair who I think is a weak actress was good. John Hurt was excellent as usual.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes it was a bit weak in some spots but it was fun. I liked the whole premise of Hellboy. The Rasputin stuff was good and the villians were excellent. I just wish they would have concentrated more on the Nazi villians (Rasputin, his female stooge and the Nazi guy with the blades... he was cool). They kind of had too much of Hellboy battling the 'hounds of hell' thing too much. But it was still entertaining and fun and had a lot of good puns and humor. I liked the triangle between Hellboy, Liz and the young FBI guy.<br /><br />Fun flick and worth buying.
B000A59PMO|4.0|WARNING:  PLOT SPOILERS<br /><br />I had been tempted to buy this series by all the high reviews it received on Amazon, but what really clinched it for me was Stephen King's nod in  an article he wrote for an entertainment magazine.<br /><br />While I found the series entertaining, I was not obsessed with watching it as I do when I find a series to be really good.  In fact, I had to push myself to finish it.  Sometimes I would fall asleep while watching it.<br /><br />All this changed with Veronica and Logan's first kiss.  It's as if this event sparked the series and gave it an interesting edge.  The chemistry between the 2 is great, and Logan is just such an interesting character.  I disliked him tremendously at the beginning, and then found myself rooting for him to the point that I hope he is the one at Veronica's door (cliffhanger at the end of season 1).<br /><br />However, I was disturbed by the following inconsistencies in the show:<br /><br />1.  Veronica Mars' metamorphosis from popular, carefree and superficial teenager (before Lilly's murder) to mature, conscientious, justice-seeking, courageous sleuth (after Lilly's murder) is just not believable.  There is nothing in those flashbacks to suggest she had IT in her.  We do not see how someone who was so sweet, innocent and sheltered could become so hard-edged and cynical.<br /><br />2. At the beginning I found the show to depict a very dark, aggressive high-school environment.  I don't remember high school being like that, but maybe that's they way things are these days.<br /><br />3.  It is highly unlikely that someone who is so much in love with her ex would destroy DNA test results that could prove he is not her half brother, especially someone who is a \\"detective\\".<br /><br />4.  I did not like her disguises on a couple of shows.  It made me think the creators were trying to go for a Sidney Bristow (Alias) in high school.<br /><br />All this said, Veronica Mars, did manage to hook me, even though it was towards the end, and even though I guessed who Lilly's murderer was 3 shows before the last one.<br /><br />I will buy the second season and hope the writers will have worked out the kinks.hook me, even though it was towards the end, and even though I guessed who Lilly's murderer was 3 shows before the last one. <br /> <br />I will buy the second season and hope the writers will have worked out the kinks.   <br /> <br />    <br /> <br />
B00000DLUV|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD. I remember the Bee Gees from their Satruday Night Fever Soundtrack and of course their days during the disco era. I also have a couple of their albums on vinyl including the one with Nights on Broadway, a song that I can still remember my sister playing as a kid.<br /><br />I must say that this CD was a joy. First to hear the Bee Gees performing all their songs live was fantastic. They do a lot of their songs from the early hits to the later ones. Some of the older songs, before they were big in the disco era, are just wonderful. Also hearing The Bee Gees performing some of the songs that Barry Gibb wrote that were hits for others like Islands in the Stream and Grease is also great. And lastly I loved hearing them crank it up and do all their disco hits without all the studio synthesizers and tricks. And when Barry said, \\"this song is for Andy\\"... man that was really a wonderfully emotional moment.<br /><br />Great CD!
158799190X|5.0|This book is strictly not an investment book. Even then Jack Schwager, the author of Market Wizard, described this book as one of his picks for the 5 best books about markets ever written. I agree. <br /> <br />As a value investor, I find him at odds with some of the cherished views I hold about the stock market. To Taleb, Warren Buffet may well be a lucky fool. Where we find common ground is on the futility of predicting price movements, the tendency to see order in random events and the deficiency in heuristic models. As a options trader, the book validates some of my trading methods and provides the intellectual underpinning of the strategies I used. More precisely, the book allows me to trade without the pretense that I know tomorrow's prices. <br /> <br />This is not a \\"How To Trade Book\\". The value of this book is that it challenges your underlying assumptions of what you know and can know about the markets. It is a book of epistemology, the theory of knowledge, as applied to life and the markets. This book questions the limit of knowledge, and then explores how one can exploit the markets despite this limit and how not to be destroyed by the uncertainty. <br /> <br />If this review makes it sound too much like a textbook on the Philosophy of Statistical Methods, I apologize. Taleb does not speak as a ivory tower academic professor of finance, but as a practitioner, a hardened hedge fund manager who have survived the trenches. This book is written to educate, as much as it is to entertain. The narratives show Taleb as a master storyteller, and his use of everyday events like the OJ Simpson trial to explain statistics, makes you want to sign up for his class.  <br /> <br /> <br />Reviewed by <br /> <br />Not A Lemming <br />Editor, <br />Mr Market - Musing of a Value Investor <br />[...] <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Jeff Bridges should have got an academy award for playing the laziest,slacker, burn out of all time. From top to bottom this movie is GREAT. Sam Elliot as the narrator, John Goodman as my dad... er I mean as Walter the Viet Nam vet who flys off the handle at everything, Steve Beuschemi as Donnie (\\"Shut the 'F' up Donnie), The Big Lebowski and his henchman Phillip Seymore Hoffman, Lebowski's wife Bunny, The Nihilist, John Tutturo as Jesus the bowler (don't 'F' with the Jesus), I could go on and on. All the characters are funny as hell and origional. The story is hilarious. The dialouge again, hilarious. The direction by the Coen brothers is fantastic. This movie could actually be perfect if their is such a thing.

B0001XTIUO|5.0|Man did I miss the boat... what was in the water between 1965 and 1975?! This is one of those albums that I instantly knew I was going to love, just by looking at the cover. I just knew... ok this girl is cool lol!  <br /> <br />The opener \\"Chimacum Rain\\" is just one of those songs that stays with you for days after listening to it. The meandering vocal melody over a soft, pensive guitar arrangement has such a simple power to it. Multi-tracking the voice makes this song wash over the listener the way a soft drizzle of rain would. MAGIC! The rest of the album is just as wonderful. Each song is distinct, and manages to retain its own personality while remaining part of a whole. Linda's voice is one of the best I've heard on any folk recording. She has the playful, bouncy phrasing of early Joni, with a soaring  tonal beauty that at times is reminiscent of Joan Baez.  Linda Perhacs has this unique ability to sound optimistic yet never naive, haunting while never depressing. She is the kind of girl that I could fall in love with 1,000 times over!    <br /> <br />As I was reading through the CD jacket I noticed that special thanks were given to both Mikael Akerfeldt and Peter Lindgren from Opeth, as well as Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree who has produced three Opeth albums. I was really happy to see that because I'm a huge Opeth fan (have been for many years now), and it's nice to know that they were involved in the reissuing of this amazing album. Anyway, I highly recommend Parallelograms to anyone who has stumbled across this page, or anyone curious about Linda Perhacs. It is a truly wonderful album, and more people need to know about it!
B000E1NWGO|5.0|Rubinstein knew all 32 of Beethoven's Sonatas by heart, but in public and on record, limited himself to the most popular half dozen or so. The four Sonatas on this CD--originally recorded at RCA Italiana Studios in the early 1960s--were, with the five Concertos, the core of Rubinstein's Beethoven repertoire.<br /><br />Rubinstein's approach to the Pathetique is characteristic of his Beethoven playing: Tempos are sensible, avoiding extremes of speed or slowness; phrasing is devoid of artifice; pedaling is sparser than Beethoven's written indications, but many of Beethoven's contemporaries claim Beethoven over-pedaled; repeats are generally taken. Some purists will object to the way Rubinstein plays some of the grace notes and ornaments in the first movement, but there has been no conclusive evidence either way on the \\"correct\\" manner to handle them (Beethoven probably didn't care anyway).<br /><br />This CD contains Rubinstein's only recording of the inescapable Moonlight Sonata. He performed it in public several times during the 1962-1963 season, and then dropped it from his repertoire. The first movement is played simply, even a little dryly, as is the second movement. But Rubinstein lets loose in the Finale, bringing the work to a stunning close. Nobody else could hit a piano that hard and still create such a beautiful sound.<br /><br />The Appassionata was a favorite of Rubinstein's. He featured it in his earliest concert performances, played it almost to the end of his career, and recorded it three times. This recording is more successful than the previous two (the first was almost comically slapdash). Max Wilcox, the producer of the original recording, has noted that this was one of the few times Rubinstein became hampered in the recording studio, and many takes were required before Rubinstein was satisfied. But one could never guess that from listening to the resulting performance, it is totally organic and betrays no hint of being spliced together.<br /><br />The Les Adieu Sonata rounds out the album, bringing a joyous conclusion to a wonderful recording.<br /><br />RCA's SACD remastering has not radically altered the sound picture, but there is a greater sense of space around the piano.  The packaging recreates the original cover art and liner notes.<br />The Les Adieu Sonata rounds out the album, bringing a joyous conclusion to a wonderful recording.  <br /> <br />RCA's SACD remastering has not radically altered the sound picture, but there is a greater sense of space around the piano.

B000002L9J|5.0|I'm fairly new to the smiths, having only started listening to them in the past 6 months or so. I was recommended the queen is dead by fellow Radiohead lovers like myself. Intially, I was taken back my Morrissey's voice, even though I was used to Thom Yorke's 'whiney' voice. Song by song, melody by melody, the album came into focus. Lead guitarist Johnny Marr's melodies don't bang themselves over your head with their beauty, they infect your head long after, leaving you wanting more.  <br /> <br />And the lyrics? My favorite of any album I've listened to. Sure, some of Morrissey's lyrics can be defined as 'depressing', but it's presented with the infectious and poppy melodies that still make it a joy to listen to. <br /> <br />Let this album sink in for a while. Don't be turned off by Morrissey's unique voice, for it is (along with his lyrics) the best part about the smiths. I've still got loyalties to Radiohead, who remain my favorite band perhaps because they've produced more music, but The Smiths have become my second favorite band, mainly due to this album.

B00005JO20|5.0|The new \\"King Kong\\" is one of the most epic action/adventure movies ever, a mega-budget blockbuster done the way mega-budget blockbusters oughtta be (but often aren't): that is, involving great characters (human or otherwise) in a great high-octane story that's fascinating, emotionally powerful, and completely engaging on many levels.  This is, without question, the real deal. <br /> <br />   Set in the Great Depression, a number of struggling and/or out-of-luck actors, actresses, film crewmen and a playright, and an oceangoing ship's crew, all find themselves cajoled, persuaded, conned or otherwise weaseled by shifty but humorous filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black, who alternates masterfully between being the underdog-with-a-dream you want to root for and the pompous, manipulative, pretentious little schmuck you want a giant gorilla to come along and stomp on) into sailing across the world to an uncharted island.  On this mysterious island whose location Denham has somehow become privy to, he plans to film his latest masterpiece, a work that he's certain will bring him worldwide fame, vast wealth and immortal respect, as certain as he was with each of his previous movies which went by with moderate (at most) success each time.  His enthusiasm for his project isn't shared by the studio he tries to get financing from, so he secures their support by setting sail in the dead of night before the studio has a chance to pull their technicians and film equipment from the boat where they were staying when the studio was actually thinking of funding Denham's film. <br /> <br />   A good portion of the film's early going is taken up with odd but effective humor, but things change when the ship comes upon Skull Island itself, where the characters - and in particular Ann Darrow (brilliantly played by Naomi Watts from \\"The Ring\\" and \\"The Ring Two\\") find themselves encountering the ruins of an apparantly once-thriving and possibly quite advanced civilization, the remnants of theisland's human population, a plethora of live dinosaurs (including a race of predators the size of tyrannosaurs with the speed and agility of velociraptors), ferocious giant bugs, and of course the most jaw-dropping titan of them all, the one the island's survivors fear and worship: Kong. <br /> <br />  You probably know a lot more of what happens next if you saw even a sliver of the ad blitz that engulfed everything in the months before the movie's release (MUST they show So much in the previews?) but in case you're like me and try to avoid seeing too much in advance I won't get too much into specifics of the rest of the movie.  Just a few generalizations: there are epic confrontations, scenes of tremendous beauty and tenderness, mountain-sized thrills and scares, more strange humor that somehow manages to work with the huge nature of the film instead of throwing a monkeywrench into it, and a fair bit of insight into mankind's quest for wonder and awe, and the dichotomy between that quest and the way man often ends up corrupting or destroying the dreams it does attain.  And mention must be made of the outstanding effects, particularly on the King himself.  You can read Kong's emotions and state of mind brilliantly through facial expressions and body language, to an extent where it's hard to believe it's not all real.  All this in one movie, one of the biggest and boldest and best ever.
6305252572|4.0|Nick Nolte had been trying to capitalize on his Rich Man, Poor Man fame but to no avail.  Eddie Murphy was trying to capitalize his fame from Saturday Night Live.  This film launched Eddie Murphy's film career but just slightly helped Nolte. <br /> <br />A convict is broken off the chain gang.  He goes back to San Francisco to get the loot he left behind.  Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) is a police officer.  On his way into the precinct, he runs hears a call.  He stops to back up the two officers on a stolen credit card alert.  What he doesn't know is that Ganz (James Remar) and Billy Bear are the thieves.  When a dead man is part of the gang, Jack goes to talk to the remaining member of the gang, Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy).  Reggie talks Jack into springing him to catch Ganz.  They have 48 hours to catch Ganz. <br /> <br />This partnership leads to a series of hilarious scenes.  The most famous is Reggie going to a redneck bar and pretending to be a cop to get information on Billy Bear. (This isn't as funny as it was 20 years ago but still you will laugh).  And it has some great chases including one with a stolen bus. <br /> <br />This film was the proving ground for Murphy but he would not become a star until he visited Beverly Hills.  Murphy and Nolte had a good chemistry but after seeing the sequel, it was probably more great writing and directing then the two of them. <br /> <br />This is a film with a great mix of action and humor.  The action part is no surprise as director Walter Hill is famous for his action films.  But the humor is pure Murphy. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B00008EYA5|4.0|I have seen a lot of negative reviews here for this movie. I think this movie is not that bad at all. If you have liked \\"Speed\\", you will probably like \\"S.W.A.T\\" too. The actions are great, and so is the photography. The director has used his imagination and with the camera he managed to get some excellent shots for the movie. However, I was little disappointed by the acting of Samuel L. Jackson, and Michelle Rodriguez (actually not expected anything from her, she has an emotionless face), but Colin Farrell, and Olivier Martinez looked great throughout the movie.<br /><br />Sometimes, the movie get slow, but soon picks up with action and keeps the audience on their seat. I agree with one of the reviewer that the movie is more mechanical thriller, but still it's worth a watch. The DVD I got had all the features, except the eight deleted scenes mentioned here. The sound effects are great and you will enjoy this movie if you have a 5.1 home theater system.
6305364648|4.0|Harry and Helen Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis) are just your average ordinary married couple.  That's what Helen thinks until she finds out that her ordinary husband is a secret agent.  Both lives collide and both Harry and Helen must save the world and themselves. <br /> <br />As I have said before, what Arnold does best is action with a hint of comedy.  This is exactly that.  To add to this is Jamie Lee Curtis.  She inherited her father's natural comedy sense and handles the action scenes perfectly.  The only negative is Tom Arnold as Arnold's sidekick.

B000001ESJ|5.0|Before I say anything, I would like to point out that YES, most of this is an acquired taste. To be honest, when I first heard Rush, I didn't like them very much at all. I thought Geddy Lee sounded like a girl and it was too sissy for me. Well, a bit later I heard \\"Spirit of Radio\\" (from Permanent Waves, I believe) for the first time, and I was like \\"Wow, are these the same guys?\\" I gave up my previous thoughts and started to delve deeper into Rush's music. <br /> <br />This is, quite possibly, the best progressive rock  album ever. Although it clocks in at under 40 minutes and has but 6 songs, this is more than enough. The title track is incredible. When you first pop in the album, you are greeted with a medieval guitar feast courtesy of Alex Lifeson. Then some glockenspiels and bells enter, and you are greeted with a wall of classic Rush rock. After going through a quick time chnge, Geddy's melodic voice enters and the song is over far too quickly. Masterpiece. After \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" fades away, there are several seconds of silence, then some very odd sounds come creeping in. Water running? Birds chirping? Is this an outdoor sound collection that will promote unity of the heart and mind (no \\"Hemispheres\\" reference intended)? Nope. It's the 11 minute classic \\"Xanadu\\". After several minutes of these sounds (plus the occasional drum beat or guitar part), the song's intro, a \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\"-esque single note riff comes at you. The rest of the song takes you on a rockin' quest for immortality in eastern lands unknown. You have to hear it to understand. The next song, \\"Closer to the Heart\\", needs no explanation. If any, this is the Rush song you will hear on the radio. Very accesible, with no odd time signatures or vivid poetry to deter Rush newbies. In under 3 minutes, number 4, \\"Cinderalla Man\\", comes in. Hmm. I like this song, really. It's got some cool acoustic parts and a chorus that gets me every time. It's not really a jump-out Rush song like, say, \\"Anthem\\" or \\"2112\\" or \\"Bastille Day\\", but that doesn't mean it's not good stuff. It's written by Geddy, so you don't have to worry about intricate Randian writings. <br /> <br />The next song, \\"Madrigal\\", passes me by, really. It's kind of gone. I've actually never listened to it very well. But, from what I've heard, it's pretty slow and mellow. MELLOW. What a fun word. <br />The next song is probably my favorite song of all time. I am, of course, talking about the epic tower of power that is \\"Cygnus X-1\\" (Book 1: The Voyage). Try listening to this song at night. I did it in bed when I was 12, and to be honest, I was terrified. This song will pound you into submission with volleys of rapidly changing time signatures, banshee screams from Geddy, power chord rampages and some very great drum parts from Neil Peart. <br />Nightmares aside, this song will get you every time. It's about a man who flies his ship, the \\"Rocinante\\" into the black hole of Cygnus X-1 (It's actually a real black hole. Look it up.). A spooky background of space creaks and groans clearly puts you up there as an eerie sci-fi voice explains your situation. Then, the Rocinante takes off and you are sent hurling into a musical void. Several bells toll, and a distant bass riff gets louder and louder. Eventually, all 3 parties join in and an odd time signature romp gets in play. After several minutes of a headbanger's paradise (Ok...Xanadu), the black hole reminds you of its role and begins to pull you in. You are battered by power chords until, once again, an odd time signature batters its way in. The black hole tugs and tugs, until Geddy's quiet voice comes out. Suddenly, all three members explode into action, Geddy wailing all the while. Then comes the brief period of happy music comes in as Alex plays some very happy chords (C, F, D, G) as Geddy comes back to his normal pitch. Once again, Cygnus intervenes and it's back to the hole. Alex breaks out into a wah drenched solo before all goes quiet... or is it? Some barely audible notes are battered until Geddy and Neil hammer in. Then a wall of sound hits you right where it hurts. The weirdest time signature I think Rush has ever used pummels you and doesn't let go. The song ends with Geddy screaming at the top of his lungs and several dim chords fading out. <br /> <br />To be continued... (go buy \\"Hemispheres\\") <br /> <br />Here's my ratings: <br /> <br />A Farewell to Kings- 5/5 <br />Xanadu- 5/5 <br />Closer to the Heart- 5/5 <br />Cinderalla Man- 4.5/5 <br />Magrigal- 4/5 <br />Cygnus X-1- 5/5 <br /> <br />This CD is probably not for a Rush newbie. Try \\"Moving Pictures\\", or their debut album for better results. But if you feel like you're ready for it, I humbly invite you to dine on honeydew and drink the milk of paradise while you get out \\"A Farewell to Kings\\".
6304806442|5.0|The reason I originally wanted to see the film was when I was in London, there was a stage production of the book which got rave reviews.  I did not get a chance to see it but there was a lot of press about Trainspotting mania in the UK.  When the film came out I wanted to see it but found out it was about drugs and became leery of it.  Since it got great reviews, I went and saw it and was surprised.  It was my favorite film of the year! <br /> <br />The film deals with four friends that are caught up in the Scottish drug culture.  The hero of the film is Renton (Ewan McGregor).  His best friends are Sick boy, Begbie, Tommy and Spud.  All but Tommy are heroine addicts.  Renton decides to go cold turkey.  But before cold turkey, one last hit.  (This leads to one of the most disgusting yet intriguing fantasy sequences.)  Renton finds it hard to stay clean and slips.  He gets caught stealing and is forced to enter rehab.  Afterwards, he gets a reality check from his underage girlfriend.  He realizes that he cannot live this life forever.   <br /> <br />Renton decides he needs to break away from his crew and moves to London for a fresh start.  But Begbie shows up then Sick Boy.  This is hampering his sobriety and kicks them out.  But the boys have to return home for a mate's funeral and there luck into a big score.  They return to London to sell their score. <br /> <br />I generally hate films that are narrated but it works here.  Even more, I hate movies that in any way glamorize drugs but this really doesn't, even the fantasy sequences are not glamorous.  This is just a great look at the subculture. <br /> <br />This is one of director's Danny Boyle's first films and he creates near perfection.  The only actor with any true film background is Robert \\"The Full Monty\\" Carlisle but everyone is universally great.  Ewan McGregor will not become a star until later but this shows his ability. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|I don;t get how this CD got nominated in first place and then landed some major Grammy awards?  Released in November 23, 2004, didn't they already get a Grammy last year for the same stuff? <br /> <br />Hey Grammy/Music Industry Leaders!! - I lost my faith in you or music!  A real artist wouldn't really care to get your stupid award, cause you know what?!? U2 sucks! oh what a horrible album for God's sake!
1563894696|4.0|I picked up The Long Halloween just recently. Let me tell you I'm glad I did. Even though it is set around the same time Year One is, and in fact continues from that time, it is not a direct sequel. My self I was wanting to see Joker and Batman's first face off but this wasn't it. However I was treated to one hell of a read. This is Batman at his best.<br /><br />Another great thing about this book we get to see Harvey Dent become Two-Face. We meet the man before he became the monster. What drove him, what made him have to pursue the criminals, and way Batman feels responsible for what happened. This is one of the greatest stories ever told.<br /><br />The mystery is kept to the very end. Hard to see coming but well worth it. If you like Batman this is well worth the money and time it takes. Do your self a favor get this book.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|In the Far side of Romania, lies the country of Transvilvania- home of many nightmarish creatures including the evil and undestroyable Count Dracula and the only man who can can kill this blood sucker is Van Helsing. Inspired by Universal's classic horror films \\"Dracula\\" \\"Frankenstein\\" and \\"the Wolf Man\\" comes this thrilling action packed adventure from Stephen Sommers, the director of \\"the Mummy\\" \\"the Mummy Returns\\" Starring Hugh Jackman as the notiorous monster hunter who dedicates his life to vanquishing evil creatures, as he battles Count Dracula, the Wolf Man and he encounters the Frankenstein Monster with a Beautiful Woman with a family lasting mission to destroy Dracula. It's a spectular great visual effects filled thrill ride, an amazing landmark Universal film that pays homage to the classic horror films. If you like monsters, adventure and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, then see \\"Van Helsing\\" it's monsterous entertaining experience that I hope has a sequel. \\"My Job, my Life, my Curse is to Vanquish Evil\\"
1401206905|5.0|Batman Year One is truly where Batman begins. Through the years I've read issues of Detective and Batman's different series but never really got into them. I had seen the movies, watched the cartoons, and played with the toys; that was enough for me. Then Batman Begins came out in theaters. It sparked an interest like nothing else had. So I set out to see what Batman was all about.<br /><br />That's when I was turned to Frank Millers Year One. You can tell from the very beginning that the people behind the movie where influenced heavily by this material. The story is Bruce Wayne taking on the persona of Batman and his first year. It is great to see him go up against gangsters while being a detective.<br /><br />The only down side about this book is that the art is very stylized. It is not for everyone that is for sure. It took me a while to get used to it but after I did wow. The story is well worth the read. This is an excellent place to start for anyone who wants to get into Batman.<br /><br />The deluxe edition is awesome because you get to see some of the sketches and other work that went into this book. Pick this up for the ultimate collector even if they have Year One all ready.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a movie EVERYONE should see.  It's a sensitive and non-offensive (assuming you don't hate gay people) simple story about two guys who discover they love each other.  It has been mislabeled as a \\"gay cowboy\\" movie.  These guys are bisexual, not gay.  Gay men don't marry women and have children, at least not the gay men I know.  It's all about being who you are and dealing with who you are and not living a lie.  Ennis never figured that out until he lost Jake.  All of the straight folks I have talked to who have seen the movie said that it opened their eyes about how gay people can feel the same emotions they do and how universal love is.  I hope it opens more eyes too.  Take your S.O.
B00097A5I6|1.0|What the heak is this junk, how did Oasis ever seriously think anyone would want to listen to this waffle. <br />There is'nt one decent song, and album by album they keep going in the wrong direction, it all started with \\"Be Here Now\\", and they've just been getting worse and worse since. They hit rock bottom with Heathen Chemistry despite that album shining with a few glimmers of hope. <br /> <br />Time will only tell whether they'll ever get better or get worse.
0307276902|1.0|My brother is a recovering addict and I know what he went  through to get clean and what he goes through to stay clean. This book was like the soap opera of the year, and so was the man who wrote it. I think he should practice his own twelve step program, if he is in one, and think about how to make amends not only to the readers he scamed but to the addicts whose honest pathways through recovery seem diminished by what he did.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|I agree with the assessments here - \\"Stay\\" was underrated, poorly marketed, mis-targeted (*not* a horror film), etc.  Definitely a film you've got to see twice to see how it all fits together.  I found myself at the end recalling all the things Ryan Gosling said (\\"I hear voices\\") and got really juiced at how it all fit together so perfectly.  It's maybe one of the best endings to a movie ever.  Quite the sudden and stunning denouement.  You gotta love a movie with a denouement...and Naomi Watts.
0553296981|4.0|+++++<br /><br />(Note that this review is for the book published by Bantam in July, 1993.)<br /><br />\\"It's an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary...because it seems to me that...[not one person]...will be interested in the [outpouring of thoughts] of a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl.  Still, what does that matter?  I want to write, but more than that, I want to bring out all kinds of things that lie buried deep in my heart...I want this diary itself to be my friend, and I shall call my friend Kitty.\\"  (Partial diary entry June 20, 1942.)<br /><br />This particular book consists of four parts.  In the order they are presented, they are as follows:<br /><br />(1) IMAGES from the life and diary of Anne Frank.  Over ten black and white pictures are presented.  (I only understood what some of these pictures meant after I read Anne Frank's diary.)<br />(2) INTRODUCTION by Eleanor Roosevelt.  These are the last words of this very brief introduction: \\"Reading [Anne's diary] is a rich and rewarding experience.\\"<br />(3) DIARY.  Covers a period of just over two years.  Only a few days of each month have a diary entry.  Some terms in the diary entries have helpful footnotes provided by the translator.<br />(4) AFTERWORD consisting of three sections.  Here we are told that: \\"The experiences that Anne described [in her diary] become perhaps even more meaningful when seen in their immediate historical context.  It is the purpose of this brief Afterword to provide at least the outlines of that context and to bring Anne's own story to its conclusion.\\"  (I thought that the information of section (I) was crucial for getting the most from Anne's diary and thus it should have been presented before the actual diary.)<br /><br />This is a non-fictional diary kept by a German-Jewish teenager.  Anne was eventually forced to go and remain in hiding due to the Nazi persecution of the Jews of Europe.  Roughly, from her thirteenth birthday to a few months after her fifteenth birthday, Anne Frank recorded her feelings, emotions, and thoughts, as well as the events that happened to her.<br /><br />With her parents and her older teenage sister, and another family (two parents with their teenage son), and an elderly dentist, Anne lived in a set of rooms on the second and third floors of an old three-story building or house in Amsterdam, Holland whose entrance was concealed behind a bookcase or cupboard.  (In Dutch, this arrangement is called \\"het achterbuis\\" that, loosely translated, means \\"secret annexe.\\")<br /><br />Key dates to consider when reading this diary:<br /><br />June 12, 1942: Anne's thirteenth birthday.<br />June 14, 1942: first diary entry.<br />July 8, 1942: last day of non-hiding.<br />July 9, 1942: the Frank family (of four) and another family (of three) go into hiding in the \\"secret annexe\\".<br />Nov. 17, 1942:  an elderly dentist joins the group in hiding.  There are now eight people in the \\"secret annexe.\\"<br />June 12, 1943: Anne's fourteenth birthday.<br />June 12, 1944: Anne's fifteenth birthday.<br />August 1, 1944: last diary entry.<br /><br />There is one diagram in Anne's diary, a very important diagram.  It is a schematic of the entire building where she hid out showing the layout of all three floors.<br /><br />During the day, when people worked in the offices and warehouse on the first floor, Anne and the others had to keep very quiet.  This group in hiding had four \\"protectors\\" or \\"helpers\\" who worked in the offices (two men and two young women).  These four supplied the group in hiding with food and other provisions as well as moral and psychological support.  At night the group in hiding could move around more freely.  However, even at night they still had to be careful so as to give the illusion that the building was uninhabited.<br /><br />This diary is many things simultaneously.  It is an account of the process of adolescence with Anne describing her thoughts and feelings about herself and the people around her,the world at large (especially the war), and life in general.  It is also a terrifying description of what it was like to be a Jew--and in hiding--at a time when the Nazis sought to kill all the Jews of Europe.<br /><br />In the ten diary entries she wrote before the families went into hiding, we discover something of the world of a child growing up in Holland in 1942.<br /><br />This may sound strange, but I felt Anne Frank was like a good friend confiding in me.  Her writing is that good!<br /><br />The three-section Afterword is well written.  (There is no indication as to who exactly wrote it.)  Section (I) explains, among other things, how Hitler and the Nazi political party rose to power, why Hitler hated the Jews, and his \\"final solution\\" in dealing with them.  Section (II) discusses, among other things, the Frank family and the German occupation of Amsterdam, and what happened to the group of eight in hiding after Aug. 1, 1944.  Section (III) explains exactly how Anne Frank's diary got published and how it was received.  Other interesting information is also included.<br /><br />Finally, there are two problems I had with this book:<br /><br />First, there is no table of contents.  I felt that for such an important historical document, a detailed table of contents should have been included.<br /><br />Second, the book's structure (alluded to above) could have been more logical.  I thus recommend reading this book in the following order (compare this to the actual order indicated above):<br /><br />(i) Introduction.<br />(ii) Afterword (section (I) only).<br />(iii) Diary.<br />(iv) Afterword (sections (II) and (III)).<br />(v) Images.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a remarkable diary and book.

0380002930|5.0|This book should be read by all, the way he personifies the rabbits is grand, along with the ups and downs surrounding this novel.  I don't really see any real reason that many would hate this book. The way he gives them a religion and the stories flows so nicely from start to end.  It really changes your perspective on many things.  I thought it was a great read and everyone would enjoy it.
B000008J3I|4.0|The best of Mike Oldfield, is a great milestone in his career from early 70 th`s to the early 90 th`s. In other words this CD is a great introduction to his many great compositions. Track 1 Tubular Bells (opning theme) has a very hypnotic theme, horrific and makes you shiver( it was also used as the theme song in Friedkin`s horror film classic(The Exorsist). A moody and creepy melody. Track 2 Family Man is an another cup of tea, with it`s very open soundpicture, with enough space to put in different synth blop`s here and<br /><br />there, to quicken it up. It has a great female vocal with guts and glory all trough. Track 3 Moonlight Shadow is the ultimate \\"summer hit song\\". It paint`s your soul with happiness, joy, and glory. Maggie Realy`s vocal with the right \\"dash\\" of \\"ecco sound\\" shines on this one. Track 4 Heavens Open, follow the poppy trends as the too tracks before this one. It`s anyway a little letdown because it stand`s still in away. The theme is to much repitition in away. Track 5 Five Miles Out, is anyway a nice gem, with one of the most \\"airy and open space \\" soundpicture i have heard. It`s a treat for your ears, and will kick your`e soul in outher space, at least for 4.14 minutes. Track 6 To France is a nice little treat, with Maggies vocal as a \\"drive motor\\" all trough the song. Track 7  Foreign affair, has much of the same quality elements included. Few distorting elements with to many instruments not fighting for theire places, to bring out the clear and solid vocal of Maggie Reiley. Track 8 In dulici jubilio is a nice sweet \\"shakesperean\\" inspired song.<br /><br />Easy come easy go, but a sweety in a way. Short and concise . Track 9 Shadow on the wall, is creepy and horrific with a devilish vocal. It has an atmosphere all trough that creeps slowly in too your soul, and paint your thought`s with shadows with a big S.. Track 10 Island, with Bonny Tyler on vocal bring`s more sunshine into your`e soul`. A good popsong this one. From track 11 to track 16 it`s time for the more experimental and weird ( in more or less positive way)Oldfield. Track 11 Etude: well, easy come and easy go joy. Track 12 Sentinel, is very similar to Tubular Bells, but bring`s out a certain flair when you listen to it. Track 13 Ommadawn is Oldfield in a \\"natures own\\" mood. Inspired in a way, but not to much variations. Track 14 Incantations has  a poor man`s `\\"carribean\\" touch all over. A let down in a way. Track 15 Amarok. To many drumming sound, and not much more. The vocal choir doesn`t fit at all.<br /><br />Track 16 Portsmouth has that \\"shakesperean\\" middelage feel over it, all trough.

0451529308|1.0|Maybe to the older person \\"Little Women\\" is an interesting book, but let's face it, the new genereation is just not interested in this kind of book. When I was in grade school, I had to read it for a project, and I hated it. The reason was probably beause it was not flashy or out of the ordinary. It just told the average story about the average family at that time. it may be interestign for some, but the young readers of today just don't like it all that much.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|Robbed completely of the Oscar for best score, Philip Glass brings the emotional masterpiece \\"The Hours\\" to life with a touching and haunting score that can easily be enjoyed separately. It may seem repitious, but each strain has a different edge and new kind of haunting and longing. The piano sections in particular are the most powerful. The star number of the album is the final track, \\"The Hours\\", which stirringly brings together all of the themes into one, fantastic piece. A must have and truly magnificent work!
B0002OERI0|1.0|This is not forced, pseudo-iconoclasticism. Pre-packaged faux-angst and political posturing laid out over a pitifully predictable pop-punk soundscape of power chords and a bass-snare bass-snare rhythm section is not good music.<br /><br />This album sucks as much as the above sentence is run-on. This review won't get any \\"yes\\" votes because I'm not worshipping American Idiot as the \\"rock opera\\" it's not, so I'll leave it at this: If Green Day met a real band like Gorgoroth or Dissection, there'd be a boulevard of broken necks.<br />- Thus says the Pellington
0689835604|4.0|My daughter is 6 months old and absolutely loves this book.  From the start it grabbed her attention.  Now when I pull it off the shelf to read, she laughs and gets quite exited.  It is her favorite \\"interactive\\" book so far.
B00005JLCI|4.0|Wow, I would've really thought this film would've been on DVD by now.<br /><br />I saw it in a theatre and loved it.  Everyone's going to have their favorites as Hamlet but I actually enjoy most of the ones I've seen.<br />I have Richard Burton's filmed performance but I've always enjoyed Burton (See him in BECKET with Peter O'Toole).  Olivier's take is a classic.  I just bought Kevin Kline's DVD and liked it.  The first real connection I had to the play was Mel Gibson's in 1990 and that one is still my favorite: I like Hamlet more when I really think he's cracking up.<br /><br />So I was thrilled with Kenneth Brannagh's \\"complete\\" film of the play, although I wish it had been presented as a mini-series.  There are several scenes and speeches that feel rushed to keep the momentum moving.  The modern viewer is used to having entertainment last an hour and a half--or just a couple of minutes!  In Shakespeare's time, there were no other channels and people had all day.<br /><br />I liked the casting for the most part, but Jack Lemmon as a palace guard and other choices were odd, almost jarring.<br /><br />Charlton Heston should have been at least nominated for a Best Supporting Actor for his brief but compelling role as the Player King.  Now THAT'S a Shakespearean performance!<br /><br />Brannagh was nominated for screenplay adaption (!) at the Oscars that year but his passion for the role and his determination to film it on a epic scale deserved much more.<br /><br />Definitely on the Must Buy for my collection.
B00005M989|5.0|I personally like this compilation of Prince, it's got most of the songs I like and the sound is great. Sure, there could have been a few more songs included, like \\"Pop Life\\", \\"Hot Thing\\", but when compared to the other compilations, this disc has more of the songs that are a must-have, for me, such as \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\", which I don't think was included on any of the other compilations. So, it's just a matter of weighing what songs you most want, so that's why I chose this disc and I'm glad I did!

B0009S2T0M|4.0|Maybe i've simply seen too many kungfu/hk gangster flicks but this movie Oldboy didn't seem that violent to me. I also found it to be a little slow paced (not fast paced like what other reviews say). However that being said, it is a good movie, very artfully put together with decent visuals. The central plot is  a bit twisted but i guess that's what the movie's going after. Some scenes felt a little dragged out and unncessarily overdramatic. Overall a decent film from korea and worth watching.
0440180295|4.0|\\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time.  Billy has gone to sleep a senile widower and awakened on his wedding day.  He has walked through a door in 1955 and come out another in 1941.  He has gone back through that door to find himself in 1963.  He has seen his birth and death many times, he says, and pays random visits to all the events in between.  He says.\\" <br /> <br />This text was pulled from the beginning of Chapter Two in Kurt Vonnegut's classic American novel Slaughterhouse-Five.  After being abducted by a race of aliens called the Tralfamadorians, our protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, believes that he has become \\"unstuck in time.\\"  These aliens live timelessly and believe that time moves in a circular method as oppossed to the linear method that we believe in, and after Billy's encounter, he is able to seamlessly and effortlessly move through the important time periods of his lifetime, especially when it comes to the days he faced as an American POW being held in Nazi Germany.     <br /> <br />The only problem is that not even Billy can decide when he is going to time-travel; he'll often fall asleep in one year and wake up 20 years earlier or 20 years later, and as you have already read, he can time-travel simply by walking through doors. <br /> <br />Maybe he's not even time-traveling at all.  Maybe it's nothing more than a sleeping disorder.  Maybe Billy is having elaborate dreams that he cannot tell apart from reality.  Maybe he's suffering from post-traumatic stress as an affect of WWII.  You decide... <br /> <br />If you are a reader who has to experience a story analytically, this book is probably not for you.  Clearly, this story isn't told in chronological order, but it's still rather easy to follow along with Vonnegut's relaxing and flowing tone, and it's very easy to realize when a change in time has taken place. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed how Kurt Vonnegut molded his personal experiences into the novel.  Vonnegut himself was a prisoner inDresden, Germany, and witnessed the fire-bombing of the city, which killed hundreds of thousands of civilians as well as many POWs.  The title of the book itself is taken directly from the name of the prison that Vonnegut was held in during his stint in WWII. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the way the novel was written.  Kurt Vonnegut uses an almost sarcastic or satiric tone, and it's quite funny to read even with the mention of war, death, and alien abduction.  The novel also forces the reader to think about and analyze the concepts of time and reality.   <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy the questioning of bigger concepts that cannot be explained.  If you are a fan of The Matrix, you would probably love this book, and you should probably pick up a copy ASAP if you want to expand your mind. <br /> <br />- James-Carroll Parker Hayes
B000002KOQ|5.0|I have loved this album, and Joni, for more than thirty years now. In this and many times in the two preceding and next three albums, she is giving us, and is capable of giving us, wreckage and craziness and joy straight from her marrow. The poetry of \\"Blue Boy\\" or \\"The Priest\\", amongst others, is similar in a way to Elizabeth Bishop or Robert Lowell, and just as unfettered by commercialism. It's funny, just how un-commercial this music sounds, now, and how uncaring Joni the artist auteur is. She is focused on other, higher things, here, and it always gives me goosebumps hearing how unabashedly un-self-conscious she is, a trait she shares in common with fellow Canucks Neil Young and Gordon Lightfoot. Essential music this is, if you would know the folk and very LIBERAL bedrock from which all contemporary music, including hiphop, is builded.
B000002H6C|5.0|The Thrash Metal decided to make one final yell, in the form of \\"...And Justice For All.\\" Ah, but I'm forgetting my manners. I am Demon Annihilator. Writer of a review for almost every Metallica album in existence. This marks all of the Metallica albums I own. S&M is next on my list, anyway... <br /> <br />Blackened 5/5: Still an accoustic Intro. (YAY!) The intro is actually quite lengthy. Mainly because the first 30 seconds were played backwards, then the explosion occurs. This song is about the envioronment, and how the government doesn't help matters. I forgot to mention that this album has a theme of the corrupt justice system. (Hell, you'd know that from the cover) <br /> <br />...And Justice For All 5/5: Holy Crap. This song is so frigging long! But, it's still frigging awesome. And that makes a good balance. The 9:44 will pass like lightning. Title tracks have always been high up. (with me at least)  <br /> <br />Eye of the Beholder 5/5: There's like a billion tempo changes in this song, and that keeps it interesting. The chorus really stands out. \\"You can do it your own way, if it's done just how I say.\\" By the way, this song ROCKS! <br /> <br />One 200-friggin-billion/5: The best ballad of all time. The second best Metallica song of all time. (Whiplash is 1st) DEFINITELY, the best song on this album. The subject being the same soldier from Disposable Heroes on \\"Master of Puppets\\" has stepped on a land mine, and has now lost all senses, and all limbs. The only thing keeping him alive is a life support system. And boy is he pissed off about that. (Well, how would you feel?!)  <br /> <br />The Shortest Straw 5/5: Blacklisting is the subject at hand this time. It could also be about Cliff Burton. (Old bassist) Still quite fast. Worth 50 listens at least. <br /> <br />Harvester of Sorrow 5/5: Okay. This is about a normal family man. But, all of a sudden, he murders his family. Nice. I am especially fond of this one. <br /> <br />The Frayed Ends of Sanity 10/5: Man, I love the solo on this song. The beginning is a gag. It's the guards' march from the Wizard of Oz. This song is unbelievable. I LOVE IT! <br /> <br />To Live Is To Die 5/5: The last song Cliff Burton ever wrote. Those lyrics are his. Although, they take up like 10 seconds, so it's still an instrumental. Definitely the best instrumental song ever. <br /> <br />Dyer's Eve 100/5: God, I love this song. It explains me. The whole FRIKKIN' THING! Look at the lyrics. Just minus the Dear Father. People always complain that they want a new Metal Militia. This ought to shut them up. It ends with a fast riff, than Hetfield yells, \\"GO!\\" and it stops. <br /> <br />Definitely worth every cent. If they released another album like this, only with bass that you can hear, I'd be happy. Robert Trujillo might just save Metallica from an ugly demise. But, buy this to give them a running start. <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br /> <br />
0767020308|4.0|While I enjoyed the Gwyneth Paltrow version immensely, this is definitely a more faithful adaptation to Jane Austen's book.  While it is meant to be amusing, \\"Emma\\" examines the various roles of women in society:  Emma, our heroine, who is wealthy, young and attractive, sees no point in entering into marriage and thus illustrates one of the few Austen characters who is not pressured by finances.  Emma's governess, who is fortunate enough to fall in love AND make a good match with a gentleman above her station.  Additionally, there is the young woman of obscure birth (with hints of illegitimicy)looking to find her station in life and the young woman of good background but poor prospects who is faced with the possibility of offering her services as a governess.<br /><br />Emma wends her way through the story as would-be matchmaker creating not only mischief, but trouble as well.  She is not always kind.  Though she views herself as a sort of mentor to a young, poor girl, she is really steering the girl in a direction that the girl, and ultimately Emma, cannot navigate.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|That i had started watching Firefly earlier.  I dont think i'll be able to seriously ever understand why this seriously, superb and engaging show ever got cancelled.  There is so much going with it in the 14 episodes that were aired.  I'm pretty sure it had to do with TV ratings and such.  It was a mistake though.  I'm only glad that i was able to have the opportunity to check out and enjoy a show that kept me coming back.  With its great characters, engaging dialogue and some all around quality action.<br /><br />Having watched this whole series.  I can say without a doubt Firefly will go down as one of my top 10 favorite TV series for some time to come.  The collection is high quality and has a few extras packed in as well.  Its a decent price for a collection that is worth so much.  Give Firefly a try and when your done you will see what others like me already know.<br /><br />That sadly quality shows get cancelled well before their time, but this one will continue on for some time to come.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Who'd have thought Joss Wheadon woud make an admirable SCI-Fi serries after making Buffy & Angel?  I sure didn't, and I was wrong. <br /> <br />This is one of the best sci-fi serries ever created.  <br /> <br />At first the mix of wild-west and super future is jaring , and the theme song makes you itchy to stop watching, but as the story progresses (particularly if watching in the correct order, NOT trhe AIRED order) the series feels very together and \\"right\\" like, this is probably the most realistic vision of the future yet put forth, the mix of old and new makes perfect sence. <br /> <br />Sadly this serries was destroyed by the TV network which commisioned it.  Don't let them ruin you on it.  This serries is a quintessential must-have for any Sci-Fi lover.  (PS girly-os into the buffy or angel serries might also like this - it has continually tested very high with female audiences)
B000E97Y6K|5.0|If you only had the choice to see one movie in your lifetime- this is the one. It has everything. Great plot, great acting, and you come out crying. <br />I've seen Kong 16 times at the big screen and can't get enough. It's everything the original has and more.The movie leaves you begging for more Kong. <br />If there is any criticism to be had, it may be the voyage on the venture gets a bit lengthy. Especially the part s that weren't necessary- like Jimmy drawing pictures on the movie posters and the relationship between Jimmy and Hayes. They bring in exerps from the book heart of darkness that really doesn't make sense unless you've read the book (which I haven't).  <br />Once Kong arrives, you are glued to your seet. I could have watched 3 more hours of Kong. <br />I love this movie. I pray there will be a sequal. Kong looks real. There are no mistakes whatsoever. The only part that may look a little fake is the bronto stampede. <br />This is the best movie of the year, perhaps of all time. I guess if Carl Denham would have been a homosexual, it would have been nominated by the academy awards. It makes me sick to think this movie won't be named best of the year. Every person I saw coming out of the theater was crying. How many people came out crying from Bareback Mountain??

0786711647|4.0|The author sure knows how to keep things exiting! He always ends the chapter with a thrilling moment, which made me want to go on reading. I almost couldn't put the book aside, I utilized every spare hour. Her style of writing pleased me very well, it never drops off. I experienced this book as a form of acting, in writing. The characters in the story are individually exposed from the inside, in a seamless performance from one perspective to the other. Perhaps this is the secret of this books' vividness. I detected only one small thing where I was beginning to feel bored about; In the part called \\"Marion\\", we caught sight of the inside of the factory of Mr. Kingship, by looking through Buds' eyes. But in my view he was endlessly persuading about it, I got tired of it. All in all I'm very glad I've read this book. The film wasn't as good as the book itself.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Let me start off by saying I am not a die hard Queen fan. I picked up this dvd after I got the Live Aid dvd. I had almost forgotten how good they were at Live Aid. Definetely one of the main highlights from that dvd. This dvd was great. Great songs, band sounds great, and that great massive crowd at Wembly. The 5.1 dts sounded great even though I could not crank it up all the way.(I hate my neighbor lol.) Buy it and enjoy it.
0385513755|4.0|Yes, Angels and Demons was a better book but this one was great.  One of the criticisms of Dan Brown's books are that they are not historically accurate.  My only response to that is that these books are FICTION.  Dan Brown does not claim that his books are works on non-fiction.  Read these books with some suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />No, The Davinci Code is not written with big words and doctoral thoughts.  The writing style is simple and easy to read.  But...this man is a great story-teller.  His books are page-turners and hard to put down.<br /><br />This story (like Angels and Demons) takes place in a 24-hour period and the action moves fast.  The book opens with a murder and closes with some heart-wrenching surprises and twists.<br /><br />I loved exploring Christianity, Paganism, the Priory of Sion, and Opus Dei through the course of this book.  The illustrated version was incredible but I wish I would have read the regular version because I took too long to ponder the images and this slowed down my reading.<br /><br />I also enjoyed being reacquainted with artwork I hadn't thought about since college...especially The Mona Lisa, The Last Supper, and Madonna on the Rocks.<br /><br />One criticism...the chemistry between the characters wasn't very strong.  I didn't believe that they cared about each other...they each had very different reasons for being on their quest.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is an intelligent thriller that is sure to captivate you.  Read it before the movie comes out in May!  You don't want to know the surprise ending until you read it in the book.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B000002AHC|5.0|\\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" is usually regarded as the last album by the original band. Gene Clark had actually left after the second album, but it's obvious that this is the last album where the original Byrd-sound is still predominant.  Still, as with every new Byrds album,  it's by no means just a repetion of previous efforts.<br /><br />New sounds, rhythms and instruments and are explored on the album, which must be their most psychedelic. But as always it's the songs that make this another great Byrds album - of course along with the brilliant guitar-playing and the delicate vocal harmonies.<br /><br />No Bob Dylan songs were recorded for the album; instead two fine Goffin/King songs stand out among the most memorable on the album. Both \\"Goin' Back\\" and \\"Wasn't Born to Follow\\" have the classic Byrds-sound and  both songs are lyrically and musically very strong.<br /><br />Among the new original Byrds songs \\"Draft Morning\\" is a highlight. The song was originally written by David Crosby, but he was asked to leave the band midways through the recording of the album, so the song was finished by Hillman and McGuinn. Another David Crosby song \\"Triad\\" may be have the reason for his ousting. Crosby wanted the song included on the album instead of \\"Goin' Back\\", but the other band members may have found Crosby's lyrics too controversal. The song was given to Jefferson Airplane and Crosby was out of the Byrds. Iin retrospect this seem a pretty stupid solution, considering that both tracks could easily have been included - Byrds albums usually had a very short playing time - and TNBB is no exception with its app. 30 minutes. Now the song is to find among the bonus-tracks.<br /><br />Crosby was not involved with the final recordings which include the opener \\"Artificial Energy\\", \\"Natural Harmony\\", \\"Get to You\\" and the terrific \\"Wasn't Born to Follow\\" which feature the great Clarence White on guitar. White is actually playing on several on these recordings, and he was later to join the Byrds as a permanent member. His contribution to \\"Change is Now\\" make this average tune another stand-out; almost like a new \\"Eight Miles High\\".<br /><br />Hillman's \\"Old John Robertson\\" is catchy Byrds-country and another favourite.<br /><br />Weakest track is the closing tune ( sea-shanty style ) \\"Space Odyssey\\"  feature odd space sounds, but somehow seems to go nowhere; a paradox that It is the longest track on the album.<br /><br />Among the bonus-tracks the instrumental \\"Bound to Fall\\" is quite good, but  sounds unfinsihed. Though all bonus tracks are interesting \\"Triad\\" is really the only track that ought have been included on the original album. \\"Moon Raga\\" is the weakest and it's wonder why it was not placed as the last track.<br /><br />A hidden track feature studio talk that reveal there was a lot of tension within the band during these recordings.nent member.

B000BM6AVA|3.0|All and all this was a O.k album, Not as great as people say it is<br /><br />1. Attack: I liked it better, When it was called \\"Master Of Puppets\\"<br /><br />2. Dreaming: Kinda Sucks<br /><br />3. Kill Rock 'N Roll: Yuck<br /><br />4. Hypnotize: The solo part is pretty cool<br /><br />5. Stealing Society: Yawn<br /><br />6. Tentative: Another yawn<br /><br />7. U-Fig: Weird, Insane, Demented... I liked it<br /><br />8. Holy Mountains: Neo-Prog meets Death Metal. Not that great<br /><br />9.

Soldier Side: Another ok song.<br /><br />So in other words kinda overrated.
B00001IVOF|2.0|Before getting steamed at the title of my review, take time and read my review in an objective sense. My critical anaylsis of this album was done strictly as objective as possible. I took my time listening to every single \\"song\\" on this album, so this isn't an uninformed review. Now to the review. <br />------------------------------------------------------------ <br /> <br />Hell on Earth, Mobb Deeps third release, came out during the era of the media-fabricated and infamous east-coast-west-coast beef. Throughout the album, you get a sense that the artist where suffucated by the negative climate of the time. The songs and lyrics on this album, in every way, reflect that era. Starting off the album is a deep bass mixed with a dark-drum line instrumental. Havoc and Prodigy lace the beat with self glorifying, tough guy lyrics that accentuate the grimy instrumental. Though this album has 14 tracks, you've be hardpressed to differentiate one from the other if it wasn't for the switch of beat. The level of variation in subject matter on this album is so limited that a review of one tracks lyrics will tell you all you need to know about the album, lyric wise. There are little to no song concepts on this album. Nearly every single track on Hell on Earth is polluted with numerous references to someone getting shot, how much better Prodigy and Havoc are than you, and how they are from Queensbridge, etc. Through the lyrical context of this album, you almost get the sense that Mobb Deep was too consumed with the negative climate of rap at the time. You get the sense that they're lashing out at anyone and everyone that may pose as a potential threat to them. Cuts like \\"Drop a gem on them\\" and \\"Bloodsport\\" find them verbally attacking the late Tupac Shakur. The lyrics on this album get so rediculous at times that you have to wonder what these guys were thinking. You truely have to sit back and question how these guys could put out track after track of the same tired material. About the only saving grace of this album is the instrumentals. Dark, grimey, and horror movie like, they paint a background of horror and terror. Though good, the instrumentals of this album also start to sound repetitive as you get deeper into the album. After a while, they all start to sound like a cluster of the same stuff. <br /> <br />I'm sorry, but in no way shape or form is this as great of an album as some have stated. Lack of variation in topics, Ignorant, mindless gun and thug brovado give this album no depth. If you're someone that is looking for intelligent lyrics or creative concepts, do yourself a favor and avoid Hell on Earth at all cost.
B000001FS3|5.0|If \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" put U2 on the map, and it did, then \\"Joshua Tree\\" catapulted them into the stratosphere.  Not merely one of U2's best, or even one of the eighties best, but more important one of the best albums ever made.  The real gems on this album are not the singles, but the cuts that never made it to mainstream radio -- \\"In God's Country\\" -- \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" -- \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" -- and the remarkable, extraordinary and incomparable \\"One Tree Hill,\\" a masterwork, a masterpiece of songcraft -- one of the finest songs ever (cf. \\"Scene of the Crime,\\" Brent Bourgeois), by U2 or anyone.
0345452585|5.0|I almost never make a big deal about the number of Stars I rate a book, or any other product. The content of my reviews is what counts - that's what's most important. In the case of Jonathan Kellerman's \\"The Conspiracy Club,\\" I make an exception. I think this chilling mystery is an excellent read, and would normally rate it 4 or 4.5 stars. (It is Olympic Game season and I feel like a figure skating judge!!). However, the novel is so original and intelligently written, refreshingly so, that it deserves 5 Stars all the way!!<br /><br />To begin with, there is little, if any violence, blood or gore in the narrative. Almost everything traumatic is implied, not explicit - for a change. This subtle approach to brutality makes the violence seem more spooky, more mysterious than usual. The reader's imagination is almost always more fertile than the written word - unless the author is Edgar Allan Poe. And Kellerman builds suspense, little by little, to a crescendo finale. Character study is very important to this psychological thriller. And again, the author excels in character development, especially that of his protagonist, Dr. Jeremy Carrier, a young psychologist at City Central Hospital.<br /><br />Carrier is a moral man, seemingly, dedicated to his profession and patients. He also appears to be a really nice guy. Six months earlier, his live-in girlfriend, Jocelyn Banks, a nurse at the same hospital, was horribly murdered, her mutilated body dumped under a bridge in a run-down area of town. Jeremy had been very much in love with her and broods over his loss and the cruelly sadistic manner of her death. The investigating detectives have targeted him as a murder suspect, even though there is no evidence of his involvement, whatsoever. This exacerbates his suffering. When more women begin turning up dead, obviously the work of the same psychopathic killer, the police come looking for Dr. Carrier - questioning him - turning up the pressure.<br /><br />Coinciding with this traumatic period, Dr Arthur Chess, an elderly but still vigorous pathologist, seeks Jeremy out, apparently wanting to be his friend. Chess is retired, but he is so prominent in his field, and has contributed so much to City Central that he is allowed to maintain his office there. Arthur Chess is a wonderful character - bizarre, wise, extremely mysterious, at times humorous and fascinated with  \\"psychology's views on violence. Specifically, the genesis of very bad behavior\\" - not evil. \\"Evil is a.... weighty word. Theologically burdened. I believe we'd settled upon 'very bad behavior.'\\" He makes statements throughout like, \\"A stranger to fear is a stranger to conscience.\\" But he never follows through. He never tells Jeremy what he is alluding to.<br /><br />One evening Chess invites Carrier to a special dinner in a private, extremely elegant, out-of-the-way venue. There he is introduced to a group of friends - six in all, including Arthur - who have something in common besides their professional backgrounds and elevated status in society, but neither Jeremy nor the reader are let in on their secret. These are the members of the \\"Conspiracy Club\\" of the novel's title. They meet occasionally to discuss diverse topics with great intelligence, and eat extraordinary gourmet fare. The wine is pretty terrific also.<br /><br />Dr. Chess suddenly disappears, apparently to travel the world, sending Jeremy postcards from various countries - all with the same message, \\"Traveling and learning.\\" His departure coincides with the delivery of anonymous interoffice envelopes from the Otolaryngology Department containing what look to be random articles having nothing to do with psychology or Dr. Carrier. When Jeremy investigates, he discovers that no one knows anything about the envelopes or who sent them. Thus he decides to open his own investigation, amateur though it may be. He must connect the dots between Jocelyn's death, Dr. Chess' clues, the club, the envelopes, and other strangehappenings. Meanwhile, danger surrounds him.<br /><br />To make matters more complicated, he has started seeing Angela Rios, a resident at the hospital. Although he thinks of Jocelyn frequently, he is trying to assuage his loneliness and get his life back on track. Will his burgeoning relationship with Angela endanger her also?<br /><br />The cat and mouse game which follows is truly compelling. I really found it difficult to put this one down. However, it is quite low-key, although very well paced. Is there such a thing as an effective low-key thriller? If not, than Jonathan Kellerman has invented one! ENJOY!<br /><br />JANAther strange happenings. Meanwhile, danger surrounds him. <br /> <br />To make matters more complicated, he has started seeing Angela Rios, a resident at the hospital.

1594200440|4.0|A funny, at times very funny, book that evoked about a dozen 'out loud' laughs over the 300 pages.  Wonderful characters and wonderfully descriptive.  Lewycka has an uncanny ability to slip in and out of broken English without really being noticed when it has maximum comic impact.  If you have any familiarity with immigrants from formerly Soviet states you will enjoy this book.
B000CCBCAS|5.0|I completely disagree with the prior post.  With many substandard versions of this fine film in the past I can finally report that a we have a great new edition of the film.  I didn't notice any dirt or scratches anywhere in the transfer.  The new transfer is a High Definition anamorphic 1.85:1 version with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.  The sound was perfect with no loss of dialogue or variation of music levels.  I can recommend this for anyone seeking the best edition available.
0446310786|5.0|I have read this book four times. All I can say is this, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the finest, most detailed, truthful, and important piece of literature to date. It describes humanity at its strongest, weakest, and most honorable moments. A true gem.
B000002MFN|5.0|You know, I thought if anything critics would always be able to ignore everyone else and give their own opinions. It seems that \\"Erotica\\" crushed this. So many gave horrid reviews. No, I wasn't old enough at the time of this release to really get into it all. But I have read old reviews and talked to many old enough to understand at the time. In my opinion everyone took the shock of the \\"Sex\\" book and ran with it! All the way to her album reviews, sadly. The fact that the album was so badly misunderstood shows how much people focus on labels, they saw the title and thought it was nothing more than a romp in madonna's sexuality. Acctually majority of the album doesn't even touch on sex. I think this is by far one of Madonna's best albums. This album was so experimental and interesting. She pushed herself, lyrically, vocally, and musically. The songs on this album are just as good, if not better, than anything else she's done. I reccomend this album to any madonna fan. If you don't believe me, sample the album on Amazon or her own website. Don't let yourself miss such a great album cause of some stupid lies!
B000000WJZ|5.0|This has got to be one of the best albums I have ever owned.  I've owned it since 1995, a few years after it came out when I was only a kid in junior high.  Since then, the Smashing Pumpkins were the greatest musical discovery of the 90's for me.  Billy Corgan has got to be one of the best vocalists on this earth, regardless of how \\"beyond gay\\" he may be.  I saw some of these other lame reviews knocking him, and sadly some people aren't on that kind of level to appreciate it.  All of the tracks are awesome and the best in my opnion was \\"Sweet, sweet\\" because in its short duration it best shows the range of Billy's voice.
B000059XUI|1.0|I GIVE A 1 STAR TO THE DVD'S NOT THE MOVIES. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW COLLECTOR'S BOX SET COMING OUT SOON. READ BELOW.  <br />Yes... looks like it's true. We've known for a while now that Warner Home Video was working on new DVD special editions of the Superman films to tie in with the release of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns later this year (in theaters 6/30), but now we have the first actual confirmation... from Ilya Salkind, who co-produced the first three Superman films! Salkind has acknowledged that he's working with Warner on the new DVDs, and that all of the films in the series are being restored and given deluxe new special edition treatment, a-la last year's Batman Anthology collection. By far the best news in all this, is that it seems that Warner is FINALLY allowing Richard Donner to create his original director's cut of Superman II! How damn cool is that?! As many of you know, Donner directed Superman: The Movie and most of Superman II back to back, but was eventually fired from the sequel. Director Richard Lester was hired to replace him, and it's Lester's cut of the film that we've seen all these years. What's cool is that Lester's theatrical cut of the film is being given special edition treatment as well, so you'll be able to fully explore BOTH versions of Superman II on DVD this summer. Lester MAY even do an interview for the DVD - something he's been reluctant to do over the years given the controversy. This information comes from Salkind via The Superman Homepage fan site, which expects to publish a full interview with Salkind in the coming weeks. Very cool news indeed (though keep in mind that until Warner announces this set, it's all still unofficial). Thanks to Bits reader Matt K. for the heads-up on this.  <br />
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Don't let anyone fool you, this album is fantastic! It is one of Neil's best in years. I bought the 1st edition with the acoustic concert as the bonus DVD, I bought the 2nd edition with the studio footage as the bonus DVD, I even bought the Greendale movie. Never once have I had second thoughts. Although the CDs in edition 1 and 2 are the same, it is the DVD that are really worth the purchase price and it is the CDs that are the bonus. I have been listening to and playing Neil Young and Crazy Horse for twenty years and I would say that the last track on the CD \\"Be The Rain\\" is unbelieveable. So buy both CDs, buy the movie, you won't regret it.
B000002IVF|2.0|For those who know little of Rock history, rather than \\"ripping off Joni Mitchell\\", David Crosby was around for years before she became popular, with the Byrds. He was a friend of hers and taught Joni Mitchell to use \\"open tunings\\" on her guitar, and use a modal singing style which she uses on \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\".<br /><br />The Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, the Greatful Dead, The Jefferson Airplane, The Quicksilver Messenger Service, Judy Collins were are friends and moved in and out of San Francisco in the late sixties. Stills was in love with Judy Collins and wrote \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" for her. All sing together on Crosby's excellent landmark album \\"If I Could Only Remember my Name\\".<br /><br />this album, unfortunately, is not his best effort.
0316168815|3.0|When I was first offered this book, I read the title and was told it was about a girl who was raped and murdered.  Well, there is enough of that to be found in real life, one doesn't have to seek it out in fiction.  \\"No thanks!\\" I replied and the book went on down the line.<br /><br />However, with the big Blizzard of 2006 on it's way, I wanted a book to read.  So off to the library to borrow a book.  I came home with this book.<br /><br />First off, although the rape and murder of Susie Salmon happens within the first 20 or so pages, it is not overly graphic. Thank-you author!  Nor does the book really dwell on this horific crime. It does dwell on the aftermath, which is the death of a 14 year old girl and how it affects her doting dad, loving mother, younger sister, baby brother and a circle of friends, including a young man who was just starting to be brave enough to express his love.<br /><br />Susie is safe in her heaven as she watches her family cope with her probable death - her body is never found - and watches as the family slowly disintegrates from the emotions and stress that result.<br /><br />The book is tinged with sadness, as Susie watches her younger sister and friends grow up, and experience what she yearns to experience also, and never will.<br /><br />And yet, when the family is scraped to the bare bones , the healing begins.  Not a goody two shoes, unrealistic conclussion, you will be satisfied with the ending, as the Salmon family and Susie's friend's build a new life on The Lovely Bones.<br /><br />Mary Bennett<br /><br />SagHarborGifts.com<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]  Come Blog with us!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I can watch this movie again and again, and not only because the dancing is wonderful and sexy, but because it bravely tackles many difficult issues, from family relations to abortion to class differences to (unspoken) racial and religious issues. I watched this movie with a friend who vacationed in the Catskills (those were the only resorts that allowed Jews) when she was little.  She said the movie brought back many memories for her--it caught the atmosphere of that time very well. There are unspoken racial issues, too, as the band leader was black (and the music, Cuban and black).  <br /> <br />I even watched it with my boyfriend, who attended Cornell University and instantly picked up on the guy who attended Cornell's hotel school! (\\"We used to look down on those guys,\\" he said.) So, so much in this movie. The relationship between the father and daughters alone has more to it than most films. The elder, obnoxious daughter is usually overlooked, but she is so well acted.  <br />I am thrilled that the DVD has extras. This movie has much to teach us, still.
B000BT97AO|5.0|The medium of film is--like the medium of writing or other celebrated media--practically limitless in potential for fantastic creations.  However, the fantasy (NOT SCI FI) genre is severely underrepresented in it.  For every Lord of the Rings, we have ten attempts at The Matrix.<br /><br />But what better alchemical mix to straight-up fantasy can we have than Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean, and the Henson Company?  One thing Henson could do with his puppets that many others never really aspired to do was create fantasy the likes that weren't really done again, and his legacy lives on, using the enriching and creative mind of Gaiman, the celebrated British fantasy writer and comic book artist whose vivid imagination was so perfectly translated into film using practically every chemical for fantasy possible: CGI, animation, painting, set design, split-screen, superimposition, saturated colors, I even think there were moments of stop-motion animation.<br /><br />The story is about a fifteen-year-old girl named Helena who works for a circus.  Her creative and artistic mind keeps her busy from day to day until her mother falls ill and has to go to the hospital.  Blaming it on herself for a row she had with her mother, Helena \\"escapes\\" into dreamland... or does she?<br /><br />I think what's really refreshing about this film is that, despite what a lot of people say about it, it's NOT that much like Alice and Wonderland.  I can't help but think that, despite the fact that this film uses a lot of tropes common to the fantasy genre, it's distinct and original, something to be admired and appreciated.  I don't think anything in this film really came off as that cliched, even though it did come across as familiar.  It might even be possible to say that anybody who has a real problem with it is just taking it too seriously, but that argument always goes in the wrong direction so forget about it.<br /><br />One of the things I think that's important about a film like this is that it's not really a kids movie.  Children could watch it, easily, and be fine with it, but it's not directed just to them.  It isn't really directed at a target audience in the genre sense.  It is simply fantasy for fantasy's sake, going where a lot of filmmakers seem desperate to avoid because \\"It's just not real enough.\\"  That's why, despite the fact that this movie has pretty obvious CGI, it doesn't matter as much as the obvious CGI in The Hulk: it's so fantastic, it helps that it doesn't seem real.<br /><br />Too bad it just won't get the marketing or the attention it deserves, probably ever.  That's why if it's ever considered a classic at all, it'll be a cult classic.  Such seems the destination of many things that dare to be what they want and not what others want them to be.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBs that it's not really a kids movie.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Please note, this review's wording and tone may seem a bit odd as, originally, it wasn't a review at all - but a post on at popular movie discussion board. But, after writing the analysis, I realized it basically expressed my feelings about the movie equal or better than any review could, so without further delay, here is my review/analysis of Serenity... <br /> <br />Reasons why you should like Serenity... <br /> <br />1). The cast. They are, in short, fantastic. Not particularly because of acting ability alone - though I'm not saying they're bad actors - but chemistry. They fit with each other, and play off each other, SO well you just literally fall in love with all of them. I harken their chemistry to the original Star Wars cast's; they fit so well together, you really begin to care about them, and it all seems so believable. <br /> <br />2). The dialogue. Okay, I'll say it; Whedon writes campy, corny dialogue. BUT! who says campy and corny is bad if done well? Whedon does it well, and it shows. Plenty of memorable quotes, plenty of fun lines that have you chuckling in even the most dire of scenes, it's just excellent, I think. <br /> <br />3). The universe Whedon has created is, at least, creative - and may even be even magnificent if not for some failings (see; reasons you shouldn't like this movie #2). The merging of cultures and customs is very interesting, and believable, and the whole Han Solo meets Wild Wild West in China is really unique and likeable. <br /> <br />4). The action and special effects are quite good. It's not World of the Worlds of King Kong, but it's very strong for a film of this budget and scale, and despite, again, a few failings (see; reasons you shouldn't like this movie #2...and a lil bit o' #1), it's very entertaining. <br /> <br />And as an added bonus, reasons why you SHOULDN'T like the movie... <br /> <br />1). The plot. It's very, very...blah. A problem that I had with the show continues in the film; all they do is run. They runto this planet, they run to that planet. They're running from this person, they're running from that person. After a while it becomes quite boring and monotonous. <br /> <br />2). The sorta \\"cheap\\" feel of it all. Again, this is a problem I had with both Buffy and Firefly; Whedon doesn't seem to know how to make things look...good, or \\"rich\\" at least. Everything seems to sorta have this \\"made for TV\\" quality to it. From dim lighting to set design, it all didn't seem very much like a feature film, or for that matter, real. <br /> <br />3). A mediocre villain. That's right; Serenity has one. While I'm sure Chiwetel Ejiofor did his very best playing the intimidating and power \\"Operative,\\" he just didn't really seem to have the presence all true great villains have; that Darth Vader-like dread you feel whenever he walks into a shot - that just wasn't there, sadly. He is a fair villain, I mean, he goes through all the motions well, and does what he has to do, but The Operative simply isn't a great villain, and while this doesn't necessarily hurt the film, it certainly doesn't help it. <br /> <br />Overall, however, I do think the positives outweigh the negatives by quite a good margin - and Serenity is quite a good film. I think the most important thing though - in watching any movie - is don't go in with sky high expectations, don't go in with your head full of things these crazy Whedon worshippers are saying, go in hoping for an enjoyable film. And, hopefully, you will enjoy it, and with luck, you'll come out having seen a film that you, dare I say, love. <br /> <br />Personally, I didn't \\"love\\" it, but still, it gets a solid 4.5/5 from me.
B00097DXZS|1.0|This Santana album has MediaMax copy protection software embedded in the CD.  The problem with this CD is that the  MediaMax program installs undisclosed--and in some cases, hidden--files on users' Windows computers, potentially exposing music fans to malicious attacks by third parties. The infected CDs also communicated back to the record company about customers' computer use without proper notification. <br />This is unacceptable and it will make me think twice before buying another Santana album.  Also, if the record company wishes to treat me like a criminal and take away the right to make a personal copy of music I purchase because of a few bad  apples, then it should realize that it will lose its few remaining customers.   <br />Santana, please release this CD without these copy protection schemes and I will buy it.  Thank you. <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I only wish I had the chance to watch a live rendition of this CD. I can't claim to be a tried-and-tested Metheny fan, but I must attest that this is some of his best work that I have heard (and randomly, I've listened to quite a lot of his stuff). <br /> <br />Each of the tracks is an independent piece, beautifully crafted; yet, there is a remarkable continuity that unifies the whole effort. I enjoy Pat Metheny's ability to make repetition sound so beautiful (a la \\"Red Sky\\"), and it is wonderful to hear him poke at the heartstrings of a subtle melody, only to revise it and render it fully in another portion of the same music piece. It was wonderful to hear elements such as the resounding \\"theme\\" from the first 4 minutes of track 2 used to bring an amazing climax to this whole music piece. <br /> <br />This was a terrific group effort. The piano was God-sent, the vocals were brilliant, the bass work impeccable and the drums...every time I play this CD there's simply more to find...Great effort. (If I left anything out, you'll just have to listen for yourself to really appreciate it.) <br /> <br />I've had this CD since April 2005 and not a week passes without me playing it. A must buy for the collection. Pat Metheny (& group members), how's about a concert in Kenya whenever you get a chance? <br />
B00003CXDD|5.0|I truly think all that have children should definately include willow in their dvd collection at home for the kids. It is truly and adventure and a magical story.Even adults will get a thrill out of it. I grew up on this movie so it is only right that i have it in my collection. I have enjoyed this movie so much over the years, and it would only be right if I share the excitment with others through this review.
B000059Z8J|1.0|I GIVE A 1 STAR TO THE DVD'S NOT THE MOVIES. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT A NEW COLLECTOR'S BOX SET COMING OUT SOON. READ BELOW.  <br />Yes... looks like it's true. We've known for a while now that Warner Home Video was working on new DVD special editions of the Superman films to tie in with the release of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns later this year (in theaters 6/30), but now we have the first actual confirmation... from Ilya Salkind, who co-produced the first three Superman films! Salkind has acknowledged that he's working with Warner on the new DVDs, and that all of the films in the series are being restored and given deluxe new special edition treatment, a-la last year's Batman Anthology collection. By far the best news in all this, is that it seems that Warner is FINALLY allowing Richard Donner to create his original director's cut of Superman II! How damn cool is that?! As many of you know, Donner directed Superman: The Movie and most of Superman II back to back, but was eventually fired from the sequel. Director Richard Lester was hired to replace him, and it's Lester's cut of the film that we've seen all these years. What's cool is that Lester's theatrical cut of the film is being given special edition treatment as well, so you'll be able to fully explore BOTH versions of Superman II on DVD this summer. Lester MAY even do an interview for the DVD - something he's been reluctant to do over the years given the controversy. This information comes from Salkind via The Superman Homepage fan site, which expects to publish a full interview with Salkind in the coming weeks. Very cool news indeed (though keep in mind that until Warner announces this set, it's all still unofficial). Thanks to Bits reader Matt K. for the heads-up on this.  <br />
B00007AJF9|3.0|England. 1555. Henry VIII has snuffed it from gout or syphilis, it depends on who you read, Bloody Mary's got a tumour and the Catholics' greatest fear is Anne Boleyn's daughter Elizabeth.  The opening scene signals the film's intent. Protestant heretics are burnt mercilessly at the grisly stake, accompanied by proclamations that they should burn in Hell. It's clear that England is in a pretty gloomy state and ruled by a humourless zealot, Mary who is hell-bent on converting or murdering Elizabeth.<br /><br />One need not possess any knowledge of history to make sense of the plot and story. Like a good mystery there were subtle nuances. Glances between characters that foreshadowed events and interactions to come, such as the woman that betrays Norfolk, and the child that inadvertently reveals his father's hiding place.<br /><br />There are many things that make Elizabeth a great film. For example, not only is it amazingly realistic, but it also portrays a very accurate depiction of the Queen. The difficult early part of her reign is not as well known as the stunning success that she later achieved as a leader, and her potent and strong-willed personality is captured very well in this film. She suffers through countless hardships during this part of her life, and the circumstances leading to her crowning of herself as The Virgin Queen are what make up the story of this excellent film. The visuals, particularly the breathtaking interiors of the tremendous castles in which much of the film takes place, are some of the most amazing things about this movie. This is an epic drama crafted with amazing skill, excellent performances, and stunning photography.
1577311523|5.0|As I write this, there have been 569 reviews of the book with a total average rating of 4-1/2 stars out of a possible 5 stars. Yet today the spotlight reviews and two of the customer reviews on the main Power of Now page are only two stars. Seems odd. Is this truly randomness or Artificial Intelligence at work, or is it an Amazon employee's oversight, or just plain prejudice?  <br /> <br />Anyway, reviewing this book would be missing the point. If you succeed in escaping from Mind and Time, as outlined by Tolle, then why waste Time commenting on the book. In fact, maybe Mr. Tolle misses his own point by writing about the Power of Now in the first place -- though he does write that we can use Mind and Time for daily practical endeavors as long as we don't allow Mind and Time to take over and control us. I must agree that once our deep self (or whatever you want to call it) controls our physical Mind and the uses of Time, our perspective changes. Mine did. <br /> <br />But I certainly haven't reached the Enlightenment outlined by Tolle. I simply strive for it. I think the path he outlines is as valid as any other and I have both tip-toed and slogged down many. When I first read this book, it seemed too simplistic -- my Mind analyzed it based on what I had experienced and read in the past, and what I wanted for myself in the \\"future.\\" But I recently listened to him read the book on CD while on a long solo drive. I became totally focused on his voice, stopped analyzing the words, and suddenly understood the concept. Stop the Mind chatter and see what you've got. That's the first baby step on your way out of the rabbit hole.  <br /> <br />For me, the listening experience was better than reading, but your mileage may vary. <br /> <br />One last thing. If I could reduce this book to one phrase, here it is: <br /> <br />Stop talking about being the Buddha and just be the Buddha.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|I saw this movie not really knowing what to expect, but had heard from everyone I trust when it comes to movies that it was wonderful.  And when I saw it, I truly believed it.  This story of Barrie and how he came to write the classic Peter Pan is truly great.  It's loosely based on the true facts, with some variations.  Though there were rumors circulating about why Barrie spent so much time with the family, this film doesn't worry itself with that, and that is a positive thing.  It's a heartfelt film, with a lot of heart.  Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet give wonderful performances.  I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys great movies.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Great cd. I had a chance to see him this weekend Feb 12, 2006 for his first ever Las Vegas appearance. He is tremendous, killer band, plays to the audience. I thought he was good on cd, seeing him in person. he is great. I had the oppurtunity to see a special performer. I can look back and say, I saw him in Vegas when he first appeared there. If you get the chance to see him in person,do not miis him. A major talent!
B000002UAX|5.0|While I like Abbey Road more than the White Album.... <br />it's hard to argue with the fact that it's a \\"legend\\" of an album.... <br /> <br />It's conceptual beyond belief..... the tracking is absolutely incredible....... <br />I'm going to give you three of my favorite moments in this album that link it conceptually... <br /> <br />1. The transition from Back in the U.S.S.R. to Dear Prudence is breathtaking: this is very similar to Simon & Garfunkel's transition on Bookends (from Save the Life of My Child to America)... having the first track fade out while the second fades in.... it's a thing of beauty to aurally hear a plane landing as a cross-fade takes place and Dear Prudence comes in with a serious, melencholy guitar opening (likely Harrison) that's a beautiful Lennon song..... <br /> <br />2. JOHN LENNON CREATES A CONCEPTUAL ROCK ART SKETCHBOOK: Where I said that Abbey Road was Paul's Masterpiece..... the White Album I think ought to be known as Lennon's masterpiece.... it's a conceptual sketch book of rock... it's a textbook on masterful rock... Lennon does a Macca in 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' having different songs linked together..... 'I'm So Tired' is one of my favorite Lennon tracks ever along with 'Birthday' and 'Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for me and my Monkey...' John Rocks Out on these numbers!!!!! ... I also love the haunting 'Cry Baby Cry' and 'Julia.' <br /> <br />3. Genius George Harrison Arrives: GEORGE'S STELLAR GUITAR PLAYING LINKS THE ALBUM TOGETHER!!!!: <br /> <br />3 of the 4 Beatles were genius'.... it's like having Three Albert Einsteins of rock getting together to do an album.... George Harrison took it to another level on this album with tracks like 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' and 'Piggies'... and George Harrison would never look back after this!!!!!!!!!! ..also... His guitar playing is really good on 'Glass Onion', 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' and basically all Lennon tracks!!!! <br /> <br />(Paul's great on the album butthe other two stand out)
B000005RFQ|5.0|It boggles my mind that anyone who likes Black Sabbath's music would not like this cd...  It is, without question, the best Black Sabbath cd of them all.  Gillan put more enthusiasm and energy into these songs than Ozzy put into ALL his Sabbath albums.  Some people have commented that the lyrics are bad- I don't understand that- the lyrics are great and actually make sense for most of the songs which is something I cannot say about many of the hard rock/metal songs I've heard in my life.  It's a shame that Gillan was only in the band for one album.  I've read that there may be 6 songs or so on some secret tapes somewhere that might be released someday.  That would really be a treat. <br />This is one of my top 10 all time favorite heavy metal cds.

B000002MFN|5.0|Earotica did not have any bad music if you love Madonna you need to buy this great songs of hers.
B000002KKS|5.0|Hmm, were to start.  First of all, Dio is a much better singer than Ozzy.  I don't wish to denigrate Ozzy-era Sabbath at all, but seriously, Ozzy ain't much of a vocalist.  It's amazing that they successfully tailored so many songs to his ridiculous vocal limitations.  With their new, operatic, vocalist Sabbath went for a more power metal direction.  It's different enough that classic Sab fans aren't necessarily gonna like it, but I sure do.<br /><br />First of all the title track: Best Sabbath song ever.  God this song rules.  A quintessential metal epic if ever there was one, with just a wonderful drone and fantastic vox in the first half and then a ton of energy in the second half.  Just brilliant.  'Neon Knights' is the best fast song Sab ever recorded, and the catchiest thing too.  (Again and Again etc.)  'Children of the Sea' is an excellent moody, atmospheric epic, nice acoustics but damn heavy when it really gets going.  The album loses a little steam in the second half, but that's pretty much bound to happen when you include your two best songs ever in the first half.  It's still far from bad, with some nice leadwork in the perhaps to formless 'Lonely is the Word' and just catchy, rockin' fun in the prior three tracks.  'Walk Away' is probably the most notable of them, just with the best chorus and a bit more of a rockish, rather than metallic feel.<br /><br />Yes, I do believe it's good.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I thought this was the best of the three versions.  Yes, some parts were a little hard to believe, but hey folks, I hate to break this to you but, IT'S NOT A TRUE STORY.   <br />I thought I'd be asleep midway through because it's such a long movie, however, it was so action packed, I was on the edge of my seat through the entire movie. <br />

B00005JOII|3.0|Woody Allen's latest film is a relentlessly bleak look at a self-destructive and ultimately doomed love affair.  Jonathan Rhys-Myers plays a former professional tennis player who, painfully aware of his own poverty-stricken roots, charms his way into a wealthy English family.  He marries Emily Mortirmer and lands a lucrative job in the family business.  However, he still finds himself uncontrollably attracted to a struggling American actress played by Scarlett Johansson.  Not only does Johansson come from a troubled background that mirrors his own but she is also the ex-fiancee of his brother-in-law.  As Mortirmer rather desperately struggles to get pregnant, Rhys-Myers begins an obsessive, secret affair with Johansson.  Things come to a head when Johansson informs him that he is pregnant which leads to Rhys-Myers making a series of extreme decisions that lead ultimately (and rather inetivably) to tragedy. <br /> <br />As any fan of Woody Allen will immediately realize, Match Point is basically a remake of his earlier Crimes and Misdemeanors.  However, Match Point jettisons the comedic and romatics subplots that gave that earlier film whatever little for humanity it had.  The result is that Match Point manages to be even more pessimistic than that earlier film.  However, Match Point is saved by Allen's strong direction and by a talented cast that manages to hold the audience's interest even when it becomes clear that their characters are, basically, beyond redemption.  Johansson brings her unstable character to vivid life and, at times, her desperation to find some sort of happiness out of her existence is really quite heartbreaking.  It is to Johansson's credit that even though her character isn't always likeable, the audience never stop sympathizing with her.  As her romatic rival, Mortirmer is amazing in a far less showy roll.  It takes a lot of talent to make normalcy compelling and sympathetic on screen and with this film, Mortirmer proves herself to have thattalent.   <br /> <br />Rhys-Myers' character, who is the equivalent of Martin Landau's philanderer in Crimes and Misdemeanors, is a bit more problematic.  While Landau's philanderer was a good man who, because of a few selfish moments, ends up doing some very bad things, Rhys-Myers' young socical climber is written and played as nothing less than a borderline sociopath.  Whereas Landau obviously loved the people he hurt, Rhys-Myers doesn't seem capable of truly loving anyone other than himself.  As such, Rhys-Myers' actions at the end of the film don't carry the same visceral punch as Landau's.  Even when Rhys-Myers breaks down into tears at one point, one gets the feeling that he's not crying for his victims as much as he's crying for himself.  Still, Rhys-Myers gives a charismatic performance and manages to make his emotionally blank character rather compelling.  Rhys-Myers does such a good job that the audience finds themselves watching if just out of the hope that his character will reveal some sort of goodness.  In many ways, the audience ends up in the same position as the family Rhys-Myers marries into; they find themselves fooled by a very likeable but ultimately empty psychopath. <br /> <br />Largely because the lead character, in this case, is such a demonic presence even before the film's final tragic acts, Match Point's story doesn't carry quite the same philosophical weight as the story in Crimes and Misdemeanors.   Indeed, Match Point works less as an examination of fate and luck in a Godless universe as it does as a very revealing look at modern day class struggle.  Though never implicitly stated, it is clear that Rhys-Myers' attraction to Johansson is largely based on the fact that she is a product of the same type of lower class background that he is trying to escape by marrying Mortirmer.  Rhys-Myers sees in the unstable, neurotic Johansson everything that he's trying to hide within himself.  It's what makes it impossible for him to resist pursuingher and also what makes their relationship doomed from the very beginning.   <br /> <br />Though this film is obviously not for everyone, it is one of the better examples of one of Woody Allen's so-called \\"serious films.\\"  Like his previous dramatic films, Match Point is, at times, a little bit too somber for it's own good.  One has to respect that a filmmaker best known for his comedies is so comfortable making a film without humor but the film's total lack of joy becomes almost as much of a distraction as an inappropriate interlude of slapstick would have been.  Even the most serious of people occasionally tell a joke!  Still, Match Point is a worthwhile film for audiences who go to films to think as opposed to merely being entertained.
B000002KMY|5.0|'The Mob Rules' doesn't have any tracks quite as awesome as 'Heaven & Hell' or 'Neon Knights', but it still surpasses that album slightly due to its greater consistency, making it easily the most consistent Black Sabbath album I've heard.  Stylistically it's just a continuation, or, arguably, a retread of 'Heaven & Hell' as Sab continues with their far less doomy, more classic/power metal sound bolstered by Dio's ultra-operatic vocals.  Make no mistake, Dio is major step up from Ozzy.  They made Ozzy work alright but he's still got a reedy, thin voice and a range of about 2 notes.  Dio, however, is the quintessential heavy metal vocalist, and he's great here, if you're into that kind of thing.  The band is in fine form too, with some more consistent riffage from Iommi and some of his best leadwork ever.  The rhythm section is pushed down in the mix, particularly when compared to early Black Sabbath, so they don't stand out much, but they get the job done.<br /><br />It opens with 'Turn Up the Night', one of the finest fast songs Sab ever recorded.  'Voodoo' is a bit slower and more atmospheric, but still a total rocker.  Great song.  'The Sign of the Southern Cross' is the epic of the album, and it completely rules, even if it can't quite match the majesty of 'Heaven & Hell'.  The main riff is probably the best one on the album, and Dio's vox are dynamic and melodic as ever.  The title track is another catchy, rocker track, albeit with a bit more groove.  Not the best thing here, but still good.  'Country Girl' has some of the most memorable vocal melodies on the album, and has a nice little interlude.  The album never drops in quality, with the fine riffarama 'Slipping Away' giving way to the pseudo-balladish, slightly epic 'Falling of the Edge of the World' before closing witht the dirge 'Over and Over'.  Quite a few people don't like this track, but I think it's excellent.  Some of Iommi's most emotional leads and more first-rate vox from Dio.  It's slow, I'll admit, but hell, this is Black Sabbath.  You should expect a little slowness now and then.<br /><br />Yeah, this album rules.  Total classic.admit, but hell, this is Black Sabbath.  You should expect a little slowness now and then. <br /> <br />Yeah, this album rules.  Total classic.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|This movie is pure cinamatic gold.  I was sure that Jackson couldn't live up to Lord of the Rings, but he did.  Peter Jackson is a genius and anyone that doesn't like this movie, is looking for too much.  Great action, great story, alright acting and fantastic SFX.  Peter Jackson should make more movies such as The Hobbit, God of War (PS2 game) and remake Clash of the Titans or Jason and the Argonauts.  I would give this movie 6 stars if I could.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Does anybody have any doubt about the importance and influence of the Beatles in modern music? Well, the \\"quiet Beatle\\" played a critical role behind scenes working with Lennon and McCartney to polish the sound of their songs, helping Ringo to nail down some compositions, and writing his own material, which is an invaluable legacy to the world. Just for these reasons you shouldn't miss the opportunity of buying this edition with two DVD's.  But if you want to dissect the content, you will find that the first part of the first DVD has amazing Indian music (Arpan) conducted by the beautiful and talented Anoushka Shankar... yes, the daughter of Ravi Shankar. Ravi also appears as the leyend he is, and as a friend and sitar master he was for George. The second part has a hilarious performance by Monty Python and his crew (you may identify Tom Hanks as one of the Canadian rangers). My personal preference is that the tribute would have been just perfect without this part, but I guess it is fine to include some British humor (no offence) in the program. The biggest part of the first DVD is the music of Harrison leaded by Clapton, supported by a band full of stars (including the London Metropolitan Orchestra), and with some amazing guests such as Tom Petty, Joe Brown, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr.   The second DVD is additional material where you will enjoy some comments from Eric Clapton, George's son Dhani, and other participants on how the tribute concert was put together and some rehearsal material. If after this you do not buy it... you would miss a historical document.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|The John Mayer Trio should be praised for their live album TRY! I was not a john mayer fan before I bought this album, John Mayer was always known for being a pop artist and im sure he got tired of playing music the people wanted. This is when he expanded deep into the roots from Classic Rock, to Blues john mayer really gives the people everything you'd expect from old Ray Charles songs such as I Got A Women, to Hendrix's axis bold as love songs such as Wait Until Tommorow. This serves a great purpose for the music scene. Their are countless numbers of solid jams and creativity on this live one! I could probably write a book on how great this album is but im going to stop with this. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00005JOIF|3.0|When I saw this movie with my college buddies I was expecting a very intelligent real life story.  I got exactly what I expected.  Eric Bana was very good in this movie and Daniel Craig was his usual self as in Layer Cake and Enduring Love.  Direction was brilliant and real, with very life like stabbing in the head moment and woman getting shot in the chest bit.  There was a lot of talking in this movie which was needed, but I found that all of the long talking scenes where quite boring to me.<br /><br />Overall this movie had no emotion or heart.  I didn't care about the characters and found the movie too long.  It was good, but nothing special.
B00000K0EA|5.0|When MGM successfully resurrected the near dead James Bond franchise with \\"007:  Goldeneye\\" starring the newest James Bond, Pierce Brosnan, many critics felt that maybe the franchise had experienced it's final adventure.  The box office gold that resulted from the film told a different story, putting another adventure starring everyone's favorite MI-6 agent on the fast track to production.  With a solid story, returning cast members and some new additions, not to mention Bond fans salivating over the casting of sexy Teri Hatcher (TV's \\"Lois & Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman\\") as the latest Bond girl, expectations were justifiably high for this 18th James Bond film.  While some of the efforts in this long-lasting franchise have been less than stellar, the most disappointing would be \\"007:  Moonraker\\" starring Roger Moore (the worst James Bond in history), this newest Bond adventure was not one of the weak installments, and truth be told is one of the better adventures in the secret agent's illustrious career. <br /> <br />\\"007:  Tomorrow Never Dies\\" focuses on a deranged media mogul (Jonathan Pryce) who sets out to setup international incidents that will force the world's superpowers to go to war with each other.  MI-6 receives word of this plot and enlists the talents of their best agent to get a handle on the fragile situation by establishing a dialogue with the media mogul's estranged lover (Teri Hatcher), the problem is this sexy vixen just so happens to be a former flame of Agent 007.  Can James Bond put aside his still smoldering passion for this woman?  And can she forgive him for walking out on her or will she betray him in the end?  As if this wasn't enough for 007 to handle, the Chinese have sent a secret agent of their own (Michelle Yeoh) to thwart the media terrorist from bringing his plans to fruition.  Now, Bond must do something that he's never been comfortable in doing, that is to put his trust in another agent and work together to bring the media mogul to justice before all is lost. <br /> <br />If you recall in my review for \\"007:  Goldeneye\\" I stated that I felt Pierce Brosnan's performance as 007 to be somewhat shaky (those may have not been the exact words I used, but you get the point).  However, any uneasiness that Mr. Brosnan may have had in regards to the role, he has clearly overcome them in time for this installment into this franchise that is once again at the top of its game.  The addition of Teri Hatcher and Michelle Yeoh as the two Bond girls, although Teri is the only one most guys remember, because lets face it if you had to choose between Teri or Michelle, who would you choose?  Honestly.  The story is, in my opinion, much stronger this time around with even more twists, turns, and action to keep your adrenaline pumping.  The casting of Jonathan Pryce as the film's main villain at first glance might seem a bit of a weak choice; however, since the role didn't demand any real physical threat to be given, opting to instead deliver a more psychological scare, that coupled with Pryce's soft-spoken yet somewhat demented demeanor, made him an excellent choice for the role. <br /> <br />Based on how much I enjoyed this installment into the `James Bond' franchise, I'll be the first to say that my doubts regarding Pierce Brosnan as the newest Bond were unfounded.  He clearly is capable to carry on the torch that was started all those years ago by Sean Connery.  If you are a James Bond fan, which most people are to some extent, \\"007:  Tomorrow Never Dies\\" is definitely one Bond movie I'm sure you've already seen, and if you haven't you really should get your act together. <br /> <br />\\"007:  Tomorrow Never Dies\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.

This is particularly scary in light of the Sony Rootkit that has compromised so many computers worldwide.

Emotional score, dramatic acting and dark to the core.  Brilliant.
0060555661|5.0|I have read several books on investing and this is by far the best one I have read so far.  I found it quite funny that the 70's were a redo of the 30's and as Zweig's commentary points out, 1999-2002 was a redo of the 70's.  The original text was very educational in that it teaches a very value oriented way to invest.  Graham's three rules have tempered what I buy and what I dont buy.  The commentary provides an even better understanding of Graham's text as it relates what happend in the last few years to what Graham talks about.  I really enjoyed this book a lot and got a lot out of it.  As a physician by background, I have no formal investment or financial training.  I have also told several friends to read this book and they have also been very impressed by the quality and timeless nature of Graham's work.  A+++, a must read for anyone who wants to make money on the stock market with minimal risk but is willing to sacrifice explosive gains by not buying issues like google.

B00005UQ9F|3.0|When I was informed of this film, I instantly expected it to be a dull, cheap and over the top slasher with cheap scares.  For the films low budget its far from cheap.  I found this film to be very interesting from start to finish.  Excellent acting from a highly underated cast, excellent plot that was well told, no evidence of cheap scares anywhere and a little creepy in some places.<br /><br />This film was very chilling.  It's brilliant story and puzzling characters hold it together like an old man with a new hip.<br /><br />I gave this movie 3 stars, even though it was very good I thought it needed a tiny bit more suspence and thrills.  The musical score was very simple but in some places very constant and repetitive.  Overall, a very good film to watch in the dark or at Halloween.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
B0000844I8|2.0|Like Aliens and T2, the new footage on this extended edition adds nothing and detracts from the suspense.  Unlike other remasters, however, the picture quality here is off:  too contrasty and saturated, as if the dvd colorist attempted to mold the entire dynamic range of the high res 4:4:4 transfer to the MPEG-2 format.  You just can't do that without making it look wanky in the process.  It must be accepted that you'll lose the subtle highlight texturing on the shoulder and the nuance in the blacks (the foot).  The high frequency picture details also look to have been boosted excessively.  I saw this in the theater, and it just doesn't look natural to my eye on this version.  Dune Special Edition, Matrix Reloaded, The Constant Gardener, The Lover, etc, all look correct to me.  This is the only DVD I have that looks off like this, and it's obviously an attempt to cash in on the \\"new edition\\" craze fueled by unqualified DVD magazine reviewers who get off on more and more color and contrast to show off their deficient (in those regards) rear projection and plasma TVs.  My Akai TV was calibrated by an Akai-approved projessional as close to the NTSC standard as they could and my DVD playback is through the pro-grade ATI Theater chip on my x800xt All In Wonder VIVO card.  The new special editions also do not include the original version of the film.  Stargate was a real trip in the theater.  It is less entertaining and engaging on later viewings, but I would still like a decent copy of the theatrical edit.  I can't imagine it being very enjoyable if you're a first time viewer and this is what you're stuck with, both in terms of the cut and picture neutrality.  In particular, various new scenes rob you of the shock at seeing those images for the first time later in the film.  You get what you pay for.<br /><br />Update: After getting the original single-layer 2-sided DVD (the one you have to flip), I'm giving up on trying to find a proper edition of Stargate.  The original is non-anamorphic letterbox.  The Special Edition is non-anamorphic letterbox (as far as I can tell), though that one does have both versions of the film using branching on a single DVD.  The Pioneer version appears to be the best in terms of visual quality and is anamorphic, but unfortunately (isn't it always?) that one is region 2 and PAL.  If it was region free I might get it since my computer can do fair PAL-NTSC conversion for my TV, and if I eventually get a DLP projector it's not an issue at all (no conversion needed).  But I don't think ATI MMC will do very many playbacks of other regions.  I'm not sure, though.  I'll have to check on that.  What a drag this is just trying to find a good copy of the theatrical cut.<br /><br />Another Update: I ordered the Pioneer European PAL edition after hacking my DVD Burner's firmware to region-free.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|i rented \\"Donnie Darko\\" when i had some free time to myself one night.  My friends were telling me it was an excellent movie so i decided to give it a shot.  i was amazed at the acting, the storytelling, everything about this movie is amazing.   <br /> <br />the storyline is complex but, if you can understand it at the end is well worth watching the movie.  its one of those you may have to watch two or three times to fully comprehend.   <br /> <br />i loved it so much that i took it to my friends house the next day and watched it again.   <br /> <br />a must see; if you see one movie this year, make sure its \\"Donnie Darko.\\"

B000CBSHK2|1.0|Like many songwriters who depend on atmospherics rather than melodies alone to convey their emotional state throughout an album, Beth is a prime candidate for elaborate production. Both \\"Central Reservation\\" and \\"Daybreaker\\" benefited from ethereal synths and a pioneering mix of trip-hop sensibilities jarringly interspersed with bare, haunting folk tunes. This gave Beth's songs an illusory subtext, as if she were communicating with us from a mysterious and melancholy place; she could weave her frail voice around these sonorities rather than around the basic melodies, thus creating an original whole. <br />Stripping her music of lavish production is a bad idea. Without it, there isn't much there. As I realized during a brief gig a few years ago, when I heard Beth alone on stage with her acoustic, accompanied by another subdued acoustic guitarist, bereft of studio magic her songs are simple to the point of being boring - most consist of two chords - and her lyrics, while intelligent, lose much of that essential mystery. This can now be said of the whole unfortunate \\"Comfort of Strangers\\" album. Although there is a bright spark here and there, overall the music is completely unaffecting. After several auditions, not a single tune has made a mark on me. It sounds like something old sixties' folkies did when they tried to add a bit of pizzaz to their listless stuff, without daring to go fully-electric. It was classy to be a tad jazzy, but it was vulgar to be rock. It sounds like Beth is suffering from the same ambivalence.  <br />Undoubtedly, many will like this album for the very absence of punch that I find deplorable - folkies, indeed; those who hated \\"The other side of Daybreak,\\" which I found to be a whole lotta fun.  <br />

B00000JHAU|5.0|Are you a lovelorn twenty-something with reams of poetry slowly mouldering in the drawers of your bedroom dresser? An idealistic humanist who prefers the charities listed on U2's latest album liner to the record packaged with them? An English professor? A cynic who still craves Romantic poetry? A decadent nihilist waking from the latest in a long line of hopeless one-night-stands? A fan of Wes Anderson movies? The Smiths? The Beatles (circa 1965-1969)? Or just someone who melts in the face of beautiful music, regardless of its style or source?  <br />If you can answer yes to any of those questions, \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\" might just hit you like the Revelation of St. John. These songs come from a gushing source of the internal commotion locked in the heads of young people. The subjects of these vignettes range from pre-suicidal portraits (\\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\") to the exploits of a social-climbing high-school lothario and the recipients of the serial sexual awakenings he offers (\\"Stars of Track and Field\\") to the tension resulting from everyday momentary encounters between a fey young man and his conservative neighbor (\\"Me and the Major\\"). Although the lyrics are not worthy of Baudelaire or Byron, they include rich imagery, realistic psychological portraits, strong narrative structures, and delicious non-sequiters such as \\"...your terry underwear;/ You feel the city air run past your body,\\" and \\"She was into S&M and Bible studies,/ not everyone's cup of tea, she would admit to me.\\" All of this is set to luxuriant and memorable melodies and stirring instrumentation whose richness redeems by far the album's low-cost production. Plus, \\"Judy and the Dream of Horses\\" is one of the catchiest, prettiest, most bouyant songs ever recorded.  <br />This album has a history of being regarded by fans as a rare treasure that should be kept close and adulated; many have become obsessed or at least infatuated with Belle and Sebastian because of this record. It is such atreasure. Listen, and cherish away.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Going into this movie I had very high expectations.  I heard from many friends that it was a great movie.  I was totally prepared for it to knock me off of my feet.  I was also a little worried because I am not a fan of scary movies.  I was going to be watching this all by myself in the dark, and I didn't want to have any nightmares.  On both counts I would have to say that The Machinist didn't live up to its billing.  The ending didn't blow me away.  I can't claim that I was expecting that exact ending, but it surely didn't suprise me at all.  I felt the movie was a little anticlimactic.  There was a lot of suspense, a lot of building tension and then the end just didn't do it for me.  I did like how it kept me on edge almost the entire time, but really wasn't scary.  I don't like gory movies, but I do like suspense, and this movie did an excellent job with that.  Immediately after watching the movie I felt a little let down. I thought that it was good, but didn't deserve any more than 3 stars.  The next day I reevaluated my opinion and decided that it was actually a really good movie.  We get to see Bale give a great performance, and not just because he lost so much weight.  It takes more than that to be a good actor.  Although I do agree his apperance made the movie more \\"real\\".  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is old enough to watch it.  It was really well executed.  I felt it was very similar to the movie The Jacket.  Both movies have a similar feel and tone.  Ironically Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a pretty major role in both movies.  I do feel that The Machinist is the better of the two movies.  In conclusion, yes, I was slightly dissapointed by this movie because I was expecting some shocking and crazy ending.  However, looking back on it, I am very satisfied with the ending.  It is truly a movie about how one man deals with tragedy, and how his life can never be the same again.
B00004VWAF|5.0|This CD has been lined up against the unrealistic expectations of jazz \\"purists\\" all over, who believe Miles should have stayed in one narrow type of Jazz, either that of the seminal quintet featuring Miles, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Tony Williams, and Herbie Hancock, or the earlier Kind Of Blue band with John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, etc.  <br /> <br />If you wanted Miles to \\"stay the same\\", this CD isn't for you. These are the people who have pulled the rating of this disc down below 5 stars. I agree to a certain extent, some of the jazz Miles produced was what Jazz is all about--back then. It is definitely worth a listen.  <br /> <br />But if you are just getting into Miles, and you stumble onto this album, you'll love it, if you don't try to put jazz into a swing box. The rhythms are African-American, yet very improvisational, the beats hold this together, but the melody played by all instruments variously is a free-form melody. All the melodies are played in the rhythm. Very funky, very meditative, On The Corner, is an aggressive inter-weaving of rhythmic textures. The energy level on this recording is incredible.  <br /> <br />When this came out, as other reviewers have mentioned, Herbie Hancock had just came out with the Headhunters CD, which was huge in sales. This one was a dissappointment for Miles, although artistically this album exceeds the catchy Headhunters CD, and it has definitely withstood the test of time.  <br /> <br />One need only listen to the Cellar Door Sessions to realize that Miles was continually moving into a beat-oriented funk-jazz during this time, but Miles' jazz improvisational roots ran deep. You hear something NEW and INTERESTING each time this CD is played, which is true of Miles Davis' BEST recordings.  <br /> <br />To hear this as an individual recording, out of context of the other Miles Davis styles, it stands as a brilliant work of ART. And it has definitely aged well--which is nice for anyone who is looking for something NEW, because it has a very low price, compared to some of the dub CDs you can buy at twice the price, this is a bargain. This is a hidden gem of a recording that I'm sure those of you who enjoy intent listening experiences will appreciate.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If, like me, you aren't a great fan of TV sci-fi such as Buffy, StarTrek, Stargate and the like, you are in for a great surprise. Although this is a spin off from a TV show, this film absolutely kicks ass. It is the freshest, most exciting and memorable sci-fi flick in recent memory. I'd say that apart from the cracking effects, design, score, acting and costume, the most remarkable element is absolutely the script. Dialogue that really breathes life into the lovable characters and malice into the baddies. Punchy but never corny one-liners and a mixture of sarcastic and slip-on-banana style humour. I'm massively tired of Hollywood movies and although this film was made there, it has none of the formulaic schmaltz or predictability of a Hollywood movie. It has a truly dynamic and surprising plot that is always credible, always surprising and nothing is ever resolved by recalibrating the disconbobulator. <br /> <br />If you like this movie, go buy the TV series Firefly. It's 630 minutes of the same stuff. In your face Fox Television! This film ROCKS!
B00006EXL5|5.0|I went out and bought Three Cheers like everybody else after hearing the song \\"Im not okay\\" and it was a pretty good album that became popular real fast. Then I saw the video for \\"Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough For the Two Of Us\\" and I really like this MCR so I bought this CD and am very much satisfied. The greatest thing about this CD is that it was produced by Geoff Rickley of Thursday, Thursday being one of my fav bands, so I knew it would be awesome. This CD is much more darker and heavier than three cheers, which is a good thing to me, but not to pop princesses out there. I enjoy the lyrics and every song is listenable, I recommend this CD to people who like THursday.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Going into this movie (not having seen the trailers), I only knew it was about two secret agents, what I didn't know was that it would be about two secret agents who are married to each other and don't know the other one is in the business.  The movie gets better as they are both assigned to the same target.  This movie is hilarious and action packed.  10!
B000C65Z1G|3.0|Adapted from John Le Carre's The Constant Gardener was a bit of a letdown after Meirelles' riveting City of God. While Gardener  certainly probes into geopolitical issues with urgency and thoughtfulness, its mood and rhythm isn't consistent and is inferior to City of God in terms of vibrant energy. After a solid first act, it considerably loses its momentum once Rachel Weisz's character gets murdereed, it becomes somewhat plodding and tentative.  <br /> <br />City of God, on the other hand, crackles with energy and verve and its unique aesthetic mood and style influences new films, like this new US documentary \\"Favela Rising\\", set in the Brazilian slums where an ex-drug dealer starts a musical revolution with hip-hop and reggae.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I wish Bill Murray would get back to doing movies such as this, Scrooged and What About Bob.  This is absolutely my favorite of his movies because of the witty dialogue and physical comedy.  It is such a great storyline-having to repeat Groundhog Day over and over again.  Andy MacDowell is great as the love interest, and Chris Elliot is hilarious as the cameraman.  The chance of you loving this movie is 100%!

B0000AZKLF|5.0|Albert King was always overshadowed by BB King and thus never received the credit he deserved for the way he shaped how the electric guitar is played. This is true not only in the blues but indeed in all styles of music. Modern guitar players who look back with a sense of fondness for players such as Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Paul Kossof, etc. would do well to consider the man who so strongly influenced their playing as well as countless others. (Including bluesmen Otis Rush and Albert Collins: already distinctive stylists in their own right.) And perhaps no other guitar player was as influenced by Albert King as the young Texan Stevie Ray Vaughan.  <br /> <br />To say that Stevie Ray Vaughan idolized Albert King would not be inaccurate nor would saying that Stevie's style was about 80% influenced by the mammoth Mississippi bluesman. On this album, the songs are mainly from King's repertoire but in many cases Stevie had been weaned on them and practiced them in his formative years so there was not much in the way of adjustment for him here generally speaking.  <br /> <br />It starts with \\"Stormy Monday\\" which King begins with some of his signature mournful phrasing while Vaughan utilizes a tasteful countermelody in return. Albert's comments as the song was starting off indicate that they have played the song together before and the smooth way they played off one another would seem to verify that. From there a bit of dialogue takes place where they reminisce about old times and at Albert's request, Stevie kicks off \\"Pride and Joy.\\" From there they moved into \\"Ask Me No Questions.\\" Unlike the previous song where it was King who had to adapt to a new song, this time it was Vaughan and he does so quite well with tasteful vibrato fills and taking the first solo at King's request. They then dialogue a bit more with Albert asking Stevie to never settle but instead to always strive to work and play better.  <br /> <br />At that point, Albert kicks off \\"Blues at Sunrise\\" and anyone who doubts that a fifteen minute blues song with a shuffle beat can be kept interesting for fifteen minutes needs to hear these two play off of each other as they do here.  <br /> <br />From there, it moves (after some dialogue) into the instrumental \\"Overall Junction\\" which has a strident pacing to it. Vaughan starts it off and gets his bits in certainly -based on much of what he plays his familiarity with the original tune (as recorded by King in 1966) is evident to this listener. And King shows on the song for those who would question it that he can move around the fretboard nimbly...a feature he usually saved for instrumentals but not always. They then move pretty quickly into \\"Matchbox Blues\\" a longtime King concert staple. Stevie's playing in the song is a homage to Albert and he certainly could authentically approach the latter's style better than arguably anyone else. There is then another dialogual interlude prior to the last song \\"Don't Lie to Me\\", a song Stevie would recognize as \\"I Get Evil.\\" Again the dueling is entertaining when Vaughan goes into the lower registers and Albert encourages him further in the process. That concludes the album but not this review.  <br /> <br />The essence of blues playing requires soul and you cannot manufacture it by wanking speed riffs on a fretboard. (I note that here for those who think \\"better blues playing\\" means faster playing: that is not necessarily so.) Albert King was a master of the blues and Stevie Ray Vaughan was his most loyal disciple. Indeed, I believe Stevie is the only one who could so flagrantly use King's own signature riffs in his playing without the master himself taking offense. And when you consider that Albert did not take such things lightly --because he developed a unique style and by his reckoning owned it-that is no mean achievement.  <br /> <br />Clearly on this album King had in mind to some extent a passing of the torch to Vaughan at one point in the recording becausehe plainly says so after they finished playing \\"Blues at Sunrise.\\" Stevie laughs and says he does not believe it but the sentiments sounds convincing enough even if King was to continue playing live after Vaughan's passing in 1990 at the tender age of 35. (The former retired and made comebacks in the same fashion as Frank Sinatra: at least in King's case, he retained his form all the way to the end with minimal if any diminishment.) As far as Vaughan's death goes, King would recount in a 1991 interview published before his own passing that Stevie's loss hurt him deeply and if you listen to the way they interact musically and otherwise on this album, it makes sense. What started out as a young boy and his idol grew into a situation where they were contemporaries and there was a genuine affection between them. Albert seemed to view Stevie as his son in the blues and no father wants to see his son go before him. May they both rest in peace and may this recording stand as a testament to them.  <br />

B000CBSHK2|2.0|Many say that Portishead invented the Trip Hop genre about a decade ago.  Morcheeba and Beth Orton took the cue and expanded things beyond trip hop and maybe into \\"trance hop\\" or \\"trance folk\\" respectively. <br /> <br />Orton's previous records had a haunting quality to them.  She coaxed some ghostly sound effects out of her synthesizers that would become her signature sound.  If you listen carefully, you'll hear echoes, if not outright samples of those sounds in a wide variety of musicians' albums several years after her seminal 'Trailer Park' and 'Central Reservation' albums. <br /> <br />In the liner notes to 'Comfort of Strangers', she thanks Jim O'Rourke for \\"...the aural illusions and visions...\\".  I've given this CD multiple spins, and for the life of me, I'm not hearing anything aural beyond very simple arrangements. This is a little surprising, because O'Rourke wasn't shy about aiding and abetting aural illusions, visions, and beyond with Wilco. <br /> <br />I hate to say this, because her previous albums way up on my favorite records list, but this record is actually just kind of boring. <br /> <br />During the lead up to the release, critics were oo-ing and aw-ing all over themselves about this and Cat Power's new release; mostly while reviewing both at the same time.  They got me to buy both, just as amazon suggests too.  I'm utterly transfixed by Cat Power's \\"The Greatest\\", and am sorry to say that the same can't be said for 'Comfort of Strangers'. <br /> <br />I'm counting on her getting her groove on again on the next release.  <br />
B000CNFC76|4.0|It's pretty much inconceivable that Hollywood will ever tell a true story in a completely accurate way. A certain amount of dramatic license is forgivable, and probably even necessary in order to compress the story into a couple hours. Even fabricating a sub-plot involving a fictional love interest is okay if it doesn't take over the film. <br />So, despite the historical inaccuracies in this movie (with regard both to Francis' personal life and the details of what occurred during the Open), this is an enjoyable film that captures the spirit and the essential facts of this classic David and Goliath story.
B000AP04FG|2.0|This was not a good movie. It was really lacking something...so much that I couldn't even finish watching it.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson has come out with many CDs, and I find \\"On and On\\" to be the best.  The smooth acoustic songs are catchy, and they all have great lyrics.

B00000AFWW|4.0|I want to start by saying I know jack-all about music. I am one of those silly sods who only knows what he likes, and this is a hell of an album.<br /><br />As I recall, when \\"Celebrity Skin\\" hit the market it took a fairly heavy beating from all quarters. Rock critics found the album to be a bit too \\"glossy\\", fans made the usual accusations about \\"selling out\\" and the morons who write for music magazines and music television harped about its \\"disappointing\\" sales. Lost in all this furor was the fact that Hole had produced some bloody fine music if anyone cared to shut their gob and listen.<br /><br />\\"Celebrity Skin\\", being a Courtney Love & Co. production, is obviously riddled with angst, cynicism, depression, desperation, melancholia and the occasional dose of rage. BFD, you say? Well, what distinguishes it from the whole punk-grunge-indie-alt mob doing exactly the same bloody thing is that Love's vocals, and more importantly the lyrics behind them, are truly first-rate. Some of the songs are so well-written they have to be read as text to be fully appreciated. \\"Use once and Destroy\\" is an excellent example of how lyrics can often do stand-in for first-class poetry:<br /><br />It's the emptiness that follows you down<br /><br />It's the ache inside when it all burns out<br /><br />It's poisonous it muscles it aches<br /><br />It's everything you had when it breaks<br /><br />It's the emptiness that's all you have left<br /><br />Too terrified of your frozen breath<br /><br />It's a bitter mouth it's buttered and knived<br /><br />It's the awful truth you fight for your life<br /><br />It might as well it might as well hurt<br /><br />It might as well it might as well<br /><br />I went down to rescue you<br /><br />I went all the way down<br /><br />Fill your hungry wretched life<br /><br />Here they come it's closing time<br /><br />It's the bitter root it's twisted inside<br /><br />It's the heart you used to have when it died<br /><br />It's the emptiness it poisons it lies<br /><br />It's everything that you'll never find<br /><br />Like all great albums, this one manages to create an atmosphere which pervades each individual track, so that each cut, even when their moods differ, nevertheless feels like its part of a whole. The atmosphere, of course, is not exactly happy. As usual, Love sounds like she's cruising through a hefty dose of scrip drugs washed down with red wine; her mood is like a parabola and each individual emotion (despair, fury, futility) represents a point on its descending curve. Nevertheless, between the fusilades of angry and cynical words comes the occasional blast of humor (\\"Love hangs herself/with the bedsheets in her cell\\" is a good one; so is the line about \\"hooker/waitress/model/actress\\", which if you've been to L.A. is a pretty good description of the people). In fact, as the title implies, a good bit of \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is directed at the Music Industry, with all the tenderness and gentility of of a Molotov cocktail hurled through a window; but Love is not merely ranting about \\"the business\\"; it's the people that make it up she wants to bleed, and that clearly includes herself. I think to a certain extent, Love got caught between identities -- the grungy, angry, combat-booted one she started with and the Versace-wearing, Oscar-pandering, I'm-so-glad-to-be-here one she ended up with. The lyrics of the superb \\"Malibu\\" (\\"how'd you get so burned when you're barely on fire?\\") are probably more about her than she ever realized.<br /><br />So why didn't it do better? Somewhere in the album there's a line about how \\"beauty blinds.\\" This album is beautiful, but it's a vicious kind of beauty, like a left hook to the liver. What can I say? Love hurts baby.>Like all great albums, this one manages to create an atmosphere which pervades each individual track, so that each cut, even when their moods differ, nevertheless feels like its part of a whole.

B00005UW9T|5.0|Although we can all agree that there is almost nothing historically accurate about this film, Anastasia is a beautiful, sweeping film to enjoy on its own. It offers a wonderful storyline that I personally wish had been a true account of Anastasia's story. The score is simply astounding, and such songs as \\"Journey to the Past\\" and \\"Once upon a December\\" are magnificently done and are terrific pieces. Overall, you're going to love this movie as long as you don't compare it to the real story of Anastasia.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|The costuming was terrible in this adaptation.  They looked so frumpy a lot of the times.  I didn't like that.  Kiera Knightley was good, but I especially liked the actress who portrayed Jane.  She did a far superior job than the Jane in the BBC miniseries.  She looked the part too.  I wish that she had played Jane in the BBC miniseries, then the masterpiece would have been complete.  I didn't like how they portrayed Mrs. Bennett as a drunkard and Mr. Bennett so seriously, not showing the sense of humor he obviously had in the book.  Donald Sutherland was the wrong choice of all actors in the movie.  But overall, it was fun to watch.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|I copped my Donuts record the day it dropped. It's hot to death. You've got a particularly focused treatment of soul-heavy samples that have defined the kind of work he did with Slum Village, Common, and Jaylib. He departs from the spaced-out keyboard jams that he rocked with acts like Frank n Dank, MED and Oh No.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest fan of instrumental albums but in JD's case I'll cop whatever he throws at me. The dude dropped pure hottness from day one, and despite the fact that his oeuvre has been cut criminally short, he will remain as one of the best beatsmiths to have (n)ever blessed your earphones. He did his thing with the kind of quiet genius that deserves infinite respect. In an industry dominated by testosterone-injected megalomaniacs J Dilla was a king among men.<br /><br />Donuts is fire, trust me. I'm not just saying that because the man passed on. It's a short album - standard for Stones Throw - but that's always a good thing with beat tapes. The shorter the beats the greater the consistency. It's a great tape for anyone looking to understand quality production: there's a lot to cover and it's a great listening experience so it's really quite inspiring.<br /><br />Dig into your crates and see just how important Dilla is to your hip hop collection. I don't claim to know the dude but I know his work inside and out and I can say with great sympathy to his friends and family that we've lost one of the best.<br /><br />Rest in Peace J Dilla

B00005JO1R|5.0|...and I guess, despite some \\"evil\\" rumours about wether \\"Walk the line\\" is true to Cashs' real life or not, this movie should answer many questions. Personally I didn't really know that much about Johnny Cash before I went to see this movie, and I must say it made a deep impression.     It is a sad story, and you really struggle with Cash throughout the movie. His life indeed was no picnic, being the invisible son to his fathers' eyes, the loss of his best friend and older brother favored of the two even long after his early, tragic death (this truely haunts Johnny Cash, and the cold relationship between him and his father), his drug and alcohol abuse the way it grows along with his carreer, his turbulent marriage, Johnny Cash simply doesn't function until he is gradually saved by his one and only true love -June Carter. From his early days listening to her voice on the radio as a kid (she was a child star), it also grows to become a gripping, beautiful lovestory. \\"Walk the line\\" introduces Johnny Cash as a kind and gentle, but a soulsick and lonely man. Until the outcome of his relationship with June Carter that is. The ending has a tone of the \\"...and they lived happily ever after...\\"-kind, and it is well earned!     It is brilliantly expressed between many of his old music-classics, with great acting and the dialogue in focus. The filming could not have been better, and the timing -well, not an uninteresting, dull moment. J.Phoenix is Johnny Cash, R.Witherspoon is June Carter -and I must say that especially she managed to impress me (and perhaps for the first time, the girl can act!) I was impressed by Val Kilmer in \\"The Doors\\", I am just as impressed by J.Phoenix from his appearence in \\"Walk the line\\".     See this film!

It might be the subtle story told by the rhyme. It might also be the excellent illustrations, semi-collage illustrations with somewhat unusual shapes that catch the eye and stretch the imagination.<br /><br />In any case, this is a much-loved and still requested book in this house.
B00005B36H|5.0|This must certaintly be the greatest album ever. <br /> <br />Every song is awesome, and only parabola receives below 10/10. <br /> <br />What is noteworthy his is that Tool has mastered the prog rock stylings that they began on Aenema, their second best album.  The songs \\"The Grudge\\", \\"The Patient\\", are particularly noteworth for their complex use of rythmical structures, and dramatic contrasts.  The title track and \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" are also particularly faultless tracks. <br /> <br />However, if you were new to tool, I wouldn't start with this album but rather listen to Aenema first which is slightly more accessible (a good starting song is \\"46 and 2\\" from that album).
B0006A9FKA|1.0|Some other negative poster said that if you like British comedy you would like this. Well, I love British comedy (Rowan Atkinson, French & Saunders, Ab Fab, etc.), but I couldn't get thru more than 25 minutes of this stinker. Didn't laugh once; absolutely nothing to compel me to watch it for a 26th minute. I picked this up at the library because it got an 80-some percent fresh rating at RottenTomatoes, which I thought after seeing it just again showed that critics do not view movies the same as real people. But when I came here to warn people to save their money, and saw it had 4 stars over a large number of reviews, I didn't know what to think. I guess you'll have to judge for yourself.

B000AP2ZDK|4.0|It was 1996; I had copped a mix by some no name Dj and was rocking it while doing nothing in particular. I'll never forget when the voices of Imani, Booty Brown and co came in on that tape followed by straight down the line percussion and a deep clean bass line, the track was 'Runnin' and the crew 'Pharcyde' whose album 'Labcabincalifornia' I copped a few months later. I didn't know it at that time but I'd just heard my first Jay Dee aka J Dilla produced beat, and I was hooked.     Unbeknownst to me (until I made a point of more thoroughly reading the linear notes of the albums I'd purchased over the years) I had been following the career of Jay Dee ever since I'd bought my first Hip Hop album 'Stakes is High' by De La in 96 with the title track being produced by Dilla. From this album through to songs on ATCQ's, 'Beats, Rhymes & Life' most of Commons 'Like Water for Chocolate' and the aforementioned 'Labcabincalifornia' all of which were albums that during the mid to late 90's copped serious rotation by me and many people I knew.     Dilla first really experienced more above ground exposure with the general acclaim that his Detroit crew Slum Village received for both 'Fantastic' Vol. 1 & 2. Following these albums Dilla left SV and moved into other collaborative efforts with Madlib in the form of Jaylib and the titled album 'Champion Sound' to his solo effort 'Welcome to Detroit' along with numerous remixes and productions jobs for people as varied as Janet Jackson, Q-Tip and MED to name only a few.    To condense his career and create a primer for the sake of this review I felt was important for a number of reasons. One being that with his death there is no doubt people who would of otherwise not of heard of Jay Dee and may have found themselves looking into this album due to the amount of respect being sent his way via 'big' names in the game. Also as his last album before his death it seems he was really still trying to progress his (and the Hip Hop movements) sound to the very last minute and that is evident in this and every album/song he worked on. So knowing about his back catalogue to an extent seemed relevant for refrence. It should also be noted that I've heard reports that most of this album, 'Donuts' was completed whilst he was in and out of hospital as you can sense this has definitely had an impact on the final recording once you''ve listened to it.     When first listening to this album I was expecting hard hitting raw simple breaks and samples with simple electronic keyboard lines, those that were very much the trade mark of the album 'Welcome to Detroit'. What I heard made for a very different experience. Far from a simple collection of a few instrumentals as can be deducted from the amount of tracks listed we receive a consistent and ever evolving collection of sound experiments consisting of jolty samples from everywhere, gritty drums, rocky guitars and raw cuts with a pace that never lets you get comfortable and drift into melancholy much like most instrumental albums. `Donuts' tone for me was reminiscent of The Avalanches and their album 'Since I left You' in that it creates a sort of sonic story. It is this sort of album production for me that is the trademark of some of the best instrumental albums within the scene; see Dj Shadow and Dj Krush respectively.     This is both the J Dilla we know and one we've never seen. When it comes down to it 'Donuts' is not a simple collection of tracks. This is an album made by a man who knew his time in this world was at an end and wanted to create a heartfelt musical album that both experimented with his trademark sounds and with what he thought the future could of been if we'd been blessed to have him in our presence a little bit longer.    Look out for his two final releases coming out this year called 'The Shinning' and 'Jay Love Japan' both of which were completed before his death.    RIP Jay Dee.  See you on the other side.  Love.    Pj.  ****1/2
B00020HEL6|5.0|I'm 40 and became a fan from the moment I first heard her sing. This young lady has an amazing gift.  She is skilled beyond her young years.  I saw her a while back on a late night show (Letterman?) and her talent just blew me away.  I wrote down her name to remember to find her CD.    I can say I love her CD, and as good as that is, I think she was even better singing live--I'm sure she'd give an amazing concert.  She has somehow tapped into the spirits of both Billie Holliday, and Ella Fitzgerald, and other greats of the 1940's like Rosemary Clooney, with a hint of Patsy cline in the mix, yet has a uniquely original style all of her own.  My favorite is \\"Is you is or is you ain't my baby\\" and this is the one she sung her heart out on, on live television, that made me an instant fan. It's such a nice surprise to see a revival of this great music and the very young enjoying and appreciating it with the likes of Michael Buble, and Chris Botti and Renee Olstead reminding us that good music is classic and never really goes out of style through subsequent generations. Look at Rod Stewart, Carly Simon and others also turning back to these standards and making them \\"cool\\" again.  All it takes is to listen to love this album!
0679420266|5.0|Jean-Paul Sartre suggests in his essay on Camus' The Stranger that, \\"For him, neither love nor individual loves exist. All that counts is the present and the concrete\\".  For Meursault, every experience has the equal importance. Therefore, his past and future don't have any particular significance in his life. He just lives the present and he \\"recreates himself\\"  every single day. He neither benefits from his past experiences nor invests on his future. When his mother dies, he can continue his life as if nothing has happened. When he is asked whether or not he loved his \\"Maman\\", he replies that he probably loved his mother but it didn't matter to him. In the general course of the novel, he is portrayed as a man who \\"has no desire to know these noble, continuous, completely identical feelings\\".  However, there are some remarkable scenes that mark slight departures from his \\"existentialist\\" personality which is depicted in the novel. By means of these scenes, Camus portrays a character whose lifestyle and actions are closer to the principles of \\"existentialism\\" rather than a person who qualifies himself as an existentialist and lives accordingly.  <br /> In the second part of the novel where he is put in prison as he has killed an Arab, it is possible to see some changes in his views which have been depicted as indifferent, passive and silent before. His expressive silence with short and simple descriptions turns into more complicated and abstract descriptions of his condition in the prison. In these descriptions, it is possible to say that he mentions more about the psychological aspects of his situation such as happiness, hope, boredom and even hatred. The last scene remarkably deviates from the \\"existentialist\\" course of the novel although it still has the qualities that affirm the principles of Meursault's existentialist personality explored by Sartre. <br />In the last scene, it is apparent that Meursault doesn't feel any kind of remorse for his murder during hisimprisonment. He explicitly remarks that his \\"debt owed to society\\" doesn't have any significance for him. He even thinks of any possibility of escape that can free him. But later, he gives up this idea as everything outside is designed to condemn him again. Later in the scene, he starts making up new laws that \\"give the condemned man a chance\\".  Since the laws of the society that he has rejected long ago are not valid for him, he doesn't think, even for a while, that he is guilty as he has killed a man and he deserves to be punished due to his crime. Each commitment plays the same role in his life. Therefore, nothing needs to be limited and regulated by laws and rules. And this affirms Sartre's analysis that \\"everything is lawful\\"  for Meursault. <br />In this scene, the aspects that depart from the general principles of existentialism are remarkably distinguishing the scene from the others. First of all, as Meursault suggests in a former scene, he has to benefit from his past not to get bored in the prison. Because he doesn't have present activities any longer such as swimming and dating with Marie to fill his every present day. That's why, he often remembers a story told by his Maman, which is about his father whom he has never known. He has to feed on his memories to live in the prison although he is regarded as a man for whom \\"all that counts is the present and the concrete\\". As he has suggested in a former scene, there are two things that he knows in the prison: \\"yesterday\\" and \\"tomorrow\\".  He has to fill his present day with the memories of the \\"yesterday\\" and has to wait for \\"tomorrow\\" to fill it up with the past again. There is nothing to do for a man who doesn't have anything new and concrete for the present although he is supposed to be a man \\"having neither past nor future\\".  The other distinctive point in the scene is that his feelings start to come to the surface as opposed to the other scenes that portray Meursault completely indifferent to any kind of feelings. When he comes closer to death, a struggle starts between his rational and indifferent side that goes parallel with the principles of existentialism and his other side which is completely human and reactive to death. This struggle constitutes the source of his hope, sensitivity and eventually hatred. His rational side which reigns in the novel insists that to die sooner or later doesn't mean anything as \\"life isn't worth living\\".  However, his sensitive and human side keeps on imagining that he is pardoned. At these moments he feels such intense emotions that he is receding from his rational side and it becomes harder and harder to calm himself down: \\"The trouble was that I would somehow have to cool the hot blood that would suddenly surge through my body and sting my eyes with a delirious joy. It would take all my strength to quiet my heart, to be rational\\".  As can be seen in the quotation, he can't help having a strong desire to live no matter how much he tries to make himself believe that to die or to live \\"doesn't matter\\" to him. At the very end of the novel, it is possible to infer that a strong hatred lies in him, which constitutes the main source of his indifference that rules the novel and of his intense feelings emerging against his rationality. It is this hatred that has emerged in the years of his education for all mankind, social norms, rules and traditions that have disappointed him; it is this hatred that has turned into his indifference to the whole world; and it is this hatred that is eventually vomited forth by a man whose last wish for his execution is \\"a large crowd of spectators\\" meeting him \\"with cries of hate\\". <br /> Camus' The Stranger gives the reader a portrait of the man, which is analyzed within the framework of existentialism in Jean-Paul Sartre's essay, and Sartre regards the novel as a complete affirmation of existentialism. However, when the novel is analyzed in a complete sense including the parts which deviate from its general \\"existential\\" flow, it is quite possible to conclude that Camus is not taking \\"existentialism as a position\\"  with its full sense, and creates the hero of his novel according to its principles; instead, he is exploring and testing its principles through Meursault. As it is seen in the last scene of the novel, Meursault is a character who has feelings and certain reactions when he comes face to face with the natural needs of his humanness. Emotions are indespensable parts of his nature as a human being. His feelings from which he can escape in a life of passivity become inevitable when he has to face with death.  <br />
B000BYA5G4|3.0|Okay, so it's sort of based on real events, but who knows to what degree?<br /><br />Too much effort in trying to be an artistic movie and too little actual just plain good movie...<br /><br />It's a shame 'cause Gage is a great actor, when he can just act, say in a flick like Matchstick Man, the movie is a lot better than in stuff like this or the silly movie with Jolie stealing cars, etc.<br /><br />The premise of gun running is interesting, so if you are interested in that, you'll find the movie decent enough.  If you don't like seeing violence and want to see better character development, skip it.
B00005JMXX|2.0|After reading [[ASIN:0743470656 The Coming Global Superstorm]] I had hoped this movie would expand on the ideas laid out in the book.  Instead I found it to be a sensationalist adaptation making use of only the most dramatic aspects of the Superstorm concept and very little of the explanation behind it.  The movie seemed to have been written specifically to include lots of \\"wow factor\\" in the form of amazing special effects, but little in the way of plot or character development.  I was reminded of the campy sci-fi of the 1950's, but without the campiness imparted by the intervening decades.    With slightly better writing, I felt this could have been an entertaining movie.  Having the father, a scientist and presumably an intelligent person, rush out into the storm to find his son was lame to say the least.  In real life he would know better.  There was a time late in the movie that I also got that \\"Titanic\\" feeling of characters running from place to place just to use up more film.    In my opinion, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" was worthy of a cheap DVD rental fee, but nothing more.
