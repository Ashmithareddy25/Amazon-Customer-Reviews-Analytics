B00G5LEXD8|5.0|Our daughter loves LEGO Friends. She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. We purchased the \\"Olivia's Tree House\\" Set for her for Christmas and it was a big hit. Since then, we have purchased several additional sets for her collection.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Dolphin Cruiser Play Set comes with a big 612 pieces. It includes two girl characters (Mia and Maya) and one boy character (Andrew). It comes with everything you could imagine for a boat trip. It has large yacht type boat that has a top that lifts off so you can play with your characters in the inside living areas (living room with an L-shaped couch, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom with two beds). The boat has several features like deck chairs, a water slide, a captains area on the top for driving the boat and a wave runner with a ski rope and skis for the characters to use. It also comes with lots of little accessories for drinks and snacks, music equipment, two dolphins and some fish to feed to them. It is a really nice and big set with a lot of playability and plenty of pieces to let your child's imagination run wild. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow and the recommended age is 7-12 because it is such a large set, but a 6 year old will only need minimal help with it.<br /><br />One point of caution, the MSRP on the LEGO web site for this set is $69.99. If a set isn't Retired, you shouldn't have to pay much more than the MSRP. That is the going rate from WalMart/Target/LEGO and usually when Amazon is the seller. Some secondary Amazon retailers sell the Friends sets for much more so be careful if the seller isn't Amazon, especially around the holidays when Amazon sometimes sells out. Make sure to shop around.  We picked it up when the price dropped to $50.99 on Amazon.  You can check the Amazon price history and set price drop alerts on camelcamelcamel dot com.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a huge and fun set that will be a great addition to your LEGO Friends collection. It looks really impressive when it is built and it is designed really well to allow for a lot of pretend play. While this is one of the more expensive LEGO Friends sets, the 11 cent per piece price is right in-line with the average for other multi-character sets. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Please Note: There is a another Amazon listing where I purchased this set at a better price available here: [[ASIN:B00CNBGUJE LEGO Friends Dolphin Cruiser]]EGO Friends collection.

B007PVHMCG|3.0|Was disappointed.. I thought this would have been a bigger set for the price.. Compared to other Lego pieces, in that price range, its a small set.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|One of my two favorite versions of this story and I'm sure it doesn't take much imagination to figure out what the other one is.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Bought this controller thinking it was the same one that came with the console. The color is more like a flat black. Functions perfectly. The texture is like a matte feel, isn't the smooth soft texture like the old school ones. Other than that, great controller.
0143039881|5.0|The wonderful new movie, Hannah Arendt (2012), directed by Margarethe von Trotta and starring Barbara Sukowa, shows that Arendt’s series of articles on Adolf Eichmann’s trial, covered by The New Yorker in 1961 and subsequently published under the title of Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil (Penguin Books, New York, 1963), was a double-edged sword in her career.  On the one hand, it gave Arendt a broader mainstream visibility, in part because of the international controversy it generated. On the other hand, this very controversy cost her several valuable friendships and even jeopardized her reputation in the academia. The controversy hinges upon the manner in which Arendt describes the nature of evil that characterizes the worst genocide in human history: the Holocaust.<br />Her explanation, captured by the phrase “the banality of evil,” posits that evil deeds are, for the most part, not perpetrated by monsters or sadists. Most often, they are perpetrated by seemingly ordinary people like Adolf Eichmann, who value conformity and narrow self-interest over the welfare of others. The concept of the banality of evil seems intuitive enough. Nontheless, it generated a huge controversy, primarily because ccritics interpreted it as exonerating Adolf Eichmann and indicting the victims of the Holocaust: particularly the Jewish leaders who were compelled by the Nazis to organize the Jewish people for mass deportations and eventual extermination.<br />Was Arendt putting the criminals and the victims in the same boat? Or, even worse, does her notion of the banality of evil end up blaming the victims? I don’t think so. In what follows, I’d like to explain why by outlining Arendt’s two explanations of the banality of evil: the first one being people who naturally lack empathy and conscience in any circumstances (like Eichmann) and who thrive in totalitarian regimes; the second understood as evil actions (or callous indifference) that even people who do have a conscience are capable of under extreme circumstances.<br /><br />Adolf Eichmann and the banality of psychopathy<br /><br />Adolf Eichmann (1906-1962) was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Nazi regime and one of the key figures in the Holocaust. With initiative and enthusiasm, he organized the mass deportations of the Jews first to ghettos and then to extermination camps throughout Nazi-occupied Europe. Once Germany lost the war, he fled to Argentina. Years later, he was captured by the Mossad and extradited to Israel. In a public trial, he was charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes. He was found guilty and executed by hanging.<br />In her accounts of the trial, Arendt is struck by the contrast between Eichmann’s monstrous deeds and his average appearance and banal, technocratic language. Unlike other Nazi leaders notorious for crimes against humanity, such as Amon Goeth or Josef Mengele, Eichmann didn’t seem to be a disordered sadist. More remarkably given his actions against the Jewish people, unlike Hitler, Eichmann wasn’t even particularly anti-Semitic.<br /><br />Although six psychiatrists testified during the trial to Eichmann’s apparent “normality,” in her articles Arendt emphasizes the fact that his normalcy is only a mask. In fact, she highlights the aspects of his behavior under questioning that were anything but normal: his self-contradictions, lies, evasiveness, denial of blame about the crimes he did commit and inappropriate boasting about his power and role in the Holocaust for crimes there’s no evidence he committed. Arendt is particularly struck by this man’s absolute lack of empathy and remorse for having sent hundreds of thousands of people to their deaths. To each count he was charged with, Eichmann pleaded “Not guilty in the sense of the indictment.” (p. 21) This leads Arendt to ask: “In what sense then did he think he was guilty?” (p. 21) His defense attorney claimed that “Eichmann feels guilty before God, not before the law,” but Arendt points out that Eichmann himself never acknowledges any such moral culpability.<br />If he denies any moral responsibility it’s because, as Arendt is astonished to observe, he doesn’t feel any. Although, astonishingly, none of the forensic psychologists see Eichmann as a psychopath, Arendt describes Eichmann in similar terms Hervey Cleckley uses to describe psychopathic behavior in his 1941 groundbreaking book, The Mask of Sanity. First and foremost, Eichmann is a man with abnormally shallow emotions. Because of this, he also lacks a conscience. Even though he understands the concept of law, he has no visceral sense of right and wrong and can’t identify with the pain of others. His extraordinary emotional shallowness impoverishes not only his sense of ethics, but also his vocabulary. Arendt gives as one of many examples Eichmann’s desire to “find peace with his former enemies” (p. 53). Arendt states that “Eichmann’s mind was filled to the brim with such sentences” (p.53). These stock phrases are a manifestation of Eichmann’s empty emotional landscape; his behavior towards the Jews even more so.<br />Yet, Arendt emphasizes, even ordinary people capable of empathy and remorse can still cause extraordinary harm in unusual circumstances. In such cases, they're motivated by a conformity which she describes as the banality of evil.<br /><br />Claudia Moscovici, Literature Salone God, not before the law,” but Arendt points out that Eichmann himself never acknowledges any such moral culpability.<br />If he denies any moral responsibility it’s because, as Arendt is astonished to observe, he doesn’t feel any.

B00594XOZU|4.0|i like the app its wonderfully and finally got it for kindle fire. and its not even slow its great. i think kik is a great text messager. its the best. I couldn't live without kik.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This album is very good. I am usually not one to enjoy pop music because it feels flat but this album is great music.  I would encourage you to purchase this album if you like good pump up music.  He is very talented and shows it in this album.
B00E1SJDJG|4.0|Unique phrasing, great music, wonderful lyrics.  I like this CD because each song has an unexpected twist be it in the lyrics, melody or tempo.  Very nicely put together.
B005LAII80|5.0|This version of Dredd is soooo much better than the Stallone version that even though I'm not into censorship I believe that all copies of the Stallone version should be found, burned, and replaced with this version. The actor stays true to character the whole movie, his sidekick is hot, tough, and has super powers. It felt like I was watching the comic itself, plus watching it results in tons of one liners to use around the home. Like when you're vacuuming you can be like, &#34;citizens of (your household's name) you may have thought dust had become the law, but it's not the law, I'm the law, and as for you dust, judgement time!&#34; Anyway, a solid buy for the price!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Loved it, even though i cried through the entire thing. It made me think about my young children. thinking about them in that situation made my heart ache for all those people.
B00005RG6B|5.0|Well I love Operation Mindcrime and Queensryche, well the original band anyway, so anything else I have to say is biased. Anyway, a must have for any Queensryche fan.The production quality is excellent too.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Sometimes I shy away from reading about the events of Nazi Germany... the whole concept is so scary,not with this book. All of the wreckage and ugliness hatred and insanity fellas eclipsed by the story telling and development of the book thief...brilliant
B00DWHWOFC|4.0|I do LIKE this game.... the only draw back,  and maybe it's my phone /and or my fat fingers... but the grids can be really small on the harder levels and I inadvertently add, delete or change a grid I didn't mean to.... That's frustrating......
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It was a good read however it didn't really lead me yearning for more, I'm afraid the next one will just be boring. I need a little more excitement.
160774418X|5.0|I've tried several of the recipes from this book, and I have to say that I just love them!<br />They are not so complicated, the ingredients are easy to find, the instructions are very clear and the results: wonderful!!!
0439023513|5.0|Great price for this book!  The price puts it a step above the rest....A book lovers place to find the biggies at a very reasonable plrice
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a fantastic sequel to The Hunger Games. It basically explains the aftermath of the first Hunger Games and--spoiler alert- goes into a second Hunger Games with the main characters, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, thrust back into action. It offers more depth and understanding to its readers as to the authors underlying message throughout the book about the oppression of the Capitol (the government that rules all the Districts, which are in essence the different states ruled under the Capital) and its affect on its people. The book ends with the threat of rebellion, and leaves the reader desperate more. This book was perfectly paced and electrifying in all the right places. While it may have spent a little too much time recapping events from the first book, it did a great job of reeling its readers in with action, romance, and thought-provoking questions all wrapped into one book. My favorite part of the book is that you, as a reader, are really able to fall in love with its main characters. You are able to learn who they are, why they do what they do, and route for them. I know that once I started reading, it was pretty hard to put the book down, which doesn't happen that often for me.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Rich in variety of sounds and very deep themes as always, they still got it, hope to see them one day soon!
1577314808|5.0|Tolle is amazing and his simple approach has really impacted my life.  To me his teachings boil down to three main premises or areas of focus, so its not overwhelming and I don't feel like I have to change SO many things, which can make growth feel daunting.  That is why I love his teachings, for this simplicity. Though its simple, its not always easy - they are not one in the same, but it is most certainly profound.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|I guess Eminem really is out of his drug slump, because this CD and 'Recovery' really impressed me. Although 'Recovery' is a little more \\"well rounded\\", if you are a true hip hop fan you will enjoy 'Bad Meets Evil\\". Its very lyrical, and both Em and 5'9' bring their A game. They work very well bouncing off one another. This CD is a must have.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|Love the length of the cord, but after a year or so the cord began to fray where it goes into the micro connector.  It probably did this because I use my tablet and phone while laying in bed and the charging ports are on the bottom of those devices, so the cord was bent a good deal.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|The writing, the story, the characters. I have been mesmerized for two weeks reading this fantastically written book. Tarrt's a brilliant observer, nay, shaper of humanity, in all of our raw and naked and poignant despair.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|I got this as the faotd, i do like how you can have many different books, so i xan organise easier, afeature i would like to see is being able to write with your finger and it sizing to fit on the lines, the is a featyre from another notebook app i have, which will make me use that one more than this, because its easier to just write rather than using the on board keypad
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Got this as a FAOTD.  Best one i got so far.  I love strategy games, problem is that since i am a relatively smart guy no one likes to play them with me because i usually win. Love to play against a good AI, and this doesn't disappoint.  Losing is fun, because i learn the strategy at the same time.  AI is tough, but not to tough.  Easy enough to learn, hard enough to be an enjoyable challenge.  Planning on buying the real version.  Now if i could only convince my wife to play with me in real life.
B00FR0GT9Y|2.0|I really wanted to like this CD. There is not a single &#34;hit song&#34; on the disc. Each song sounds like background music in an elevator.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is a lot like the Facebook version. Obviously you spend real money if you want to advance quicker. This is a given in all zynga games.  But I've spent a lot of time on the Facebook version. Finally have something to do on breaks at work :)
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Great Movie!! Really like the direction this has started out. Look forward to seeing more in this series.  Really like the Ultravilolet copy. It uploads to your Flixster account instantly.
B00EYRCD8M|5.0|Some people might not appreciate the whole album as it is certainly not all in the highly energetic style of Royals, but if you enjoy that song and are open to a bit broader spectrum of music, you will definitely appreciate the album as a whole.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|Do not buy this product for its joystick. It is terrible.<br /><br />The orientation of the joystick means that you can only move it with the side of your thumb. As it already requires you to stretch your hand, it becomes a real strain to use with any precision or without slipping. Though there are many games that might benefit from the directional control of a joystick, this joystick is so difficult to use that you're better off sticking with WASD. The pre-loaded hotkey profiles seem to agree with that assessment, as most of them disregard the joystick entirely, or simply assign it to duplicate the WASD keys that are already assigned on the keypad.<br /><br />The buttons to switch quickly between keybind pages, M1-M3, are located too far away to use on the fly, so one wonders why they exist in the first place. Though I have large hands, I still find it difficult reaching buttons on the right side of the keypad. The apps on the display are the only thing that sets it apart from a regular keyboard, and they don't really add enough to justify the rest of the device. I've come to the conclusion that anything I could do with the G13 could be achieved more easily with a regular keyboard.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Nice take on the Shakespeare classic; the cast was great, especially Amy Acker, love Amy Acker. Whedon got some range.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|New characters, a ton of fun. Killing me that Tyler is gone, Matt Donovan not getting as much time as he deserves.<br />Brilliant double double doubles, showing off Nina Dobrev's and Paul Wesley's subtle range. lol. With half the cast cut off to a new show,  I hope all the actors are getting paid double for their double roles, hahaha. Waiting for more from the newest evil professor Dr. Max.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Crushing candy is my business and business is good!!!<br />Great game for fun for those that have little amounts of time to spare!!
B003SQVI54|5.0|It's just funny what can I say. Great ensemble, very balanced. What Courtney Cox's character may lack in differentiation from Monica, the rest of the ensemble delivers with style. Ultimately Monica, I mean Jules, is everyone's foil. and pay attention to the title bars.... don't stay away from this show because they got the title messed up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My little girl loves this  game. It does  inspire her a lot. It keeps her busy specially on occassions that I am busy. It is a great diversion. Great game
1451666179|5.0|An irrepressibly funny book with great illustrations. My 17 year old nabbed it from me and has been reading it to me, while I look over her shoulder at the pictures with tears streaming down my eyes because the stories are so hysterical. I have not laughed this hard in 6 months to a year, so, anything that funny is welcome in my world. The pictures are genius as well, and could have been drawn by my daughter when she was a child.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|My little girl loves this. My husband sometimes even plays it too! It is a great diversion for moms specially on occassions that mom do not want to be disturbed and bothered.
B00GPE9HEA|5.0|One of of her best works yet... she actually SINGS in several of the songs. I like the fact that is more balanced with up tempo, and slow songs instead of too much of one thing. I feel like Britney is back, and so thankful for that. You will love it! This is not one of those albums that only die-hard Britney fans will like. She is reaching out to her more mature side, and with that will find and retain a more mature audience. Kudos to a job well done, and thank you for not rushing this just to put another album out.
B00BQ1D9IW|5.0|Incredible, I repeat, INCREDIBLE music... but highly disappointing packaging. This honestly is just an envelope with a disk inside.<br />I'm glad I bought it, because I can always rip and give it as a gift if nothing else, but I'm having a hell of a time (no pun intended) finding the deluxe and/or international and/or Scandinavian edition anywhere for sale. :(
0307719774|5.0|Very creative. I bought one for myself and one for my mother. It is neat to go back and see how much you have progressed over the years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really awesome game I bought it on my old tab and this is the first game I bought on this it's fantastic good job
B004RC8NUQ|1.0|Anothere awful movie didnt finish watching so disappointed. Got the movie on time as ordered great service not a great movie
1878424319|4.0|Easy read. Good condition.  Good guide to live a stress free life with good relationships.  You can simplify the rules to 1) use I  2) ignore statements starting with you.
B00846REIS|4.0|Engaging read. I really like both characters and find their story interesting. I like that neither is perfect or awful. Both are very possessive. The H definitely leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Can't wait to read the next book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The kids love this game for the kindle.  Ill most likely purchase another at some point.  Thank you very much.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I like the continuation of their story. Lots of sex. But if you read the first you would expect it.  I am interested to see if these two imperfect people can make this work. Planning to read book three.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|A wonderfully written account of what might have been during a time of world conflict.  Easy to follow and enjoy.
0201633612|5.0|First read this 5 years ago, and have since re-read it. I also have used this book as a reference many times.  Should be required reading for all engineers interested in software development.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game totally kicks butt it has great updates and I love how they change the them every season and have different hunts
B002LFPAUC|5.0|John Cleese at this best, surrounded by a great cast, every episode starts slow and John always ends up in trouble at the end
B006ZS4SXQ|5.0|My Grandson thought it was really cool and fun to put together.  Also, enjoyed creating the remote control box that came with the set.
B00G3Q6VPS|3.0|Pros : she returns to using her natural voice. A bit more mature, favorite tracks are.  Alien, perfume, work bitch, till its gone and don't cry.   Cons: over produced. Dated production.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|I've been waiting for this game to download for 4 days, but get it's, I played it on my friend's tablet, it's amazing, and get dinosaur dominion, it's amazing too
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|Left over tracks from born this way and the fame monster. Nothing new, nothing ground breaking. Not the \\"album of the millennium\\" as she herself called it. She abandons her role as a champion of the underdogs because its no longer profitable. She opposes born this way, a song about not caring what others think of you to Applause where she says she lives for approval of others. And moves on to pushing Andy Warhol and Da Vinci down our throats. Not worth the 3.99 ( the lowest amount you can sell it for to count towards Billboard.Another cheap trick to top the charts as she is known for doing) Desperate is not a good look for Gaga. She is capable of much better!
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I had to think about this a bit before writing it.  The setting of this book is WWII Germany just outside Munich.  An orphaned girl is brought into a foster home after the death of her brother.  What was great about this book?  The writing is excellent.  The narrator is death itself.  Quite a busy profession in those days.  It allows Zusak to do some clever things.  The book is absent of cliff hangers.  Death has no time for that nonsense!  Quite clever and refreshing.<br />Here's where I found the book challenging.  It's nearly impossible to write a book like this about Germany without coming off as a bit of a Nazi apologist.  The sort of  &#34;We were not at fault because we too were oppressed.  Dissent would mean death.  Yes we knew about the death camps...no, there was nothing to be done.  We even hid a Jew in our basement.&#34;  This is probably one of the most central learning moments of the book.  Blame the author for being authentic?  Yes.  I admit it.<br />Why 3 stars?  The story line reads a bit flat.
B00008CLIP|5.0|Great recordings in an unusual setting...the unplugged series is so good. Listening to the pure voice w/simple accompaniment is such a welcome change.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a bit frustrating to wait for more &#34;lives&#34; ... but gives me a break from it. It also eats the Kindle battery quickly. Good game to kill time.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I'm a new fan...after I heard this one...went and purchased the rest of their CDs! Be prepared to purchase the rest of their stuff!
B00867GHS8|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. Great story, good animation, and unlike most other media these days, the dad isn't a bumbling idiot. In fact he gets to be heroic for a change....<br /><br />With so many other assaults on dads, this was a refreshing change. I'm referring to all the comercials and tv shows where the dad apparently can't change a diaper, cook a dinner, change a light bulb, or even make the simple family decisions but is somehow able to provide money to the family but isn't good for anything else....
0399160477|5.0|Farewell to One of America's most prolific and patriotic writers. The last novel of Mr. Clancy will be bitter sweet to read...I can't wait to lay my hands on it.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|Received Card in record time. I have a problem with how it was received. My daughter was leaving for a wedding when found on my doorstep of my very open apartment building. I'm missing other items if they were to be delivered the same day. Tis the season for items to be stolen. Why didn't anyone get an signature?!?<br /><br />Items were found on my doorstep the next day. The box it came it was still closed, or appeared not to have been opened.
B000002GBD|3.0|As an 'old guy' I liked this CD for only ONE song, they killed my love for &#34;Love Hurts&#34; many years ago by over playing it on the airways...but &#34;Hair of the Dog&#34;...TIMELESS!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Skip the movie, as usual the book is the way to go. Bring your hankie, Kleenix or a whole box. The book touches you deep in your heart, and you live the horrible and beautiful world of Hitler and the Jews through the eyes of a young German girl. Very moving book.
B00E4W40C4|2.0|I watched the film at the theaters and loved it but unfortunately the Blu ray release is bugged. I get a message stating that I need to update my drivers in order to play the disc. I called Fox tech service and they tell me to clear the cache on Blu ray player but my player is in my PC (model  Samsung SH-B123L) so I don't know what to do. I can't recommend a buy since this is the very first Blu-ray I have ever purchased to have that problem. It's opened so I will look into my return options if I can't find a work around.<br />Update:<br />I went snooping online and I suspect that the disc is specifically designed to not run in PC installed Bluray drives but only in networked stand alone bluray players. I plan on returning this as soon as possible.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|for the friend of my child
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best drama show on television....cable or network. So much more than a bunch of zombies staggering around. Can't wait for season 4.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Because I loved the movie, and always wanted the sound track.  I love most of the songs on this CD.  I have a fondness for old time hillbilly gospel music.  One of my favorite movies, and one of my favorite CD's.  I would like to add that I thoroughly enjoy the Amazon Cloud.  It was free to download and a copy of the CD I purchased is in it.  It was easy for someone like myself who is cyberly challenged to use.
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|To hear, at least what sounds like Brad again, to catch a glimmer of the music that made (some of us in) a generation - it's like an 11 year breath, finally exhaled. A thing to bring tears to the eyes. This is not the Boston I fell in love with, fell in love too, even played at my first wedding. That time and place it seems is decades past (and, indeed it is). But, I still love Tom and Brad and Barry, Sheb, Fran, and all the rest who've been in and out over the years. These people I've never personally met are part of my extended world, and they always will be. Surrogate family close to my soul both as a person and as a musician. So, it may not be the Boston I fell in love with, but it's still the Boston I love. Thank you Tom, for finally letting the light shine once again, even if the glory is not as strong as it once was. It's still something golden and beautiful.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I love this series. It's my favorite! Although I wish Mrs. Day would hurry and finish it. I am going crazy waiting for the end!!!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Solid watch for the money. Keeps good time, and a solid build. The military styling and canvas band are just what I was looking for. Has worn very well over time. I would recommend it.
B000JQUZCI|2.0|Amazon says the length is 228 pp, the ebook version claims only 126. It seemed endless, so I'm guessing 228 pp is closer to the truth.<br /><br />Heavens, this was tedious. Victor Frankenstein is just about the most self absorbed a-hole ever to live. He is totally clueless regarding the people around him. Everything revolves around him. Despite being allegedly brilliant, he has the critical thinking skills of a newt.<br /><br />This book is, in a way, a good example of the evils of racism, but I doubt that Shelly or most of her readers understood it that way. Basically, Frankenstein's monster was deemed wicked and depraved merely because he was deformed and ugly, not because of any inherent character flaws. In fact, during the book, we learn that he was amazingly intelligent and sensitive. He went off the rails, so to speak, only after constantly enduring deprivation and scorn inflicted upon him merely because of how he looked. Yeah, if you throw enough brickbats at a person, eventually they might retaliate. Big surprise. So, in Shelly's distorted world view,  one's throwing the brickbats at creatures whose only sin is ugliness, isn't depraved, but if the receiver of the undeserved brickbats retaliates in any way, then that retaliation confirms depravity?  How does that work?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this book. It really and truly stinks. In addition  to a story that makes no rational sense, the book is backed with tedious page after tedious page of that horrid 19th century gratuitous glorification of nature and excessive maudlin brooding on one's emotional state. If you want to read a classic &#34;monster&#34; book, do yourself a favor and read Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was indeed a good book. I can't adequately express my contempt for this particular piece of trash.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I have been using this product for at least a year now and love it.  I have to admit that I've never needed to contact their customer service, and it can be distressing to have a problem with an app and not get any response from the developers.  But in response to an earlier reviewer, there is an option to backup all your notebooks, so that of there is a problem, you will have a file to restore your data from.  The backups can be done to local storage, a Google drive or a drop box.  When I got my new kindle I used the backup and restore feature to move all my notebooks to my new tablet.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little gem is a great solution if you view lots of YouTube on your iPad like my wife does. It's an amazing value for the price and sets up easily. I have bought 3 of them now. Only thing not shown clearly here is that it does require power. It comes with a power base, or you can power it via USB. Many newer televisions have a USB service port which can be used for this.

0783114222|5.0|These four discs tell you most of what you need to know about the people of the early space age: those who flew the machines, those who designed, built and prepared the machines, those who waited behind, and those who dreamed of the future that the machines inhabited. There are some historical inaccuracies, but they are offset by the rich visualization of what is often only the legends of the space age. The story is told from the American perspective mostly, but that story is one that we who lived through it are proud to own, and those who were not yet born will be happy to see in this re-telling.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|From start to finish-riveting. I couldn't put it down. I was prompted to read it after watching &#34;Catching Fire.&#34; I just couldn't wait for the next movie. Mockingjay was everything I expected it to be then some more. I promise that Hunger Games fans will not be disappointed.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This is the archetypal pirate story. We have &#34;shiver me timbers&#34;, &#34;Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum&#34;, pieces of eight, parrots, cutlasses, peg legs, etc. The whole shebang. It's also a very good story. Stevenson is a great author.<br /><br />It interests me that a number of reviewers have complained that this book is difficult to read. Perhaps that's so for folks who began school after the Republican party began their assault on public education in the 1980s (or was it in the 1970s they set out to destroy public education?). Kinda weird given how public education was a special priority during the Eisenhower administration. For the young 'uns among us, Eisenhower was a Republican. I dunno, I found the book fascinating and easy enough to read when I read it in elementary school (and my 4th grade teacher drummed it into my brain that I could read at only half the level required for success in college) and I still found it fascinating and easy to read now that I'm rather more &#34;mature&#34;. I feel a level of sadness for our future together. A society that doesn't value public education has doomed itself to a long, painful death. A society whose members can't appreciate Robert Louis Stevenson is rather shallow and pathetic.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|At 62, I am certainly not a fan of 'games', but this one provides a level of necessary skill and makes it very enjoyable to play.  Being a male, I especially like the 'destruction' in the game.  Label me old fashioned...at least I am tech savvy.  I got it for free on Amazon, but it is worth the price if unfer $3 and comes with hours of fun and frustration.  My only frustration to date is the extra free 'stash' level which I am having a problem in getting the last moustache.  Still, a great game and worth replay.
B008GAZHN6|5.0|By now you know what you are about to purchase. However I am not so sure I was. I have to confess I did not know of this book until I saw the trailer for the movie. Then it was a shocker to see the physical volume of the book. On opening the book I found it contained one hundered and fifty-eight pictures to accompany twenty-six thousand one hundred and fifty-nine words. Not until I started reading the book did I realize the graphics were not illustrating the words but actuary part of the story.<br /><br />In all my years I have not come upon a unique combination of the way the story is told. And to add to this it is an interweaving of a fictional protagonist to tell the story of a real life person. I have seen the formula of interweaving reality with a fictional character before; one of the most famous is \\"Sophie's World\\" by Jostein Gaarder. Both books have more depth that imagined at the start of reading.<br /><br />Any way the basic story is of a child that loses his father and thinks that his father left him a message that will change his life. In the process of perusing the message he meets Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who may just have a message to change the reader's life.<br /><br />A great site for more information is fi.edu/pieces/knox/automaton

B0000AFQS0|5.0|The best rock documentary from the greatest rock group of all time. Yes, even better than the Rolling Stones. Basically all 4 members of The Who are the best rock has produced for instrumentation, song writing and vocals. Plus my wife still thinks Roger looks real hot. How many groups can you name where both the drummer and bassist are irreplaceable? I have to admit though that Zach Starkey is about as close to Keith as you can get. You know immediately it's Keith and John playing once a song gets started.  Additional to some of the greatest rock songs of all time produced by Pete and company,  they have done so much more such as loads of charity work and respecting their fans by not ripping them off w/ outrageous 50th anniversary concert ticket prices. Pete and Roger care and that's one reason why they received The Kennedy Center Honors and I doubt the Stones ever will. But then since there is no financial benefit to the award , I sure Mick and Keith don't give a damn anyway. This DVD is worth having just for the ultimate version of 'Won't Get Fooled Again'. My favorite song of all time. I still get chills down my spine every time I hear Roger's scream. In addition, it is just classic after classic from start to finish. Also, it has the definitive version of 'A Quick One (While He's Away)' from the Stones 'Rock and Roll Circus'. The Stones performances were actually quite good, but The Who still stole the show. By the way, Listen To 'Endless Wire'. It really is quite good and it's strange that nothing from it is ever played on the radio. It's still classic rock, so play it!  Thank you, Pete and Roger for all you have done. I miss Keith and John so much.  Long Live Rock indeed!!!
B0010VDSRK|5.0|I really like this CD! The songs on it are really good. Some of the songs remind me of Nightwish when Tarja Turunen was their lead singer. Every song on this album is perfect. I would absolutely recommend it!
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|I think this might be the only Jane Austen book that I'd not read previously. I have, however, seen the video multiple times, as well as all other Jane Austen videos my spouse has managed to find. I believe &#60;cite&#62;Persuasion&#60;/cite&#62; is one of her favorite Jane Austen books/videos. As for books, I would rate it at the bottom of the Jane Austen collection, although to be fair, it's been so long since I read &#60;cite&#62;Sense and Sensibility&#60;/cite&#62; or &#60;cite&#62;Mansfield Park&#60;/cite&#62;, that I might not be remembering either particularly well. It's also possible my view of the book is colored by my repeated exposure to the video. The video, fwiw, is much superior to those we have of &#60;cite&#62;Mansfield Park&#60;/cite&#62; and &#60;cite&#62;Northanger Abbey&#60;/cite&#62;, but as I said, I'm not convinced the book is superior to either of them.<br /><br />The writing style struck me as being more stilted than the other Jane Austen books I can remember, and the subject matter doesn't much interest me. An interfering acquaintance has broken off the proposed marriage between Capt. Wentworth and Anne Elliot. Some eight years later they find themselves still carrying the torch for each other, but unsure as to how to ascertain if the other still feels similarly. In the end, of course, it's all unicorns, rainbows and bunnies, but getting there is a bit tedious, and we're constantly exposed to pages of emotion-laden idle speculation. My suggestion is to watch the video and then go read &#60;cite&#62;Pride and Prejudice&#60;/cite&#62; or &#60;cite&#62;Emma&#60;/cite&#62;, both of which I've read within the past year, so remember clearly that they were, indeed, good reads.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great read. You love the characters, like the town and hope for the best. You will enjoy the book.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Imagine, if you will, the following setting:<br /><br />A Colorado town named Roaring Fork. A great snow storm descends upon the town. It is Christmas Season. A missing story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  A Forensic Sciences student named Corrie Swanson, who is a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast, searching for graduate thesis material.  An upscale real estate development with an unscrupulous developer. Madness and mayhem everywhere. Evidence of cannibalism discovered on miner cadavers by Corrie. Enter Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast to lend his prodigious crime solving talents.  The writing style is excellent.<br /><br />The book is written in crisp, readable prose. The action never stops. I found it difficult to put the book down, and I read each page with a great deal of anticipation for the next turn of events. The characters are exceedingly well developed and they are believable. The plot is plausible and very exciting. There are twists and turns and many surprises within the plot. This book is a must read for any aficionado of crime novels. I enjoyed reading this book right to the end, and I eagerly anticipate the next Aloysius Pendergast novel. I think I received much entertainment and significant value for the money spent at Amazon.com. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Roberto
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A very well written novel. Two characters spend most of it trying not to fall in love but they make it a good trip and the ending is every bit as sweet as I had hoped.
0425238091|3.0|A flawed classic. HOG is the account of an intern's year and the trials he faces.HOG is really a caricature of medical training, seen through the eyes of a disaffected trainee (is there any other kind?). I read it as a first year med student and was enthralled. I read it again as a resident and enjoyed it, but saw flaws.  When I read it as a professor I was annoyed at the presumptions/exaggerations of the author/hero. The non-medical reader shouldn't read this as an accurate factual portrayal of the medical system. It is an accurate portrayal of how the system feels to those still in training...which is something very different.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Great book and really makes you think how you spend money. Defiantly opens your mind. I now want to reevaluate my income.
B0082SU98U|4.0|This was a surprisingly good book. Pollyanna is not an insipid character. Rather, she is a strong, young woman who makes a game of finding silver linings in gray clouds. But more importantly, by her irrepressibly, she brings a town full of repressed, early 20th-century Yankees, into people who begin to find themselves able to &#34;count their blessings&#34; (as my grandmother might say it).  Pollyanna has a glad game. When something happens, she ponders what is it about that happening for which one can be glad? Sort of along the line, &#34;I'm glad I had my accident, because it enabled two estranged lovers to reconnect&#34;. Well, it sounds a bit silly and saccharin, but Pollyanna has a way of making it more sensible.<br /><br />Referring to someone as a Pollyanna has become, in our cynical society, a rather pejorative term. We now think of Pollyannas as being mindlessly cheerful and insipid. But if people could reconnect with the original Pollyanna, perhaps they'd see that being upbeat doesn't necessarily require one to be insipid.<br /><br />The only real problem I had with this book, a cognative one on my part, is that Polyanna was continually referred to as being a &#34;little girl&#34;. Well, she was 11. Even as late as the 1950s, girls of 11 were only removed by a year or two from the age at which their parents could marry them off in some states (like New Hampshire, for example). It's weird how our perceptions change.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Super cute film. You will fall in love with the villain who isn't really a villain in the end. The girls in this are so adorable as are the minions. This is a great movie, you and your family will enjoy it forever!

It's really quite a good approximation for its size.<br /><br />It's fragile (the doors and roof fall off with almost any touch), and only one character will fit inside at any time, so I don't recommend getting it to play with.<br /><br />The instruction manual is the coolest Lego manual I've seen, with book-like binding and pictures and fun \\"facts\\" from the movie.

B0083Z614S|4.0|Well, I remember that Miss Hill read this to us in 3rd grade. At least I think it was Miss Hill. She was far and away the best teacher I ever had in elementary school, so anything good that happened in those days had to have been at the instigation of Miss Hill. One rather strange boy in our class, who was there for only a year or two before going off to a private school became besotted with &#60;cite&#62;The Secret Garden&#60;/cite&#62;. So, anyway, I did know something about the book. I may even have seen parts of a BBC dramatization of it. But, what brought me to read this book was my having decided I should figure out who &#60;cite&#62;Little Lord Fauntleroy&#60;/cite&#62; was. It turns out the author of &#60;cite&#62;LLF&#60;/cite&#62; wrote &#60;cite&#62;The Secret Garden&#60;/cite&#62;. Who knew? Since I thought &#60;/cite&#62;LLF&#60;/cite&#62; was a well-told story, I figured I had nothing to lose in stuffing &#60;cite&#62;TSG&#60;/cite&#62; onto my kindle. It's in public domain after all.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a great story. Perhaps a bit saccharine in parts, perhaps a bit implausible in parts, but a great story none-the-less. Basically, it involves two &uuml;ber-spoiled children (10 rather than Flavia DeLuce's and Penrod's 11 or Emma Graham's 12, but still at that age when you're still a child, but have become fundamentally competent) who find redemption in their relationship with each other and in their tending a secret garden, a garden that has been locked away and (mostly) neglected for 10 years. They are aided in this by an idiot-savant rustic (12, I believe), who knows everything to know about living and growing things and who charms animals (crows, squirrels, bunnies, and the like).<br /><br />The one part that will be difficult for American readers is that an important part of the story revolves around the antics of a local robin, a robin who lives in the secret garden. Well, British robins are nothing at all like American robins, so one's got to do some mind bending to get around the robin part. Just pretend it's a spunky sparrow with a spot of read on his throat.some mind bending to get around the robin part. Just pretend it's a spunky sparrow with a spot of read on his throat.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I bought this for my boyfriend who's a huge fan of the tenth doctor. He loves this sonic screwdriver. It has a light and makes noise like the sonic screwdriver on the show. It's made of plastic but it's a good replica.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautiful, moving book that requires a lot of appreciation.<br />The plot revolves around 16 year old Hazel and 17 year old Augustus, who both have a type of cancer. They have a unique way of expressing their thoughts and use language that not a typical teenager would use, but, in the end made the book moving and deep.<br />Obviously, Hazel and Gus fall in love but in the end, Augustus looses his life to cancer.<br />This isn't a \\"cancer book\\" it has much more meaning and goes deeper. If you like The Perks of Being a Wallflower then you will love The Fault in Our Stars.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Nice special effects, but then most movies now days have good FX.. The story I found to be so-so and I blame this on the actors and the director.. There was not much 'real' interaction between the two main characters and, I don't know what is wrong with Jeff Bridges, but I couldn't understand half of what he was saying! He spoke like he had a mouth full of chewing tobacco constantly and it wasn't pleasant to listen too.. Maybe he did, I don't know, but if you're an actor you WANT people to understand your lines, otherwise, what's the point of speaking? There was little rapport between the two leads and I think the whole movie would have been MUCH funnier if their two alternate characters, the Chinese guy and the gorgeous blond, had had more air time.. Now that was a funny duo.. Sorry I can't really recommend this movie unless, like me, you are bored to death and nothing else comes to mind..
B0011UBDTK|2.0|I LOVE the SATC series and was thrilled when my husband bought me this for my birthday.  The picture quality is poor though, and seems to freezes or jolt from frame to frame sometimes.  Happens in every episode, not just one.  Also, the case is in bad shape.  It's supposed to be new and the box is beat up and cracked.  Very disappointing.  Going to return, not sure if I'm going to return for refund to buy somewhere else or exchange.  If I exchange it I'll update my review on my experience and if the picture quality is better.
B004EPZ070|5.0|This movie is romantic, funny, and has some drama. This is a must see movie, if you love romantic movies. Excellent movie.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|We've just gone through an orgy of Jane Austen videos at our house, including two versions of Pride and Prejudice and two of Persuasion, and two of Emma. My spouse went back and re-read most of them, and decided I should also re-read at least one. I'd done Pride and Prejudice fairly recently, so Emma was elected. I had read Emma previously when I was in college, which was pretty much in the dark ages, back before colleges were turned into glorified trade schools, and when education was more important than amassing cash.<br /><br />I found Emma a bit long and tedious in parts, but the tedium was also appropriate to the story. Several of the characters are either rather taken to blathering endlessly, or taken to excesses of self flattery, or both. I wanted to choke them, but then one would. Whatever, Jane Austen, as always, uses her vehicle for many observations on manners and society. Emma provides much food for thought on the ways be behave towards each other, the social charades and self delusions in which we engage ourselves. Fortunately, Emma herself, has enough critical thinking skills, that she eventually can see through her own faults, aided greatly by her friend, Mr. Knightly,  and things end happily ever after, so to speak.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This is a surprisingly good movie, the 3D art is beautiful and the look and feel of the film is good. It's also pretty sad for a children's story. You really feel for the characters and bond with them. The art from the original books doesn't really look like the art in this film, but you can still tell that they're the same characters. It makes you want to believe in the guardians and feel like they're real and maybe they are.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I always liked books reveling in the heroism of the human spirit.  I also enjoy reading about science, space and technology.  So this novel was near perfection - it rings so authentic and keeps the reader so enthralled. I truly have problems finding anything to criticize.  It's all there - plot, characters, setting, suspense, technology, problem solving, puzzles.  Many have criticized the heavy tech talk but they fail to recognize that this is EXACTLY how a trained astronaut would think and act.<br /><br />Praise should be extended for the manner in which he made one character interesting for hundreds of pages.  And he did so without resorting to aliens, hidden Martians, supernatural devices or magic.  Incredible ending - just loved it.  I can't wait for Mr. Weir's next book although I find it difficult to imagine he can top this one.

B000002GXX|5.0|With this album, the Eagles somehow managed to stay within the country music genre while also exploring other musical ideas as well. It works so well that I, among others, consider this their absolute best - even over Hotel California. You see, at this point in time the Eagles were actually considered a country band. Their was no denying their success on the country charts with Lyin' Eyes. But what makes this album a great one is the varying styles of music. The song One Of These Nights is a soulful/rock tune that, in a way, still sounds a lot like country music. The same could be said for Take It To The Limit, a slow, thoughtful tune that also somehow retains a country music feel to it. There are also some awesome deep tracks here, including Visions (Don Felder) and Too Many Hands (Randy Meisner).<br /><br />Like it's three predecessors, this entire album has a country vibe to it; however, this time around you can get a sense that the band's style of music was in the midst of change. This change was complete with the release of Hotel California. Once Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner left the band, all traces of the Eagles' former country sound were pretty much wiped out.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender's Game: 1 was a sci-fi book with some unique twists and turns. The characters were well developed, and there was plenty of action. I feel the book only deserves four stars, however, because the end of the book was weak. After describing the action of a period of  several years in most of the book, the author tries to tell what happens to him later on in only a couple of chapters.  I felt like I was reading a 6th grade creative writing story!  I know there are other books in the series, but I have no desire to read them after those last couple of chapters.

B003VANOFY|3.0|Pros: Bought it after my brother bought a pair. He's had his for a year with no problems, so I bought my own last month. Comfy, clear sound, reasonable price, haven't had any problems with mine at all. Even using it in the room next to my brother's set hasn't provided any problems. In terms of sound, I don't play heavy fps games, but it's worked well for me with most games. You can use the software to fiddle with the settings if you're unhappy with anything<br /><br />Cons: If I had to when the battery's dying, it skips sounds, but I'd prefer it to have a more distinct beep. other than that.. I don't have any complaints<br /><br />EDIT: a few months after I bought it, it was working fine but it kept disconnecting and reconnecting for some reason. I thought it had to do with my brother using one in the next room, however, that was not so. The disconnecting wasn't too bad, it'd only disconnect for a few seconds but then a month later, it would randomly give a loud buzz through the headset that did not stop even after disconnecting.. apparently it may be a driver or hardware problem? but according to the forums, I don't think there's been a quick fix yet. I've only had this for a few months, so this is a little disappointing otherwise I would've left it as 4 stars. still works, but be aware of these problems

It meant to keep people in, but it will work just as we'll keeping zombies out. Shoot the writers of walking dead probably read this book.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love twilight. They get married!!! Great movie and the DVD had extras that are great. I love the movie
0786962984|4.0|Great update on a classic game I played as a kid.  I like the new game board design where dice roll consequences are list on the board.  No more having to reference the manual each time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|great novel by Stepen king.  I throughly enjoyed this one as it completes the Shining novel from years ago.  Danny would make his mother proud.
B00338QENI|5.0|I learned a lot about biological science from this book, but mainly I gained insights and questions into the use of human samples in today's world. My sympathy for Henrietta and her children grew.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|DONT LET IT AUTO UPDATE, IT BREAKS ROOT ABILITY! You are then stuck using only 5 or 6 apps and none of the local content on your device. I had hoped that I would at least be able to play my pictures and videos on my TV from my phone. So far I can only use google play movies, you tube, and hulu. You tube is the only free one in the bunch. There is a custom ROM out for it but if you let it update, you won't be able to take advantage of this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It came in on Saturday, have used it for 4 days now watching Supernatural via Netflix and I love it.  Haven't used the other options yet, but we are heavy Netflix users so for the price I wouldn't care if they didn't work as well!  Extremely easy set up!
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I never really liked classical music but after reading the series of books I was intrigued. I ordered this CD and I love it! I listen to it all the time. It has a good mix of light and dark songs.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|It was really cool for a time. Though I noticed it was not worth the price I got it for because the button used to push the sonic screwdriver up has fallen off and loosened numerous times. I cant even use it anymore. Definitely a bad price for such a low quality item.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. The puzzles are just challenging enough to keep me entertained. The graphics are of good quality.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love this show and it was great to catch up on anything I've missed during a recent trip.  Love them!!!
B002V092B0|5.0|So interesting, clearly articulated and fascinating.  I learned so much about a part of my brain that I rarely experience in my day to day life - and I am motivated now to develop it
B00GX59QO2|3.0|The plot never gets in the way of the action in this movie. It was entertaining but it seemed like there were a lot of unexplained gaps in the story. Much like a comic book.
B00899DR40|1.0|if i have to rate... I would rather not.<br />Really do not want to support the crashing of<br />the boy.<br />Believe talented but needs to grow up and realize he is<br />a role model now, in the eyes of the public (kids).<br />Best to him but grow up and look at what your actions are doing to<br />yourself.<br />Again, talented....
0740797719|3.0|It was okay.  Perhaps it just wasn't what I was expecting, but did find some of the ideas interesting. I'm still having trouble with the term realist and some of the animals in the book.  They are interesting characters though
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Simplify by making it a wee bit easier to get collections completed in special rooms before losing all credits.  Frustrating
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The book is great, so hard to put down and you don't need to wait till the end to find out the secret, just what happens to the secret!
B005TKD512|5.0|A must read for anyone wanting to make change simple.  Easy to read and easy to remember! Many great stories
B0071MV540|5.0|Good Comedy, good vs. evil. Good cast. Ben Stiller is always good and fun to watch.It was also good to see Matthew Broderick and Eddie Murphy again.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Been waiting for this to come out for my kindle fire. I love playing castleville. Now it is portable. It is seamless and has great touch sensor. Keep up the good job.
B001HN6EF4|4.0|Our family/friends all play a LOT of cards and thought these would be fun to take to the beach or pool.  They are great to use at the beach (if not windy) or pool area.  However they do not work well once they are wet - Duh!  Naturally they stick together once wet - but are easily cleaned and dried.  The clip is totally unnecessary and somewhat a pain...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Haven't had this much fun with a game since &quot;excite bike&quot; for Nintendo! I really like that the ads are so small that they're almost non existent.
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|predictable, sterotypical liberal dribble.<br />grisham sleep walks through this one.<br />waste of time and money as grisham coasts on past success
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|I liked this game but the price is way too high, similar games, just as good, are more to my liking. The free game is pretty short, graphics, hints, and story are very good and worked fine on my kindle fire HD, just think not worth the price.would have got more stars.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I thought the book was a fantastic follow on to Ender's Game. I believe it really pushed the character forward and showed where one goes after the mental anguish Ender was going through. It is not as action packed, but I loved the thought provoking situation. I would read it again.
B000683VI4|5.0|I have seen this movie several times over the years.  I have also written a review on this more than once.  I have no idea where they go when we submit them and they don't happen.  Anyway, I will enjoy having this in my personal film library.  The ending is sad and loving.
B00GNL251C|5.0|At first, I started this knowing it probably wouldn't live up to Ip man 1 and 2. By the end of this movie however, I quickly corrected that error. The beginning is all fighting, but after about 30 mins you actually start to get to know how Ip man really was. Not just the chinese propaganda that Ip man 1 and 2 seethed with. I definitely recommend this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This story will take u through a range of emotions... really deep ones. I enjoyed every page of it, couldn't put it down. Good Read!!!
B00GMONG90|5.0|I haven't had music make me feel this way in a long time. The type of music that you can actually feel throughout your body. I thought that they were just a cover group, BUT THEN I found out that some of my top tracks were ORIGINALS(Run to You and Natural Disaster). I don't really purchase music often, normally opting for YouTube and Pandora but I LOVED their music that I bought the album just to support them.<br />9.5/10
B00CS74W0C|5.0|This is a great book!!!  It has a very good story too it; the sex isn't the whole story of the book.
B00BEIYMTW|4.0|Nice, entertaining movie - a very good way to pass a cold winter afternoon or evening under a fluffy, warm duvet.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I have never seen this movie but have heard of it for years.  i love both of the main actors in it and am looking forward to watching it.

B002QH2NUA|5.0|Paul is such a great showman!  Seeing this encouraged me to spend the money to see Paul in person!  WOW!
B003274QH6|5.0|Missed the shows when they started and began to catch up with the season videos.  Up to season 6 now and we agree, it is one of the best shows ever produced for TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just can't stop playing with this game that can be really you as it is and so as it can be to other people
B0099SEKD2|5.0|such a cute little book. I expected a bigger book but its a tiny book. Daughter loves it anyways. cute story
0439023521|5.0|God I loved this book. It has action, sadness and everything I look for in a YA book. If you're hesitant about picking up this book, don't! It is an excellent read and had me captivated from the very first page!
B00021HBGS|5.0|My boys love these! This is a really cute set and it comes with a mesh bag for storage, with suction cups.
0804164223|5.0|This was one of those stories where at times it was so dark that I didn't want to continue listening but at the same time couldn't wait to hear what was going to happen next. It is suspenseful, dark, haunting, gory, disturbing, mysterious, intriguing, and at times vulgar. It keeps you listening because chapters are split up by characters. Therefore, you figure out different things by hearing about them from several people's point of view until you finally get to the end and get it all figured out.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Just not a well done movie.  I was expecting the visual to be fantastic, which it fell short of. The acting was really disappointing
B008SLAXGO|5.0|I preserved the book with the suspicion of it being old and trashed but It is in amazing shape! For only 8 dollars there was one small mark on the front and that's all! Even better I got it delivered in two days instead of 8-20 like estimated.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Sure is costly to play games like this, I couldn't imagine how much people who are ADDICTED spend!! Think of it, you could buy a brand new xbox or playstation!<br />KEEP SPENDING ~:0)&trade;
0439023513|5.0|This book will have you crying your eyes out! But it is an absolutely amazing book. A beautiful ending to an amazing series. I honestly hope Suzanne makes a book based on Haymitch and Finnick's Hunger Games. I believe those would be amazing stories to read about! Do yourself a favor and read this book! You will NOT regret it!
B009GX69RK|5.0|One of my favorite shows ever! Zooey Deschanel is such a loveable actress and her character Jess is adorable! Loved the 1st season better, but still, a great show!
B00005JO9J|5.0|Runs greats, no trouble at all with the cds or the case, everything was fine, it only have subtitles in english.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|It is a great book and an easy read. The topic is of interest to all ages because of the life lessons discussed. I am using the book as  Holiday gifts to friends and family!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game! If you like Subway Surfers or games like that, this is a must-have! Love minions, and love Despicable Me. Don't regret getting this at all.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love hidden objects games this helps me to get my addiction fulfilled. I like it so far because unlike the other game that froze on me this one has not. Keep up the good work.
0545586178|5.0|This book is my absolute favorite book out of the trilogy. Finnick is my absolute favorite character in the entire book! The book pulled me in and captivated my heart. I believe people will love this book and the movie does it justice!
014241493X|5.0|Very good book. You must read it at least once!! Check out his other books, he is a phenomenal author!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Really not enough apps for this and you cant stream your videos or pictures<br />Bad can not recommend for now till new apps
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|This is a fabulous production!  Even if you wouldn't normally watch Shakespeare, you will laugh and love this film.  I've never seen Shakespeare archaic prose rendered so naturally.  The difference is nothing short of AMAZING!  Even the productions I've seen at the Globe Theater are not done so realistically.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|how many words do you need to express my lifelong admiration of this film? it is innovative and dramatic and a great childhood memory.
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|Its amazing. the story and comedy blend as well as Terry's usual shenanigans makes this book amazing. I would highly recommend
B000068PQ7|4.0|Low-key and Unpretentious Clark Album<br /><br />Gene Clark's 1971 album &#34;White Light&#34; was never as high profiled as his 1974 masterpiece &#34;No Other&#34;, but still the album is considered one of his most important releases.<br /><br />In contrast to the aforementioned &#34;No Other&#34; &#34;White Light&#34; is a subdued and sparsely produced album with Clarks vocals and acoustic guitar in the center. Producer Jesse Ed Davis contributes the electric guitar and the rhythm section consists  of drummer Gary Mallaher and bassist Chris Etheridge. Overdubbed keyboards come from Ben Sidran and Mike Utley .<br /><br />This is no large or expensive production, and some numbers may well have a little demo character, and especially the bass may at times appear somewhat flat.<br /><br />Clark has written most of the songs and several are definitely among his best. Clark's songs often have a wistful character and two of the best on &#34;White Light&#34; come in that category, namely &#34;With Tomorrow&#34; and &#34;For a Spanish Guitar&#34; both melodic songs performed on acoustic guitar.<br /><br />More upbeat is the fine title track &#34;White Light&#34;, while the finest composition on the album,&#34;One in a Hundred&#34; is found in a less produced version than the ”Byrds” version on &#34;Roadmaster&#34; - both versions are for me among the very best Clark released .<br /><br />&#34;The Virgin&#34; is also a fine folk- country thing , while the more complex &#34;1975&#34; may indicate  what was to come on&#34;No Other&#34;.<br /><br />Among the excellent bonus tracks &#34;Ship of the Lord&#34; probably is the song that mostly deserved a more complete treatment than what apparently was the case. The song really should have been an obvious choice for the original album. Much better than Clark's cover versions of both &#34;Tears of Rage&#34; and &#34;Stand By Me&#34; which are both fairly unattractive.

0590129279|4.0|There is something about this book that was truly wonderful. It's a very short book, but I still couldn't put it down. At first, I wasn't sure what to expect; I had wanted to read this book for a while, yet didn't really know what it was about. My brother-in-law lent it to me a few days ago, so I figured this was the perfect time to start it. I think this is a perfect children's book because its filled with descriptions that really pull at your imagination. At the same time, its wonderful for adults because it makes you look at life in a different way. This is a book that everyone should read at least once. I'm sure I'll read it a few more times and take away many new things from the story.<br /><br />Pagesofcomfort.blogspot.com
B00FR0GT9Y|4.0|To start, I have been a Boston fan since I got the greatest hits album in 1999.  I am a big fan, and not to date myself, but I was born a year before Third Stage was released, so obviously I am a lot younger than most Boston fans.  And although I appreciate the old, classic, Boston sound, I understand that their sound is going to evolve over time and change, not to everyone's liking (especially the Baby Boomers and Gen Xers who remember the old Boston when Barry Goudreau was still in the band in the late 70s).<br /><br />The biggest disappointment I understand is that the sound is uneven (and the drum kit sounds like a phaser and not actual drums).  At first, that was a major disappointment for me as well, especially since it takes Tom Scholz 10+ years to complete an album and we have come to expect him to master the sound thoroughly!!!  I was very upset upon first listen of the album so you would have read a very different review if I acted on impulse.  However, after a few listens the sound starts to blend in and the album grows on you.  It is a mix of classic Boston (Don't Look Back Era and Third Stage) but with an updated sound (heavy guitars from Walk On).  I will not discuss track by track as other reviews have done that but just know the album does flow well and still rock!<br /><br />3 of the songs were previously on Corporate America which makes one concerned that they are running out of ideas... however despite that, their placement throughout the album does help with how the album flows as a whole.  \\"Didn't Mean to Fall in Love\\" sounds very similar to the one on Corporate America expect maybe a little heavier production and guitars.  The other two, \\"Someone (2.0)\\" and \\"You Gave up on Love (2.0)\\" have been changed and improved from Corporate America.  The former has a meatier guitar and the first verse is changed up and has an added spoken word section before the first chorus.  The latter song is completely rewritten with updated sounds but same lyrics.<br/><br />I hope you give this album a chance.  It's not like Corporate America which sounded great from the start.  It's 2013, not 1976 people...
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Liane Moriarty has done what all my favorite writers do - fleshed out characters so well that you feel as though you're living their life experiences.  The &#34;secret&#34; isn't at all what one expects, and the twists and turns keep a reader engaged.  To me, the ending was interesting (but sad), a peek under the veneer we all see.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|as product don't like it .<br />useless and there is something else better<br />cant stream my gallery on it<br />internet connection is always needed
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple, elegant,and with that &#34;just one more go&#34; factor. What I particularly like about it is that it relies on logic, and isn't time based, so you can plan a series of moves and then execute them. A little classic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is far more engaging and challenging. You get stuck at some points of the game because of the challenge. Combos are very rewarding too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm so glad I finally bought a copy of this book! It's been on my TBR list for such a long time, and I've read so many good reviews about it. I was a little worried that this book wouldn't be as good as I was hoping, just because of how hyped up it was. But thankfully, it was amazing. However, it was much different than I was expecting it to be, though I don't really know if I can describe how what I thought it was going to be like. I loved the characters of Hazel, Augustus and Issac; I thought their relationships were written so well and felt genuine. I also loved that although they were all dealt crappy cards in life, there was so much humor in their friendship. Hazel really starts to open up and live a more full life when she meets Augustus. Its great for readers to realize that just one person can make such a huge difference in someone's life, regardless of their situation. I think we could all use a friend like Augustus; he showed Hazel that there is more to life than just waiting to die from a terminal illness. He got her to do things and think about the world in a different light.<br /><br />I'm so happy that I read this book. I think John Green is a masterful storyteller, and this definitely won't be the only book of his that I read! I can't wait to go back to the bookstore and find his others (: I highly, highly recommend this to everyone. Its a quick read because it doesn't let you put it down, but its also a very emotional story, which left me with a few tears.<br /><br />Pagesofcomfort.blogspot.com

1250038820|5.0|I'd read about the HONY site, ironically, in a United Airlines magazine on a flight out of NYC a few months back.  Having only been to NYC twice in my life (2 years in a row), what surprised me the most about being there was how very much I enjoyed the people in the city - just seeing the mass and variety of humanity, then also talking to interested, friendly New Yorkers and visitors, too.  For several months I read all of HONY's posts on Facebook; it was great.  THEN I ordered the book, not necessarily expecting the &#34;experience&#34; of seeing in a book what I was seeing daily on my FB page to be much different.  But, oh, it WAS!  The book is just wonderful, expanding the Humans of New York experience greatly.  Highly recommend the purchase of this book if you enjoy the human family in all its diversity and depth of experience.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I would call this story a  mild tradgedy. It's character's losses will tug at the readers emotions. Well written... I enjoyed it more than A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|The game is ok to past the time. But takes to many crowns to get certain items.  Have to pays to get upgrade to hold supplies.

B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is really cool I love the way it was made and I am really happy to have downloaded it. It's just so fun because I get a bunch of my friends and we all compare ours and see who has a better team. If you like superheroes or fighting games I would recommend this.

081297381X|5.0|To call this book an investment classic is an understatement. The Black Swan has had a huge impact also beyond the enclosed world of finance. A Black Swan is today a part of everyday vocabulary. Former trader and now author/ philosopher Nassim Taleb wasn't first to introduce the bird and unfortunately though the wording has stuck, the underlying meaning has not - but still.<br /><br />\\"A Black Swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable than it was.\\" Hence, it's an outlier (but not as rare as most expect) where statistics has little to say about probabilities and still it's an event where people will paint a picture of retrospective predictability - the event becomes obvious with hindsight. The concept distinctly sums up my uneasiness of the trust that is put in historical belle curved statistics and my fascination with how humans need to make sense of their world and therefore after-rationalize to be able to feel in control of their life and destiny. There is nothing new here for those who have read their Benoit Mandelbrot and behavioural finance, but it is presented in a \\"massive impact\\" way. Much of the text and its concepts have been incorporated into my reasoning.<br /><br />With a nod to Mandelbrot the author exemplifies two types of uncertainties in the world with the imaginary places Mediocristan and Extremistan. The first is a linear place where the belle curve rules and \\"when the sample is large no single instance will significantly change the aggregate\\". The second is a non-linear place of power laws where \\"inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionally impact the aggregate [...]\\". People's height and weight is from Mediocristan while their wealth and financial markets are from Extremistan. The problem is that we treat most areas as if they were from theformer. To some extent the problem of not seeing the Black Swan coming is a \\"sucker's problem\\" since it occurs relative to someone's expectations. As not all Black Swans are instantaneous surprises, an open mind can turn some Black Swans into Gray Swans. A big chunk of the book deals with predictions. The more knowledge people have the more confidence they gain in projecting an \\"inside the box\\" Mediocristan future. In reality forecasting is useless as unknown unknowns will change the path of events and forecast errors degrade the prediction in an exponential way over cumulative time periods. Instead we should prepare to cope with consequences, minimize the negative effects and also to gain from positive Black Swan events. Apart from a discussion around a barbell strategy there is relative little tangible stuff on the topic of how to prepare. Still, some general advice is given; Try to avoid making large bets on predictions and prepare for other outcomes; try to position yourself in asymmetric situations where the favorable outcomes - should they occur - are larger than the possible negative ones; \\"favor experimentation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories\\"; and \\"train yourself to spot the difference between the sensational and the empiric.\\"<br /><br />The book is a mix of philosophy, statistics, finance, neurology, mathematics and quirky anecdotes - an improbable set up for a bestseller. The learned Teleb in many ways succeeds in his pursuit to be a renaissance man. The Bibliography reads like the library of Alexandria. The book is also filled with - mostly justified - sarcasm and arrogance. Even as I find myself agreeing with most of the spite, the author's distaste for those less intellectually elevated in the end becomes off-putting. There is a lack of humor and self-distance. I can't help but wonder if there is a measure of insecurity behind the ranting intellectual snobbism?<br /><br />The book is an appeal against the stupidity that follows from our psychological biases and our unwillingness to deal with their effects even though they are well known. It takes a subject that might be seen as technical and brings it into a philosophical and intellectual domain, which puts it in a different light - simply superb.<br /><br />This is a review by investingbythebooks.com
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham is dependable for giving the reader a solid plot, interesting characters, and a glimpse into the law.  I wish I had reread &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; before reading this quasi follow-up.  I was also disheartened at the lack of strong black male characters.  It seems all but one black male was redeemable.  I will still read his books.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|What a wonderful story by a master story teller.  If you are a Sanderson fan this is a great addition, if you are wondering if you might be then this is a fantastic beginning, and if you have never heard of him let this be your introduction.  In this short story Sanderson captures a new culture with the palpable weight of depth and history.  The characters feel real and you find yourself sympathizing with people on both sides of coin.  Well worth the few dollars it costs.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Another great G5 game with some good minigames and thought provoking puzzles.  Having said that I only used the free download part as I refuse to pay the prices for the full unlock that are being charged as there are better games for those prices. Bring the cost down and more people will buy. Simple economics.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I enjoyed the characters, as always , and the story, but thought it dragged.  I always expect a lot more action throughout these novels.  All that, being said it took me longer to read, as I could easily put this down and not pick it up again for a week.....

B00E3VTR1K|4.0|Luca Rossi has written a collection of futuristic tales that are unique, beautiful and so well written that you feel as though you are watching a visually stunning movie. Almost all of them are by the seat of your pants thrill ride and offer an unique spin on science fiction stories. From a future where a software company controls humans lives to a man who falls in love with a woman in her true form.<br />As well written and unique as these stories were, I could not enjoy them. I don't read science fiction because the genre often does not appeal to me as it is filled with references, terms and plots that go right over my head, making it hard for me to get lost and enjoy the world the author has created. I chose to read Galactic Energies because the synopsis intrigued me and I wanted to, for once, step out of my comfort zone and try something new. Though I was left confused as to what was going on, I still was able to appreciate the beauty of the stories Luca Rossi has created.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Hands down one of the best and most emotional books I've read in years.

B0087IT8FK|5.0|We Love this movie. I have shared with family and friends and we all were touched. It is great that it is a true story.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I unfortunately read this after reading Lone Survivor.  If I had read them in reverse order I would have rated this higher, but Lone Survivor is in another class compared to the late Chris Kyle's accounts.  The book starts slow and ends slow, but his in battle stories are very interesting.  The main difference is in the delivery, Kyle's book comes across as unpolished and raw while Luttrell's story has the assistance of a seasoned writer.  The final result is like comparing apples to oranges.  I do recommend reading the book, but don't go in expecting the same quality of Lone Survivor.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|The Best cartoon movie out and even better than the first !  Great gift item for children and  adults !  Fun !
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|Dope as hell! Great streaming of about 50 channels. I havent bought electronica music since. It will open your mind and ears to new sounds everytime!
0425252868|5.0|A great human interest story. Not all Germans were Nazis. A totally new perspective on the German fighter pilots of WW II. Gave a copy to a friend who flew P-51 Mustangs in WW II. He read it twice and got his children and grandchildren to read it.
B003F48E4W|5.0|Party all night; sleep all day...what's not to love? Funny, not-too-scary, good music. Yeah, we could talk about the ingenious use of peer pressure to seduce big brother into joining the blood-sucker's club, or the surprisingly-good acting performances - including the dog's - but the first dozen or so times I watched this movie, I was having way too much fun to analyze it. That says it all, right?
B0064Z7RXS|4.0|New fan. I play 75 % of this album on a regular basis. The first song on the album gets you.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman does it again.  He did it so well that I felt it was too short!  It's always a pleasure to get this engrossed in a book.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|A silly book. The endless wisecracking of the lead character is so annoying. Plot isn't all that great either. Ending was never in doubt.
B00BATG18K|3.0|I love Amy Tan and she eventually follows up on a great plot, but there is too much &#34;tell&#34; and not enough &#34;show&#34; along the way.  Long monologues and rather dry recitations of events and feelings take up much of the text.  But of course, there is much to be gained from reading this novel.  As usual Amy Tan delves into sociological/historical/cultural contexts and the reader explores the nuances of  courtesan houses and rural villages. As in the Joy Luck Club, daughters cannot escape their mothers.  The story ends just as World War II is getting underway, and I am hungering to know if the characters who, by this point, are living in Shanghai and San Francisco will ever see one another again.  I am pleased that I read The Valley of Amazement, but it just isn't The Bonesetter's Daughter or The Hundred Secret Senses.
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|The movie is on a true story basis. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the general manager of the Oakland Athletics seems frustrated with his team losing to the New York Yankees. This forces him to reinvent his team by trying to devise a new plan to formulate a competitive team. This strategy causes many challenges to the team. Beane has to work hard to beat the much richer clubs that keep purchasing the best players from the team. The movie is less about baseball and more about persistence. Essentially, one does not need any baseball background information to enjoy the movie. In fact, we do not get to meet the players in person, as they are not of importance. The individual victories of the team members are not vital. Beane meets a young economist Brand with great radical ideas and thinks he has the capability of helping with the implementation of his plan and makes him his assistant. With the combined efforts of Brand and Beane, the movie places emphasis on fighting for the things that an individual believes in.The movie is more than about baseball. It targets individuals that have their dreams locked in dark corners and are afraid to pursue the things that they believe in. The film aims at altering history (Lewis 1). According to the film, Carlos Pena remained Oakland’s starting first baseman from opening day until Detroit signed him in July. In the real sense, although he started at first base between April and May, Scott Hatterberg replaced him in 1 June, and was playing for Oakland’s AAA when the trading to Detroit took place. The movie is inspirational and inspires the target group to pursue their dream.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book I love every part it's so interesting way to go Suzanne you really outdid yourself with this one
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|As a WWII Navy veteran stationed in the Pacific, this was not as good as the Band of Brothers stationed in the European Theater. The Pacific video focused too much on the back story of people and sex. This was disappointing as a veteran of this theater.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|There have been few decent concert films over the years. This one is without a doubt the best. The way the show builds from David Byrne with his guitar and a boombox, all the way to a stage filled with musicians all in perfect sync, is a beautiful thing to watch.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|As a fan of PD James, and a true Jane-ite, I was really looking forward to reading this book.  I was disappointed.
B00B7ERH04|3.0|I made 3 apps then I deleted them cause I didn't really like it then I tried to another video then it said I had to buy fantastic camera pro to make more video's. :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is so addicting, trying to get to each level.  I have never cared for these types of games but this one is so much fun.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best hunting game I have ever tried and I will always play it... until the next upgrade of course.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I downloaded the game all because of everyone so into it.  I really don't see what all the fuss was about.  It's like all the rest of the games to me.  I don't like the fact that you only get 5 tries to play and then you have to wait 30 mins until you get the next one try.  Starting to give me a headache!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|From the very beginning this book captures the imagination, bringing you back in time to a different era..<br />one  you cannot imagine being a part of, just a spectator. Thoroughly enjoyable!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Game was fun but for being free, once you run out of lives you are forced to buy more.  Also all the levels are timed and if you don't complete all the levels in the allotted time given the game ends and a life is taken.  It was fun but the game isn't entirely free.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am so addicted to it but I don't care I play it all the time!!! Buy it, it is way worth the money!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|The movie started slow and we thought that it was not going to be good becausee the third sequel is never as good as the first movie, but we were blown away by how awesome the movie was.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great faotd! This is a very straight forward game. It has good enough graphics, and it kills a lot of time.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|It feels cheap, and gets them a little louder. I find it really only suitable for Line out adapters. Otherwise your just amplifying garbage if you think you can just slap your phone 3.5 jack to this your wrong.<br /><br />It worked great with apple line out, but now I got android and there is no line out. Until than this will collect dust..
B007J4T2G8|2.0|All the fifty shades were popular for one reason only...mommy porn, for bored housewives who need entertainment<br />outside carpool.  Boring and  so repetitive, no character development...  oh my! laters
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I hate this game, I can't get past level 23, and I'm not going to spend any money on it either. I hate this stupid game.
B003V4ASV8|4.0|Opened up a whole world hitherto unknown to me. Great journalism...exposing the extraordinary resilience of an oppressed, poverty stricken people. Uplifting true stories of the triumph of the human spirit in even the most extreme circumstances.<br />Read it and be inspired!
0316204366|2.0|The same idea os repeted over and over again. The 15 min TED speach given by the author is better than the book
B008J34466|5.0|LOVE IT!  This entire DVD was great -  loved all the songs!  Not recommended if you have kids, since the lyrics are explicit.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love it. A lot of fun to play.  Just wish it was easier to earn coins.  Will hope for changes.
B00BG5CXGM|4.0|Just got the case and it fits the phone really well without adding bulk to the phone. I had an Elementcase on my phone before and I find with this case I have better signal and no affect on wifi. The sleep/power button is something to get used to however. It barely feels like I'm pressing it. Blue is my favorite color so I got the bright blue color and it's great! I don't really like how the back shows fingerprints and smudges. I thought the back would feel more solid and not so much like plastic but it's still nice. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.
1416955070|1.0|SPOILER ALERT: Take the plot of the original Star Wars trilogy (including every plot twist), switch the genders, set it in a fantasy New York, then remove all the interesting secondary characters and replace them with cardboard cutouts of people from CW shows.  Boom, you've got yourself a hit tween novel and a sweet movie deal.  I really wish I hadn't wasted my time on this book.
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|The music, as expected, is fantastic.  However, the DVD is only a slideshow.  I am disappointed that they made such a big deal about a DVD when it is not much better than another CD.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Works great for my 2013 City Mini, and much cheaper than the Baby Jogger brand alternatives!  It's fabric with a frame but keeps its shape fairly well.  The cup holders are elastic to keep water bottles and cups in place well.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Great! My daughter loves this. The pacifier is great and she also loves to hang onto the monkey. So cute!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app has very soothing sounds which makes it a whole lot easier to sleep. I would highly recommend this wonderful app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing match 3 games for years. This is the best. But they should give something free once in a while.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Even if you're not a techie, the story of Apple and of Jobs is fascinating. Jobs led an incredible life, achieved great things, was not always the nicest guy, but he knew how to get things done. His time here on earth was cut tragically short by cancer. But oh what a journey he had!
6305508550|5.0|This is a gem of a movie!  The characters, the plot, the humor - top notch!  I rewatch it often.
0062060562|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It keeps you guessing and I did not see the end coming at all.  It is such a good plot.  My book club loved it.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Great show and they've kept it up.  Season six is as entertaining as the ones before.  If you are in academia in any way, you know all these characters well.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Its really Nice, easy to use.I had download it and had been using it since then, No glitches what-so-ever.Purchase it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The game is awesome just like the actual game. But you have to tap the screen. It is truly amazing purse of work.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works great. I love the idea that it keeps my phone cleaner and running much quicker.  I would highly recommend this!!!
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Strange and unique gameplay.  Seemed complicated until i played a few games . Still not sure i get all the nuances yet, but fun nevertheless .
0312370849|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It keeps you guessing and teaches you a little history while you become enchanted by the story.  My book club loved it.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Great movie- cute chick flick but not slow at all, there is always something going on.  Keeps you guessing as the background is only revealed in pieces.
034580404X|5.0|Its popular and best known as an erotic story with hot and funky sex scenes and that its going to be a movie (or a movie series, just like the Twilight Saga), so I finally brought the book version from Amazon and read it 3 weeks after receiving the parcel.  Then I found the sex scenes in Book 1 Fifty Shades of Grey appealing and definitely erotic, and this is the reason I immediately started to read Book 2 Fifty Shades Darker.  Amazing things happened, the writer has developed the story with wonderful writing skills, and suddenly I found I could skip the sex scenes in the middle of the book, and then turn the pages to see what would happen to this pair of lovers who are working their path to find their hearts, with or without flowers.  It was around 2 am when I read the chapter of Leila breaking into Anastasia's (or Kate's) apartment, then confession and confrontation were made in Escala, with Christian taking the Sub posture in front of Ana!  Amazing story, because at the end of the Book 3 Fifty Shades Freed, you would find this was actually a &#34;pure&#34; love story, between a brave, courageous, beautiful girl and a poor boy in all senses-turned-to-be-a-successful businessman that definitely made the readers moved!  Of course, though, one would re-read for the touching story, as well as for the erotic sex scenes!<br /><br />In the last tens pages of Book 3, there was a short chapter of the beginning of the story from the perspective of Christian, written by EL James.  I thought many fans would like Ms James to finish the work as a new book, as an echo to the movie perhaps.
1594132054|5.0|Very good book to read I will get the next books he wrote. Learned a lot from this book thanks
B00H1O3Q18|1.0|The show was awesome, but it constantly froze up on me.  Usually Amazon videos area great, but this one was terrible!
B00C8Y3MLK|5.0|This story has personality in spades! I love that the author has considered a day in the life of a crayon and to each and every colour attributed a personality! So creative and wholly original ! Bravo!  Voted a favourite on Goodreads,  I can see why.
1250012570|5.0|It's rare to read a love story that doesn't intentionally try to jerk the tears from the ducts of your eyelids with a giant, extra crispy serving of sentimentality. But Rowell's Eleanor & Park will get the tears out of you (unless you're an android or something) and without any sentimentality. I wish more love stories/YA novels were like this.<br /><br />Rowell's story works because the characters are real. I am sure everybody can find at least one character here that they can relate to. And, if you're shy like me, you relate to both of the main characters (I kept saying, \\"Hey, that's me!\\" multiple times throughout.)<br /><br />And you will be moved. If you aren't moved, then you don't move.
B0020M99LC|5.0|This is one of those films I can watch over and over again.  And I do.  Shawn Connery is a hard act to follow.  Whoever picked Daniel Craig, got it right!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been waiting to be able to play this game.  I'm glad Amazon has it now!  I felt like the only person not playing...
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Perfect personal album that includes songs for every range of moods! This is Spears personal best and her vocals are simply amazing!
B001NEK2GE|1.0|This is a very unique product that I hoped would relieve me of my keyboard for FPS Games.  I have large hands and found that not only were the keys crammed together, they are small.  I could not reach the keys under the &#34;ASDW&#34; and found the device very uncomfortable.  I don't think I could get use to this, but the idea of this sort of device is appealing.  This one is not to my liking, AT ALL.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is a fantastic series... Second book every bit as good as the first. A main character you really care about and like, excellent and almost poetic writing throughout.  Good plot developmnts... Patrick Rothfuss had better keep working on this series, and have another like it in the works!
B005MJ8CL8|5.0|I loved it, bought it for my birthday and i couldnt be happier, great piece to have for any die-hard wu-tang fan. It's a shame the wallet is so large, i would love to carry it on daily basis!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Enjoyed yet another book by Blake Crouch. He is one good story teller ! Have enjoyed the Pines series, looking forward to more.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun and goals are reachable. Everybody should try this game out we love it. So definitely check it out.
1451696191|5.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower (Perks) is hands down one of my favorite books of all time. I bought Perks early in the morning at a bookstore after it was recommended to me the night before. The first thing I did when I returned home was begin reading it, and I didn’t set it down until I had finished. As a teenager who has read hundreds of books, many being coming-of-age novels, this is the one of the only stories I truly connected to and learned from. Perks by Stephen Chbosky is brilliantly written, with deep emotional content and powerful messages and lessons that I believe all teenagers should be exposed to.<br /><br />This novel is an accumulation of letters written by fifteen year old Charlie to an unknown stranger. The story is written in the voice of a freshmen boy who is just trying to get his life straight; it’s easy enough to read yet enticing with ideas. By writing in this format, readers get a view of Charlie’s uncensored thoughts and emotions as he goes through his first year of high school. One also feels a strong connection to the story because it is as though the letters are written to you, and that help builds sympathy for Charlie and causes readers to cheer him on.<br /><br />The story discusses many coming-of-age dilemmas such as exploring sexuallity, experimenting with drugs, family tensions, crushes and relationships, making friends and many more issues. In the story Charlie is so observant and honest - a wallflower, he loses so much information that most boys his age catch on to immediately, like dating. Charlie develops a crush on one of his friends, and shamefully confesses his dreams of her because of his guilt for having them. To his surprise “she laughed. Not a mean laugh, either. A really nice, warm laugh. She said that she thought [Charlie] was being cute” (22). This was one of Charlie’s first experiences with a girl, and his innocence shines through his writing, it’s simply extraordinary and eye-opening. For any teen growing into adulthood, this is the perfect book to read because of the issues it brings forward for the reader to reflect on.<br /><br />If anyone is considering to read this book, I highly recommend doing so - it is a story that can’t be missed out on. It makes a great gift, and is now a popular movie as well. Perks of Being a Wallflower is easy to fall in love with and worth the read.into adulthood, this is the perfect book to read because of the issues it brings forward for the reader to reflect on.<br /><br />If anyone is considering to read this book, I highly recommend doing so - it is a story that can’t be missed out on.

B005LAIIMG|5.0|5 STARS! World War Z is so good. I've watched it three times. You know the premise probably. The world is over. The dead walk the earth, but in this case they run super fast and infect you. Most zombie movies are about survival and sadly most of the cast don't make it. You endure a whole lot of body munching, screaming, and gore. In World War Z, you move past that because there is no survival for anyone if they don't figure out how to neutralize the zombie infestation. So it's a mystery wrapped in an apocalyptic thriller. If you've always wanted to watch a zombie flick but were scared of entrails all over the place, this is the movie for you. Plus Brad Pitt is so very awesome in it. He rocks, and tries to save the world. I love him.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Since I am a reader and not a writer, all I can say is..awesome! Starting book three immediately! Excellent continuation.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|This is a great movie with some stellar performances.  Ron Pearlman does an amazing job with his part, a delight to watch him  work.  Charlie Hunnan creates a very believable character; he is the perfect hero for the movie.  The fact that it is a 'Godzilla' type movie should not mislead you.  The quality of the special effects, the plot development, the tension with the conflict has you on the edge of you seat the whole movie.  It is very easy to become involved with the action and the interaction between the characters.  I am eagerly awaiting the next movie, I hope many of the same actors are employed to present this one as well.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think that this was a great experience for the young kids and adults who are not allowed to have a visa card
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.The game is you take care of a horse and play games with it. I think it is really fun! Some of the goals are hard but yeah. Also you can get different horse and even unicorns!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|This game has so much errors it's annoying... It freezes during the games and kicks you out then you lose your coins! They need to get it fixed!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The music they arrange is absolutely beautiful!  Bonus, I didn't even realize when I bought it that it came with a DVD!
B0007939NO|5.0|One of hubby's favoirte movies.  He loves all the older muscials and I had never seen this one until he borrowed it from Netflix.  I know he loves it so when I found it here, I eagerly snatched it up for our large DVD collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I &lt;3 this game I can't put it down but I never liked the ads their so anoynnoing to me but I love it. It's the game for you I personally recommend it I hope you enjoy it as much as me
0545626382|4.0|I really enjoyed reading these books.  I just couldn't get enough of the hunger games and to find a trilogy set like this is awesome!  This was a great purchase.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked the book, it was different than most books I read. Would recommend it to a couple of friends.
B00FATEJYE|1.0|I tried to download not but I had no space so I deleted all my games and still can't play it.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I admit, I'm a huge James Bond fan, so when my friend directed me towards this book, I was so excited to start reading! This is an edge of your seat espionage thriller that keeps you turning pages deep into the night. The voice of the narrative is just right, capturing the flare of a classic spy novel with excellent pacing, wonderful historical diction and details woven just perfectly into the narrative. I immediately found myself drawn into the story, which ultimately is a reversal of what one would expect: instead of trying to kill Hitler, the goal here is to save him, because if he is deposed, a more reasonable seeming leader could lead to the war continuing indefinitely and the Allies losing. This book is seriously like a Bond movie on the page: it's got the gadgets, girls and double crosses that keep you on the edge of your seat. (and like Bond, Fleming is a bit/LOT of a playboy...lol)  I'm not going to give away the ending, but it's safe to say it satisfies and I'm definitely picking up the first book of this series &#34;Operation Amanda&#34; just as soon as I've hit post on this review. If you love James Bond, you'll love the Ian Fleming Files! Highly recommended!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is a free, simple reader for PDF files.  I make all my recipes cards on PDF files and then read them on my Android tablet while cooking so I can just wipe off the tablet if I happen to get anything on it by accident. Right now my new tablet my husband gave me as an early Christmas gift sits nicely in a table top plate stand for easy reading while I work.  It is a perfect system for me, particuarily with all the Holiday baking I have ahead of me.
B00GI8AMI8|4.0|The graphics were pretty simple but the game was entertaining such as it was. It was really short but totally point n click, no HO scenes.  The hint feature was a little confusing but helpful if you get really stuck.  I would have given it a five if it had more to it.  We'll worth the .99 for the game.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|very funny an cute movie kids loved it even the wife, didnt think it was as good as the 1st but still funny.
1449410243|5.0|I love The Oatmeal. His comics are all hilarious, had to buy the book to read the ones not on his site (worth it!!).

B0014D6PCO|4.0|great film, love watching from time to time. if ya do not have it on Blue ray, get it. its cool
B0067RQYNW|5.0|It has greater options than other android office suites and it is free!  I was able to open a docx file and change it to a doc file for my older computer.  The fact that it so easily manipulates files, making new ones or working woth old ones is a real bonus to me who uses MS Office all the time.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This game is so good! When I played this game, I couldn't stop playing it. I like the part when he tried to get his memories back.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Every time I let a younger child sit with my Kindle this app is what they find! Nice artwork. Cute game.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Extremists addicting! I just got this game and cannot put it down. So far no kinks. Let me put it this way... I do not ever rate apps that I download (in fact this may be my first time) and now I am taking my time to give it credit. Have fun!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My 6 and 8 year old boys love all of the Temple Run games.  This one has the Oz theme, which just gives them new &#34;territory&#34;!

B00F30S0Y0|5.0|I never like arcade fire AT ALL then I saw there 2013 SNL performance and I liked one of the songs. I see this album on sale at best buy so I figured why not.

B006JY28HE|5.0|If you love lana del rey (like me) then you love and appreciate this picture disc. The art work is beautiful and I love the remix of born to doe on this. It will be a fine edition to your lana collection get a copy while you can they're appearntly limited edition uk pressings.
B00CPLGFII|5.0|Solid, low power processor. Handles all HTPC duties with ease. 1080p video is beautiful, and the included driver/software for video is first rate.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|works good for lap top and or tablet where there is normally only one 3.0 usb port to connect to works well and has it's own software driver built in. Gives you 3 extra ports for high speed use without slowing the system down noticeably!!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 6 and 8 year old sons love all of the &#34;run&#34; games.  These have great graphics, and keeps them entertained.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|Not the traditional romantic comedy, a little racy in spots, but at it's core a very sweet movie. Chris Evans is wonderful in his role, showing that under the surface his character has a big heart, and Anna Faris creates laughs and groans with her antics. One you'll want to watch again and again.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|Love the movie! Recommend it to any one that wants to see a kid friendly movie that's fun and has a point.Recommend seeing the movie in 3D!!!!!!
031623480X|5.0|This was really informative.  I ended up buying copies of this for many friends and relatives.  This is information that all of us should think about.  I think each of us is our own unique chemistry and we need to form a diet that works best for us.  This information is something that we should all be aware of to create a healthier life.

0767836324|5.0|Love this movie very funny but also has a sweet touch too. It is a great squeal to peter pan. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone it is a great movie for the whole family.
006228648X|5.0|The audio version is spectacularly good.  I listened to all but the last few chapters, then read those last chapters on an iPad, then listened to them on CD.  The narration adds a lot.  The story is riveting. It's full of surprises.  But the narration really adds another dimension.  I enjoyed the first two books, and I wondered if the third could measure up.  No need to worry. Just like we are still reading Charles Dickens, in 200 years they will still be reading Allegiant.  It's not flawless, but it's awesome.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I like all things Batman ... Great movie!  I would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase this movie.  Blu-ray made it even better!

B00FR0GT9Y|4.0|A bit different from previous Boston music, however, I like this album.  I got this one at Best Buy with the bonus track on it.  I got it for $4.99 + tax (on sale and had a coupon), so great deal for $5.  The song \\"If You Were In Love\\" is surprisingly sung by a female, however, enjoy the vocals.  Apparently, there are a few songs included from a previous album, Corporate America, but since I never got that album, I am glad I have some of those songs on this one.  It is nice to see a change of pace from a great band that has been around for decades, however, I still hear the Boston \\"flavor\\" in these songs selected for this project.  Enjoy the variety of all the songs and overall, I am happy with it.  Not all the reviews have been good, but give this one a chance.  I am glad I did. :)

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was using a Trendnet TEW673 GRU router and apparently this gadget is incompatible with the router. On set-up it got me up to the point of &#34;ready to cast&#34; but it cannot be found on the network so it will not proceed to download the extension. Called technical support and they were not able to resolve the issue. Looked on the troubleshooting guide and there is a list of compatible and incompatible routers there. Only one model of Trendnet router was listed there which was compatible but unfortunately my router was not it. To solve the problem I bought another router, since my old router was no longer supported by Trendnet,  which was on the list and set-up was a breeze from there.  Totally satisfied with the performance of the product after set-up.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|One of the few great shows on TV. Always has a few twists you don't think of. Keep it up.
B00005BCPC|2.0|If this was a movie independent of the Jane Austen title, I would have appreciated it more.  The movie is not bad; actually it is rather sweet.  The problem is that this is not Mansfield Park.  The quiet Fanny Park is nonexistent in the outspoken opinionated Fanny of this film.  Edmund is unaware of his feelings for Fanny the majority of the book, but in this movie his love is present from the beginning.  The largest change is the inclusion of slavery.  It is a topic that should never be forgotten, but is not even mentioned in Austen's novel.  Furthermore, I found the addition of slavery was only there to support the outspoken nature of Fanny.  Its inclusion didn't add to the film nor introduce an intriguing/new thought about the topic.  There are more inconsistencies, but these are the three that stand out most.<br /><br />  If you have read and love the book, I would be cautious in choosing to watch this film. It takes far too many liberties with the story for those who expect a recreation on screen.  If you are up for something similar to an alternate reality version of Mansfield Park, then it might appeal to you.  If you haven't read the story, then I would go ahead and watch.  The movie is nothing spectacular, but it's cute.
B001R6AW18|4.0|This movie is an old classic that I wanted to add to my collection. The special effects were ahead of their time.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Annine Lennox has chosen the most interesting group of songs for this album.  There were plenty that I'd never heard before, yet they were all enchanting.  I especially love the old-world stylings of the songs themselves.  This is a real homage to an age gone by.  You've probably never heard Christmas like this before, but I for one absolutely adore it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|it is great for kids to play because it is fun, gets kids excited, and if they are in a bad mood, it will make them happy!

1476727651|4.0|Prior to this year, I had never read Stephen King's iconic novel The Shining, despite being an avid fan of his work. Conveniently, I decided to read it immediately before King's thirty-years-later sequel, Doctor Sleep, was released. It was an interesting, though not necessary, way to approach the latter. While Doctor Sleep does continue the story of Dan Torrance (the gifted five year old Danny of The Shining) and calls back to the original book in numerous ways, it could also be read as a stand-alone and be almost just as enjoyable. At this point in Stephen King's lengthy career and devoted readership, if there is any individual who bought Doctor Sleep and hasn't read it's prequel, I would be rather surprised.<br /><br />This book begins by exploring what Dan has been doing for the past thirty years, and what we see at first is a man not so different from his late father. Despite his firmest intentions to stay far from alcohol, Dan eventually succumbs to the same addiction that plagued Jack Torrance. Alcoholism and involvement in AA are heavily prevalent in this book, exploring an interesting theme that people tend to gravitate towards the same habits and struggles as their parents. Dan still has ability to use the shining, but it's power has toned down significantly as he has grown older. He works as an orderly at a nursing home, and it is there that his nickname 'Doctor Sleep' is coined, for he has a special ability to ease the dying through a gentle passage into death.<br /><br />Before long, The True Knot are introduced: an outwardly forgettable caravan of RV travelers who move together from place to place across America, led by a gangly power-bitch who calls herself Rose the Hat. The only catch: The True are not-quite-living, not-quite-dead, and they require feeding off of human souls to live (a diet that also keeps them looking young and fit). More is revealed about The Knot throughout the book, but I can say with confidence that they make as effective and sinister a band of villains as King has ever conceived. Needless to point out, The True and Dan Torrance cross paths in some interesting ways as the pages roll on.<br /><br />Another element that stirs up the narrative even further is a young girl named Abra Stone who seems to have shining powers that would eclipse those of the younger Danny. Several states and a thousand miles away, Abra telepathically calls out to Dan (as an infant). Not long after, The True gets wind of this extremely powerful little girl, and that's when things get really interesting.<br /><br />King described Doctor Sleep in early promotional interviews as getting back to, “balls-to-the-wall horror,” and what a pleasant return it is. There are more than a handful of clever elements worked into the story, such as each of the members of The True Knot having a specific ‘power’ or talent that helps them succeed as a group. I got a pleasant sense of freshness and excited ideas, reminiscent of King’s earliest work. To avoid spoiling something wonderful, there is an ability introduced between Dan and Abra’s shining power that bears a distant resemblance to such heady concepts as Inception or The Matrix. While what is actually being done with this power would be rather difficult to describe clearly in most contexts, King, master that he is, introduces the reader and establishes the parameters of it with incredible clarity. That description probably sounds quite convoluted… Read it, and you’ll know precisely what I mean.<br /><br />As a whole, Doctor Sleep is a book that opens with a bang; there are a number of great hooks on both the ‘hero’ and ‘villain’ sides, snagging one’s attention immediately for the first seventy-five pages or so. Likewise, it ends with an exciting, clever, rather curious sort of confrontation. However, the middle narrative tends to drag in places. While the cast of characters is colorful and enjoyable throughout the novel, I found something somewhat lacking in the actual action of the plot. Don’t misunderstand, I’m quite alright with a book taking it’s time and having a slow-build, and I could not even call the middle of Doctor Sleep slow. It simply has a bit of a misguided feel.<br /><br />That said, I think King wrote the sequel to The Shining that felt right to him, and in that sense I believe that it is probably about the best that it could have been. Does it hold the same un-put-down-able quality of the original? Is it the best Stephen King book I've ever read? Not quite. But is it a good sequel that makes sense within the world of the first story? And is it a fun read? Absolutely, and I think in this case, that's enough.<br /><br />P.S. As has been King's habit, especially in recent years, to include some reference or another to The Dark Tower universe, Doctor Sleep is no exception. There's literally just one sentence that ties the book to that world, but for avid fans it will stick out like a sore thumb.g in the actual action of the plot.

B00BAXFDLM|5.0|It is no small feat that this is a novel narrated by a selfless AI who is also the most poignant personality. For me, books have flavors, superficial resonances that can usually be expressed verbally as “this books reminds me of FOO, but with BAR.”<br /><br />What Ann Leckie has accomplished in her debut novel is to give us a story that has all of the flavor markers and hallmarks of a classic C. J. Cherryh novel from the 1980’s, with the poignancy of a contemporary story. The novel is first and foremost a top notched space opera. But what has been fascinating for readers is that the language Leckie has chosen to use bring up questions of gender. This is certainly not the first book to talk to gender – even LeGuinn’s Left Hand of Darkness wasn’t the first genre book to go there. Leckie’s fresh approach, though, is in giving us a future society where gender is rendered equal not by neutering it, but by neutralizing it. By removing the bisect of male and female and using only the female gender to reference everything, the society of the Radch blurs the line. By submerging Breq, our AI product of Radch society, into other cultures, we begin to see the how arbitrary some attributes of gender are, and how much they can complicate what should otherwise be a simple worldview.<br /><br />One of the oldest tales is the tale of vengeance. What is justice, then, but vengeance wrought legal? But what if the system, the ruling mind that defines what is right and legal, is itself what has gone awry? Is the vengeance of ancillary component still justice? I am probably reading too much into this play of words between the title and the straightforward goal of Breq, but these are the kinds of thoughts you have when reading Ancillary Justice. Its really refreshing to find a book that satisfies both my simple interests (Space Opera with boom!) while still being thought provoking.<br /><br />And there was plenty of explosions and gun play. Just in case you were worried.<br /><br />Ancillary Justice was a wonderful read, and I look forward to more in this series./><br />Ancillary Justice was a wonderful read, and I look forward to more in this series.

B00G922EA2|5.0|G5 always make excellent games. This is no different. Settings are simple. You wont regret getting this game. I give this 6 stars.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is an incredible series with amazing cinematography. I frequently have one of the discs playing on the TV while I work at home as it creates a non-stop backdrop of brilliant video that is absolutely fascinating.
0143122061|5.0|My only regret is I cannot go back to my university days and enroll in one of Ferguson's classes. Insightful book.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Just as advertised and fast shipping! I have wanted this movie for a long time, thank you so much!! I will be back !!
B0081SRJSY|3.0|This is a good app for an amazing game. However, it's lack of features leaves me no choice but to give it three stars.<br /><br />* This game would be a four star app if it added pass and play features for multiple individuals.<br /><br />* This game would be a four-and-a-half star app if it further added Carcassonne expansion support, even as in-app purchases. (I would totally buy these!)<br /><br />* This game would be a five star app if it further added online asynchronous or real-time games for other players.<br /><br />(And I would buy it twice, maybe even three times, if it supported cross-platform multi-player support!!!)<br /><br />One small problem I do have is the &#34;elimination&#34; of certain play areas when there are no additional tiles that can be played there. This extra information is helpful to me, but in a real game of Carcassonne a player has no practical way to keep track of what tiles have been played, let alone what tiles are included in the game itself. This bothers me, as it detracts from an otherwise &#34;pure&#34; Carcassonne experience. This is equivalent to &#34;counting cards&#34; at the casino, and is an unnecessary addition to the game.<br /><br />Regardless, Carcassonne is a classic for good reason: it's a fun, challenging game that creates a unique, modular city each time you play. I highly recommend the app for anyone even though I only gave it three stars. I love this game, I just wish the app could have been better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book shows the true spirit of a person that hides in everyone. Take away the face a person presents to the world and we are all left with our own version of Katniss. We are all scared and unsure and selfish at times and we all have that point in our lives that make our break us. Each character in the games displays the most blunt and brutally accurate aspect of our character types. Whether we are Peeta in his most staggering honesty, or Haymitch in his most desperate attempts at finding  a reason to do anything while he is helpless to prevent what seems inevitable. Each character lays bare the best and worst parts of being a human being.<br />5 stars for this stunning piece of written art.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|An amazing and touching story. Mitch Albom never ceases to amaze me with stories that touch the heart and soul. Thank you for this wonderful book, I would recommend it to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said? Lower levels are easy enough for kids and the higher levels can stump you sometimes.  A fun game to pass around.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was beyond well written and kept me on my toes every single page. I feel like this book changed my perspective on important topics and loved it from the minute I picked up to when I set it down. You'll either fall in love with this book or absolutely despise it. Some reviews say that none of this would ever happen in reality, but the author did a splendid job of making this book believable. I definitely recommend it to anyone!
B00E4W40C4|2.0|This didn't measure up to the first. This had less action and missed opportunities to expand on character talent/mutations. One of the bad &#34;guys&#34; reminded me of a poison ivy and surely they could have made that character a lot more interesting. Also there was an unrealistic affair and exaggeration of cultural norms. I love sci-fi and action. I also love Hugh Jackman. This was a big disappointment.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|This was a long story that made little, if any sense.  I love the author but this one was a bomb.
B006NYDV7Q|5.0|Money well spent. All those albums for the price paid for, and the sound quality.  Hard to pass this up.
B008JFURII|5.0|funny and great actors and actresses.  Will love to see it many more times.  Great suspenseful scenes and wonderful dialogue.
B0091VYG86|5.0|It is a bit dated for 2013, u can tell it's been out a while, but it is defiantly one of my all time favorites
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I forgot my calculator for math class, so I got this so I wouldn't get in trouble. It worked perfectly but it will take some time to getting used to the controls if your learning math with negative numbers
B004HZ14QS|3.0|Good sound.  The live version of the post-Jaco era songs really sound much better.  I was thinking the medley at the end of the show was going to be some generic &#34;meh&#34; filler - but it really flows nicely.  My only complaint about that track is that it leaves you wanting more.  I'd love to hear that line up of Weather Report playing Elegant People.
B004FHCH9Q|5.0|One of the better films I've seen in several years.  The structure of the film is brilliant--since it opens with the \\"final\\" scene, we, like the main character, have no memories by which to judge what is truly happening.  As the movie progresses backwards chronologically our lack of knowledge of prior events can lead to misinterpretation of situations.  Only when prior scenes are revealed are we able to understand the motives and actions of the characters.  Great acting, intelligent premise.  I had put off watching this for the last few years because I couldn't believe the movie wouldn't be confusing and frustrating.  Amazingly, it is neither.  Highly recommend this film.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|THIS game is awesome!!! Now it just got better with the Christmas patch!!!!!  Presents,Santa claus. It's just amazing! Great job 505 games. Worth the money. -mason
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I just started this game but it's a fun,addicting to play when you have nothing to do I would have given this game a 5 star if you didn't have to have a Facebook to do certain things or you have to buy with crowns and you don't get many crowns without buying them so that's why it isn't a 5
B00G3Q6VPS|4.0|Britney will always be my #1 pop singer. This cd is no Blackout, it contains a lot of heart felt lyrics and ballads, but still a solid 14 track album.
159514188X|5.0|This book trully changes the way you look and act towards people. It's very well written and revolves around subjects that teens deal with. If only they had us read books like this for English! Honestly, every teenager should read this book to understand how their consequences can affect someone in a major way.
B003IY48PS|5.0|Classic horror film that inspired many modern movies. Blu-Ray is a must buy for Evil Dead fans even if, like me, you have it already, even the Ultimate Edition on DVD.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Love this game. It's very fun and entertaining you can play for hours without  getting bored. It's also a little addictive
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|great movie based on true events. great acting and it being shot in black and white really adds to the film its a 3 hr long movie and was captivated from the start. If you have never seen this movie its a must see!!!
B00DXPC1U6|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. I got into the series about 3 years ago and have been buying every season I cant watch for free on Blueray (Much better picture).
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Came free with the Blu-Ray purchase. Unfortunately these downloads are of horrible quality and are temporary. But it's free so no matter
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have always loved this game. The variety of sets is great and challenging. Even my granddaughter loves it. I play  it whenever I am waiting.
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|another great film great acting from the period shows the hell all men went through on the seas rather on ship or u boat .
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book concludes the series quite well, although a fuller account of the type of government that was left would have been useful.  In this regard the book was a bit myopic.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Got this for my daughter. She's a big Veronica Mars fan. I hadn't seen it before but when I walked in on my wife watching the series, I found myself hooked... asking questions and trying to remember what happened from season one... was almost late for work.
B00AAQ4EQ0|3.0|I gave this 3 stars bc It's not real nail Polish it peals when dry and stop glowing.  Will not buy again
B00GGEV828|1.0|Wish I had purchased the non-extended version.  This one is terrible.  Over indulgent with singing goblins, really bad make-up, and painfully uncomfortable to watch.  I would probably like the non-extended version to spare me from the horrible extended parts that should have remained on the cutting room floor.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Excellent Dan Brown. Mysterious, intriguing, historical and fascinating. Robert Langdon once again digs in deep to his quest and brings us along.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Fun game. Easy to play. Kills time when you're stuck waiting ... So far I have not experienced any glitches... my wife and I play together.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|This is a really fun app but there aren't any challenges like in the version for iPad 5 I wish that there is a update soon where there will be added challenges
B00G922EA2|5.0|Interesting fun game with a decent story. Good graphics and challenging puzzles. Not to difficult but not super easy either.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|You have to love Columbo.  Getting this will take weeks to see everything, but as long as the discs work, and don't give me problems, I know that I'll enjoy watching every episode and movie.  One of my favorite series!!!
B0036UMM84|5.0|My wife watched this with her friend and said it was really good. She had never seen it before, her friend watches it every year. The ending was sad, though.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I enjoyed the movie a lot. Nice special effects! Good combination of story tellings and actions were fun to watch
B00915G6R6|4.0|this fourth season is pretty much repeating the previous ones, but since the story is well made, it  is okey.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|So entertaining. Couldn't get enough of it and finished the entire season in under a month. Can't wait for the next one.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Still brings the laughs. My wife wishes they'd have more nerd issues and less sex talk, but as a man I find the whole thing humorous and entertaining. Sheldon is still the best character.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Not helpful.  A waste of time to download and install.  Have deleted it from my device.  Don't bother if you already know how to play the game.
B00BC5I6Q2|2.0|the story was almoust too weak. politics and revenges. that does not make a whole season worth to see. i did not like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can see why people are addicted to this game!! It's exciting but frustrating at the same &quot;clearing the jelly&quot;...
B002P73UQW|5.0|Probably the best episode with Sheldon... We still laugh when Penny gives him that gift. Priceless, as my wife says.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I bought mine, and it was decent at first - a nice cheap way of casting some stuff on my TV. Then, it started to &#34;go weird&#34;. It became unresponsive once, and took some effort to get it reset. Worked for a bit after that, but happened, again, and had to reset it again, only this time it forgot its settings, and I had to re-initialize it.<br /><br />Now it just seems dead... permanent red light. I'm a little tired of wrestling with this thing.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I have read all of David Baldacci's books and enjoyed most of them (except The Hit), but this was my favorite yet!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love this show! It's not all about the zombies, it has a great storyline and characters and writting! Try it yourself
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Loved this when it came out in the theatres. Got it for my wife, since she's a big Halloween nut and likes to watch a new one every year. It's a great kids show ... nice to see kid Halloween shows coming back.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It is a good book but I feel like the author didn't put as much romance in this book as the the Hunger Games the first book. She also doesn't help you have the same relationship with the characters as in the last book but everything else was great.
0770435726|3.0|Having been an expat myself, I really looked forward to this book, but I found it boring and dull and did not live up to the publicity.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Great film.  I used to think superman was really cheesy.  Not so with this film.  They did a really great job making him cool again. They got rid of the cheesy theme song and improve his uniform.  Great acting too.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This years must have Christmas CD. I love being able to put this in as background music or just easy listening and then jiving with it when I start hearing a favorite part.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|Hugh jackman is the perfect actor to play wolverine. this movie was so much better the origins. Hugh is a terrific actor and loved the Japanese setting.
0307341577|2.0|I so loved her first book, but this one was just gruesome with nothing redeeming about it.  I would not recommend it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Another great edition to the Lord of the Rings series.  I love this film.  I wish I would of waited for the extended cut though.
015603008X|5.0|The story is great and very touching.  I enjoy reading and this book has met my expectations!  It is a must have.
0307887898|5.0|An absolute must for anyone serious about startups. Not only on their own, not only in technology.<br />You're an intrapreneur? Good. Read it too.<br />The introduction this book provides opens up a wide amount of valuable knowledge for your endeavour.
B005DOL0R0|1.0|Sorry, amazon you got this wrong!!! It does not fit my Kindle Fire HD, in any shape or form. amazon was awesome about resolving this issue, however buyer be forewarned, as I really wanted THIS sleeve.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Visually this is an amazing movie.  I'm not sold on all the theology (as I am a devout Christian) but its still a good film
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is one of the best games I have ever played in my life I think it is the best
030746363X|5.0|This was THE most effective book I've ever read.  I'm not a big consumer of &#34;diet books&#34;. It's effective because Tim has presented several best practices for achieving specific results.  And by putting these practices (simple sets of actions to make part of your daily routine) in the context of an &#34;experiment&#34;, he has removed the typical &#34;belief&#34; requirement that so many books require of the reader.<br /><br />It really is very simple to achieve the results that he has documented in the book and on his website's blog.  Like any experiment, it doesn't matter what you 'believe' or not.  Just be rigorous in following the dietary and physical practices for at least 30 days, and you'll be able to make your own assessment as to whether or not it is effective.  But don't make up your set of rules or say you'll do some things and not others and then 2 weeks later say this doesn't work.  Just like cooking from a recipe, follow the instructions to get the desired result.<br /><br />My results: Before reading 4Hr Body, I walked 1 hour every day for 18 months and 'tried to cutback on calories in the usual way.  I managed to loose 20lbs, from 185lb to 165lb.  I could never get below 165lb and had a 36&#34;+ waist. (not good for someone who is 5'6&#34;)<br /><br />Following the slow carb diet, I lost 20lb in 5 weeks.  I've continued to practice the SlowCarb eating style for the past 2 1/2 years and have maintained 140lbs and 32&#34; waist.  No joke - I'm 54 and have never been more fit at any other time in my life.<br /><br />Thanks Tim for sharing your knowledge.<br /><br />Mark Eakle - currently nomadic in South East Asia
B001P9EQH8|3.0|First off, it is worth the money because it is so inexpensive. That being said, while it amplifies the sound fine, the volume controls are nearly useless. It crackles a lot, meaning soft music will have annoying interruptions. It is fine for music that does not require close listening.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|A great movie of courage and perseverance.  Also a great depiction of what it must have been like to be there when this happened.  I felt like I was right there when the tsunami hit.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|By far one of my favorite trilogy!!!!!!! Peeta and Katniss' s love will never lose the flame that caught fire!!!!
B00A2YAY3C|5.0|This classic needed to be added to my collection! An Amazon instant video using Amazon storage . . . good visual and adio with smooth streaming. For me this is far more convenient than a CD (already had CD). Read other reviews for content!
B00003CXBH|5.0|A telling movie about love for freedom, brotherhood, and spirituality. De Niro and Jeremy Irons play two characters who are both manly but in a different way. They lived differently and died differently, however both fullfilled their &#34;Mission&#34;
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|While Tom Scholz continues to be constant in his releasing of music over the years ... Third Stage (8 years), Walk On (8 years), Corporate America (8 years) and Life, Love & Hope (11 years), musically the reviews are varied from listeners, myself included.  I love the Boston sound that Tom founded, but on this album I'm not sure what's happening.  One could argue all the Boston elements are present (even posthumous Brad Delp which I'm sure were tracked before his untimely death), but the drumming is horrible and the beat of the album is very reserved.  Tom doesn't need to reinvent the wheel here, but a quality album goes a long way.  If this album were truly stellar then fans would agree across the board (ie (current releases) Mark Tremonti, John Elefante, Alter Bridge, Transatlantic, Fates Warning, etc.), not the varied reviews here which range from one star to five.  I kind of figured this album would be akin to his last two releases but I still picked it up and I got what I expected I was going to get.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent, with so many twists and surprises!  Sweet is the return of the land grab.  Hard to<br />put down with all chacter interplay
B008IGAJJK|5.0|Another classic that I wanted to add to my collection! The visual and audio are better than the CD I already had. This was an Amazon instant video purchase stored on Amazon. Smooth streaming and always available! Please read other reviews for content.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|this product is ok, first off the one I ordered was FAKE, I was lucky enough to get covered by ZAGGs lifetime warranty and received a new REAL one! overall it didn't help from my screen ultimately cracking. I did purchase for my new galaxy S4 though
B0049VZ222|5.0|Loved it. All this time and I never ever saw the very first episode! I wondered how everything happened and now I know. I started watching walking dead when they had a marathon last year and now I love the show! Love it!
B000002J20|5.0|A superb Yes album, 'Tales from Topographic Oceans' represents the summit of the psychedelic ride up the mountain and back again on which Yes takes the avid listener.  It is quintessential Yes, at their best... at once beautiful, spiritual, awe-inspiring, uplifting, and ultimately unforgettable.  Please enjoy.
B00D8JE0H4|4.0|If you enjoy Whoopie Goldberg, this is a fun video. She's a nun on the run, creating havoc and teaching life's lessons to her students. A favorite of mine, purchased and stored as an Amazon instant video. Think laughter!
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I have been really enjoying this game. It keeps the mind thinking and active. I like the different things you have to figure out. I let<br />my 5 yr old grandson help me and he enjoyed too. some things were hard but between both of us we had fun in playing the different games. Also good story line for a game.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|Lady Gaga said several months ago that this was an experimental cd and she was right. I dont know why these people hate this cd-I admit I did not care for it at first time I heard it but on repeat playings this is a good cd. This is the worst of the 4 cds she has-the best being Born This Way. Before all of the Lady Gaga fans revolt-I am a HUGE Lady Gaga fan and would buy anything that she put out.<br /><br />Now the best on the cd is Dope, Gypsy, Manicure and Artpop. Dope is so raw and honest it is one of the top ten of all of her songs. She should release Gypsy and Manicure as singles-she would do a great job with videos for these songs.<br /><br />There is only one song I cant stand-it is Jewels-I have listened to it many times and dont like it at all. She doesn't need Rap creds- stay with the Dance/Pop songs she does great with.<br /><br />People who hate this listen to it in its entirety for 6 times at least you will change your review.<br /><br />Can't wait to see which songs she is doing for her new Artpop tour next year. She is an excellent performer!
B004SIPA4G|5.0|Sin City is a hyperstylized piece of greatness. Co-directed by Rodriguez and Miller, the film is action packed, highly stylized, and very riveting. It's also an anthology movie! The film consists of a prolouge, three short stories, and an epilogue. There are many many huge name actors in this movie, so watch it to catch them all but I don't want to list them all. The three leads of each story, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, and Bruce Willis give some of their best acting in their whole careers. Rourke especially! The first story focusing on Marv is definitely the best, but everything is great in this flick. I have come to detest Rodriguez's reliance on cheap digital effects in his current films (Machete, Once Upon a Time in Mexico) and feel they are missing what his older films had, pure raw unabashed bloody squibs and firey blanks flying left and right. This film however is easily Rodriguez's best work. This film had to be done the digital way, all with green screens and digital effects. It's completely appropriate because it blends with the film's style so well. This film is the kind of film that current day Rodriguez excels at.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks amazing too. You get two cuts and a TON of bonus features. Seriously, no director's DVD releases are as in-depth as Rodriguez'. I got this for $5 on Black Friday and would definitely say it is a must own for any Blu Ray collector! I put this movie off for nearly a decade and am happy to say I have finally seen it. I look forward to the sequel and the TV series as well! I may read the graphic novels now too (I never read them but know other works by Miller, Batman, Ronin, Wolverine, etc.) I might have to say this release and movie gets a flawless: 10/10
B00D8JLLRQ|4.0|Whoopie's back in the Habit! She returns to save the school with fun and music. If you didn't see 'Sister Act,' you might miss a bit here and there. Outrageous fun from 'headliner' in Vegas and back to the convent to save the day. Purchased and stored as an Amazon instant video. Humor plus!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Boring. Special effects were okay. Story line standard. The acting performances were surprisingly flat. I usually like Will Smith and Jaden was great in Karate Kid remake.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It is a fun game to play on the kindle while you need to waste some time,  however it freezes up and restarts and you lose your credits!!
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|The action scenes were pretty good! Just prepare to take a little nap between each action scene. The actors were not the best... alot of no names.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This was a 'request' from my granddaughter! It's her current favorite and has become one of mine. This was an Amazon instant video purchase saved to Amazon. The quality for both visual and audio is excellent with smooth streaming. A definitely recommend!<br />Note other reviews for content.
055380684X|5.0|Excellent book.  Life changing.  Wish I had read it when I was younger.  I have made it required reading for all my children.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got it for my kids and now I Play it all the time lol<br />I love the movies and so do my kids so this was just as fun
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A good storyline and a good read. Not the author's best writing, but a story worth telling. Worth the time.
B008GBCMHO|5.0|A fun classic to enjoy with my grandchildren! This was an Amazon instant video purchase stored on Amazon. The visual and audio are clear and crisp. Streaming is smooth and always available. Please read other reviews for content!
B000I8G5B2|5.0|Bought for my son. It kept his attention, so it must be good. I checked with him before rating and he said it's fantasmal (is that even a word?).
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app it helps me sleep.I have insomnia and so the relaxing music and rrelaxing beat things help me sleep very good.
193700788X|5.0|I had been reluctant to read this last book of the Sookie Stackhouse series due to all the grumbling I'd read from fans who'd already read the book and didn't like the way Ms. Harris had chosen to end her story arc.  I tried hard to make sure I didn't read any specific 'spoilers', just in case I decided to read the book later.  After breaking down & deciding to buy this signed copy first edition, I still put off reading the book for several months, but finally say myself down to take a chance.  I am SO glad I did!  In my opinion, Charlaine Harris has stayed true to her vision of the Stackhouse universe, providing her fans with yet another, stellar, funny, clever book about the beloved Sookie, her vampire friends (Eric, Bill, and Pam), her foes (fairies, vampires, Arlene), her brother Jason, her demon friends (Mr. Cataliades & Diantha), her human friends (Tara, the Bellafleurs, Jane Bodehouse), and her were friends (Sam and Alcide).  I'm so proud to have a signed copy of such a wonderful story!
0141195851|2.0|Love this story, don't like this book. I've been collecting this series, but have noticed as I start to read them all that the designs on the covers rub off quite quickly. A nice set if you plan to never actually read them.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Because this is the greatest show ever, best so far has been first season, middle of fourth season then second season.  Don't stop watching during the second season, it gets better.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|lots of fun for every age to play takes a long time to wait to play when you need new stuff
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|Another GREAT cd by Mazzy! Love this CD and her voice too, this completes my collection of Mazzy Star CD's perfectly!
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Product shipped quickly. It's the product I ordered, but upon arrival, the internal packaging is a bit smashed. Nothing that stops me from watching the movie, but a little disappointing, as it's a gift.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Altjhough Chromecast does give me the freedom to watch a few things my Roku box doesn't, such as ShowtimeAnytime, it is highly unreliable, often jamming or skipping AND 100% OF THE TIME THERE IS A LAG BETWEEN AUDIO AND VIDEO....it's like watching a poorly dubbed foreign language to english translated movie. I have a very fast internet connection and router and my router and chromecast are close to each other as recommended. I would seriously advise anyone considering this purchase to spend the extra money for Apple TV, Roku, etc. Chromecast is a total disappointment.
B007SGM084|1.0|poor writing, unimaginative story, and frankly, boring sex (would not of thought that possible..)  yet a best seller? who knew
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It is a fun tower defense game. Supports multiplayer too. My son sometimes prefer it over his ps3 games. :)
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|The characters are very entertaining and the plot has some fun twists! I would love to read another story about the friends and adventures of Don Tidwell.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|Dear Ms. Conrwell:  Dr. Scarpeta is a powerful, double degreed, with two sub specialties, and a retired Colonel. She cooks Italian, and sleeps with a gorgeous man.  I am tired of her relentless complaints of how bad her life is, how frequently she is betrayed, how many people she has to protect.  Making over $500K a year, Chief Medical Examiner living in a semi mansion, complains about having the flu, having her friend get a new job, having a bad sister, having been separated from her husband, dirty work vans.  She is complaining so much that she can't get her work done.  Her beloved husband who is a psychologist and a profiler has suddenly lost the ability to cope, manipulate and get along with a boss he does not like and babbles like an idiot.<br />Patricia dear, please bring us Dr. Scarpeta back.  She was pretty dynamic and interesting and we tended to learn something in each book and not sleep all night because we needed to see how it ends.  This is the third major flop in the series.  It is not getting any better.  I am going to pretend that the last 3 books have not happened and look forward to the next one.
B0010358D0|5.0|Written from the ground up to be culturally revenant to both Japanese and American audiences--you'll enjoy both the English dub or subtitles to the original Japanese.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|A fun little game that gets more challenging on higher levels. I'd like to get gold medals on every level. That keeps me coming back to this game.
1594745692|5.0|I like the feel of the cards, they are thick and easy to shuffle. The designs are fun on the cards and I love the bullet box design of the box. I don't know much about Tarot reading, so I can't speak to how well the card designs match their meanings.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Currently hyperthreading with this in my current build. Works great. No issues on install and with daily use. Thanks Amazon.
B002M9WW30|3.0|I was expecting a better picture quality being these blu rays, but was disappointed, some disks skip, but I guess for 20 bucks I couldn't ask for more, overall average product.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is handy but can be glitchy. I love the My Points to earn neat prizes.I would recommend this app to anyone.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A very well written book and Hard to put down.  This is the best of John Grisham's books I have previously read.
B001I45UFC|4.0|The book was ok and it messed up for me. The pictures were amazing, that's what surprised me the most.
1439153663|4.0|Good to hear the side of an indentured servant as well as the slave - a very tough life not so long ago!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is one of the best Stephen King has ever written.  Congrats on creeping your readers out once again.  Thank you.
159420229X|5.0|This book takes you on a fascinating journey into a new world, and is one of those rare books that combines memoir with nonfiction. The ideas stick with you, and long after enjoying the story, I've used his techniques successfully in several real-world applications.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This was such a great movie, it actually was better than all the others made in decades.  They need to make another one
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I completely loved this game when I first downloaded it but now that I am on level 19 I hardly get any challenges or treasure chests.  I grow rare seeds for 10 pearls and get another plant and not rare fish.  I have yet to update and from the sounds of it I don't want to.  I would love to keep the game but growing tired of it.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I love this game is awesome but I'm having the issue that many others are having with my kindle saying that I don't have enough storage and then I look at my storage and it's at over 3 GB! Amazon! Please resolve your issues and read your consumers reviews!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was sad at the end  it kept me entertained. It's a great sequel to \\" Time to Kill\\". I would highly recommend reading this book.
B004XKVPG6|4.0|This is absolutely the darkest, most depressing, and sad film I have ever seen.  No, I'm not talking about the acting, which was brilliant, or the ability to keep your attention, which was also amazing.  I'm just saying that when I walked out of the theater, my mood was as dark as ever in all my years --- and I'm generally an optimist!  The film is actually quite excellent in realism, and the sadistic measures that some criminals will go to realize their intentions.  Obviously, this isn't the first time Hollywood has chosen to kill off a very likable character (won't tell you, in case you haven't seen it).  But the manner in which it is done is so macabre and detestable, you have to wonder how the writers must have stayed up nights trying to figure out the most gruesome of ways.  After leaving the theater, I didn't want anything to do with this movie for many years, which unique for a movie lover like myself --- but I eventually had to come back and give credit to a very well done film.  The 5th star indicates that I &#34;loved it&#34; and that can never be the case, but it is worth four stars for the story, and another fantastic performance by Morgan Freeman, as well as good drama by Pitt.  If you can get beyond the shadow that this movie casts over your psyche, the film is well worth seeing.  Terry Mindham
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is a great book for kids and teens. It keeps me in suspense and interested. Unlike other books, this book is about Greek gods and goddesses. I also find some writings numerous and witty. Parts will surprise you, especially the end! ;-)<br />  Overall, this book is wonderful. I will be reading the other books to this series. Good job Rick Riordan! Please keep writing more books.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather is accurate. The app does not freeze up or anything. And is very useful when I need it in the morning
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|My favaorite artist - LOVE IT TOTALLY! This CD is great, Madonna has did it again with these songs. I play this atleast once aweek
B00280LYIC|5.0|I am just rating the book do not read cause there is nothing about it that you need to know
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I LOVE this app. I am a BIG reader.  I can share all my books with all my devices, My tablet, desktop computer, laptop, Even my kindle fire with this easily.  Best app I ever got.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game and can play it four hours! I was worried it would require Internet to play but glad it doesn't makes it to where I can play it while traveling.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I'm a huge FAN of Micheal Jackson!! i love all of him much - this CD is great, because I can just place this one CD in my player and dance until my heart contend!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is truly addictive, so much fun to create your own little ice age village. But it's hard to expand because it gets more expensive as you go. The acorns are had to come by there should be an easier way to win and gain acorns other than having to buy them all the time, but other than that it's a great game!
B004IK8PLE|5.0|This book was awesome. I loved the way he explained everything, and you could follow even the most complex theories and codes easily.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I have the greatest respect for Veterans and our military and what they accomplish. My review is about the book not the man, who by the way is a Great Hero.<br /><br />I was hoping there would be more technical descriptions of how they do what they do. There is very little. The training he went through is not well described and kind of skipped over. The book is mostly short stories told from memory with out much detail. This could have been a great book if it had been written by someone with a better understanding of how to put a story into words
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's pretty good, you need to have a decently fast internet connection for it to work great. There is a little bit of a delay when switching songs or videos. There aren't too many apps out to support it. It is a little bit difficult to start and stop using it while trying to switch between videos or music.
B00GINENG0|3.0|This games teaches kids to have better responsibly s if they want a pet you can't afford why not use this.  in this game you feed and dress Tom make him go to the bathroom let him sleep play games with him and decorate his furniture I am just so fond of this game it is more than I can explain
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book wraps up the series well.  I couldn't put any of them down....and this one was no exception.  I didn't predict many of the happenings in this book.....which makes it special.  If you liked the first two, this one should be no exception.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I find it easy to play but a little awkward until you can upgrade. Beyond that it is fun to play and an easy time killer.
B0001I561E|5.0|I am glad that their lips match what is being said! Some dvd 's are Lip SYNC-ING, and this one is not.<br />Thanks
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Well this game has lots of games in one app so I would use and show this app to all my friends
B006G3D0SO|5.0|Love this film, it's a classic. I always enjoyed it far more than the original Wizard of Oz. Glad it was available to stream.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This is an amazing game having allot of fun but for some reason I try connecting to my Facebook with the game and it pops up the it would like to access my account info but when I hit ok it don't connect what could I do to fix this?
0385523394|5.0|Granddaughter said she enjoyed this book and is planning to read entire series. I will order them here on Amazon as well.<br />  Thank you
B000O8OTNC|4.0|When first trying to use this item, i followed the instructions and was not getting very good results.....now i am not sure if this is wrong or not (but my blades are razor sharp now), but for some reason i get the best results when slowly pulling with blade tilted at the same angle the stones are set at. Then switch to opposite side, because it seems to only sharpen one side at a time that way.....also, by pulling thru the carbide side a few times first will help to rough it down so to speak. It definately works, just not as instructed
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Nancy Gibbs is an awesome writer. I love everything she does. She is not the editor for Time Magazine. This book lets you into the closeness of the past  Presidents. No one else knows the feelings of these men ...only each other.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My nephew was actually the one to download the app. Little did I know I would really enjoy it. Haha.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I am glad that their lips match what is being said! Some dvd 's are Lip SYNC-ING, and this one is not.<br />Thanks
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|There are really good graphics and a large selection of animals to hunt. Everything does seem a little expensive, especially coins.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|There is no way to ever get enough crowns to purchase a dragon without spending money and that will only get you one. Unless you have lots of money you really don't need, lots of time you really can't use doing something useful, and lots of Facebook friends just like you, this game is not fun.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Exciting game..buy the full version. You will not regret it. Hours of fun. I have not had so much fun with a game in some time.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I am glad that their lips match what is being said! Some dvd 's are Lip SYNC-ING, and this one is not.<br />Thanks
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I find the Chromecast disappointing. I've tried it on Youtube and Acorn tv  It streams for a minute or so then I get the home page saying there is no connection.  When I stream Netflix, without Chromecast (Netflix is programmed into my tv and uses my wifi) I don't have this problem.  I'm just find Chromecast frustrating.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved everything about this book. It was interesting to see a German's view and that they didn't agree with Hitler.
0307887960|4.0|Excellent suggestions especially for keeping the weight off which makes the whole book worthwhile. I have been using this program and have lost weight. Most importantly, I think this will lead to lifestyle changes although I will incorporate the Dukan philosophy with other nutritional concepts.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|no Backward or Ahead as far as the Lip sync goes. This Dvd works well and lips are in sync with sound and words.  its Nice Thanks!
B0082Z447U|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely and would have given it 5 stars but the plot twists were foreseeable at times<br /> and the characters a little one dimensional.  Given the era it was written, it was to be expected - for an audience not so jaded. It was masterfully executed and retained my interest.  I see why it's considered a classic.
B00BP0LPZI|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  It will change how you view our freedom and how we take so it for granted oftentimes.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Scariest of the Alien series. Better in my view than the first.  There is an adoption theme going on here, and the producers seemed to have to mark Weaver as heterosexual for some silly reason. But it has some of the scariest, tense, and utterly chilling scenes in US film making.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Had this book for my kids when they were young and am now reading it to my grandchildren.  I don't know if it is the story (Which is a great story) or the way it is told but the kids have all loved it and ask to have it read again and again.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|my granddaughter loves this video...watches it all the time! She has seen all the Harry Potter movies and likes this one the best.
B000GKW4I0|5.0|Another great dinosaur by Papo. It is a great addition to the dinosaur collection. One of the best Stegosaurus you can buy.
6305428042|5.0|Fabulously humorous Hallowe'en movie. The witch trio is not to be missed! A scare-romp with unforgettable Midler at the center. Suitable for not-small children.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|After being completely dissatisfied with the previous five to six novels, I was hesitant to pay the 'new release' price for Dust, but I am glad that I did.<br /><br />::A FEW MILD SPOILERS INCLUDED::<br /><br />Cornwell and her series of characters are all FINALLY returning to their roots and moving away from the dark shadows of drawn out regret and resentment that have followed them for quite some time now. Scarpetta is back to being a Chief Medical Examiner, Lucy is hacking into things, Benton is a profiling for the FBI, and Marino is a city detective. The fact that Cornwell has brought her characters full circle is what is going to make this book attractive to her fans who have been missing the 90's. It's almost as if they are back in Virginia, only, of course they aren't, but the dynamic between the characters and how they work and interact with one another reminds me quite a bit of Virginia.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed DUST thanks to several major components:<br /><br />- Minimal whining, bickering, resentment, and rambling<br />- Profiling is more prevalent with Benton back to doing what he does best (more of a psych thriller edge)<br />- Old fashioned detective work is used in combination with high tech forensic tools (versus all gadgets)<br />- Benton is actually present (no longer resentful, distant, and secretive)<br />- Marino has returned to his vices and is back to being his macho, yet, insecure self<br />- Lucy is flying choppers, developing new software, and in a stable, rather than destructive, relationship<br />- Kay is not attacked by a serial killer (that was getting old)<br /><br />I think long time fans will appreciate Cornwell's return to her roots. Naturally, with everything that has happened in the previous novels, things will never be completely as they were, but the storyline is no longer composed of a sad song that refuses to end. While some resentment and insecurities are still present within the characters (particularly Marino), Cornwell has toned it down and returned to the dynamics that made her books so successful to begin with.<br /><br />The only thing about this book that bothered me was her references to Sandy Hook, as if she, Scarpetta, were actually there. When the book opens Scarpetta has just returned from the scene and is deeply disturbed by what she witnessed and experienced. Throughout the book she has various flash backs to blood, gore, and the bodies of small children. While I find it reasonable that an expert of Scarpetta's fictional stature would be called in to provide expertise in such a case, I found it both troubling and disrespectful that she used this tragedy to further uplift and heroine-ize Scarpetta. As I flipped through the pages, I couldn't help but wonder how the families of these beautiful children would feel knowing that their child's death was used as a tragic stage for plot written to entertain and thrill. I personally found it tasteless. When you make millions of dollars writing fictional books, I think you should be able to create your own twisted scene, without cashing in on the misfortune and tragedy of those who have suffered such an unimaginable loss.Cornwell has toned it down and returned to the dynamics that made her books so successful to begin with.<br /><br />The only thing about this book that bothered me was her references to Sandy Hook, as if she, Scarpetta, were actually there.

0385350864|5.0|As a long time fan of 'Bridget Jones' it was impossible not to enjoy this laugh out loud sequel.  Sadly to enable Helen Fielding to write the novel she wanted to about the plight of the single older woman, she had to kill off our favourite hero Darcy. Her wonderful gentlemanly husband would never have left her so despite knowing she would  upset her many fans, it is a shadow that hangs over this sequel. It is not a spoiler having told you this as the news was literally all over the media before publication.  However much you were a fan of Darcy do not let put you off this the return of Bridget with her latest diary.<br /><br />Bridget, now 51 a widow for a few years, feels ready to start dating again. Despite the lack of plot and the somewhat unbelievable situations she gets herself into this is still a highly entertaining read. Not all of it is unbelievable though as her Twitter addiction, panic attacks over the children and her inability to cope with a plethora of electronic gadgets all ring very true!<br /><br />If you are looking for a light hearted view of life for a single, middle aged Mum, then you will not in my opinion go far wrong by catching up with Bridget Jones. Just maybe do not take it too seriously then you will not be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The characters will connect with your emotions if you are anything like me and will be rooting for the victims throughout.  Anyone who read or saw the Hunger Games needs to read this book.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great book, highly recommended even if you've been lifting for years. My favorite thing I got from this was a sense of perspective regarding my training. I'm always looking for ways to improve my training, both nutrition and weights, and this helped put some of what I have been doing into perspective to help me train smarter, not harder.
B005H9B44A|3.0|The plot is good and plausible, good entertainment. Much of the movie is very dark and images are not clear. There appears to be &#34;pixel smudging&#34; and though action is happening via sound, the movements cannot actually be seen. The story can be followed by sound and by speech, but not by visual effects. The stills are striking and beautiful, but the action cannot be deciphered visually.
1401324649|3.0|I read this for the Book Club Group I belong to and to be honest although I found it amusing, it was hard work. It is well written but was not for me the pleasurable read I am looking for when I choose a book to read. Billed on its front cover as an International Bestselling Sensation it seems mine is a minority opinion. Although I admit there were moments I laughed out loud, for example one character an idiot half brother to Albert Einstein, provided a few, as did the encounter with an air traffic controller in Bali. As a matter of fact writing this review I have realised why I did not enjoy this book, it is farcical and I am not a fan of farces, so no surprise really! One thing it did remind me of was the fact that despite our age we should still treat life as an adventure, just maybe not such a far fetched one!<br /><br />The novel starts on the 100th Birthday of Allan Karlsson as he waits in his room at the old peoples home for his party to begin. A big event has been planned with press and the Mayor planning to be in attendance, most important guest though decided to disappear by climbing out of the window. This spritely centenarian then begins a series of episodic adventures involving criminals, several murders, a suitcase full of cash, and incompetent police. As his antics unfold, we learn about Allan's earlier life in which he was involved in a ridiculous number of major historical moments of the twentieth century. He helped to make the atom bomb, became friends with American presidents, Russian tyrants, and Chinese leaders.<br /><br />As mentioned already very far fetched, but if you are a fan of farce this may well be a five star read for you, if not just give it a miss and find something else to read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have played this app for nearly a year now. I love the different puzzles that get put together. It's a great way to slip into a brain coma and have fun. The best part is you continue to get the dozer doller and free coins even if you don't play for a while.

B00DQZT38G|5.0|Belkin Chambray Cover for Kindle Fire HDX 8.9&#34; is a great sturdy case that would make a great holiday gift.  The case comes in four colors; Black, Pink, Blue and Purple.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|As a reader, I was able to understand and get involved in Malala's story.  Education is taken forgranted in many places.  For Malala, education was very important.  For her and her fellow classmates it was a priviledge.

B007UW9VWO|5.0|There isn't much to say except that this is a great movie for sushi lovers.  I am not new to sushi or the Japanese culture, and I still learned quite a few things from it.  Both the video and audio quality is pretty good to excellent, and if you enjoy a good documentary about the sushi business you shouldn't hesitate to pick this blu-ray up.
0151008116|5.0|My brother greatly appreciated this book. I gave it to him for his Birthday and he appreciated it very much.
B00H1O3Q18|2.0|Not the best season really.  Been having trouble getting into the &#34;flow&#34; of it as a whole.  It's an uncomfortable mix of plodding along and then moving too fast, with way too many characters thrown in and then killed off too quickly.  Feels cheap and forced.  That said, there have been a couple episodes I've really enjoyed, including the 6th one where The Gov is reintroduced.  Will go into seasons second half with guarded optimism that it improves a bit.  Never thought I'd be saying this, but glad to have a couple months of a break from the show.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like that you can play as much as you want and its not like the others. Once you geit into it thats the end
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app does not give me a notification that text has been received.  Kindle needs to greatly improve texting apps!
1574214276|5.0|This is my &#34;go to&#34; book when I want to find a different pattern.  Since I can't draw and need to see something to copy, I go back to this book over and over.  It is sort of dog-eared by now I have used it so many times.  I like the layout of the book and the examples are great.
0062107313|3.0|You know who you are--we'll read most any book Amy Tan writes!  This book is well written, classic Tan in that it tells stories of mothers and daughters.  It's an historic novel with a lot of interest for period fashionistas and buffs of the courtesan culture.  The story line is never ending (perhaps because the novel is lengthy), and the squeamish feeling you get early on well reappear throughout, due to the many unpleasant plot twists and scenes.  The female protagonists routinely make bad choices with horrifying consequences.  Of course the men don't fare much better; good and bad alike meet fateful ends.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This app is really fun and will keep you entertained! It definitely isn't the real thing but it is not just a lame hunting game
0143034545|2.0|The information is really elementary and nothing new. Anyone with a little common sense could be doing most of what is suggested.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|My tastes are rather eclectic. For example, one of my favorite forms of music to listen to is movie soundtracks. While I don't have any musical training, I was raised not to dismiss any type of music. Like a kid who says he doesn't like broccoli, but has never tasted it. So, having heard a track from the Piano Guys Christmas CD, without hesitation I ordered their other two works. Their music is amazing and their arrangements are so inventive. While many of the tunes were written by classical writers, the arrangements are thoroughly modern and so listenable. Composers like Beethoven, Bach, Mozart are there, but so are Howard Shore and John Williams. Some of the songs I immediately became enamored with I noticed were all written by the same person. I didn't recognize the name, but upon Googling it, I found it was one of the group. While tracks slip from classical to popular to (even) children's music, the transitions are seamless - a testament to their ability to consistently arrange the music. I have no reservations in suggesting their music. There are no bad tracks; the entire CD is topnotch!
B0007939NO|5.0|Love this movie, love all Gene Kelly movies. Had a copy taped off a movie channel, our own copy is much better,
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|historically inventive, interjecting information supposed with no verification.  but it is a good read, well written although not reliably scholarly.
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|It was just &#34;ok,&#34; really.  This is the first 3D movie I've purchased where I turned 3D mode off 20 minutes into the movie.  It just wasn't that well done.<br /><br />4 stars for the story / action.<br />2 stars for the 3D presentation.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews, but I wanted to take a moment to rave about The Piano Guys: A Family Christmas. I had seen them perform a song on Youtube a year or so ago and didn't realize they were actually cutting CD's. Someone recently sent me a link to their video on Youtube, &#34;Angels We Have Heard On High,&#34; and I saw where they had a CD available. Having been enamored with their sound, I immediately ordered it on Amazon. This CD sets a perfect note (pun intended) for the holidays. Mostly traditional Christmas music, their arrangements are refreshingly inventive and catchy. I'm betting their Christmas CD will quickly become one of your favorites for the Christmas season. If you have heard even one their tunes and enjoyed it, don't stress about whether you will get burned by purchasing the CD. You won't! Their sound is consistently excellent. I can't say enough good things about their music. Buy the CD!
B002KCNUH6|5.0|My son loves this toy.  It's fun like one of his trucks but also great for him to play with and build around with his Duplos
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is a book of wonderful beginnings and endings. It gets a bit muddled in the middle, or perhaps not. After all, most dreams seem muddled when you wake.<br />  Highly recommended.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS SO GOOD I JUST WANT TO CRY. ITS UNDRESCRIBABLE HOW AMAZING THESE BOOKS ARE
1936891026|2.0|I&#34;m not really impressed.  I have heard alot of talk about this book and when I got it I was disappointed.  It has some nuggets but all and all he really didn't say anything that was profound.  The book is not organized into chapters per say....it's really just pages of information that he refers to as &#34;books&#34;.  Maybe it is golden for some groups of people and that's fine.  Every book is not for everybody.  One thing I did learn from reading this book is if I wanted to write a book I could do the same format..,.just write a few words on each page, with alot of white space and &#34;bam&#34;...published book,
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|not quite as awesome as their first album, but whiskey legs and a few others still rock...and the dross of this album is still lightyears ahead of the pinnacle of other artists achievements in the pop world
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun and when I have spare time I play. I won't pay  to play more or longer. I refuse to get wrapped up so my h in any game that it drain my pocKetbook or prevents me from doing things I should do.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|It is, with the last book, starting to drone on and on with no end in sight. This book takes us from character to character let's watch them make bad decisions  to the point that we lose what interested us about them in the first place.
B00F9040HU|1.0|You can only get to a certain level for the free download,then you have to pay if you want to keep playing.<br />Come on people, either it's free or it's not. Have a little integrity.
B00005AWMF|5.0|great sound quality and production values on this album, and sade has an amazing voice. vocals, music, everything is spot on
B003Q6D2B4|2.0|Cast: impressive. Too bad their talents were wasted here.<br />Story: moves about as fast as a turtle. Bored me to tears. Heavy on the cheese factor.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The installation is super easy, its tiny and it does the job. The only draw back is that I originally purchased it so that I could travel and still access Netflix, and it doesn't work within the few hotels that I have stayed. Not sending it back though. Its perfect!
B007ZB06OW|4.0|this is a great model I like it and it has everything that the ship on the show has it good
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Quite an enjoyable game.  I am really enjoying it.  Not sure if I will buy the full version yet.  Want to get a little further in the game before I make a decision.
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|Awesome. I know my daughter will be super excited on Christmas morning.she just loves Monster high.<br />They are fun to play with. I don't recommend for younger children. The arms and legs come off.(they're suppose to)<br />Also there are lots of small parts, shoes, purses and such that can be swallowed.
B0055S348W|5.0|I have been wanting an app for my kindle fire hd for quite a while. I read the reviews on this app and didn't want to spend $12.95 if it wasn't going to do what I wanted. However, when it went on sale for $4.95, I thought that I would take a chance. It works perfectly with my mobile bluetooth printer as well as as my regular e-printer. Setup was really easy. They have you download updated drivers and something else to be able to print documents and then you just scan for the printer and then select it and when you tap on a document, a window will come up for you to choose which program you want to use to open it. You pick printershare and it is ready to print once you click on print. Works great. Can print from websites, too. Glad I took the chance. It is back to $12.95 now.<br /><br />An Update:  Still love this app.  I have had a couple of updates lately and the only thing that is an inconvenience is you have to download the document file again to print documents.  When you click on a document, and then the PrinterShare icon, it instructs you to download something in order to print the documents.  Never have to do it again until an update, then you have to repeat the process.  Wish it would stay installed so you didn't have to repeat doing it after each update.  Keep finding out new ways to use this.  If you want to print a web page, click on 'share' and then click on the PrinterShare Mobile icon.  Works great.  And I can print my e-mails if I go to the hotmail or yahoo website and print from there instead of from my e-mail app on my kindle (you can't print from there).  Overall, it is a great app and I would highly recommend it!
B004KPLVW2|4.0|they did a really good job putting this on blu ray. if you liked the movie its great on blu ray
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is the exception that sequels are terrible. I loved this book and now would love to read more about Abra as she grows up. This is a must read for fans of a good story as well as Stephen King fans.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I was always a fan of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series but the last two books I read I was very disappointed in. Cornwell seems to have thrown anything into the endings of these books just to finish them. I don't know if I will read any more!
B008JFUPOY|5.0|An entertaining movie for all ages.  Every bit as enjoyable as the first Monsters movie...my grand daughter really enjoyed it.
B00B4804KS|5.0|great 3d effects, sharp picture, good sound, there are so many movies that claim to be blu ray 3d and the only thing about them that is either is the packaging,  and the label on the disk, this is not one of those.
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|I can only tell you that this book spoke to my heart.  This is one of those books where you completely, and I mean COMPLETELY, lose yourself in the story.  You won't hear your name being called and the book should probably come with a health warning because you will skip both meals and sleep to keep reading this story.  I believe everything in this book-the characters, the times and the lives, all touch on aspects of each of our lives today.  There are plenty of reviews describing the story to you-I just want you to read it for your self, you will be so glad you did.<br />This book is for everyone, both youth and adults.  I haven't been a young adult for some time but I loved every page.  I both want to see the movie and re-read this wonderful story.  This is a keeper!:D<br /><br />HIGJLY RECOMMEND!!! :D  :)
0920236251|4.0|GRR. Love this book, foiled again, This book is 3 inches square (as it clearly states) I just wish I had paid more attention. Just make sure you know you are getting a itsy bitsy book.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|i used to love this reader, but the current version doesn't work as well as the older versions i used to use. for instance - there's no dictionary in the current version. i've been looking for a way to revert back to v3.7, a version i know worked, but can't find a trust worthy place to download it.<br /><br />i can't find a way to contact customer service here on amazon either. so the best i can do is try and warn people that the current version of kindle is not an upgrade - you will regret overwriting your older version.<br /><br />something else i've always felt the reader needs is a Back button that would revert you to the last page you were at. if you accidentally loose your place it can take quite awhile to track down your previous location.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|My new favorite Christmas album. I listen to them everyday can't really explain the feeling it brings to my heart. . .
0425263924|5.0|Love the entire Crossfire Series.  If you enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey Series . . . hold onto your bed post.  YES!  You will devour this trilogy regarding Eva and Gideon. Ahhh.
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby is the ultimate in the triumph of style over substance, to the point where the excesses of the movie itself clash strongly against the purpose of the original work.  After the black and white beginning, as soon as color comes in, it is time to leave the theater (and all of your hopes that the film will do the book justice) entirely.  It isn't even the anachronistic Jay-Z soundtrack, the color palette, or even the choices Baz Luhrmann makes in the framing device of writing the story from an asylum.  No, what is lost here entirely is the POINT of F. Scott Fitzgerald's work, which isn't a love story or love triangle, but a metaphor for class and accountability.  This movie has the precise opposite moral from the book.  It turns out if you have enough money to make or sell a movie like this, you are Too Big to Fail and can get away with murdering the classics--just as our antagonists have gotten away with murder in the end.<br /><br />Sad.  Disappointed.  Save your money.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Tons of fun.  I'm a late entry into the world of Candy Crush but have quickly become an addict.  I'm sure there are strategies to use but I just enjoy it as a mindless distraction.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|While it did take me about 15 minutes to get this doll out of the box, it's well worth the wait! She's packaged in such a way that is similar to a display-only collector's doll. Her hair is a wavy magenta ponytail, and her plastic boots snap on and off with pegs. Her shredded skirt is adorned with pink and silver sparkly discs, and she comes with 4 bracelets, a broken mirror 13 necklace, 2 pink hoop earrings and 1 '13' earring. She is an absolutely beautiful doll!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I didn't want it to end...the premise of the book and the narration by Death itself was pure genius. The main character Liesel will touch your soul throughout the book, but her Papa's undying love for her runs a very close second. In fact all of the characters lend themselves so well to the story. Many of you potential readers may think this is just another World War Two story about Nazi's and persecuted Jews but it's much deeper with a bit of that thrown in but how can you tell it without it I suppose. Take the word of an avid reader who loves all types of books that this is worth the read and I had no idea at the time of purchase that it was going to become a movie. Happy reading my friends...
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Needs more applications and system to work with.  If you use everything google then this is ideal for you, otherwise it is just ok.  The only reason I kept it is because when I have people coming over to my place I can stream what I have in my laptop (only if you use Chrome Browser) to the TV and share it with them.  But in general is ok and the $35 won't make you regret buying it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game keeps me up and focus all night. game is very addictive if u anit got this game download it.

B00AFROVQC|1.0|the worst thing for me about this book is the timeline: everything is happening in a few days. It is a shame that a nice story it's not presented in a more consistent manner, this way it feels as if the author is underestimating the readers, not being willing to invest proper time into his work
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is not only addicting but can be very challenging. I am having a lot of fun playing this. Everyone I talk to love this game.
B00CNBS40M|5.0|Shipped super fast and perfect condition. It is just what it says it is. Great for Christmas, son will love it
B00D0OR5EC|5.0|Watching the movie prompted me to read this book. I couldn't put it down. 100x better than the movie. Definitely a must read.
B00BD05PEW|3.0|I usually read the details so I guess it's my fault. I let my son pick it out and I quickly ordered. There's nothing wrong with but I to think it is overpriced for the size. I thought we were getting the large one or I would have never bought it.

It is very interesting and thought-provoking, There are so many twists and turns that it keeps you turning the page, reading the next chapter. Card did a great job of developing the characters, and they are easy to relate to and understand why they do the things they do. Overall, a great book and a must-read for any sci-fi fan!
B005LJK3AC|2.0|When I saw the reviews for this movie, I thought it would be funny to watch but not so. In my point of view Hollywood thinks that if they load a movie with lots of stars the movie will be a hit, in this case not So.  This movie has a pretty pitiful story line, too many stupid gags, what a waste of some often good talented actors.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie and that is too bad because I do like these actors individually. Nice try Hollywood but you should do better by us the movie going public.  This is my own personal opinion.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I like all of Helen's books however I spent the extra money for the audible and let me say that the book is very, very, very boring to say the least.  You know how folk speak of not making sequels and three-quels, she should have left well enough alone.  Not good at all. I want my money back!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It is a fun fighting game it's not much like the consel version but still really fun and cool app
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I got the audio book. it was well read and is a diverting story. It does follow the typical Sanderson format. Some obscure factoid prior to each chapter, and the chapters jump from one character to another. I did enjoy it and look forward to the sequel. I am a sanderson fan.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|First let me say that Denzel is one of my all time favorite Actors.  I have been enjoying his work every since St. Elsewhere.  Very seldom have I been disappointed by his movies, that said, when I started watching Flight I was not so sure I made a good choice.  I kept watching and I have to say I grew to love it.  The story information may be hard to watch for some but it rings very true because I remember the days when some Pilots used to drink all the time in the various lounges in the airports I traveled through.<br /><br />As a matter of fact I met quite a few pilots back in the day and shared a few drinks with them to settle my fear of flying nerves.  These days though I am glad that the Airline industry is doing a better job of helping pilots with their possible addictions.  Denzel portrayed a very likable but Flawed human being who just happened to be a pilot, John Goodman is funny enabling friend and Don  Cheadle plays a great lawyer trying to save Denzel's character. Tamara Tunie is a great Stewardess friend too.<br /><br />Don't want to give away too much but this one is a keeper and good addition to my Denzel collection.  See for yourself.<br /><br />Don't want
B000FC1AGG|3.0|Im using the Kindle reader to read to my while I work and the reader is not really  making it seem so interesting but I'll try to read it without it.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I bought this to trick my Mac-Mini into thinking it had a Monitor Attached to it. This is important for remote accessing the Machine. It makes the screen update smoother because the Mini thinks a screen is attached and use the full Video drivers etc...  All you have to do is short out 2 of the connections on the adapter with a resistor to make this work. There are tutorials available on the web on how to do this.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Personally I really didn't care for this one. I would not recommend it for young children. It reminded me a little of some slasher movies.
B0061US58C|3.0|The original Cars movie was fantastic and I and my 7 year old Grandson really enjoyed it very much.  I rented this second version and it was okay but not a very good sequel in my opinion.  I usually purchase the movies I love but I am going to pass on this one. The storyline was not very exciting, the characters did not appear to be as Good as the first movie at all.  As a matter of fact my grandson lost interest after the first few scenes.  Not a keeper for us.
B000002KE2|5.0|One of early Sabbath's best.  Great example of &#34;downer rock,&#34; with lots of fuzz and doominess.  It's really just pessimistic power pop, hook-laden and rocking.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|again my kids love playing this game so much fun for them, such a great deal for a great game
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This was action packed from the start. It is a unique take on the zombie fad. I liked it so much I bought the dvd.
B006NXIO0Q|5.0|This was a very action packed, thrilling movie to me. One of my favorite genres for movies is action,adventure types like this.  I loved Zoe Saldana in the movie Avatar and this movie was just as Great for me.  It tells a true reflection of how families can get involved in crime and how they can overcome that and come out victorious.  This movie moves at the pace I like and often kept me and my daughter on edge to see what happens next.<br /><br />I recommend this movie and since I now own it I can watch it often, Zoe should be the 1st Woman &#34;Jane Bond&#34;.  Why not?  Can't wait to see another like this, very well done in my opinion
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Put in like 3 hours of game time an  prepare yourself to never put this game down. Top notch, thanks for a gaming gem, Gameloft
B004RJMUJO|4.0|again my kids like this game too, they barely want to share them with each other, i have opened a can of worms  :)
B0040GYAOM|5.0|I love Elvis. This is a very good compilation of some of his best. The sound quality is great. If you like elvis you'll enjoy this set.
1608193381|5.0|A good read. The author transcends his left wing biases to acclaim the benefits of an open market economy. He draws attention to the risks from a completely free market. He puts up good challenges to free market proponents that need to be addressed.
0618680004|5.0|The truth hurts.  For those who really want the truth and have an open mind.  All others need not apply.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|At first I wasn't sure I would really get into this CD, but after giving it a try and letting it sink in for a week or so, I started listening to it on repeat. I still can't understand what the girls are saying all the time, but the sound is addicting. I would describe the sound as indie pop with an 80's vibe. Not party music, but you might dance in your car a little while listening. Love it!
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I really enjoyed this version of Superman. It is a very well done reboot of the saga. Well worth the viewing and I look forward to more in this line. Very reminiscent of the Christian Bale batman reboot.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|I thought it was great and sad also. If all events are equal and close to the truth Lee was a very lonely man who had abandonment issues and Scott although caring in the beginning became as embittered as the rest.<br />Lee gave him the world though Scott could not handle the excessive life style.<br />But that is what Lee was all about.<br />It truly was a love story but was runed by by both people in the end.<br /><br />Rest in peace Lee you was a great showman.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Love the Cranford series; so charming! Wish it could've been longer/more detailed for the ending... but I will watch it again for sure!
B00CL151G4|5.0|My daughter is very much into Sherlock Holmes - the original.  I bought this to see if she would enjoy an updated version.  Not only did she enjoy it, she delighted in making connections between the original story, literary critiques, and the TV version.  We've enjoyed it tremendously and look forward to the next season's release.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Too much bad FX, and the plot is very thin. Not the worst but by no means a great movie. just simply ok.
B0096BIENY|4.0|It's a good vocal group and many of the songs are beautiful. I don't think it's necessary to end every song with that much vocal power. It can sweet and melodic though the end of the song. Overall they are both very nice CDs.
B008OOYALE|5.0|it extremely addicting. I cant put it down. my husband may delete this app soon.  he hares when I play.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As good a as the first book, still as well written and would be well received by many age groups.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I have not bought this game yet.<br />What I have seen and played  so far in this game is very similar to what you find online or the Xbox/PlayStation stores. It's fun,entertaining, challenging, and overall a blast to play. I have to say the download time for this app is long, and weird. It took me two shutdowns and entirely resetting my kindle for it to download and work so be warned. Great game a possible issue for those who don't know what they're getting into.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I am studying Spanish in a total immersion style course. I was looking for something simple and cheap...free... that would make my studies a little easier. This is a great little app. that is interactive in a variety of ways including speech. I am making real progress in my studies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's much better than the movie. It has much more details and very touching. Love it so much. Happy hunger games and may the odds be ever in your favour.
B000000H57|5.0|Even after 17 years, this is still my favorite cd.  It's just a diamond in the rough you rarely come across.  A must buy.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Originally did not really think I would like this one in the whole Avenger Clan group of movies. But it turns out it was much  better than I thought. I also like the technology meets brute 1940s force and weapons as well as political climate then also.<br />Good guys duking it out with Thompson SMGs and ACP-1911s against the foes. Wish they could have that Captain Avenger hammer team work together again also in another movie but this one jumped forward so far in time.... good story however.<br />Note to accuracy enthusiasts below:<br />For those who complain about realism sometimes... hey you are watching a movie about Captain America...It starts out with MARVEL comics! Get over it and suspend your disbelief, the method to which we all enjoy stories and tales.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is a novel. This book is a textbook. This book is a journal. Mrs. Henrietta Lacks should be added to lists of historical figures.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I personally love this movie and I'm so glad that I got it at such a low price and brand new! I would buy a movie from Freddie Highmore again!
B00BEIYMTW|3.0|This is a Disney film, based off a Pixar film, so I had high expectations thinking it would be as good as a Pixar film, or even as good as Wreck-it-Ralph (their other non-Pixar movie recently). This movie was a big disappointment.<br />My nephews got bored within minutes while they can watch Cars over and over again and still get excited each time. I can't even get them to finish this movie.<br />I love Disney and I love Pixar, but this movie was boring and it seemed like the animation team did great, but the story/acting sucked.  Dane Cook was a bad choice for the main character, Fluffy wasn't able to be as funny as he normally is since this was for kids, and the others were people I'd never heard of, nor did I like their voice acting. Teri Hatcher did a good job with what they gave her though.<br />The writing got complicated; I sat there thinking, do they expect kids to understand this? Or do they think kids aren't listening to the words? At one point Teri's character makes an automotive (?) joke that even the other characters in the movie didn't get; there was alot of plane lingo as well as alot of science. Not much humor. I was bored and had to make myself finish it because I was hoping it would get better. It didn't.<br />I predicted the ending after the first few minutes; unlike other Pixar films (and even some Disney films), there was no major plot twist. There was a minor one that was quickly resolved.<br />As long as it looks good, they'll sell merchandise though.<br />Don't bother buying this until it's discounted. I'd recommend renting it first.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|It has taken me many years to finally view this film.  I must say I found Dario Argento's &#34;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&#34;, a suspense thriller (1969), much more engaging/wild and &#34;The Killing of Sister George, (1968), more intense, of course adapted from a play it is much more wordy, something Antonioni eschews (Don't get me wrong I enjoy many movies that employ visuals more than words, i.e.;  Tarkovsky's  &#34;Ivan's Childhood&#34;, heck, any of Tarkovsky's films.  Anyway, I did like &#34;Blow-Up&#34; somewhat, but found suspension of disbelief in two instances difficult.  I think the film and director both over (inflated)rated.  His&#34; L' Eclisse&#34; is a much better film.  His shots of streets/buildings in this film, as in &#34;L'Eclisser&#34;, great (you know the alienation of humans thing).  Anything inanimate elicits his best existentialist eye.  The discovery sequence in the film very well enacted/filmed. Lots of fine sequences that just don't add up to much.  I also think the teeny philosophical thread of perception and reality in the film is just that;  barely tenable.  I guess what I am trying to say is that the film is more hype and not even that fun.  No one in the film elicits any thought, for me of, &#34;I care what happens to her/him.  Still, many great shots and if you don't take your &#34;Sarte&#34; too seriously, digestible.
B008CRC506|5.0|Love this show. Songs are great. So sad It only lasted 2 seasons. Must purchase both seasons! The last episode says it all.
145211207X|5.0|Excellent &#34;art of&#34; book. While the film itself was a minor Pixar effort overall, the artwork is amazing.  Led by the supremely talented production designer Ricky Nierva (the production designer of Pixar's Up, the art team take his cue and creates a world that  is more fleshed out than the original film.  I found some of the set designs  a bit repetitive in the film, but the explorations based on Mr. Nierva's visual themes are never less than fascinating.
B000J233SK|5.0|I totally love Loreena Mckennitt's music and especially love this CD. Definitely recommend Mckennitt's CDs to other Celtic music lovers.
B00FOWX6NM|3.0|Good, but not excelent. Poor material around iphone and no fit well.  Just a basic case. Not protect too much your iphone.
B00ESF285S|5.0|LOVE  this book  reminds me of my daughters. Love Dr. Seuss books but especially this one. A must have book.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This too, was a gift & it was very interesting to anyone that has read or studied the history of our country and Lincoln.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Bought this for my daughter but we both love this CD. This is probably the third time I've bought this CD, we keep wearing them out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game will have you occupied for hours with its many different and frequent rewards for all skill levels and is simple to play  control takes just one finger!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I wasn't expecting the ending.  I more of a hopeless romantic otherwise I would have rated it a 5 stars
B00CXLQG0M|5.0|My daughter got this for her birthday.  Shoots with good power!  Got a great deal on it (I think the price has gone up since) but it was well worth the price that we paid!
0316069515|5.0|Ordered this newest Michael Connelly book for my husband for Christmas. He's an avid fan of Michael Connelly's books, and especially enjoys his Lincoln Lawyer series.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|When I heard Jonathan and Charlotte, they was great....to be so young, I loved their voices....I listen to them every day......
B005L38QHA|2.0|Plugged it in, ran the official software from the Steelseries website. Asked if I wanted to update the firmware, I chose &#34;Yes&#34;. The firmware update failed and now my mouse is bricked. After contacting Steelseries support I am pessimistic about getting this issue resolved. In the future I doubt I will purchase any other Steelseries products based on the shoddy software and poor customer support. It's a shame because this mouse would've had the perfect amount and placement of buttons for my mmo needs.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I actually loved this game. Too bad since the last update I can't load the game any more! When is this going to be fixed??
1490313370|5.0|I caught myself laughing out loud while simultaneously experiencing profound realizations. His irreverent attitude towards the status quo inherent in today's life and business resonate deeply with entrepreneurs like me. I feel like James and I were separated at birth - keep writing and thanks for re-energizing me!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You got to try this game game is not a challenge. But some levels are hard and and some are easy.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh has made a huge impact in turning around my own battle with depression. Having her rainbow colored book make my world better. I enjoy reading it over and over. Highly recommended for anyone who needs to laugh, cry, be happy or sad, or just in general!
0307951529|4.0|I enjoyed reading, the many suggestions, experiences and examples, which are very inspirational.  And it is definitely worth a re-read.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This is a good book, a lot of unexpected twists at the end, can't wait to read the next one, I give this book 5 stars.
0307477479|3.0|Weird? I'm clearly not smart  enough for this book. What was with all the weird diagrams at the end? There was so much jumping around that it was impossible to read in small chunks (which of course I did- and would spend 15 of the 30 minutes before bed trying to remember what had happened before).
B00B47MTZC|2.0|I thought the show had promise, and I love a good mystery/thriller.  But the writers lost me after about two shows: the police and FBI are stupid -- they repeat the same mistake over and over and over -- the bad guys know too much -- practically omnipotent -- and the protagonist never learns a thing.  The creepy \\"following\\" are hollow shells.  And the evil guy has no psychological credibility, even though the writers invoke the stories of Edgar Allen Poe as if that would lend him some.  If you like watching flat, delusional characters, then you might like this show, but I don't.<br /><br />I stuck it out through the season hoping it would improve (have enjoyed Bacon before even in mediocre venues), but when it was over and I realized they were going to try to bring the serial killer back from the ashes, I deleted the season.  Waste of time, money, space.
0316219266|3.0|Got to say this book is heavy going learned some fascinating insights into the mind of Jeff Bezos but at the risk of sounding whiney too a while very verbose so you might want to avoid it
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|I like the music, but the way the songs are separated is not very good.  The beginning of the song is at the end of the previous or vice-versa.
1250012570|5.0|Such a great story. I cried in several parts of the book- it is heartbreaking in the best kind of way. Would recommend for all ages and have already gifted to several people. I expect to see this in several best of 2013 book round ups.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The whole series was disturbing and thought provoking. The final book was appropriately disturbing and thought provoking. It could not have had a sickly-sweet ending because of what the characters had been through. The author provided just the right conclusion.
0804137501|5.0|Gave me plenty of insights and pointers as to how to better manage and develop culture within a remote office company - plus found it valuable in terms of understand how to structure for remote workers from the start.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I like this app a lot. It's great for organizing notes and typing is generally easier than writing if you have problems with fine motor skills including handwriting.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I heard a lot of good things about this game and the general consensus was, &#34;More fun than it sounds.&#34;  After playing it, I couldn't agree more.  It sounds kind of stupid, having only 16 cards, but it's surprisingly fun and has a lot of replayability.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|I was excited to get this game because of the good reviews. However, I was disappointed. The game just starts. Bam! No tutorial or objective was given. I don't even know what to do, or how to navigate.  I deleted it.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I found the first chapter very unique and challenging. However when I tried to continue to chapter 2 the game hung for a minute or two then completely exited out to my home library page. Tried several times to continue on but repeatedly the game exited to. my library. I deleted the game then reinstalled and more of the same. I was able to play through the epilogue which was fun but nothing between that and the first chapter. Called Amazon customer service they're noting the problem to try for a fix and are refunding my money. Don't know if they'll fix it for those of us with 1st generation Kindles though. They seem to think the problem is mainly with the older Kindles. If that's true then disable download ability for 1st generation or warn potential purchasers of the incompatability issues. Even though $2 isn't bad for a game if 1000 1st generation Kindle customers purchased it that's $2000 the developers receive for a product that doesn't work! So anyone having these same issues please call Amazon customer service to report it. That's the only way to get their attention. Good luck!
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|It is a wonderful movie for all ages! This will be a classic just as the first one. The Blu-ray at home is great.
B003UYV08E|5.0|The new Iron Man suit is amazing! This sequel is truly awesome and goes beyond the first! I see why people are so eager to have Stark tech!
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|This game is good. It works just as it says, and has a good tutorial to get you started. I would recommend this game if you want a challenge.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great and easy read for anyone.... If you haven't yet pick up the first and read all 3!!!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|So moving and entertaining!  My family and I have watched it over and over, even after having seen it on the big screen.  It's an unbelievable story!  You won't regret getting it!  We have all his songs memorized, which made going to his concert incredibly enjoyable!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|This 3rd installment absolutely, positively was the best of all! The plot was beyond those of the first 2, and it was a thrill to watch! The concept of the evil taking complete control, yet to have the good still come in and win is spectacular!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|You won't be disappointed by this novel. I read it nonstop and found it hard to put down. Five stars.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|The cable did not fit my kindle model D0111 so/ I returned it for credit.  I am still waiting for information about which cable will fit that model.
B001SKB1Y0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie greatly. It was not difficult spending an hour and a half watching Penelope Cruz, Scarlett Johansson, and Rebecca Hall. A simple plot, the love triangle, filmed in a great setting with great acting. I will admit when Bardem and Penelope were on screen together with Scarlet Johansson; Johansson's acting seemed a bit inferior. Not a masterpiece like Midnight in Paris but still a great movie. I will definitely watch this again and again...
B00EUGYM04|5.0|Seether is one of my all time favorite bands, can't get enough of them!!  Love all of their music!  5 stars!
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Worth buying for &#34;Hot Knife&#34; alone. I'm one of those dinosaurs who still buys CDs and listens to them in the car during my long, horrible commute to work, and albums like this mean a lot to me.  I can lose myself in the density of her lyrics and the lush, playful, darkness of her piano playing and almost forget how bored and stressed out I am.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Love Leonardo DiCaprio! Great film from start to finish! Set in the 1920's Leonardo plays The Great Gatsby! Just Fabulous!
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Wow! I enjoy scary movies and also find it very difficult to find good ones. This one is great. I was genuinely scared for the first time in years. The first few minutes are creepy and just set the mood. I actually had to stop it once and watch some live tv to calm my nerves because I was watching it alone in the middle of the night. Not a masterpiece but worth your time if you like horror.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Cool game. Fun to play. Waste time away. When I'm bored. I'm writing this to get more Yaaaaaay Yaaaaaay<br />It's fun to play
B000002LBH|5.0|Nothing better than this CD.<br />Louder Than Bombs is my favorite Smiths CD. When I hear it my first love is rekindled. Will never listen to it that it does not take me back to that time.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Originally on Facebook, just for the games and initially I played every game Zynga released, until they become too difficult for different reasons. Some needed too many neighbors just to get enough of the requested supplies and when not enough people play its impossible to complete a quest or mission that has a time limit and Then turns out you need the prize from that you fussed over to get and now since you don't have it can't move forward. I gave up on ALL Zynga Facebook games because if the previous was not enough to make you run away, then the fact that the games keep breaking, the graphics too much for most computers to handle unless you have a super charge gamers  system setup. So as far as this game goes the graphics are nice enough but not too much to get in the way or slow things down. It takes way too long to make money and many of the simple tasks take a bit too long to make in time as well versus others that only take seconds. It is a condensed version of castleVille and seems to have many of the same characters but expanding takes leveling up and that is also slow. I have the option that Zynga absolutely DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE, DIFFERENCES, OR THE CONCEPT OF &quot;GAME THEORY.&quot;  I have seen enough interviews to believe that the owner DOES NOT Care that his company's products drives customers away simply because he believes more will sign up to replace them and because they only need 1% of the customer base to make a purchase to keep them in business. Which translates into real dollars as multi-millions.  I tried this game out of curiosity and because it is something to do while waiting for the games I really enjoy are busy doing what they do.  As for those that fuss about not having Facebook it's your choice to not have Facebook. It's easy enough to fix. Step (1) get a free email account there a way too many places to list here, where that is possible. Step (2) after signing up for email, use that email account to sign up for Facebook - then you will have Facebook and can get new friends and game neighbors. On a daily basis tons of people are posting &quot; add me&quot; requests and you never have to talk to them or anything else, it's quite amazing and better yet some may even surprise you and actually be nice people that are worth being actual friends... out of over 600 so called friends on Facebook about 20 are family or friends I actually knew in real life before Facebook the rest have been added simply because of needing new neighbors and about 50 I actually have formed a friendship with. As for the rest I only have contact with via game stuff.  So please stop whining about this in games such as this when you know good and well that is how the games go...  geesh.- then you will have Facebook and can get new friends and game neighbors.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|Think Stephanie Plum and Lula at 100 years old!  Laughed out loud at how even the ridiculous, to some people, can be rearranged to make perfect sense!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I love a Fun, Laugh Out Loud, Sexy Read. This definitely fit the bill, and is worth all of those 5 stars reviewers have been giving it. It's written in the male point of view of Drew. What can I say about Drew: think of Mel Gibson's role from the movie What Women Want. He's that egotistical, sexist male, that has grown up being Gods Gift, and will melt off a woman's panties with one look. He's a complete A-hole!! But we watch with glee, as Kate, the one woman Resistant to his charms, takes him down. There's a great gang of secondary characters: mates and family members, to round out this charming tale. Love 4 year old niece Alexandra, with her Bad Word Jar, which will certainly pay for her College Degree!! Part War of the Roses, the competition between Drew and Kate is Fiery. And so does the ensuring sex scenes: phew, some of the best I've read!! Even the Angst, I still laughed out loud, and Drew trying to get Kate to take him back: hilarious!! Read this with a huge smile. Although this is a standalone with a Very Satisfying HEA, Thank god more books are coming out soon, because I look forward to more Emma Chase.
0689835604|5.0|My son's one of the fav books . I bought it for him when he was 9 months old . He loves the lift the flap book. It's bright colors are very attractive
B00BAXFECK|2.0|I just finished reading The Goldfinch. The beginning is excellent, but the novel goes downhill from there. The plot is good, but the book could have been condensed to 350-400 pages.I regret the many hours I spent reading it. Donna Tartt's characters are essentially stereotypes and  the dialogue (which is most of the book) is surprisingly bad. What 10 year old says, &#34;We're having dinner with the Van Nesses' on Fifth&#34;? or drug addicted twenty-three year old says &#34;Good God!!&#34;? Boris' English is embarrassingly inconsistent. Ms. Tartt's lack of research irritated me as well. She writes of stores that closed years ago, among other things, and her understanding of the antiques market is embarrassingly uninformed. The one thing I am glad about is that Ms. Tartt has called attention to a beautiful painting. If you ever have a chance to see it, do! But, with all the incredible novels out there, this one is not worth it. Far, far better to read Ann Patchett.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read just about all Mr. King's works. I suffer angst waiting for a new arrival but always find the wait time to be just the appetizer for the real deal. I am always amazed by his genius, he just knows how to touch your senses with a mild electrical jolt. God has blessed many people with different abilities but I'm not sure He realized the consequences of the ability he gave to Mr. King, write on Mr. King write on.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|funniest Christmas movie ever! the whole crew of actors make this movie an all time funny, very funny favorite<br />great for the whole family
0679809015|5.0|I fought it for my son when he was 18 months old . He loved the book. I jus read the book to him twice , later he would take the book sit in a corner and make all the animal sounds by himself . The peek a boo animals are a lot of fun and he like to show us where the animal is hidden .
B000ATQYT2|5.0|ok, so I collect versions of A Christmas Carol.  Have all the ones that I could find.  Resisted getting the muppets version because the other cartoon type versions that I had come across in the past were less than enjoyable.  Some I never even watched to the end.  But the Muppets version is, well, extremely entertaining!  And interestingly enough, the dialogue is closer to the original book than many of the serious &#34;adult&#34; versions!  Perfect for all ages.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Having enjoyed Donna Tartt's previous 2 books so much, I was eager to read her third novel. However,  I found that I got a bit bogged down in this one. The first third of the book was quite good, and after that it lost some steam and/or I just lost interest. What I would say to prospective readers is that if you have not read The Secret History, her highly acclaimed first book of some 10 years ago -- read that one first. While she is a good writer and her previous 2 novels were very engaging, this one was a little disappointing. For me the loose ends just did not come together at the end.
B003VANOFY|5.0|It looks sharp and functional enough when I play video games.Cool 7 channels at this price?can't deny my love.well done,Logitech.
0062235893|1.0|I loved the idea of a cloth book and bough this in cloth. The print is not good and looks cheap. More over the blue background doesn't make it attractive for babies. And since the print is bad it difficult for the baby to identify an objects  in the picture.

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I have become so addicted to this game I am tempted to take as star off my rating to punish Rovio for doing this to me. I want more, more levels, more characters, just play this all the time. I even take it to the bathroom, the doctor's waiting room, with me. Yeah, sad, right?
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|It's a quick play but more than worth it. Can't wait for your next game, you definitely have tons of talent for this Nathan, you will have a huge fan base.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This is a decient app. The computer is a bit dumb even on its hardest setting it will make stupid trades. It is worth picking up if you are looking for a good chess app.

0896898288|5.0|This is an excellent quilt book.  It came with good instructions as well as a CD for the templates.  I am looking forward to making this quilt along with several of my friends who are also making their own versions of this quilt.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I really enjoy the game, it is addictive. You definitely need a steady hand and a quick hand. Watch out for the little demos that try to block you.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I’m a country girl. When a story of two investment bankers in the big city has me laughing and crying, you know it’s good. Damn good.<br /><br />Told from Drew’s prospective—a man’s prospective—was fresh and inventive in so many ways. I love the realistic thought processes Emma Chase gives her characters. If you want a positively smoking hot combination of love, laughter and sex, grab Tangled.<br />My blog rating: 5 Hearts ♥♥♥♥♥+
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is awesome. you should try playing this game. I tryed this game and I loved it and I bet you will to.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This Is just an all around great game I've got the Xbox version and its Damn near as good as that
B009NY43NY|3.0|I just felt as if Harris was trying to convince the readers that Eric was such a bad guy in the end. We know that Eric was duplicitous and manipulative, but he had to have cared more for Sookie, based on his actions. There is that implication that Sookie and Eric's other &#34;children&#34; would have made a perfect trio, etc.  He could have turned Sookie into a vampire at any point, against her will, but he doesn't. I think that speaks volumes in his defense. I think about Eric and Sookie's history and romance over the years, and I just don't see how her buddy Sam even begins to hold a candle to their relationship, except that he is much less complicated and she can have a baby with him.  I'll give this book 3 stars because I enjoy the main character and have always been drawn to this series, but Sam?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Most addicting game ever, I'm glad my kindle doesn't know I ran out of lives on my phone. Can't stop playing it!!

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this so much. so much fun. I also love fruit ninjas which are both made by halfbrick studios.
031620157X|5.0|this was a gift for my daughter when she turned 8.  at the time it was a little advanced for her reading level but no problems when we read it together.  the characters are older, i could have waited a year to get it for her, but she enjoyed it and it certainly wasn't inappropriate for her age.  looking forward to getting her the next book when she turns 9.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Kept my attention from beginning to end. Excellent sequel! (And this is my second time reading it!)
B00005JPMZ|5.0|When this movie first came out, I saw it with my nephew, expecting it to be two hours of skateboard and pizza jokes. Movie is actually fantastic with some dark-ass themes going on it, and manages to be pretty serious toned for the majority of the movie. I love the franchise, so I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and figured I should get it on DVD.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Do not buy! The item is a cheap knockoff, not a real Sony Product. Gaming experience is horrible: the resolution of stick control is about half that of the real Sony product. If you like FPS or Driving games, you will HATE this product, because of the complete lack of smooth control. Steering seems to be in 30 degree increments.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|act of valor, that's why only 2 out of every hundred earn the trident. great training and determination. best of the best
0671510991|5.0|Henry Kissinger is adorable. His writing style is dry but manages to hold your attention somehow. This book meanwhile isn't the most engaging read on the planet, but if you need it for a class, it's not too bad.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was torn between 4 and 5 stars for this product. 5 stars for ease of setup and ease of use. I connected it quickly and easily to my TV, and set it up quickly from my iPhone. I can &#34;cast&#34; video easily from Netflix, which is great. No stutter, no buffering, everything runs smoothly. 4 stars for the amount of content available. I really want Amazon Instant Video to be supported. With the addition of this service, it would definitely be a 5 star product. You can't beat it for the price, though, even with this limitation. I'll be taking it on the road with me, since it's so small and easy to hook up. Any hotel with WiFi will now come with streaming movies!
B0018AM1YY|5.0|It's Neil Young! Nothing more needs to be said! Neil and Crosby Stills and Nash bring back memories of an important time in my life.
1781162646|5.0|This wasn't my favorite King book, and it's a bit of a departure for him, but I really loved it. The book is kind of a cross between a pulp fiction mystery and a straight up Stephen King scary story. Plenty of suspense and great believable characters. I like the setting at a closed amusement park and empty-of-tourists seaside resort. It really lent a great air to the story. King builds the story in his usual unhurried manner, then hits you with the tense ending. Very much enjoyed this one, and I'd highly recommend it.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|Too predictable by far. Most of the actors could have mailed in their parts. The first one was much better.
B00C6PT0BC|4.0|The sound quality could be a little better, but it's great to hear a live recording of a Ronstadt show. I've probably seen her a dozen times in concert, and this reminds me of the earlier shows I attended. Although she was never really comfortable on stage, her amazing voice said it all. So sorry that voice is silenced now, but we have this and her other recordings to remember what a great musical talent she was for decades.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO MUCH FUN CAN NOT FIND OUT WHEN NEW UPDATE .I THINK IT SHOULD BE LIKE PC BECUASE IT HAS DOGS AND MODS LIKE MO CREATURES MOD I LOVE IF THEY DO IT MY MOJANG<br />DOES NOT NOT WORK<br />SO<br />THAT<br />WILL<br />BE<br />NICE<br />.<br />:D
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome so far.  Super easy to set up, super easy to use.  I just wish there where more options available as far as what you can sync.  Easiest way to watch netflix at any tv in my house.

B00E8KC5HY|5.0|Mind-blowing ... what an experience! it really sets the standard for any other version. But it will be hard to beat.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Downloaded today and I love doing this.  This is only the second one of this type of game I have ever played.  The graphics are great and I like that you are solving a mystery instead of doing things in a magical fantasy land.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|I'm glad I got this as the free game of the day because I would have been passed if I paid for it.
B00BGIC170|2.0|I thought this movie was horrible. It wasn't funny - more like uncomfortable humor at best. Typical lazy man living with type-A female type humor. The worst part of it was the rampant classicism. Here are things I really disliked:<br /><br />1. I'm supposed to care that these rich people who don't seem to even work might have to move out of their $MM house. She owns a fashion boutique that does $14k a month of sales and doesn't work there. He's trying to produce indie music. They have a huge beautiful house, catered birthday extravaganzas, and cush vacations while they talk to their staff and accountant about how broke they are.<br />2. There are two 'bad' grandpas. One is rich and absentee, the other is broke and always wants money from them. They both almost redeem themselves, but then at the end the rich grandpa is a hero and the poor one is a heel.<br />3. There are two employees at the boutique and $12k is missing. The beautiful Megan Fox who has fancy cars and expensive clothes (she's an escort) turns out not to be the thief. Instead its the poor, Asian, not-beautiful employee who stole the money.<br />4. Just to top it off - this Hollywood writer/director put his own kids in the movie. Nepotism fits in nicely with the classicist theme.
B00EDY5KTA|5.0|For me, an absolute winner--both music and film! I feel that FROZEN is (arguably) the best Disney movie since BEAUTY AND THE BEAST with a score and song score to match. The music is as beautiful as the 3D animation and as memorable as BEAUTY's. I had an interesting thought almost immediately after beginning the film. I remember when I first saw the animated BEAUTY. I left the theater commenting to my wife that that film was custom-made for a huge Broadway hit. The musical is now among the top ten longest running musicals in Broadway history. When I came out of FROZEN today, I mentioned to my friend that THIS film is custom-made for a huge Broadway hit. My fingers are crossed and I am hoping that those plans are in the near future.<br /><br />The two song standouts are Idina Menzel's powerful &#34;Let It Go&#34; and &#34;For the First Time in Forever&#34;, a duet between Menzel and Kristin Bell. I would entirely expect both of these songs to be nominated for an Oscar as Best Song with one of the two actually winning. The orchestral score by Christophe Beck is mesmerizing: the tones swirl as if they were the snow coming down. This is a score which is truly integrated into the movie as a whole.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this soundtrack (the deluxe edition) any more highly. An equal statement can be said about the movie as a whole.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Step aside kids --this is mom's game :) Lots of fun! Not just for the kiddo's, but the parents too! Highly recommended!
B00B3L3RPA|4.0|I would have liked more detail on how he made his monster,; it made the book lack in plausibility. But it was a good yarn, easily read and I would recommend.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Love the game, except it doesn't store prefect games. When you open the app after quitting, all the golden frames are gone, and it doesn't remember which levels you finished on perfect
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is really cool and I go anywhere and play this game I love this game alot I don't know wat I would do with out this game
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I first heard this group last summer and fell in love. I bought this CD knowing that I would like it, but I LOVE it. I would highly recommend this CD from this awesome group!
B004G5Z0AU|1.0|IT DID NOT PLAY IN MY DVD PLAYER!! :(  I was most disappointed.  I did not know that DVDs in London would not work on US DVD players.  Now I know.  Will NOT order DVDs again.  Hope to be returning this DVD soon.  G. Belmont
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|I absolutely cannot get enough of this CD. I just discovered Iron & Wine last summer. This CD is great. I cannot think of any songs I don't like. If you like this group, you will love this CD.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This is a great game. Great sequel with all the possible heros to choose from. Difficulty is intense but still able to conquer with time. But one thing that does suck.... not enough levels! By the te you make it to the end, you still want more! Cannot wait for the 3rd one...
B000FC1HBY|4.0|While I really enjoyed this read, it certainly took me much longer than I was expecting. At times it almost felt like a chore to pick it back up again. It would be nice in the kindle version to be able to easily switch between the story and the appendices because of how complicated these George R. R. Martin stories can be. Since I have already read the first two books on my kindle, I will likely finish the series that way. But if I were to start over, I think I would choose to read hard , if only to help the stories in line
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very informative . Not a surprise that the wealth got rich only because they stole from others like Tesla . Still happening today on Wall Street. I am curious as to what inventions the US took credit for after seizing Tesla's note books etc. Thanks for the read, amazing how history gets distorted by the rich.
B00G91WB3S|5.0|I've read other reviews and am not sure what else I can add to the discussion.  My own personal rating is based on the simple premise...if this was a current cartoon version of Superman would I watch it.  Does Superman have to be Christopher Reeves?  This movie felt like it took the Smallville tv show to the big screen and then up'd it a notch.<br /><br />Henry Cavill is not Reeves.  Reeves deserves his place in Superman lore and history.  Cavill is more like the cartoon visualization but has the ability to bring it to human form.  He reminds me of something between Reeves and Injustice waiting to come out, good or bad.<br /><br />Everything that happened seemed like the action, drama, writing from a Superman cartoon like All Star Superman or Doomsday.  The action was (spoiler if you haven't seen it by now) what I would expect from quasi god figures who can topple buildings, destroy people, and otherwise create mayhem.  There was the love interest which even this story line surprised me despite a similar approach of Smallville television show.  (Spoiler)......................Lois knows...
B00E95ED32|5.0|Bought this based on \\"Wake Me Up\\" and wound up LOVING the entire CD. There are a variety of styles on the CD, not extremely out of Avicii's style, and all are great. Nevermind those poopheads who complain about some country-sounding tunes. They don't know what they're talking about. I, for one, don't mind if Avicii does a little exploring and expanding his wings and range. Can't change, won't change, eventually one becomes irrelevant.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Monsters University...Monsters Inc...Monster fun.  My kids liked the story about (spoiler) Mike and Sulley becoming friends and how Randal became...well...Randal.  There could almost be another story between where Randal turns to the dark side...
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I did the exercises and apparently I'm holding myself back, lol. This book did get me thinking about things and how i interact with those around me.
B0009A21R6|5.0|Excellent surround sound,  depth of music is excellent. sharp and clear.  One of my top 5.1 recordings. Arrived quickly, no issues
B00068TJM6|5.0|I cannot say enough great things about the build quality and upscale looks of this watch. I have the original Seiko flight chronograph (which I still wear) which I bought new in 1990 and it is still a reliable and great-looking timepiece. This watch takes everything great about the original up several notches.<br /><br />I expect that this watch will stand the test of time, just as my first one has (and continues to do). In comparing the two, the screw-in security knobs over the three setting buttons is a plus for the new watch, also the more visible date display (the original has a round dial for the date that's really impossible to see - especially in the cockpit) is a big improvement.<br /><br />I have a relative in the watch business and have compared the Breitling Navtimer to the Seiko numerous times. the Navtimer is more watch in every way. But, this new edition of Seiko's Flight Chronograph closes the gap considerably, to the point where I would question whether the difference in price is worth the difference in the watches (ie Navtimer vs. SNA411). I would say, (i) as a functioning timepiece/instrument made for pilots, that is (ii) also a super-handsome and high-end looking wardrobe accessory - the Seiko is my choice, based on what it brings to the table for the price; but, purely as an investment (assuming you have a few extra grand laying around), paying (much more) for the Navtimer is probably worth it, as the Navtimer will increase in value over time.<br /><br />In summary, for me, this is hands-down my top choice for an aviation watch. Better than the previous Flight Chronometer from Seiko (which has given me 23 years of flawless service - so far). 5 Stars without reservation! Extremely well-done Seiko!
B007QXWV1U|5.0|&acirc;&uml;Works great. &acirc;&yen;Love it. &acirc;&yen;  So many things to do on it. Downloads are super easy. Well worth the &eth;&micro;! &eth;
B00GIZO674|5.0|The game is just as good as the pc version. The game is a bit harder without a mouse but that is expected.
B00B4804KS|5.0|This is a classic movie that has to be in the Blu Ray Collection!! The way they digitally transformed the movie to 3D is pretty amazing as it looks great! Makes you appreciate an already great movie even more. In my opinion a visual piece of art. Glad to have it in the collection, even more so considering I got it for $17.99!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever. Love it. Very nerve wrecking.with Santa clause chasing the graphiti artist is much fun also. I recommend it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game could not put it down! Download it, you won't be disappointed! Loaded with true to life examples of hunting at its finest!
B007RTAR64|3.0|Unhappy with the condition of this product. The barbie box had something spilled on it, that honestly I was afraid to touch. It looked like someone spilled something on it, set their work order on it and it dried. There was torn paper stuck to the &#34;sticky&#34; stuff. I eventually did wipe it off with some scrubbing but with what I paid for this doll, I would have hoped it came to me in better shape.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Gov't Mule knows how to rock! I love the second disc as much as the first, with all the guests singing Mule's songs. Grace Potter shines in &#34;Whisper in Your Soul&#34; and Dr. John sounds so delicious in &#34;Stoop So Low&#34;. Definitely a band to see live, and a great addition to your Mule collection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Not even kidding. I remember when I actually had a life. Now, I just spend all day yelling at my phone and cursing candies that blow up at inconvenient times. I have never hated chocolate more.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|Billie Joe and Norah are amazing on this record! Their sound is so much clearer than the Everly Bros, whom I always felt whined. This is the best way to remember the Everly Bros while also keeping their sound fresh and alive with new, talented voices. A must have CD if you love this style of music.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This is a GREAT movie! Lets forget about the kids for a second (It's a GUARANTEE that they will LOVE this movie), this is fun for everyone!!!!<br />I'm a 50 year old father of two daughters. I found myself recalling feelings I had as I watched my daughters Grow into young women. I have watched this movie three times in the past two months because it makes me laugh. When it's done and the expected happy end comes... guess what? I'm happy.<br /><br />The people who want to compare this with Gone With the Wind, or another, is going to be disappointed. Geez, get some perspective people! It's an animated movie that gives you a chance to relax, unwind, and have a good time.<br />(I think the critics are the same people who believe Dancing With the Stars is an American treasure)<br />Denille
B00FATEJYE|5.0|A great game.  I have it on the iPad , and enjoy it on kindle.<br />I hope they add challenges soon.

B00E1LT41K|4.0|Forget historical accuracy. Done that? Good, because \\"The White Queen\\" has very little, even less so than the books by Philippa Gregory upon which they are based. The sooner you accept that, the more you can enjoy a mini-series that doesn't claim to be anything but a loose dramatization of the War of the Roses, starting from 1464 with the meeting of King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, and ending with the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.<br /><br />The time was ripe for a dramatization of the War of the Roses given the immense popularity of [[ASIN:0345535529 George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones]] and the subsequent HBO television adaptation, for the author has made no secret of how much this period of English history inspired his own work of fiction. In fact, for fans of the books, it's hard not to watch \\"The White Queen\\" without drawing correlations between the two: Henry Tudor's situation is very much like that of Daenerys Targaryen, whilst Robert Baratheon seems to owe his existence to King Edward IV. Cersei Lannister might well be a less-than-kind depiction of the titular White Queen, and even the emblem of the famous rose sigils of Lancaster and York can be found in the fictional Tyrells' standard. It stands to reason that if you enjoy one, you'll enjoy the other.<br /><br />But what \\"The White Queen\\" brings to the table is an emphasis on the women that were involved in the period, namely Elizabeth Woodville (wife of King Edward), Anne Neville (daughter of the man known as \\"the kingmaker\\") and Margaret Beauford (mother of Henry Tudor). Far from being passive observers to the drama, the mini-series makes good on its promise to depict the events from their eyes, and has them right in the midst of the intrigue and violence that characterizes this tumultuous period.<br /><br />Worth noting however is that this is not so much a miniseries about the War of the Roses, but an adaptation of author/historian Philippa Gregory's take on the events in question. Based on three of her books: [[ASIN:1476735484 The White Queen]], [[ASIN:1476746303 The Red Queen]] and [[ASIN:1451626088 The Kingmaker's Daughter]], various plot-points and characters are based on *her* specific understanding of what really happened, a relatively important distinction to keep in mind when you watch. Some historical figures are cast in an unsympathetic light (poor Duchess Cecily gets the worst of it, portrayed here as an embittered old harridan), whilst others can come across as noble heroes or helpless victims. Gregory's rather notorious reputation for distorting the facts to suit her favourites or to increase the levels of drama (seriously, don't believe *anything* you see in this show regarding Richard III's relationship with Elizabeth of York) means that everything seen here should be taken with a pinch of salt.<br /><br />But you could have probably assumed some degree of historical inaccuracy simply by watching. From the perfect skin and whitened teeth of the actors, to the visible drainpipes on the buildings and rubber-soled boots worn by the men, to the inexplicable decision to film the Battle of Bosworth FIELD in what is clearly a FOREST, there's not a huge amount of effort in keeping it realistic.<br /><br />But the main points of what became known as the War of the Roses are all touched upon: the controversial marriage of King Edward to Elizabeth Woodville, the Mad King and the Bad Queen, the on-going warfare between York and Lancastrian households, George of Clarence's execution, the mystery of the Princes in the Tower, Richard's stressful reign as king, and finally the invasion of Henry Tudor's forces.<br /><br />Emerging from the ensemble cast are several stand-outs: James Frain as a scheming Lord Warwick, Rupert Graves (best known as Lestrade from [[ASIN:B00499LTLM Sherlock]]) as the opportunistic Lord Stanley, and Rebecca Ferguson as the titular White Queen, who combines beauty and charisma with steel and fire. Veerle Baetens also has a small but unforgettable role as Margaret of Anjou.<br /><br />For me however, it's Aneurin Barnard as King Richard III and Amanda Hale as Margaret Beauford who really steal the show. Barnard's portrayal of Richard throws him into a far more sympathetic light than what we are used to, freeing the man from the most famous depiction of him as the black-hearted villain in Shakespeare's play.

Barnard's portrayal of Richard throws him into a far more sympathetic light than what we are used to, freeing the man from the most famous depiction of him as the black-hearted villain in Shakespeare's play.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is taking care of real horses for computer people it is amazing I loved it I hope u do too
B005K17RU0|5.0|Used this on a Kindle Fire for a couple years with no problems. Just got a Galaxy S4 and, while the included app was ok, this was my first install! Faster and smoother. Works perfectly. Even found a couple new things - one of which I just had not noticed on the Fire.<br /><br />Now if I could just use it to CHANGE the weather... Maybe in the next iteration?
B0081SRJSY|1.0|Won't let me play, even after restarting my tablet. As a free app of the day, nothing was lost.  Disappointing, since my kids love to play the game IRL, but hate the effort of tracking scores.
B00FLDG52I|3.0|Sad & Disappointing!!! I was going to buy this no matter what because this is some of my most favorite music in the world. The concert and artists were and are amazing. The Allman Brothers Band and Eric Clapton are some of my most favorite artists ever, BUT!!!<br /><br />The Camera shots, shaky Point of View handheld camerawork, camera angles and stupid editing choices RUIN this DVD.<br /><br />I don't like giving bad reviews. I'm just so frustrated when Directors and Editors don't know how to shoot and edit a live music performance!!! I'll speak for me... I want to just see them perform live with a good view of them and the band!! THAT'S IT!!<br /><br />Who is this DVD mostly aimed at? Music lovers, musicians and Guitar Players!!<br /><br />I don't need and don't want fancy, dizzying camera work, ridiculous closeup shots, fast editing, and artsy fartsy crap. One of many examples is a shot of Gregg Allman's Foot on the B3 while Derek Trucks is soloing!!!<br />I love Gregg, but want to see each musician play ESPECIALLY while they are soloing!!!<br />So many times I yelled &#34;Come on!!&#34; to the TV because I want to see the fretboard, guitar player's hands and the artist express himself (or herself) in music and they cut away to a Stupid shot of the audience or another musician who's NOT soloing!! I just don't get it!!!!<br /><br />What are/where they thinking????!!!!<br /><br />&#34;A Concert for George&#34; comes to mind as an EXCELLENT DVD because they kept the shots simple and just let the viewer watch a great show. That's all we want!!!<br /><br />I wish some concert DVDs were reissued with a 'normal, non A.D.D. Edition' or at least give the choice to the viewer which style they want to watch the concert in.<br /><br />There are so many great concerts that have been absolutely ruined (in my opinion). It's Exasperating!!!!<br /><br />I wish someone with similar thoughts could get the word to these people who think they're being 'cutting edge' and artistic to STOP!!!<br />End of rant. I feel a little better, but I still have a ruined concert DVD.  LOL<br /><br />P.S. I wish I could give this 5 stars just to all the amazing artists on this show.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app is amazing. I hate all other keyboards now. I'm a fast typer and this allows me to be fast on my phone too! I've saved so many keystrokes using the predictor. Completely worth the money.
1452126577|4.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend that likes grumpy cat.  It was a nice hardcover book to give as a gift & she seemed to enjoy it.  Great for grumpy cat fans!
0525953728|5.0|This was bought for my husband.  My son is in the Navy and he really enjoyed this book. It was very well written
B00FEHXISA|5.0|This best of all the iron man movies that have come out. Very intuitively made. I enjoyed it in its entirety.
B00AHDXTIK|4.0|Good quality cable but price is meh. I know all legit lightning cables cost a fortune, but that doesn't make the prices ridiculous!!!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great movie. The reveal in the end was the best part. The special effects were great also. I hope more movies like this come out.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Such rubbish. Got sucked in to the popluar culture fiasco. Not worth the paper it was written on. I don't understand how the subjugation and humiliation of women can interest the masses.
0375842209|5.0|I wept through the last pages and could only think of my children.  I was done with the book and again, all I could do was weep and think about my kids.  A haunting tale that rips the soul right out of you and then delivers it right back, only this time life is a little more precious.
B001MTENOC|4.0|Mostly fascinating.  If I thought I were susceptible to hypnosis, I'd love to be one of the author's subjects.  This book is recommended for those who take their spiritual journey seriously.
B003C5FMEE|5.0|An amazing album with a great mixture of rock, funk and jazz. His trombone solos are incredible and the rest of the band is great as well. The berry sax player in particular is really good. He also sings on several songs and does a great job with those as well. The only weak song on the album is &#34;Something Beautiful&#34; which is still better than most of the crap on the radio. Highly recommended.
B00EYRCD8M|3.0|I have the CD, purchase the record for a warmer sound.  Overall the album is great except the 1st record arrived damaged on side two with scratches.  The other issue was side one is very noisy starting on track #2.  Of course Amazon sent a replacement out and I sent the defective one back.<br />The second album arrived with no signs of damage however, after track one on the first side this album suffers from the same noise issues.  Side two is dead quite.<br />Must be a defective pressing.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|This book is amazing. I have read many, probably over 100 different vampire books and liked so many of them, but I've really fallen for the characters, Roman and Shanna, and all the highlanders. It's a terrific read, well written and different from all the others. Hats off to the author, Kerrelyn Sparks for a great couple to root for.
B00F91H666|3.0|Typical Zombie flick there is  a zombie outbreak run from Zombies find cure run from zombies inject cure .. the end..
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I loved this little feel-good read. I was so sad to see Sadie go. Sophie Kinsella has done it again!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the first romance novel that has an incredibly unexpected story line.  So powerful that I was unable to stop, devouring the entire trilogy in under a week.  My only complaint is the complete lack of lull.  As quickly as one climax is resolved, the next is driven into your mind.  Unexpected turns of events, character introductions, and reintroduction keep the reader glued to the pages.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|The best make-out album ever. Douglas Adams agreed. From So Long and Thanks for all the Fish:<br /><br />&#34;She moved forward, put her arms round and kissed him, because the record had got to that bit which, if you knew the record, you would know made it impossible not to do this.&#34;
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Perfect balance of dance and soul and yes it's her most personal date. She doesn't pretend to be Adele and deliver songs catered to her die hard fans for nearly 2 decade. I'm ecstatic and satisfied, you should try and listening to its entirety and you will be pleasantly surprised.
B00D2ZF24O|1.0|Very disappointing. Jaden Smith has his moments, but not ready for prime time. Frankly, I can't take the way he talks. Very distracting.
B0051GOB26|5.0|My husband loves this movie and watches it over and over and over...it is on cable at least once a week but nothing like watching it whenever you want to
B00E9A656K|4.0|Can be played without spending any money.It just takes a while. Very fun and addicting. You only have so much fuel and it takes time or money or friending on Facebook to get more.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Nice addictive game but frustrating.  As you progress it takes more and more coins to get enough DNA to evolve the dinosaurs.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The game is fun, beautiful graphics and challenging to play. It's wonderful that such a cool game is free and can be enjoyed by the entire family.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My family has enjoyed playing this game.  We have spent many hours playing this together!  We liked it so much we gave one to some friends and they have commented on how fun it was.  Challenges both the young and old.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|She writes a very good mystery.  I like the way she blends her stories. I have bought all her books. I watched her whole 8 seasons
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I Loved this book.  Is it perfect?  maybe not, but it is close!  Deep, well- written, worth your time.  Suspenseful, yet had something deeper to say.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When you begin reading Hopeless, be prepared to do nothing else until you finish it. I have read a lot of books, but Sky and Holder have to be some of my favorite characters. The reader begins with one sense of who these two damaged people are, but by the end, you have a totally different idea of who they have become. They went throught such pain and grew together into two incredible people. This book is so much more than a beautiful love story. It can be used to help so many people who may be going through a similar situation. I don't want to say anymore because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't had the pleasure of reading it yet. I can't wait to read more by Colleen Hoover. Hopeless is one of those rare books that stay with you long after you have finished the last page.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Started reading and lost interest.  It came across as fifthy and Vulgar.  If my love one ones/friends found out that I even ordered it I would be embarrass.  Nor do I plan to see the movie when it is available to see
B0027MJU00|4.0|Wow, what a story. Dark Places is very dark in a very good way. I had read Gone Girl and enjoyed it so I thought I should give another of Gillian Flynn's novels a try to see if I liked it as much. I had the same issue with this book as I did with that one, something at the end just was not as good as the rest of the story. In Dark Places there was a chapter that just didn't fit, it didn't read like the rest of the story. It is unfortunate since I was loving it until then.<br /><br />On to the story. It opens with present day Libby. Man she has issues. Yes, she has a horrible past, but she is written in a way that I never feel bad for her or anything. I just watch what she does and think interesting, or just go along with it. She is not a character that makes you wish everything would work out for, that everything would somehow get better and everyone lives happily ever after. I mean she is just living off of the funds well wishers gave her so many years ago, and she always wants her tragedy to be the top tragedy. She has her issues, but she doesn't apologize for them. That is just the way she is. She, and all of the characters in this book, seemed more real than most stories. I did like her though, I liked reading her. The reason why she starts to dig up the past is a little iffy, but I just went with it. I like the idea of the Kill Club and Lyle (who is probably the character with the least issues).<br /><br />The story is told in two parts, Libby present day and the family members in the past the day of the murders. I did enjoy reading the past sections, and how things slowly started to come together to show what happened. Ben does look guilty since he is so angry and detached. He doesn't help himself in the present either so I was constantly wondering did he really do it? It was fun to unravel the mystery slowly and see all the coincidences that filled in the picture of that day. All the simple things that were taken out of context and lead people to believe one thing or another. Very well done. So many details that just worked. It never really felt coincidental or too much, it felt real like this could happen.<br /><br />My only issue with the book was near the end when Libby goes to talk to Polly. It starts off alright, but quickly gets to the really? This is really how you are going to play this? It just got a bit ridiculous. The rest of the story was not so it was sad to see these few chapters which were just not in line with the rest of the story. It felt like they came from a different book. They just didn't fit. Though they do help Libby figure things out, it was too easy. It was like the author didn't know how else she could figure it out so she just kind of shoves it in her face. Even with that I never would have guessed the ending and what really happened in full. It was so crazy how everything just came together in the perfect storm of coincidences to make what happened happen. I never would have guessed it, though afterwards I did look back to some parts to see if I would have paid more attention to certain sections how I might have put it together. Even still I don't think I would have, which is great. I liked being surprised by what really happened, surprised by how the events unfolded. Even though there were a few chapters which were not so good, it still ended on a positive for me.<br /><br />Overall it was well worth the read and I cannot wait to read more by Gillian Flynn. It is hard to find good, dark books and Flynn definitely knows how to write them.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]thing or another. Very well done.

B00CB4ET0K|4.0|It would be an awesome game except it is way too expensive to buy the weapons.  It would be fine if you could buy the weapons NEEDED to pass levels with regular war bucks but in order to get very far in the game at all you have t o purchase GLU CREDITS and the regular player cannot afford to do that, sorry but it loses the attraction if you can ONLY GET SO FAR.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|I think it was well written and kept your attention.  It did tell of the pros and cons of being almost totally disabled but<br />the love story with Will and his caretaker is very sweet and then it lets the reader down with a real thump.  Just when<br />you think he has a reason to live, he returns to his plan to die and then to the readers surprise, he does die.  Then to<br />say, kind of, well it really was ok and his caretaker now is in Paris, becoming more cultured and receiving money from his<br />estate and so that is good. But she would have been better off where she was, with her family, and never having gone through<br />this heartache and he was being selfish when he had every reason to live and share his life with her, even if he did die naturally<br />because his injuries were so serious.  Why read a book that makes you cry for 10 minutes and leaves you depressed.

B001SKB1Y0|5.0|The randomness and plot twists of this movie were consistent with what one would expect from a Woody Allen film, but the casting of some of today's finest actors and actresses (Cruz, Bardem, Johansson) made the exploration of the concept of love feel fresh and interesting.<br /><br />The movie centers around Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson), two New Yorkers who spend the summer in Barcelona staying with one of Vicky's relatives.  On one evening, the girls are having dinner at a restaurant when, by chance, they encounter Juan Antonio (Bardem), a charismatic, womanizing painter.  In short, both women become sexually involved with him, though the nature of each woman's relationship with him could not be more strikingly different.  Vicky is engaged to her loving fianc&eacute; in New York, and Cristina is a perpetual wanderer whose constant restlessness precludes her from commitment.  Vicky comes to Barcelona happy and secure about her upcoming marriage, but a one-night-stand with Juan Antonio leaves her ambivalent and unsure of her intentions.  By contrast, Cristina finds a committed relationship with Juan Antonio that turns tumultuous, and then unconventional--when his ex-wife Maria Elaina (Penelope Cruz) shows up.<br /><br />Though it didn't leave me with any philosophical questions or strong emotions, it was an entertaining film and the backdrop of Barcelona made it visually engaging.  Like many Woody Allen films, there wasn't a clear &#34;moral of the story&#34; here -- just a melange of art, sex, and beautiful women--it is, after all, a Woody Allen film--but I didn't mind.
0316204366|5.0|Whew! Where do I start to convince you to read this thought-provoking, entertaining, page-turning gem?<br /><br />On the title pages of the books I read for these reviews, I usually list 10 to 20 page numbers—with the best stuff I want to talk about.<br /><br />This book: 45 bullet points, all worthy of long paragraphs. It’s pure torture knowing I can’t mention most of them. You gotta read this bestselling book!<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell is a master at his craft with bestsellers like Outliers: The Story of Success, Blink and The Tipping Point.  His latest, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants, is classic Gladwell.<br /><br />He writes, “David and Goliath is a book about what happens when ordinary people confront giants. By ‘giants,’ I mean powerful opponents of all kinds—from armies and mighty warriors to disability, misfortune, and oppression.  Each chapter tells the story of a different person—famous or unknown, ordinary or brilliant, who has faced an outsize challenge and been forced to respond. Should I play by the rules or follow my own instincts? Shall I persevere or give up? Should I strike back or forgive?”<br /><br />In these memorable stories (I’ve already shared half-a-dozen relevant vignettes with colleagues in the last 10 days), Gladwell explores two ideas: 1) sometimes “the act of facing overwhelming odds produces greatness and beauty,” and 2) we “consistently get these kinds of conflicts wrong. We misread them. We misinterpret them. Giants are not what we think they are.”<br /><br />So rather than a dozen spoiler alerts here…I’ll give you a True or False test. Mark “True” if you think the following notes are from David and Goliath.<br /><br />TRUE OR FALSE?<br /><br />#1. In the mid-1950s, Swedish furniture manufacturers boycotted IKEA, angry over his low prices. So in 1961, at the peak of the Cold War, IKEA’s founder did business with manufacturers in Poland—the equivalent today of “Walmart setting up shop in North Korea.”<br /><br />#2. Based on the statistical history of wars—the David vs. Goliath types—if Canada waged an unconventional war on the U.S., “history would suggest you ought to put your money on Canada.”<br /><br />#3. In discussing the relationship between parenting and wealth, “The scholars who research happiness suggest that more money stops making people happier at a family income of around $75,000 a year.”<br /><br />#4.  “The phenomenon of relative deprivation applied to education is called—appropriately enough—the ‘Big Fish—Little Pond Effect.’ The more elite an educational institution is, the worse students feel about their own academic abilities.”<br /><br />#5.  So…where should your kids attend college? Research on college grads concludes that “the best students from mediocre schools were almost always a better bet than good students from the very best schools.”<br /><br />Gladwell divides his stunning findings (told through page-turner true stories) into three parts: 1) “The Advantages of Disadvantages (and the Disadvantages of Advantages),” 2) “The Theory of Desirable Difficulty,” and 3) “The Limits of Power.”<br /><br />More True or False:<br /><br />#6. “We have a definition in our heads of what an advantage is—and the definition isn’t right. And what happens as a result? It means that we make mistakes. It means that we misread battles between underdogs and giants.”<br /><br />#7. In Gladwell’s up-close-and-personal interview with a world class attorney who has dyslexia, the lawyer talks about the advantages of his disadvantages. “Not being able to read a lot and learning by listening and asking questions means that I need to simplify issues to their basics. And that is very powerful, because in trial cases, judges and jurors—neither of them have the time or the ability to become experts in the subject. One of my strengths is presenting a case that they can understand.”<br /><br />#8. George Bernard Shaw once said, “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.”<br /><br />#9. In response to Birmingham police jailing hundreds of children who skipped school to march in the Civil Rights demonstrations, Martin Luther King responded, “Jail helps you to rise about the miasma of everyday life. If they want some books, we will get them. I catch up on my reading every time I go to jail.”<br /><br />#10. A California father, incensed at his daughter’s brutal murder, champions the Three Strikes Law, while a Canadian couple—Mennonites—forgive and move on; “a very practical strategy based on the belief that there are profound limits to what the formal mechanisms of retribution can accomplish.”<br /><br />Business leaders will appreciate this book, but I’m guessing nonprofit and church leaders will love it.  They have “against all odds” challenges most days before breakfast.  So, have we been looking at “disadvantages/giants” incorrectly? Why might disadvantages actually be advantages?<br /><br />During World War II, the Germans pretty much gave up on disassembling a safe haven for Jews in the French mountain community of Le Chambon.  Why? Gladwell says, “wiping out a town or a people or a movement is never as simple as it looks. The powerful are not as powerful as they seem—nor the weak as weak.”<br /><br />I could go on, with another 35 or more mind-grabbing and soul-whacking notes, but I gotta stop. I hope you’ll read this book. Give it for Christmas and you’ll receive appreciative thank you notes. (By the way, all 10 statements above are “True.”)hey can understand.”<br /><br />#8.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is a sick, twisted movie that should NEVER be watched by kinds or those who are light of heart.  With that said, it is one of my fav's.  The unrated version takes it to the next level....OMG.  If you are a twisted individual who loves America, hates terrorists and has a raw, sick sense of humor, pick it up.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Gary....get in the car.
B00EEDNA4M|4.0|Breaking Bad was such an awesome action packed show.  Each show got me more and more interested.  I will probably end up watching the whole series again very soon.  It so awesome..  I love this package deal too.  The only thing i didnt like was the price.  But i had to have it
B004OT8HJO|5.0|I was a lucky one and grabbed this off of Amazon for $109 with prime.  Saw it at Target for $139 and checked Amazon and found it at a killer price.  It is an incredible kit.  The detail is excellent and it took me about 5 hours to build.  When you consider that popular Star Wars figures go for $10 -$20 each, it makes the price even more tolerable. The only improvement I would have is that it should have C3P0 and R2D2 included.  Vader is great......but he isn't a typical passenger on the Falcon  :)
B003YL4L0W|4.0|I'm a bit torn about this one. The characters were compelling (as they invariably are in Picoult's books). However, the inevitable twist at the end seemed to wrap things up far too quickly, and Picoult does not give the reader much information about the fallout of the twist. Characters who played key roles in the story are swept aside, and we have no idea what their fates might be. Without venturing into spoiler territory, this particularly bothered me in Lucy's case. There are others characters I will not name (in the interest of keeping this review spoiler-free) whose &#34;aftermaths&#34; were also missing, and the story is the weaker for it.<br /><br />In addition, although I found the story and the characters compelling, reading &#34;Sing You Home&#34; was a bit like being hit over the head with a rainbow-painted two-by-four. Picoult has a clear agenda here and she makes no pretenses to the contrary. I am a strong supporter of LGBT rights, but I felt like I was being pandered to (and that people who disagree with me were being preached at). It seemed clear to me pretty early on that Picoult was trying to push an agenda here, and that is not always the case with her books (although they do tend to exploit hot-button issues). A more subtle approach might have served her purpose better, and I say that as someone who probably agrees with her wholeheartedly on this subject.<br /><br />I'd give the book 3 1/2 stars if Amazon would let me. I liked it, to be sure, but I had problems with it.
B00AEBB9O6|5.0|This is a great movie.  I had it on DVD but wanted the extra resolution of BluRay and it has delivered.  I never get tired of watching it.....ok, I am going to toss it in quick.  Gotta go.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I almost could never put it down.  Can't wait for more. When does the next book going to be published?
B007REV4YI|5.0|Been a Bond fan for 30 years.  This, in my opinion, is the best one ever.  GREAT to see MoneyPenny and other classic Bond characters get reintroduced into the ongoing series. Also nice to see them show a side of Bond that makes him look a little &#34;old&#34; and tired...but still the coolest guy on the planet.  If you like Bond, you will love this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Danny is all grown up and helping a young girl who's shining is brighter than dan ever thought possible.  King fan must-read!
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|Despicable Me<br />I couldn't maintain an interest so never completed viewing. Didn't have my grandchildren around to see their reactions or input, so I don't know if this is a good movie or not. I watch many children movies, I'm a Disney child at heart. And this is a first that didn't sweep me away.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I love point and click adventure games. story line could use more depth but every good game. graphic were really good.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I served in the Marine Corps 1967-1971,DaNang RVN 1969.A Marine grunt would have truly been 'hell in the Pacific.'in WWII.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game works amazing.g on my kindle fire.. I also enjoy that I can link to facebook or not. love it well done
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It's a beautifully written book! Tears tears and smiles! I love my dogs and I love how Enzo is just like what my dogs are like!
B00003CXBK|4.0|This is, as of now, my favorite Miyazaki piece. This show is about a boy who was cursed with a sort of dark magic. This curse is supposed to kill him and after he is banished from his village, he heads for the source of this curse. He finds a village that relies on making steel and the neighboring mountain forest that wants the villagers to keep out. With the mountain forest wildlife, is a wolf girl who the boy becomes attached two. In the end there is a large battle, but I can't spoil too much because, believe me, it get pretty crazy towards the end.<br />I enjoy the animation quality, and the film gets across the &#34;getting along&#34; with nature theme WITHOUT shoving it down your throat. It was written into the story very well. The characters are likable, particularly the main character, and I could in no way predict the climax. Although the very ending was a bit of a cop out, I'll admit, the entire film is worth, at the very least, a watch.
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|My daughter, granddaughter and I heard this cd while in a little shop in Old Spring TX; it was impossible not to get caught up in the music immediately with it's lively beat and the performer's beautiful voice and 40's style interpretations. Caro Emerald was new to each of us but managed to fully engage three generations of music lovers in this cd - it was love at first beat!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|addicted to this game! ugh!!  thanks!! I can not seem to put it down... I'm not getting a whole lot done after work!! It is so much fun to play! I like that each run seems to be different than the one before!
B003ASLJO0|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  I was upset with &#34;F&#34; word used so heavily involving gang but could not give movie a lower rating.  It was so witty as only Eastwood can do.  I laughed throughout.  I know many old grumpy people who are very nice if one gives them a chance but haven't yet run across one like Eastwood.  He is one of a kind and has given us so much to remember him by.  I will definitely be buying more of his movies and sending to troops overseas after I enjoy them.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This music is a new holiday favorite! I an thoroughly enjoying listening! I think I have some new favorites among the classic Christmas tunes, and also with their new ones!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I didn't think that I would like this game as much as I do by  I must admit that I have  fallen in love with Castle Ville. Like right now I'm supposed to be getting the kids together for school but there are a few things that need to be done on my game first lol.....this game and this kindle are gonna get me in trouble :)
1575666286|5.0|Straight to the point. Easy to follow recipes and enjoyable to read. Well put together for people with limited knowledge on this subject.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I got hooked on this game but am now stuck at a level that I need &quot;friends&quot; help to play. Every time I try and send requests to Facebook they don't send and now I can't play. Booooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!--
B0033AX1YG|5.0|Gary Moore is one of the best guitarist who ever lived.  Was very sad to hear of his death.  This DVD has all his best works on it and I have played it over and over.  So glad I purchased it.
B00GK5WCV4|4.0|Very good. Better than &#34;Lightning Thief&#34;! It's not exact, but it's great. The best scene is the bronze bull scene.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|I was really hoping that this app was the same as it is for Apple, but it's not. The graphics aren't as good, the music isn't the same and most importantly, it's not actually multiplayer! The best part of the iOS version is that I can play against real friends, not computer bots.<br /><br />The gameplay is still fun but having played the other version first, this was disappointing.
0739315293|5.0|Simply a wonderful book. Bryson is always a great read and this maybe his best work yet. He does a fabulous job of weaving various stories together in a coherent and interesting fashion. I will read it again. Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you download you will be addicted soon!  Can't get enough of this game!  It tis so fun to strategize how to play.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|This has to be in the running for the best kids' movie of all-time.  Gorgeous, funny, and with complex, positive themes.
0316789798|5.0|Ed Emberley's guides to drawing are user-friendly. They're also charming and clever, ranging from simple drawings to images with complex details. Lots of room to grow, good fun.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Rio is an underrated movie.  Our two-year-old son gets about 30 minutes a night to unwind with a video that he can pick.  He pretty much always picks Rio or Finding Nemo, ahead of many other options.  I think it's a combination of the bright colors, all the animals, and the music.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very fun, very addictive. I have a hard time stopping because I get so into the game. Great for puzzle lovers or just killing some time
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I considered this rating because I have read the first two books and they were also amazing and this one is just the icing on the cake. So sweet,so perfect, just plain awesome. I really enjoyed this book because at the end of every book you just want to keep reading to find out what's happening to katniss and peeta. I would definitely recommend this to people who really enjoy fiction and suspense  together in one book. You have to read this book!!!!!!<br /><br />  -December 3, 2013
B000SP1SEO|5.0|Fun movie. I downloaded it to work on my accent for an audition and wanted an entertaining way to practice this particular dialect. Worked perfectly and I was entertained while studying. :D
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Pics won't load, constantly being signed out automatically. After I installed the new update I noticed all my games that were connected to this were running slower and couldn't connect to fb so I could access friends. My fb page is loading very slow and sometimes not at all. Very frustrating. Just this morning in the app store there was an update so I did it, went to the page it was still goofy so I went back to the app store and the update button was present again. What is going on???
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Pianist is my favorite game. It's a great deal too. I  love it my daughter Jacy loves it . It's truly awsome
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This book has helped me tremendously over the last 10 years of marriage. I learned how to better communicate with my wife. I always recommend this book to newly married couples.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great story, fell in love with the characters, I really hated finishing the trilogy, with the author was still alive and could keep writing this story.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Jurassic Park Builder is a really fun and addictive game. I really enjoy playing with my Niece's. You get to interact with each other, compare your three parks, send gifts to each other for your parks and it is all free. Ludia has a few things to work out with game crashing, but they are working on it. On the Facebook page they have customer support  for your questions and help pages for more support. You start with land to clear to find DNA, missions to send out searchs for DNA, and then you evolve your Dinosaurs by feeding them and gifts from friends. The more you evolve them the more dino coins they earn and by buying with your coins decorations they earn even more coins. It is really fun to check in and get surprised with gifts from friends, and surprise discounts on items for your parks from Ludia.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and addictive and hard to put down.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love this app. I have it on all of my android and smart devices. Wouldn't go anywhere with out it.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Neat book. Worth reading if you are just looking for the next book to read. I was able to read this in two flights
1909313033|5.0|This book is so funny and pretty accurate.  I got it as a joke gift for my boyfriend and we actually enjoyed reading it together and laughing.  If you have a pug or know someone who does, this is a great little gift for them.  The illustrations are great as well!
B009LDD22U|5.0|Man I love this show! During the Black Fri Sale I was able to get this for under $10.00. WHAT A DEAL!
0345529057|5.0|I love these books. I have been reading them along with listing to them in the car (through audible.com) on the way to work. I love getting a feeling of the entire world that these characters live in through the many different view points. I also like that it is not predictable or cliche as in a lot of fantasy novels. Normally I am more of a science fiction reader (which can also have it share of cliches). Because a lot of the events in the books are loosely based on real history, it has made me a lot more interested in actual history. If you are new to the series or like the show and are interested in the novels I strongly suggest picking up these books and also Roy Dotrice readings through audible.com.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I am rating this for my wife. She wanted me to say it was an ok book. Not the best and not the worst. The authors style was just not for her.
0525478817|5.0|Book was in perfect condition & arrived the day after I ordered it. I read this book when it first came out and absolutely love it.
B004V5QWU2|3.0|Ahhhh it's an ok app. I used it for about a week solid and then it just got to be more than I wanted to mess with. I guess it does what it says
0811879542|5.0|This book is GREAT!!! When I unpacked the book I thought, &#34;Oh no, it's a board book&#34; but it isn't. The cover is in the board book fashion, but the pages are made from paper, well super slick and shiny paper, but paper pages none-the-less. Since it is a gift for Christmas I don't know my five year olds review, but I LOVED IT!  So much fun! It teaches colors, numbers, left/right, how to follow directions, etc. It's a good length book too. I highly recommend this book!!!<br /><br />Pros: see above<br />Cons: not having the book in your collection
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This is a great movie. I didn't think it would be as good as it is. The producer did a great job of making 10 years fit into a couple of hours.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When you have such vivid memories of the first time we met Danny, the thought of a let down bothered me. But once you see him as an adult it closed the circle beautifully! Awesome!  I hope there's room for an Abra follow-up, but I hope he doesn't wait as long!
1452113432|5.0|Rachel Khoo has successfully made classic French recipes easy and achievable for the everyday cook. The book is well written, clear and concise. If you have seen her BBC show of the same tittle, this is a must have book. Highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was the  best it had so many little details that could help you visualize things easily. This book made you want to keep.reading after every chapter their is a cliff hanger which wants to make you keep reading. The worst cliff  hanger was the end of the book. It makes you want to keep reading so in order to you have to get the 3rd book so if you haven't already GET IT!!!!!!!!
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|It was $4 what a deal!  This was another Rotten Tomatoes pick that was right on with 90+ percent fresh!
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I REALLY REALLY hope that the dev is working on an online play mode to be able to challenge friends on a turn by turn basis. This will be rated 5 stars if that were to happen. Until then, it is still a fun game that I will casually play every once in awhile.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|Such a bizarre format.  I really didn't start to enjoy it until i realized it was more a book of short stories. At first I was trying to figure out how these chapters were going to fit together into a novel. But then i realized they were individual stories about a group of people who have had intertwined lives at one point. Then a strange thing happened near the end.  I figured out that the short stories did create a novel.  I found it very well written and loved the journey from Teenage years to Adulthood that it took me on. At first I was confused and lost.  But slowly throughout this literary journey I found my way, and what a pleasant discovery it was.
B00CHVIAS4|3.0|I watched it with my granddaughter.  I have a 3D TV and love spending time with her watching all kinds of movies she's 11.  This was good but I only would watch it once.
B00GNL251C|1.0|I wish I could give a corner of a star....horrible movie....damn subtitled chic flic...they scene that could have saved it, they fought holding a damn cookie....nobody fought....WTH!! People were walking out when I was there....I regret I didn't also...this movie makes my PTSD act up.
B009329ZF2|4.0|3D effects were great!  Story line a bit weak.  Not one I would watch over and over but certainly a couple of times a year.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|i couldn't get the CD out of the case; i had to wait until my resourceful husband came home. he was able to get it out of the CD holder, but it did crack. so, i'm thankful for computers where we were able to get it saved and then burn another disc. i am afraid to play the original one for fear that it will continue to crack and become unplayable.<br /><br />the Piano Guys play music with joy and love for their craft. and wow, does it come through!
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|3D is just ok nothing spectacular.  Story line an old one with a twist.  Kirk and Spock emulate the original characters, which I appreciate.  I don't think I would want to watch this one over and over again.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Ooh my god, this book(while the beginning was a little boring) got SOOOOOO good, can not wait to start the second!!!!!!! Truly amazing
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My six year old grandson has watched it several times and enjoyed it every time. I enjoyed it too, but once was enough. Fits well with some free on line games like Sugar Rush Racing.
B00770KR7W|5.0|Great molding - super detail - excellent product - arrived as expected - great packaging - no issue's what so ever in the overall quality - Amazons posting filters seem to be out a whack here - this is the sixth time I'm posting the exact same review and the filters keep telling me there's a issue with the review ??? weird - great item anyway - highly recommended
B001AX60KU|3.0|Not great quality and there are a lot of repeating themes.  Some of the tracks seemed to sound scratchy.  I was somewhat disappointed.
0375842209|4.0|This book will take you on a journey from a perspective not often portrayed.  My heart felt this one.  I was left thinking about it long after I finished it.
B00GX50ZC4|3.0|I Believe that If someone doesn't know who Steeve jobs was, would not understand anything about the movie. It is a good movie but it is hard to get involve in it
B009LDD590|5.0|I love this series and the fact that it is on blue ray.  I don't have to worry about my DVD scratching and I love the case it comes in too.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Well there was a plot or something, and the ending kinda sucks a bag of dicks nobody cares because the animation in this movie is damn hard to top. The effort clearly shows as even idle conversation between characters is filled with movement unlike tradational anime. Just watch it and go fast.
1439107955|5.0|I bought this book for my mother and she lived it. Easy ready and she read it in just about 3 days.  It tells the truth and is a very interesting book that will open your eyes.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Nice and fun game! You have great battles and you can upgrade your player disfruten este juego est&aacute; muy bueno
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|great product strong feel to it and the speeds are legit. Dont be fooled by a Chinese knock off that wont perform
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun even my 3 year old cousin loves it. On thanksgiving were all constantly planning who goes when. I could play for hours on end. VERY GOOD GAME!!!!!
0062225677|5.0|what a Great start to what promises to be an amazing series... This Book just grabs hold from the First page and keeps you untill the last... my only regrett is that i waited so long To Get it..
B007SGM084|5.0|this was possibly the best trilogy I've ever read.<br />the ending was superb, and I loved every second I was reading, and couldn't bear to put the book down
B008QTVNUI|1.0|Plot was interesting at first, but then there were some graphic sexual scenes. I don't think this is necessary to tell a story. I won't be watching it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|better for if you like blood. love sharks,  and love lots of water games! so I hope,  you in joy this boy and Girl game! if I like it and am a girl that means some girls may too! ( I am not a girlly,  girl) thc bye :&quot;)
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It is a great adaptation of the console game. It also connect s with the console. Wish there was multiplayer. But it it is great no bugs or glitches.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I cheaked some reviews and I look at ever thing it would be great for any size my older brother would like this and hes 15. you may be wi seeing about the bad reviews well you can look for some too. But you could chleack good and bad reveiws and then get it if you see some problems starting to evalve delete it right away! thc for reading my opinion for Nemo's Reef! bye :&quot;)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing. It is just like caring for a real horse. I can not wait to get my next horse.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is pretty good, I try to use it every day, and I'm making good progress. If you are just starting to learn a language, I recommend this app. And then if you still don't have it nailed you can call Rosetta stone.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It was fun at first, but now I see that it is very limited. You can't change skins, so don't even bother buying the skin apps. To play multiplayer locally, you need the space consuming updates. The controls are tricky. Occasionally, I would get a message that said the game stopped working. Out of all these things, being stuck as steve is the worst factor.
B00EXVZZE8|4.0|It's a good game I like the different cats you can use fun costumes you can by with coins yah
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Really like this just like the one that comes with Windows. Great program got it for free but worth buying
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Very tense throughout, well acted and thoroughly gripping account based on a true story.  The romantic element meshed well with the factual account of the climb.  The shots of the mountain are the most realistic I've seen.  This ranks right up there with 'Into the Void'.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's Good But when you slide over it doesn't go but other then that it's really fun and I love it me and my friend always race and we always have competitive.  So other then that it sometimes wont slide you over i say to get it it's really really really really fun!  :)
B00EY7LT9Q|2.0|Stories are dull and the characters are uninteresting. The only exception is Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, Gregg has talent and his character has depth, but everybody else could be replaced without trouble.<br /><br />In short, the series is just not worth watching.
B00BWYX2MG|1.0|Lies lies lies, doesn't work and only messed up your leather gloves even if it's black. I ended up buying one of these touch screen gloves that really worked just fine. Don't buy this product.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Foolishly long. The extra story elements included to increase the film's length are not interesting and ring false. This story could have been a perfectly fine 2 film tale -- making it the same length as LOTR was foolish and ultimately destructive.<br /><br />Mutating the dwarfs into handsome tiny humans was a big mistake. Dwarfs are short and stocky ugly dudes like Gimli. EVERYBODY knows that.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game has it all. Level up your cards to make your team stronger and faster. God's among us has everything you could ask for in a mobile game. All DC characters are here for your beating pleasure.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Scanned over 1000 sildes so far. Scans slides very fast. I can watch TV and scan slides at the same time.
B003IY48PS|5.0|The bluray version of this film is the best quality release of this title to date. Everything is clear crisp and clean.(with some grains) The sound quality is so good that i heard things i never have before. Some of the hoky moments in the original anchor bay release are cleaned up nicely. Meaning that some of the \\"scary\\" moments are actually scary.<br />The anchor bay dvd i have has two commentaries. Bruce cambell solo(in my opinion the very best commentary for this film) and rob tappert and sam raimi. These are both lost in this version sadly. But the commentary in this one is all new with sam raimi rob tapert and bruce cambell all together discussing things they didnt in the dvd version. There are two versions of the film. original widescreen and the updated full screen. both are identicle other than the theatrical bars on top and bottom of screen.<br /><br />This film means something to me mainly because it was shot not too far from where i live and all the locals in that area have some pretty funny facts to share with you if you ask around a bit.<br />If your a big fan of slap stick comedy and horror then you will love all the work sam raimi and rob tapert does.<br /><br />Another great horror movie to check out is Return of the living dead part three. The third stands alone and is in my opinion one of the purest B movie horror there is bside this one.Oh yeah and check out Mutant another great B movie horror.<br />Enjoy this great classic film and dont forget to  \\"JOIN US\\"
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I love this movie to begin with, and already owned the 50th Ann Edition on regular DVD..THEN I read the blu ray reviews. Well..it looks GREAT, and the remastered sound is really something to behold! When my DVD arrived it had a different cover (not the sepia house one shown here), so I thought maybe there was a mix up with the order. It was perfectly fine, in fact I find myself watching it more now than I did before. The high def picture is SO crisp & clear, but it ISN'T perfect. There are a few scratches here & there you can notice, but it's the best this movies has looked. I've seen some Criterion Collection movies where they managed to make them look prestine. The picture looks SOO clear, and the black levels are just perfect- rich & deep..without interfering with the greys. The extras are great also (I'm a fan of extras), many were transferred over from the 2 disc regular DVD edition. There's a new documentary about the new DTS sound, and (after ALL this time, and MANY editions later) they found NEW sound in the track (hint..tweet, tweet)- just a little gem in all of it. The DTS is something to listen do, and considering the age of the film it IS a feat. The audio commentary isn't bad- giving some good tidbits throughout, and was also transferred from the DVD edition. All in all, if you're a fan of the film, please check THIS out. If you're looking for it to be absolutely perfect, you'll probably need to wait for the next Hi Def release, but this one IS something to behold!!
B00003CXFV|5.0|I love true stories, award winning stories, romantic and stories that make me laugh. This story is a true story and it made me laugh. I fell in laugh with it when I first saw and I still  love to watch it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad this is my first time playing candy crush ever I hope to play candy crush pets
0316069515|5.0|The only thing I do not like about Micheal Connelly novels is that he only does about one a year. I purchase, read in a day, then it is over for the next 10-12 months. The Gods of Guilt is a wonderful read, even for those not familiar with Connelly's preceding works. Connelly's writing style is concise and is some of the easiest our there for the reader. You just cannot put it down. I actually started the book while on jury duty, sitting in the jury pool lounge. Fortunately, I did not get called until late in the morning so I got a good start on the read.  I have enjoyed ALL of Connelly&#34;s books and look forward to the next and the next and the next.<br /><br />Thanks Michael, thanks for all the time well spent engrossed in your work.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I used to love this game but once I got to the upper levels I have sat on one level from 3-6 months trying to get past it. Quit playing for a long time then my daughter told me they changed it to where you get free items while playing but the free items don't help. Figure I would give it a another couple of days and if I don't get any farther I will quit again because to me they  haven't done enough to help the game. 3-6 months is a little ridiculous to be stuck on a 1 level.
B008602KQI|4.0|The book is better! The movie leaves so much out because (let's face it) it is not easy to make a film where more than half of what is going on is her thoughts and feelings-which I think are stronger rendered in print. The whole story is told in first person. So all the other characters in the story are told from her perspective-something that does not come out well in the movie.  As a result, it left a lot of confusion to any movie goer that did not read the books.  Still the movie is good.  I just suggest anyone who has not read the series do so before watching the movies.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Game is great for someone who only has time for short visits with a game.  Would have given 5 stars but there is a lot of content you cannot obtain without spending actual money, and not just a few dollars. Still, I highly recommend the game!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Love Star Trek. Casting was spot on!  While I was watching it in the theater I was just thrilled to see how Star Trek was going to have a new life. I have seen this movie several times since its release and I never get tired of it.
0345535529|5.0|These are such a beautiful set of books. They came in a box that will make them display nicely. The perfect Christmas gift for my Game of Thrones fan at home! Great price for all 5 books =)
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Great casting. Great storytelling. I was wondering how they were going to cast Khan and I wasn't disappointed.  I really liked how they have pulled some threads from the older Star Trek movies (thanks to a new timeline) and put them in this one.  I won't spoil it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|totally recommend to any reader _ will read again and can't wait to see the movie ( due out 11/13)
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Too cute!!  I just wish all the song lyrics were included in the game. Great for all ages. I am addicted!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This device comes nicely packaged with all the necessary parts and then some.  As long as know your wi-fi's password it will be easy to set up.  But if you think you're going to be able to stream TV shows which you've downloaded from iTunes on to your iPhone - think again.  You can only stream from apps on your phone (or laptop) and I am still in the process of trying to figure out how to get the TV show into an app so I can see it.  I am going to keep it as it may come in useful in the future but I'm a bit disappointed I can't see the TV show I downloaded from iTunes now.<br /><br />Ok - I'm back again.  I downloaded the Netflix app to my iPhone and lo and behold I was able to watch movies from Netflix on my TV.  Kinda dazzling.  I wish I had had this when I had to watch \\"Orange is the New Black\\" on my Kindle.  I hope they do improve it where you can watch TV shows you've downloaded from iTunes onto your computer or iPhone.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|The DVDs came faster than I thought & was in great shape! I don't watch TV because I can't wait till next wrk to know what happens next!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Very good book. I look forward to reading another one of Liane Moriarty's novels in the very near future.
B008JFUR10|5.0|The only way this movie could be any better is if were a porn. Still fappable if you mute the fight scenes.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|Not as detailed in building the story line of other king and Maxwell stories, but the final outcome was worth the read. I always am able to read non stop because David's books flow and full of drama.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|it is a great and fun game to play it will buy it it has a map foreverything and a hint button it is a great game it shows you wear the stuff goes I can tell it will be a very long game
B005LAII4E|1.0|Horrible film. Pointless and rushed. Never seems to get going and doesn't flow with the first film at all. Waste of time.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Mr. Baldacci never fails in writing a great story. Loved the characters, the humor, and the storyline. My top five favorite author and will be a fan for life.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|Love this series, but this is just to let people know this DOES have Special Features:<br /><br />• The Murder House presented by Eternal Darkness Tours of Hollywood<br />• Behind the Fright: The Making of American Horror Story<br />• Overture to Horror: Creating the Title Sequence<br />• Out of the Shadows: Meet the House Ghosts<br />• Audio Commentary on the Pilot Episode<br /><br />I post this because, speaking for myself, I only really buy blu-rays for the special features, and noticed the page on here says this has none. Hope this helps sway someone in to buying this great series. :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is fun!  it is good for working on your problem solving skills.  I think my kids will like it.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|Just wanted to write in about the Special Features this DOES have. Just like the first season, there's no mention about this having any, but they are:<br /><br />• The Orderly<br />• What is American Horror Story: Asylum?<br />• Welcome to Briarcliff Manor<br />• The Creatures<br />• Deleted Scenes<br /><br />Like I said in my first season review, the only real reason I buy blu-rays is for the Special Features, so I hope this sways people like me in to buying this great show. :)
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This series was fan-frickin-static. I literally laughed out loud throughout this entire series. These books are wonderfully written, with characters that have depth and personality that are unmatched in my opinion. The dialoge in these books is simply amazing, and the ending... perfect!<br />Jennifer Armentrout is one of the best.<br /><br />Thank you Miss. Armentrout for such and amazing adventure. I so look forward to more works from you.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Explained a lot about the new engineered wheat. Now I know why my tummy is bulging. I definitely noticed a difference when I gave up wheat.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|One of the best musicals ever made - inventive music and lyrics, probably the best scenes showcased and excellent production. True in many ways to the actual Guarnier Opera in Paris. We saw it live three times, the third time in London and each one was wonderful.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I always enjoy a book that takes me places where I care about the people at the same time as making me think about life.  While some of the &#34;surprises&#34; I saw coming, I enjoyed how the story made me feel. I was definitely up late reading the story to find out what was going to happen next and have recommended it to several of my friends.
B00C74SHRK|4.0|For anyone who has ever fallen in love with a piece of art, this story is for you.  It is a most astonishing story told through the eyes of am imperfect and loveable character who will make your heart ache.
B00BATG18K|3.0|I liked the movie based on her book &#34;The Joy Luck Club&#34;, so I thought this book would be just as good. It isn't but it's worth the time if you stick with it. Some parts are down right boring and others are suspensful. The subject matter is sometimes overbearing, but I still kind of liked it overall.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|Enjoyed it very much, big fan of Mr. Gaiman's he has written many fine witty books.  My favorite was Good Omens but this runs a close second.
B0016BPWNM|4.0|Fun fantasy for family viewing....good sound and effects.  This is a visually appealing remastering of an old favorite - check out David Bowie's eye makeup.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I really enjoy watch this series.  At first I was not big on watching something so unrealistic, but after the first few episodes, I was hooked.  Now everyone in my family watches the show through amazone on Monday, since we do not have AMC on our TV.
B007STBUIW|5.0|If you love to be scared to death, and lulled by bits of humor along the way to ease the suspense, this is your movie.  It demands the  suspension of disbelief in a ridiculous premise, and you cannot avoid buying into it.  The ultimate beach novel translated to cinema.
B00G6MW68K|5.0|First off, \\"Yes this is a Blu ray/cd for only $14.99.\\" Unbelievable value, especially for what I believe to be among the best live concerts of any band I've ever seen. I've been a Muse fan for several years, and though I love every live DVD they've done, Matt's exuberance has sometimes gotten him into trouble vocally in the past live recordings. Not so here. He seems to be in perfect control through his astonishing range. I watched this concert twice back to back, and plan on watching it again tomorrow. Oh, and to Amazon, I'm sorry I went elsewhere to buy it, but I just had to have it same day. I didn't realize that was an option with you guys until it was too late. Buy it now. Don't hesitate!
B00843TZJ2|5.0|It's great to see this group together through so many years.  They are not as young as they once were, but those of us who remember them when are no spring chickens either.  Perhaps not at top physical form now, they show a depth of feeling that maturity contributes.  I find it interesting that in so extremely youth oriented a culture, talent and maturity still sell well.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Injustice for Kindle is almost as fun as console versions. I just wish the batman card didn't cost so much. But overall it will provide lots of fun.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Stroll down memory lane with an authentic old time broadway musical, before full orchestras gave way to synthesizers.  Classic song and dance
0312117337|5.0|I use this frequently in addition to the rider-waite. It's one of my main go-to deck's. Doesn't work for all questions. When you want to find out the situation or specific details, go to the traditional deck, but when you want to know what you should do, how to approach a problem, with what attitude, go to this one.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|This performance is elegant, witty, sophisticated.  It is a refreshing breath of humor in an often too serious genre.  The voices are all one could ask for.  After seeing it on PBS, I had to have a copy of my own.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The kindle app is great it was easy to download and keeps me up to date on facebook while on the go
B005OCFHHK|3.0|I won't be reviewing the movies but instead Ill be review this 'Collection' box. The audio quality and video quality of the films are top notch and as you would expect from a BluRay film. The disks all come in a double wide 8 Disk case and has a card board slip cover. The cardboard slip cover is very well made, sturdy and has a foil effect thats pleasing to look at. The disk case is also well made, doesn't feel cheap and should last a lifetime. I was disappointed by the disks themselves. The disks were clearly just reused from the standalone titles so they don't feature a unified theme generally found in boxed collections. Some of the disks even say Disk 1 or Disk 2 further showing that the disks were just reused from the stand alone set. I was really disappointed WB didn't take the time to reprint the disks for this collection and it makes the collection feel they didn't take the the and pushed it out the door.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|This is a really great song. It has a nice melody and the piano on this song is great. They are very passionate and I am very happy that I got this song. I highly recommend it.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Cowboys & Aliens, sounds like such a simple premise but was terribly done. I'm a big fan of the Sci-Fi genre and was intrigued by the plot/setting of the movie. It felt like a unique twist on an otherwise generic genre. The cast was top notch and each character was engaging and well casted but the plot is what hurts the movie the most. The plot stumbles around trying to find what path it wants to take before the final moments of the film and it finally settles where it wanted to go. The aliens felt generic uninspiring, and honestly not that threatening and was glad when it ended.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|It's the Little Mermaid for crying out loud. Of course it gets five stars! It came in an expediant manner and worked like any other DVD.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I was extremely excited to get my hands on the set. The show itself is amazing and really well done. The story is engaging full of plots of betrayal and intrigue, and the show is masterfully crafted. Each episode felt like a movie. From the scenery to the outfits every detail was well thought out and planned and it really pays off. When each episode ended I couldn't wait to start the next one and was hooked from the first minute.<br /><br />This boxed set was very well done. The disks are stored in a typical printed card board sleeve and housed inside a box. It felt very sturdy and I have no doubts will last a long time. The detailing on the other box was exceptionally well done. I was very impressed by the quality of this set and have no doubts I'll be picking up any future boxed sets from newer seasons. My only complaint is the lack of DvDs/digital copies that newer revisions have.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I would refer to their music as a little different and definitely interesting.  The lead's voice is a little strange but it works, one of the albums I can listen to in its entirety.
B00GO95TAC|1.0|I cannot rate it since I have not seen it due to the ridiculous price. My kids are impatiently waiting.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|The game works fine, but I was rather disappointed with how easy it was and the simplicity of the graphics. None of the locations had anything hidden or hard to find, and whatever object you were there to retrieve was clearly the only movable object in the room. It reminded me of the old cartoons where all of the background objects were in a slightly different palette from the things that would move. Anyway, the game was so-so at best, tedious at worst.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS IS A HORRIBLE ADDICTING GAME. DONT PLAY UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE STUCK WITH LIFE PLAYING THIS GAME  LOVE IT
0142421375|4.0|I love mysteries and I think Theodore Boone: The Abduction is a great book. It’s about a middle school-aged boy’s best friend, named April, who has been abducted. He feels it’s his duty to find her. I like the book because the author’s style of writing makes you want to find out who abducted April and if she is alive. That’s what makes you want to keep reading the book. I’m nine years old, but I think kids, ages 10 and 11 should read this fun and mysterious book. My only caution is that it might scare younger children.
B001706I5I|1.0|FOR SOME REASON IT STOPPED PLAYING HALF WAY THRU MOVIE THEN I TRIED TO PLAY AND IT SHOWED I NEED TO BUY IT AGAIN. I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS INSTANT MOVIE
0316055433|5.0|This is an exllence book.  It's well written. I have not read a book like this  one in along time. I could not put it down.I am now a fan of Donna Tartt. I will be reading more of her books. I wish I could have gotten an autograph copy. She is a master storyteller.
B000T433CO|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT HOLIDAY GIRL MOVIE. I LOVED IT. I WILL FOR SURE WATCH IT OVER AND OVER.  GREAT SHOW
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|I first discovered Pentatonix from a Facebook share of Little Drummer Boy. I truly enjoyed it then went to You Tube to hear/see some more. Incredible, simply incredible.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book is flat out amazing. It was so interesting and breath taking especially at the end of When You Reach Me!
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love this app. It is really funny. Best talking tom app. Like the other talking tom apps, my talking tom reapets you. Also, at the beginning at the app you get to name your cat.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book came so highly recommended and the summary makes it sound so interesting - it does not live up to the name though.  It bounces around so much it is hard to keep up and does not really smoothly tell the stor(ies) with a clean ending.  I would only recommend if it is very inexpensive and and you don't have anything else to read.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I haven't been able 2 put it down since downloading this game. Good graphics &amp; ads aren't annoying so good work u guys I love it!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wish there wasn't an advertsement before every new game - but for free I cannot really complain - I've become addicted to this game on my phone and my Kindle Fire HD!  You can play as much as you wish and there is NOTHING that ever needs to be purchased to play the game or have a better experience.  THANKS to MobilityWare!!!!
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|There are not enough adjectives to describe these erotic short stories: brilliant, exciting, addictive. Life in Prison was absolutely my favorite. This book is one of the best I have read lately. Well written and engrossing from beginning to end.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|like many &#34;free&#34; apps there are too many advertisements and to really play and enjoy you have to purchase stuff anyway.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Will not connect to HDMI without my Vipre Security rejecting set-up.  Google Chrome &#34;download&#34; wants to include software I don't<br />want...I tried to out-smart the downloads intrusion, I could not.  I will no longer attempt to connect My laptop PC, what an attempt<br />to introduce crap software!!!!!  However, Chromecast connects automatically to my 7 inch Tablet and performs well.  FYI, I tried<br />a different Laptop and the same software, claiming to make my PC faster, intruded again and it took a little skill to remove.<br />I very often use the regular Google site for it's great search capability.  As far as googlechrome, it should be a &#34;snap&#34; for a person<br />with my backround nonetheless, I ATTEMPTED TO CONECT MY PC OVER &#34;60&#34; TIMES including, at times while on the phone<br />with customer assistance.  I give it two stars because the ease in which it connects with my Tablet.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|works great and is much better than having to log on each time!  A must have if you are a Facebook user!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|You're hooked from the time you begin reading.  It's a great story and well written.  It's refreshing to see Jake Brigance back in action.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I enjoy John Grisham.  His heart is in a good place.  The twists make the story a pleasant read.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in justice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The horrors of what humans can do to each other and the pat reasons they construct to justify inexcusable acts must always be recognized and challenged.
B003O86FMW|4.0|One of my favorite books, made me re-read Lord of the Flies, and watch Battle Royale. Katniss is the perfect female character, strong flawed and vulnerable.
B002MT3CIY|1.0|This is a bootleg DVD copied from a VHS tape, you can even see the old static lines at the bottom of the screen from the VHS tape. For you Pink Floyd fans that have seen Delicate Sound Of Thunder, this is the same exact video but re named Shine On. What a rip-off! My Delicate Sound Of Thunder DVD DIGIPAC &#34;which I didn't know was a bootleg too till after I bought it&#34; has a better picture even though it's not an official release. GARBAGE!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|An amazing book thAt is sad and amazing. U Ellen l o 've it no matter whAt  trust me .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It is one I can play alone when friends are busy. But it definitely challenges me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have heard of this book from many friends all saying it was an excellent book. I never knew how great it really was ( those same friends also recommended series like twilight, but as a thirteen year old boy it's not hard to imagine I wasn't into that stuff). This book kind of reminds me of the book thief, both death oriented and both very witty. I enjoyed how the book was kind of a cliche with how the book in the book ended. By that I mean they both ended on a note where you don't know if the character will live or &#34;bite it&#34;, but what you do know is that it was a profound book. This book also showed a lot of the characters maturing and changing throughout the book.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It's a great game. Beware though on the 11th arena, the last battle, Bane is so over powered it's not even funny. Have fun with that battle.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I would have given this app 5 stars if it wasn't for all the ads that keep popping up. Gets old fast, but I do enjoy the app itself - has all the functionality and options I'm looking for when playing solitaire. Just need to check out a couple more of the other solitary apps to see if I can find another I might be happy with that doesn't have all the ads.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game all the family play we compete with each other fab fun for a winter evening<br />You won't be disappointed
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game but have only one complaint...I wish Amazon offered updates as soon as they became available....still waiting on the most recent update that all my friends have been telling me about....still. waiting.
B004UID2LC|1.0|the app only worked for a week, after that it constantly closed. it was a really good app when it worked.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love, love ,love this game... I am so upset ,, it says we've improved upgrade now.. well I can't it's not available through Amazon... this stinks!!!!!!! Now I can't play at all.. this makes me so sad,, I played this game every day,, an sometimes all day!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You know what people, you need to GROW UP. If you like minecraft then why rate it one star? Because you don't get what you want in 5 seconds. Okay parents who want to get this, don't listen to the bad reviews. I'm 11 and I LOVE this game. I have a kindle fire HD and minecraft has everything it is supposed to have. And it doesn't have cars for a reason! It has awesome graphics and is the best game you could ever get. And people be patient. And it's very worth the seven bucks.
B0095G5AFU|3.0|I think this would be a great app if you could print from it. My kids use it for stories and school work but without being able to print it is useless.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I give this review because i find it my consumer obligation. I did not buy this game with any intention of taking it seriously. You do not receive my opinion so do not take this review seriously at all. I am simply tired of the request to rate this game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like seeing how my Facebook friends are doing. And, it helps to give and get extra lives as well as next level tickets.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I think this app should be rated 10/5 stars! I love to type stories for kids like me and when I'm older I would love to make stories for kids all around the world. I also love art which is included in this app. I recommend you ALL to get this app. Love it!!!!! Bye...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game much better than some of the other search games. Can get lost in it for hours! This is my first game by g5 will be sure to get more.
B00GK5X2HC|2.0|Love the books, and I do want to see more films from the series.  This was a somewhat entertaining movie, but a horrendous adaptation of the book.  While the first movie made me run out and buy the books, the second film would never have had the same effect.  It was a horrible screenplay, that is not terribly true to the characters in the books.  Its never a good sign when the book makes for a better Hollywood blockbuster than the movie.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Oblivion is an entertaining film, with excellent visuals, a finely crafted setting, and strong lead character. Tom Cruise does an excellent job as Jack Harper, nailing both action and emotional scenes. The action is a treat, though the climactic shootout is a bit clumsy.<br /><br />If sci-fi tech is a draw for you, there is plenty of drool-inspiring technology in this film - cool ships, cool weapons, the greatest AI drone sound effects ever created, and computer GUIs that can only be described as arousing.<br /><br />There were a few aspects to the story that seemed unbelievable, but actual got explained later on. The plot pulled a few surprises, which was a treat as I went into this expecting a very straightforward story.<br /><br />I knocked off a star because some of the supporting characters (particularly Morgan Freeman) were underwhelming, and the end was too cheesy. Despite these misgivings, I'd recommend it overall if you're a sci-fi junkie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Funny, funny! This book had me laughing throughout. Humor, though, was not so much with the characters or their quips, but at the constant plot twists and cutbacks. I had absolutely no idea which way the maze was going to turn next, but could not wait for the thrill of the next surprise. Read it in about 6 hours or so, and even muted the football game because it was distracting from the book. Not 'literature', but a real hoot of a reading experience.<br />Grisham says no part of any of it is remotely related to anything in reality. But, to my mind, it was much too intriguing and convoluted to be purely imaginary
B0033AI4CK|5.0|Network, the story of a news anchor gone mad and a station desperate for ratings, is one of the greatest films ever made. Halfway between a drama and a black comedy, Network offers an outstanding story and phenomenal acting. This is one of those films where you can utterly lose yourself in the dialog, one of those films that makes you want to say &#34;they just don't make films like they used to&#34;. Few actors in history have been able to hold a scene like William Holden does in this film. Every role is utterly believable.<br /><br />The story is a satirical exploration of the greed, hypocrisy, and sometimes desperation that go on behind the scenes at a television network. This is the height of biting satire, one of those films you'll remember for the rest of your days. This should be required watching for anyone looking to go into the broadcast industry.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent. Being a 70s film, there is naturally some grain, but the transfer is so high quality you'll feel like you're watching the original print.<br /><br />Don't pass up Network. Buy it now. You won't regret it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|It was like Dr. Davis wrote this book especially FOR and TO me!<br />Thank you, thank you so much!<br />I feel like a new woman since I eliminated wheat from my diet :)
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Like all deeply-touching stories I've experienced, I felt a loss when I reached the end.  A fast read, that felt like a lifetime, as the characters became intertwined in my life.  The story is both moving, and poetic...a string of carefully and skillfully selected words...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I only wish there were more rooms. But I really like that the objects are always indifferent places so it's never to easy.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this thinking it would be pretty neat.  Maybe it's my wireless AP but I can't get good quality streaming video out of it.  The video is choppy and it lags pretty bad. I have a good wireless signal with a newer DLINK wireless AP, but just can't seem to get it to work very well.  It was cheap so I'm not all that dissapointed, but I thought it would work better.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Great story and well acted. Besides, I am a sucker for anything that Catherine Zeta Jones is in. I found Jude Law's character having to carry the burden of the piece.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|nice little machine. no bells and whistles, just a player with USB connection for PC. nice that it has continuous play.
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|I have always enjoyed Johnny Depp's work! He is a unique actor who provides great depth to scenes through his expressions as well as his portrayal. That is never more evident than in &#34;The Ninth Gate&#34;. A combination mystery thriller with just a hint of the supernatural that grows during the story to be the climatic confrontations.<br /><br />If you consider the movie for your entertainment just be aware that there are some nudity and sexual situations that really do not detract from the mystery story but certainly must have added a factor that greatly added to Depp's enjoyment while on the job.<br /><br />The story itself tends to do what I consider considerable &#34;over-laying&#34; and that approach causes the audience (in this case, moi) to have to continually sort out who is who and doing what - but of course that is the very essence of mysteries. The story has a touch of the naivety found in &#34;Rosemary's Baby&#34; with the principal character (Depp) being confused by events at every turn while he struggles to succeed in discovering the puzzle pieces and to make the necessary connections to move the story along. At points the story displays turns that really should have called for higher production values than those captured in the film but I am sure the budget and the producers were watching their shekels as always.<br /><br />Again, if you enjoy Johnny Depp's work as an actor this piece will not disappoint. Just remember the sexual content and the crescendo of the supernatural thread. After all, it is &#34;The Ninth Gate&#34;!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Brilliant....I really don't know what else to say... The Book Thief replaced my current favorite book of 10 years The Blind Assassin....Definitely a book of a lifetime
B00COHAUD4|2.0|NOT worth an investment of time or money unless, of course, you are entertaining the teenage grand boys during a weekend visit.
