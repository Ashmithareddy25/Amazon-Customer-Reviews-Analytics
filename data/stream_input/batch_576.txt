B0000AQS0F|1.0|this series while short lived was exceptionally written, directred, and produced. the cast were well chosen and acted out. this series could have gone on for many more seasons, if the studio heads had used their heads. the charactors were just starting to come into their own near the end of the series. this DVD would be worth seeing for any age group and has something for all.
0060194995|5.0|I read this book as a free-read for class, my friends recomended it to me so I said, you know... what the heck I'll read it. and thats exactly what i did... there's not 1 person i know that read the book(all of it) and didn't like it... I think younger kids shouldn't read it though but around 6th or 7th grade is ok. this book made me want to live up to the morals of the book on day-to-day basis. I bet you the world, if everyone in this world used the books morals everyday and every second of our lives the world would be a better place... So yes i'll admit it, and i should say the book started out really slow... but when Scout(narrator) finds a summer-friend the book gets really interesting, i felt like the book was a movie rather than a book... as a 7th grader i think this book should be read by everyone... its a really great book that YOU yes YOU should read!!!!!!! so go ahead, if you think its too historic for you then thats your problem... your the one whos missing out... I am so ready to read this book again(2nd time)... enjoy!!

B00097DXZS|4.0|I thought this was a decent CD.  There were some songs on it that I would listen to over and over again.  Great work, Seor Santana! <br /> <br />One thing about the copy-protected CDs...... hold down the Left Shift button on your keyboard when inserting the CD.  That will stop the install of their program.
B00003CX8U|5.0|I've not seen this movie since it's theatrical release years ago and what a gem to rediscover.  The \\"Take Off With Us\\" dance scene is mesmerizing...eroticism at its best.  You can really appreciate the unique Fosse style.  Also the dance scene between his daughter and girlfriend is charming.  Ann Reinking looks so great in this movie.  I remembered why I would listen to the soundtrack over and over again.  After you watch it, go rent Cabaret, another Fosse classic.  Too bad he didn't live to film Chicago.  As entertaining as that movie is, it doesn't quite have the Fosse stamp it would have had he directed it.
B000062XGK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I have seen it several times and see something new each time. I love Ed Harris so that helps a little. The underwater shots are beautiful. It makes you wonder if there is other life out there watching \\"us\\" destroy ourselves.
B000005RYQ|5.0|I was concerned about purchasing this CD because it was an import, but the songs are the same as you hear on the radio and on other Police CD's.  I love this greatest hits album.  It's a little bit of everything.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I received this product as a Christmas gift.  It worked great after the initial battery charge and I really loved it.  But, after the 2nd charge it started stopping after less than 1 minute of use.  Took it apart, cleaned all the bristles, recharged the battery, it still would not work for longer than about 30 seconds.  I sent it back.  Waited 3 weeks for a new one.  After the first charge it worked great.  But now after the 2nd charge this one won't work either!  Please do not waste your money, this product is defective.
B000000XBC|4.0|Chronicle Volume 2: Twenty Great CCR Classics proves that Creedence Clearwater Revival was not just the great singles band as presented on Chronicle. The tracks \\"Born on the Bayou\\" and their sizzling cover of \\"The Midnight Special\\" are the only songs that still receive airplay on album-oriented rock stations and are among their best work. There are actually a lot of cover songs that work on varying degrees. While the R&B-flavored \\"Night Time Is The Right Time\\", the Southern sounds of \\"Cotton Fields\\", and the rollicking \\"My Baby Left Me\\" work very well, their versions of \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\" and \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" are decent at best. When they stick to their originals, the results are very solid as exhibited on \\"Tombstone Shadow\\" and \\"It Came Out of the Sky.\\" There's also a noticeable rockabilly sound here as shown on the Ricky Nelson cover \\"Hello Mary Lou\\" and \\"Don't Look Now.\\" A pleasant surprise in this collection are the opening \\"Walk On The Water\\" and the scorching \\"Pagan Baby\\", songs which prove that CCR could have been a great jam band if they chose that route. Other solid tracks here include the rocker \\"Born to Move\\" and the melancholy ballad \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone.\\" A few of the songs near the end such as \\"Molina\\" and \\"Lookin' for a Reason\\" showed the band was running out of steam creatively hence their breakup soon after. While not containing as many top notch tracks as Chronicle (what greatest hits album does?), Chronicle Vol. 2: Twenty Great CCR Classics shows that the band was more than just those fantastic 3-minute singles that have found a home on classic rock and oldies radio.
0345403959|2.0|I am really surprised at how well rated this book is on Amazon.  I read it and think it may well be my last Eddings book.  I did like the Belgariad and Silk may be one of my favorite literary characters. BUT, I did get tired of the humor and over all tone of the books.  The humor isn't very original (jokes about wives that you've heard a million times) and is repeated again and again.  Seriously, how many times can some talk about turning someone in to a turnip?  Having said that, I would recommend the Belgariad series as a good read but would stop there.  This book feels like a rehash of the Belgariad series and I just don't think it is dark enough.  Don't get me wrong, I don't want a horror story, but it seems more like a TV show where there are lots of explosions and people are thrown in the air, but they then land on bushes or bails of hay.  There just needs to be some grit in the stories and after the first series, I just can't take the \\"cuteness\\" anymore.  I would read something else........
B00000J7S8|5.0|Since I'm on a small fixed income, I rarely buy cds anymore but I was so pleased when I heard this new (for me) recording from Diana Krull at a friend's house that I had to break the budget. Anyone who has not heard this recording should do so.  Her voice is so fine -- as are the arrangmeents. You'll not be disappointed.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|I'm a huge Floyd fan. I don't like \\"Momentary\\" that much, but the songs from that album played live on \\"Delicate Sound of thunder\\" are excellent. \\"Bell\\" was definitely better than \\"Momentary\\". I wanted to point that out to let the people reading this review  know where I'm coming from, and if they have similar tastes, let them know that this album is not for them. Great production, great solos, but overall slow and boring. Of course there are good songs (\\"The Blue\\" comes to mind), but come on! I want to stay awake! Too many pointless instrumentals and too few  songs (just ONE) that pick up the pace. If you MUST have it- OK. I can't stop you. Just don't listen to it while you're driving.
1931382794|5.0|If you presently train with a power meter on your bike or are thinking of getting one, this is a must-read book.  Authors Hunter Allen and Dr. Andy Coggan are eminently qualified to write this book which is the first full-length book devoted solely to the subject of training (and racing) with an on-bike power meter.  Hunter allen is a full time coach of cyclists and triathletes who uses the power meter as a key element in his training approach.  Dr. Coggan is renowned as a widely published exercise physiologist and is also an avid master's cyclist. <br /> <br />The authors have presented much of the material in the book at seminars around the country.  I attended one of those in 2005 in Sacramento, CA, so I was already familiar with much of the material in the book even before reading it.  Also, much of the material has been presented and discussed in the Wattage discussion list on topica (lists.topica.com/lists/wattage/).  The beauty of the book is that it collects all this valuable information, and much more, and presents it in a well organized manner in one place. <br /> <br />An early chapter describes each of the four major presently available commercial power meters (SRM, PowerTap, Polar and ergomo).  It covers their relative advantages and disadvantages.  The same chapter covers the software that is included with each power meter plus other standalone software offerings including CyclingPeaks which was developed by the coauthors along with Kevin Williams.  Many examples from the book include screen shots and examples from CyclingPeaks but the ideas they convey are explained in the text so no prior knowledge of CyclingPeaks is necessary.  If you are contemplating buying a power meter, this chapter alone is worth the price of the book. <br /> <br />The starting point to train using a power meter is to determine your Functional Threshold Power (FTP).  The book explains several alternative methods to do this.  Once FTP is known, the authors present a system of seven defined training levels.  The explanation of why seven levels are chosen, what the purpose of each is and power and heart rate ranges (where those are appropriate) for each level are given.  The power ranges are expressed for each level as a percentage of FTP.  For example, level 4 is the lactate threshold level with power range of 95-105% of FTP.  The justification for selecting these seven levels (sometimes called \\"zones\\" in other books on training) is the clearest I've ever read on the subject.  The rationale for and benefits of training at each of the levels would be valuable information even to a cyclist who wasn't training with a power meter. <br /> <br />Many novel concepts are introduced in the book.  The concept of \\"power profile\\" is one example.  This involves measuring the maximum power that you can sustain for four selected time intervals - 5 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and FTP.  These are then converted to watts per kilogram.  A table in the book (separate for men and women) allows you to see where you stand on a scale ranging from untrained to world class level.  By determining your own profile and monitoring it over the course of time, you can see better your strengths and weaknesses as a cyclist. <br /> <br />There is simply too much novel material in the book to do it justice in a review of reasonable length.  Just to mention, in the most cursory way, other novel concepts introduced and covered in detail the book are Normalized Power (NP), Intensity Factor (IF), Training Stress Score (TSS), \\"sweet spot\\" training and Quadrant Analysis.  NP and IF are introduced to define TSS.  TSS is proposed as a method to quantify and monitor the total training load that a cyclist carries. <br /> <br />Other chapters in the book tell how to develop a training plan based on power.  Sample workouts and sample multi-week training blocks are given. <br /> <br />If you've gone to the trouble and expense of putting a power meter on your bike, you owe it to yourselfto get this book and read it.
B000B0QJM2|1.0|I guess I shuould've known this was just too good to be true... <br /> <br />I mean; The legendary, all time greatest live album was actually being filmed?!! <br /> <br />Not so. <br /> <br />This is just more hogwash from those \\"experts\\" that made those crappy \\"Critical review\\" and \\"Inside...\\" series earlier on. <br /> <br />No interviews of the bandmembers, no authorisation from the band whatsoever, but the most embarassing thing of all; <br /> <br />No live footage that hasn't allready been released elsewhere. <br /> <br />The footage included on this one, is either from the \\"Live in Copenhagen/Scandinavian nights\\", \\"Doing their thing\\" or \\"Masters from the vaults\\". The only footage that may appear \\"new\\" to some, is Live footage from New York in 1973. <br /> <br />That is, if you only have seen the VHS-verson of scandinavian nights (Live in Copenhagen). On the later DVD-versons of this, all the New York Footage is included. <br /> <br />I will strongly advice any DP-fan to steer away from this hoax, because it is sertainly not what it appears to be! <br /> <br />And finally, if this harsh critique isn't enough for you; <br /> <br />They don't even spend the time entirely on the Made in Japan album, but starts of with the \\"concerto...\\" and move on cronologically from there. <br /> <br />By far the worst, unauthorised product i have EVER seen with the name Deep Purple on it!!! <br /> <br />Or let me rephrase that: <br />By far the worst, unauthorised product i have EVER seen. PERIOD. <br /> <br />Don't support this bunch of idiots any more, by buying their produckts!
B00005JOIF|5.0|A good friend of mine, and a real film buff, tried to talk herself out of seeing this remarkable and courageous movie.  Don't do it!  Forget everything you've read or heard and judge it on its own merit.  Especially with Spielberg at the helm, this could easily have been \\"Avenging Spitzer, Gutfreund, Berger, et al.\\"  Instead, Spielberg and adapters Roth and Kushner grab us by the scruff of the neck and make us appreciate the human and political cost of the kind of revenge killing that Mossad engaged in after Munich, and that Hollywood loves to peddle (see Harrison Ford in \\"Firewall\\" for a recent good example). <br /> <br />My purpose in this review is not to much to evaluate the strenghts and weaknesses of the movie (of which there are both) but instead to convince you to make up your own mind, ask your own questions, and actually see the movie instead of pre-judging it.  We need to get past the manifestly silly arguments that the movie fails to take a stand, or on the other hand that it is insufficiently sympathetic to the Israelis or the Palestinians, depending on one's individual orientation.  The film very clearly takes a stand, both personal and political.  (For Tony Kushner, as we saw in \\"Angels in America,\\" the personal and the political are always intertwined.)  Its stand is that the translation of ideology and/or nationalism into either initiated or responsive acts of violence, always involves a disturbing and ultimately unacceptable human cost.  Wrapped up in this is a remarkable exploration of what constitutes \\"home,\\" politically or personally.  Notice the constant intertwining of references and images of food, companionship, sex, family, and even the amoral nightmare of a \\"family\\" committed to providing its dubious services to the highest bidder, completely devoid of any moral choice.  This, too, is part of the \\"stand\\" that \\"Munich\\" takes.       <br /> <br />One great virtue of the movie is that it never explicitly applies its message to today's situation, in which presmptively innocent people (based on American concepts of jurisprudence) are demoninated \\"enemy combatants\\" based on mere suspicion, and denied access to legal process or counsel.  Please see this month's Harper's Magazine for an excellent article on the incompatability of western concepts of morality and justice with the currently on-going institutionalization and standardization of the use of torture. <br /> <br />I stayed away from \\"Munich\\" for a while because I thought it was a little much that two well-off American jews (I am half-jewish) like Spielberg and Kushner (I don't know if Roth is jewish) were wringing their hands about the cycle of violence in the Middle East.  \\"Munich\\" presents no answers for the current Palestinian situation, and it can well be argued that it is the place of art to raise the questions, not answer them within a convenient 2-hour format.  (If you want quick, neatly-packaged answers like \\"we really can all get aong, as Stephen King argues in the current Entertainment Weekly, then \\"Crash\\" is for you.)  I was unprepared for the philosophical and moral complexity that \\"Munich\\" presents.  Considering Spielberg's penchant for easy emotional release, making this movie was not only a mature decision artistically but a tremendously courageous one as well. <br /> <br />Before seeing this movie, think about the moving speech made by Burt Lancaster at the end of Judgment at Nuremburg:  it is when times are hardest, when the wolf is at the door, that it is most difficult for a society to cling onto its most cherished notions of fairness, decency, and integrity.  The German people, faced with crisis, allowed their government to turn to barbarism and mass slaughter.  Today, faced with a continuous and uninterrupted \\"war\\" on terrorism in which more and more seemingly illegal and immoral acts (wiretapping, torture, detention without trial) are tolerated, what does it mean when our country emulates Mossad after Munich, and engages in actsthat are characteristic of our \\"enemy\\" instead of ourselves?  This is the question that \\"Munich\\" so powerfully and eloquently asks.
0743526937|5.0|I give this book an A+.  I'm taking a class in global business for my MBA and this book was recommended by the professor off handedly.  I picked up the audio book so I could cover the material in my car during my daily commute. Excellent coverage of a complex topic!  I found a lot of similar concepts to that of Covey's 7 Habits.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000XB9|5.0|This cd brought back all of the memories that had slowly eroded, and demonstrated to me that I still knew the lyrics and lived the music.
B00004RYOB|5.0|This movie is a remake of the original one (1961) starring Hayley Mills.    This movie is decidedly more modern and Lindsay Lohan gives a glorious performance- as both Halley and Annie.    However, the plot is a tad less realistic. It's believable that the owner of a California vineyard would send his kid to the summer camp, would a London designer send her daughter to a summer camp in another country?    I don't think so.    The pranks the two play on each other are less mischievious than that of the original, but the ones played upon Meredith Blake are much more!    The story begins when Halley Parker from Napa, CA meets Annie James from London, U.K. at a summer camp. The two become rivals and play pranks upon the other, until the camp director snaps and has both put in an isolated cabin- together.    Remarkably, Halley and Annie are mirror images of each other, as well as share the same birthday. They are allergic to the same foods and Halley has only a dad and Annie only a mother and only a picture of the other parent. When they show the other their other parent, they recognize them and find out they're twins.    The plan then becomes to switch places and get their parents back together.    The plan moves into action even faster when Dad Dennis Quiad announces his engagement to gold-digger Meredith Blake (not the actress's real name.)
0385486804|5.0|So I had to find a non-fiction book for a project in my L.A. class, and in the process of looking f or one my teacher recommended \\"Into the Wild\\". I figured I would give it a chance because time was running out to find a book. I read the cover: \\"In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska alone into the wilderness north of MT.Mckinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He gave $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all his cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter.....\\" <br />   One thing this passage forgot to mention about the book was how inspirational it is. Not by the means of leave your family, house, and things like that just to take a trip up to Alaska; but just get out of the place you are right now and do something you have always wanted to do or see something you have never seen before or go some place you have never been and life live in someone else's shoes. Like i this book Chris (even though he use to be pretty wealthy), lives his life in the shoes of a hobo, vagabond, and a hitchhiker. This book inspired me to want to travel around and see everything i can, and get to know people while i do it. The one mistake Chris did was give up everything, to the point of endangering himself in the wilderness of Alaska. He only had his non-suitable clothes (this is for Alaska), a 22-caliber shotgun, and a 10-pound bag of rice. <br />   I think the reason i like this inspirational story so much is because it is real. This kid really just got up one morning, abandoned everything, and set of for his \\"Alaskan Odyssey\\"; for no apparent reason what so ever. This wasn't so fiction tale, that a author thought of one day while sitting out by the pool, everything in this book really happened to Alex or Chris. This book gives a great description of where Alex went, whom he met, and what he did. \\"Into the Wild\\" follows his life every step of the way. <br />  If you are look for a book to read that is non-fiction full of adventure, the \\"Into the Wild\\" is the book for you. <br /> <br />      <br />
0684824906|5.0|I really enjoyed this book on Lincoln. It shows what you can do when you go for the best people and not the people that agree with you on everything. This book led me to read MANHUNT and also now go back to NO ORDINARY TIME by Goodwin about FDR.
0679721037|4.0|The book \\"Hiroshima\\" by John Hersey is a wonderful work of literature that characterizes and explains the atomic bombing of the city Hiroshima so well that you can almost imagine the whole ordeal in your mind. John Hersey uses imagery throughout the book. Phrases such as \\"everything flashed whiter than any white she had ever seen\\" captivate the reader and make the book interesting and enjoyable. The author also writes in a style like no other. He tells the story of six victims that survived the bombing. He tells the story from their point of view and their experiences. It not only tells of the victim's accounts of the bombing experience, it also tells of how the victims live their lives after the bombing and far after the war. Some victims suffer from radiation sicknesses, and the author tells how they live with it and how they get over it. The book often leaves you hanging skipping from person to person and it makes you want to read the book all in one sitting. The book also creates in the reader a sympathy for those victims of the bombing. As you read the book you learn and feel more and more sympathetic for these people. Overall this book is a great read, and I would recommend it for anyone who is particularly interested in World War II.
B000002KYK|4.0|Vangelis' original recordings for the 1982 sci-fi thriller became mired in legal squabblings and were ultimately not released until years later. In the meantime a secondary source of the film's music was produced, using a conventional orchestration rather than the heavily synthesized sound that is Vangelis' trademark. The result is a warm, rich, highly accessible album that is by turns brilliant and imaginative. <br /> <br />While purists may scoff at an adaptation of an original film soundtrack, there is no doubt that this album accurately reproduces the original soundtrack's epic sweep, from the heavily-orchestrated, dense soundscapes delineating Los Angeles of the future, to the sparse, spare, jazz-based themes of the principal characters Deckard and Rachel. Further, while many of the cuts created by Vangelis for the film are simply incidental material used to background the visual action, the adaptations are extrapolated musically to produce coherent compositions that are musically whole. <br /> <br />The soloists featured in 'Blade Runner Blues', 'Rick And Rachel', and 'Memories Of Green' know their jobs and perform them well. The songs are sentimental and pop-oriented, but hardly insipid, and provide a more intimate interpretation of music that was never fully realized in the film. <br /> <br />The film itself is mired in controversy over its theatrical edit, which has been superceded in recent years by the so-called Director's Cut. This soundtrack adaptation is probably more accurately representative of the film as it was originally presented in theatres, than the re-release with its heavy dose of film-noir pessimism and ambiguity. <br /> <br />I enjoy both versions of the film, and I enjoy both versions of the soundtrack. Afficionados of the film and its music should have both copies in their collections.
B000BT97AO|5.0|\\"Mirrormask\\" is probably not a movie for everyone. It's not simple, straightforward, and it doesn't offer a familiar story or a comfortable visual style. It does not pander. It is a rich, complex, sometimes troubled fantasy that can truly be enjoyed by the whole family, which doesn't mean that it is safe for kids to watch and tolerable for adults -- it means that both kids and adults can find something here to grab onto and explore.<br /><br />Fans of Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean should be well-pleased by their newest collaboration in \\"Mirrormask.\\"  Gaiman's writing is as sharp and clever as ever, and McKean's style of visual storytelling is wonderful to behold in the medium of film.  For those new to the impressive creative engine that McKean and Gaiman represent...let me just say that you're in for a treat.  These guys do great work together, and with \\"Mirrormask\\" they're at the top of their game.<br /><br />Film is a collaborative medium, and Gaiman and McKean were not the only impressive talents here.  15 different animators applied their abilities to different pieces of the film, and it's amazing how well it all comes together. The animation (which takes a featured role for much of the film) is unique and starkly beautiful.  I've seen it three times now, and each viewing reveals some hidden detail or nuance in the animation that I hadn't noticed before. And all of it's just wonderful to look at.<br /><br />The actors also turn in universally strong performances.  Highlights were Gina McKee as...well, in multiple roles, each played to perfection, and Jason Barry as the lovable rogue Valentine. The real star of the show, though, is Stephanie Leonidas, who turns in an amazing performance as Helena, a very modern teenage girl with a troubled family, caught up in a dark Wonderland of new experiences.  She brings an emotional depth and believability to her role that is very rare in most fantasy film, or movies in general.<br /><br />The DVD extras are perfect for those of us who are interested in the creative process of the film, and include a poster gallery for several iterations of posters for the film, a lengthy \\"Making of Mirrormask\\" segment including interviews with Gaiman, McKean, cast and crew, and selections from a Q&A session at the San Diego Comic Convention, and best of all, a full commentary track featuring Gaiman and McKean talking about the process of making the film.  The commentary track is actually well worth the time it takes to listen to it, just for the insights it provides in how a movie like this can (and maybe should) be made on a very limited budget and in a relatively small time frame.<br /><br />\\"Mirrormask,\\" like all stories of this type, owes a measure of debt to other storytellers: C.S. Lewis for the Narnia books, or Lewis Carroll for his tales of Alice and Wonderland. But what really sets \\"Mirrormask\\" apart from there is how the story is told, and the uniquely modern themes it is able to express as a result.  Visually it is a rich, beautiful film, and it has an imaginative scope that is hard to match.  It is rare to find a family film that can really captivate everyone, but \\"Mirrormask\\" does that job perfectly.for those of us who are interested in the creative process of the film, and include a poster gallery for several iterations of posters for the film, a lengthy \\"Making of Mirrormask\\" segment including interviews with Gaiman, McKean, cast and crew, and selections from a Q&A session at the San Diego Comic Convention, and best of all, a full commentary track featuring Gaiman and McKean talking about the process of making the film.

B000059TEQ|3.0|My wife and I purchased the video for a couples Valentine party in our home.  As baby-boomers it was chosen as a flash from the past from when most of us were either dating or first married. <br /> <br />It was both touching and funny to watch this old movie with friends as our perspective is a lot different 30 some years later.  Overall the plot is a bit thin and is a bit implausable and we were not entirely happy with all of the language as Ali McGraw has a rather foul mouth in the film. <br /> <br />Overall, it worked fairly well for our purposes of attempting to capture a \\"romantic\\" film from the past for our group.  I think the concepts in the film appealed more to us when we were in our teens and rebelling against authority than today.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a movie that grips the soul, stirs the emotions and<br /><br />tugs at the heart. I went to see it a couple of times with<br /><br />different people.

I think it pushed the boundaries and preconceptions of what we view love as and or<br /><br />how it should be.

Welcome Home (Sanitarium) is one of my favorite songs of all time by ANY band.     This is'nt just heavy metal; this is MUSIC, brain food, something you can never tire of. To all who bash this album: You're wasting your time. Instead, BUY this album and experience what youre missing.      R.I.P Cliff Burton (1962-1986), Metallica was never again the same without you. :(

B000BEZQ18|5.0|The entire soundtrack from beginning to end is just like the movie: BEAUTIFUL, MAGICAL, MELANCHOLIC, AND VERY POETIC!<br /><br />The scores from the movie are absolutely beautiful. Listening to \\"Brokeback Mountain 1\\" reminds me of Ennis and Twist working together for the first time, getting to know each other. Listening to \\"Brokeback Mountain 2\\" reminds me of the second night they were together after the made love for the first time and tried to deny their feelings for each other; but it was impossible. Gustavo Santaolalla received a much-deserved Oscar for his hard work.<br /><br />The other tracks on the CD are also fantastic. I especially enjoyed \\"He Was A Friend Of Mine\\" by Mr. Willie Nelson. It's such a powerful song, that fits in perfectly with the movie's theme. And I love \\"The Devil's Right Hand Man\\" by Steve Earle, this song reminds me of all the rage and hostility that Ennis had pent up inside; he was only able to get it on in very small trickles when Jack Twist could look deep inside him (where no one else could see).<br /><br />If you enjoyed the soundtrack but have not seen the movie yet, please go see it; you'll be very glad you did. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" has restored my faith in modern American pictures because it is reminiscent of the romantic films made in the 30's where two lovers always stayed together despite all odds. The only difference is these two lovers are homosexual men.
B0007PAMR4|1.0|I bought this DVD thinking I would see all that I saw so many years ago in the movie theatre... The best scenes are edited out, for example the scene where Baron Harkonnen pulls the heart plug on a captive then takes a blood shower - that got cut. Guess someone was offended to see an evil character doing something evil. LOTS of the best scenes are cut. This \\"extended edition\\" is just a lot of trash picked up off the cutting room floor. <br />If you still want to buy this DVD, save some money and I will send you my own (played only one time) DVD, just cover my postage cost. It is NOT worth owning.
B0009X7664|5.0|If you are a fan of Gregory Peck's this is the DVD set to have.  I throughly enjoyed the movie and seeing the man in his personal life on the other CD.  His sense of humor and down to earth style and seeing his family and other live interviews just validated my feelings for the actor and the man. To Kill A Mocking Bird, he admitted, was his favorite movie to make.
B0000029DD|5.0|I had to listen to this CD a few times before I got really into it. But, alot of CD's are like that. His voice is so haunting and filled with emotion. My favorite's are \\"Lilac Wine\\" and \\"Lover, You Should Have Come Over\\". I would definitely recommend this album and would buy it again. His music is reminiscent of some of the music from the 60's.
0895260131|4.0|If the President of the United States would read this book, I would pay for it.  I have found nothing that can't be verified through other sources.  The book is well written, pithy, to the point!  Sadly, the point is the enemy is among us and their agenda is fatal to freedom.  May God bless and preserve America!
B00000JR29|4.0|First off, the sound quality to this remastered version of the album is magnificent ... In fact, I also own the Original Master Recording gold CD, and the sound/volume is notably louder and clearer on this reissue than on the gold! It's still nice to own both versions though, because the gold CD features bonus extended mixes of \\"Shout\\" and \\"EWTRTW\\" (Which includes a fantastic extended guitar solo in the middle of the track), which the reissue doesn't have.<br /><br />I wasn't too fond of most of the bonus tracks on the reissue ... They sounded more like a hodgepodge of sound effects to me, rather than music. It's too bad that, in the space of those recordings, the extended mixes from the gold CD weren't used instead. I did enjoy the mixes of \\"Shout\\" and \\"Mothers Talk,\\" though ... The slowed-down vocal in the middle of both remixes of \\"Shout\\" is hilarious, but I have no idea what he is saying! :) I could take or leave \\"Broken Revisited\\" ... The slowed-down, backwards vocal in the beginning freaked me out!<br /><br />\\"EWTRTW\\" and \\"HOH/Broken (Live)\\" were two of my favorites, because they sounded the most upbeat to me. The beautiful yet eerie \\"Listen\\" was the true highlight for me, because it sounded like the most experimental and surreal track on the album. I love how the synthesisers emerge from the crowd cheering, from the previous track, plus there are loads of amusing sound effects throughout the recording. The song also overflows with beautiful keyboard sounds and the guitars really rock, too! \\"Listen\\" is a creative explosion, and reminds me of something from \\"The Moody Blues\\" ... My brother thought it sounded like \\"Enya,\\" too! :)<br /><br />In my book, the factor of brilliant sound quality outweighs the factor of bonus tracks that I'm not crazy about, when it comes to this re-release. As for the original album, I wouldn't change a thing ... It's a perfect ten by me! :)<br /><br />*There is one interesting tidbid that I wanted to add ... On the gold CD, near the end of \\"Head Over Heals,\\" there are two extra bars of the chorus chanting, before the final lyrics, but I'm not sure if this was material that was edited down for the reissue or looped just for the gold CD release! :), near the end of \\"Head Over Heals,\\" there are two extra bars of the chorus chanting, before the final lyrics, but I'm not sure if this was material that was edited down for the reissue or looped just for the gold CD release! :)
B00003CX8U|3.0|A pretty nice video except for the fact that I found parts of it a little bit lengthy and boring with Fosse going back and forth with his dillema. It was a little cliche at one point , however I do enjoy the fantastic \\"dance\\" involved here and there
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|If you're tired of turning on the radio and hearing some British guy endlessly whining Beautiful maybe it's time to discover something different like Nightwish the best rock/opera group in the world.Nightwish has been making terrific music for years but Once is their best album to date.Combining Tarja Tarunen's strong vocals with heavy matal music and choirs and contrasting her voice with Marco Hietala's harsher vocals every song is an dramatic experience.It's pointless to analalyze each song you just have to experience it for yourself!If I had to pick a favorite song though it would be the thrilling Wish I Had An Angel.If you have even the slightest interest in Goth music Once is a musical epic that belongs in your collection.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|Like Titanic you know going in how it's all going to end so the genius of Peter Jackson(As with James Cameron)is that he makes you care so much about what happens in the end.King Kong may be 3 hours long but it's bursting with so much humor,excitement and emotion that you won't mind.The first section of the movie that focuses on a shifty filmmaker Jack Black trying to get his movie underway is breezy and funny.The 2nd section on Skull Island where Kong must defend starlet Naomi Watts from hordes of creatures is incredibly exciting full of one pulse pounding sequence after another.The final section in a beautifully realized Depression era New York City packs a heartbreaking punch.King Kong works so well because Kong himself is so expressive not just another forgetable CGI creation(Talking about you Jar Jar Binks!)and Naomi Watts' intensely believable performance as the woman who can actually relate to Kong's loneliness and vulnerability.Like Lord of the Rings this is oviously another labor of love for Peter Jackson so King Kong is more than just a fun Saturday night flick.Despite only winning special effects Oscars King Kong is a towering acheivement.A movie with so much creativity and heart it will prove to be an enduring classic in years to come.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Being a big fan of Sinatra I was hesitant about the claims that Michael Buble was the next \\"Ole Blue Eyes\\" and held off purchasing any cds...BUT!!! was pleasantly surprised when I got to hear and watch this performer in action.  There is only one Frank but I think Michael Buble has his own sound which is easy to get lost in.  The man swept me away.  Buy this cd! Buy all his cds! You will NOT be disappointed!
B000E6UK32|3.0|Mysteriously the record company decided to omit \\"X-offender\\" and \\"Presence Dear\\", 2 Blondie classics. Buy the import instead, both songs are included.
B000088E6D|5.0|If I was on a desert island with only three cds I can assure you Michael Buble would be one of them.  His easy style is reminiscent of the Rat Pack days and am glad this crooner has made his mark! If you enjoy the sounds of Sinatra, Darin, Martin, etc., you will not be disappointed and if you've been living under a rock and have no idea who Sinatra, Darin and Martin are, pick up this cd anyway as an early introduction to the \\"classics\\"!

B00005JOFO|5.0|Crash.  A word will live in the hearts and minds of the American and International community that watched this years Academy Awards.  Our community, and others, was hoping to hear something else read when the award for Best Picture was made.  Instead of hearing Brokeback Mountain, we heard a loud and resounding CRASH.  Since the announcement, there has been a lot of debate over the merits of each film.  The proponents of each film are stating their cases, each trying to win over the hearts of the opponent.  But why the backlash?  Why all the drama?  Let us look.<br /><br />Brokeback has been called many things this year.  It has been heralded as the gay community's acceptance in the mainstream community.  It has been heralded as the bridge that will span the gap between the hetero and homo worlds.  It has been called many things and most of them positive... well in our community and a select set of heterosexuals.<br /><br />We have read numerous articles and opinions of people who are self-identified heterosexuals who have called the movie wonderful, uplifting and a new and fresh look into the struggles and life of closeted gay men.  It is a look into a gay community that we do not normally hear about.  The world of the cowboy, gay cowboy, which is never seen nor talked about.  However, was this move a true depiction of this community?<br /><br />More than twenty years after the founding of the Gay Rodeo, is this movie a real portrayal of those men?  Some say yes, while others say no.  They say that seeing this on screen is nothing new to them, and that many of them even struggle to find themselves in the movie, for it is no longer representative of their lives.  They say a lot has changed since the Jack and Ennis years (the movie covered the lives of these men from 1960's to the 80's).  For most Americans this movie represents all their preconceived notions of what being gay is.  We wreck homes.  We are all about sex.  We cannot fight the desires of lust and sin, and instead act on it while breaking up the American Family.  They see the way Jack and Ennis marry and have kids, yet still hook-up for sex every so often.  They do not see the inner struggle.  The turmoil the characters go through while coming to terms with whom they are and whom they love.  They do not see the love that exudes in this movie.  Simply put, they could not move beyond the blinders that they have been taught to wear all their lives.<br /><br />So was America ready for this film to win Best picture. Unfortunately NO!  Nevertheless, one good thing that will become of this is that more Americans will go to see the film.  The buzz behind the loss will fuel the need and want to see the film everyone was cheering on and lost. You know what they say...  the underdog tends to win.  In the end, while Brokeback lost to Crash, I think Brokeback will win.  I know I will keep watching it, and wish I had not spent that 7.50 on a stupid movie like Crash that really did not make any sense.sin, and instead act on it while breaking up the American Family.

B0000027I6|5.0|While one can certainly claim the Wall, 'Momentary Lapse' and 'Division Bell' were more commercially viable, no one who listens to 'Amused to Death' with an open mind can refute that the quality of Waters 1992 attempt beats them all hands down. In some ways, it even gives 'The Wall' a run for it's money. <br /> <br />Loosely based on a book by Neil Postman (Amusing Ourselves to Death), Waters album centers on his perception of humanity during the tumultuous transition from the 1980's era of flash through the Gulf War and ending firmly entrenched in the dismal depression that was the early 1990's. <br /> <br />I personally find it most unfortunate that people feel the need to rate this album based on their perception of Roger Waters and his battles with David Gilmour. A true rating on any record should only be based on the music, lyrics, and contents therein, not commentary of how they judge someone's actions outside of the piece they are rating. <br /> <br />'Amused to Death', like most of Waters work, is not something for the casual listener. If you get this simply to have some background music in your car or ipod while working out, you will never really 'get' what this is all about and you may well not like it. While it has catchy songs that CAN be listened to independently, 'Amused' is not a typical rock album. Unlike most pop albums, 'ATD' does not spoon feed the listener one hit after another, rather it requires someone to sit back and allow themselves to become immersed in the experience. <br /> <br />I myself did not like 'Amused to Death' for a number of years because I kept trying to treat it like a normal record. One day I bought the cd put it in the player, turned off the lights and tried to go to sleep. Q-Sound is astonishing and the first thing I noticed was that sounds from the album were actually tricking my brain into thinking they were happening in real life. I had never noticed it before and I got more interested so kept listening. Song after songand finally at the end I was wide-awake and completely converted. <br /> <br />By the end of the title track I finally understood that 'Amused to Death' is like an essay. It does not make sense to pull the staples out of a multi page essay and read whatever in any order, nor does ATD work well if only one or two songs are listened to at a time. <br /> <br />Some don't get it. Some like the 12 or 13 pop tunes all jumbled together in no real order, so long as the guitar style and vocals are pleasing. Some like it when songs have no real meaning. Before ATD I would have been one of them. <br /> <br />It requires a bit of effort. It requires one to allow themselves the time to listen to it, but also I can honestly say that if anybody who can appreciate Pink Floyd tried ATD in that way, they'd never look back!

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|My goodness, most of the negativity about this movie is coming from die-hard BBC-adaption fans. The same people playing Nancy Drew regarding historical inaccuracies(and half of their criticisms are uninformed or misinformed by other period pieces) don't seem to be using the same critical eye to the BBC adaption, which is incredible but has it's inaccuracies as well.    If you go into this movie with an open and flexible mind,keeping in mind how the medium of cinema and the medium of television will make COMPLETELY different products(and thank goodness-I didn't want a carbon copy of the BBC version), you'll enjoy it. It does take some artistic liberties, it does condense alot of the story, and it's take is less pretti-fied than most people are use to(compare this version to the more realistic and I think best Austen adaption to date-\\"PErsuasion\\"), but what I loved most about it is that it \\"got\\" the spirit of the novel, and from that spirit, made new moments to enjoy(the first proposal? great!).    And just a side note---if you don't think Colin Firth isn't happy as can be to have someone else tagged as \\"Mr. DarcY' after 10 years, you are delusional!He's probably thanking his lucky stars....
B000E8N690|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are both wonderful in the roles of Johnny Cash and June Carter. This is basically a film about their relatonship viewed through the lense of Cash's career and struggles with family and drug abuse. The film is extraordinarily entertaining from beginning to end and the musical sequences are very well done. Both actors deserve a lot of credit for doing the singing and making the performance sequences realistic. No doubt Witherspoon deserved her Oscar and Phoenix was equally deserving in a tough field.<br /><br />Having seen Capote and this I think it would be a close call but I'd have given the award to Phoenix.<br /><br />Overall this is an uplifting story about a love between two people who were obvious soulmates and survived in an environment that makes long term marriages a challenge at best. Very enjoyable film.

0399245030|5.0|Oliver Jeffer's second book has become one of my favorite picture books ever.  I recommend this for children and adults.  This is a story of a boy and the penguin he finds on his doorstep.  Assuming he is lost, the boy attempts to return him to the South Pole.  After a long and dangerous adventure, the boy realizes that the penguin was not lost-- he was lonely and looking for a friend.  Just flip to end of this book and look at the two of them hugging.  Its the cutest dang 'ol thing ever.
B00005MP58|4.0|There is not much to be said about this version of the classic Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that hasn't been said before. It's quite faithful to the book, it's an exquisite production and it has Colin Firth, who provides enough visual delight for the ladies watching.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|My gosh, the special effects in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen!! The freeway pursuit scene is amazing and brilliant--it looks so real and I believe part of it was actually done in real life as well. That one action sequence alone is a reason to purchase The Matrix Reloaded in my opinion--it's superb. The movie is packed full of stunning (and I mean stunning!) visuals, a creative plotline, great acting and thoughtful introspection. DEFINITIVE--better than the other two (I think). I just can't get over how amazing the freeway chase scene is, from car leaping to the semis colliding. Amazing.
1558216847|5.0|This book made me put my life on hold for one day until I read it cover to cover. Very seldom have I ever encountered a book that can make me want to read it from start to finish and just escape from the world until I have finished it. After completing it, I then had to ask myself if everthing in the book was 100% true as written. I am sure there had to be a few little exaggerations in some of the events to make it extra dramatic, but I am sure this story is basically true. This book will leave a great impression on all readers. I can not believe this book has not been made into a movie. Of course, Hollywood would take away most of the truth of the story if it did turn it into a movie but still it could be a great movie.
0975991477|2.0|I bought this book because I was under the impression it had to do with \\"unleashing the power of consciousness, matter and miracles\\" achieved through your beliefs.  Page after page, chapter after chapter I'm thinking...\\"When do we get to the part about how to change our beliefs?\\"  All kinds of data regarding how cells work, a smidgen about how early childhood programming effects us through our sub-conscious.  A little bit about how we are all one, sprinkled with a little spirituality.  Well, thank God for the \\"Addendum\\" starting on pg 203 where you are directed to Rob Williams' \\"Psych-K\\" as the means for meaningful change, otherwise this book was nothing more than a personal dissertation regarding \\"the Biology of Cells.\\"  I feel the title of the book is highly mis-leading.
0451196716|1.0|My complaint against Stephen King, whom I normally like his work is that he could not be original enough to come up with a title for this book that was not already used by another author (Rawicz) in 1956 on a subject that had nothing to do with this book. My message for any author of books, movies, or even song writers, Never create a piece of work and use a title for it that was already used by somebody else previously. <br /> <br />King could have chosen \\"A Long Walk\\" or \\"The Deadly Long Walk\\" but dont be so unoriginal as to copy somebody else's title that has already been copyrighted. The penalty for doing so in this case, is that the average rating for the above book has now been decreased by my rating. This may actually cost King some money.
B00005MP58|5.0|Its no good- Colin Firth will always be Mr Darcy to me. Its a wonder that this book keeps people as enthralled now as when it was first published, which attests to the skill of the writer. As far as I am concerned this BBC production is the last word in Pride and Prejudice.
B0000844I8|2.0|I just watched this for the first time since I saw it in 1994, and I must say that with the exception of a few scenes, this is a boring forwula-driven film.  While Jaye Davidson is a very interesting RA - \\"I created your culture, now I will destroy it\\" - and Spader and Russell are exceptional actors, they cannot make up for the silly themes of oppressed people uprising, the establishment of a \\"team spirit\\" among the hapless military who took the trip, etc.  It just doesn't hang together all that well and there is very little originiality.  If you are a fan of hard scifi, don't bother with this one.  It is just barely a cut above junk.

B00009TB5G|5.0|This special extended version of this film brought more to life for those that did not read the books.  Peter Jackson's vision was near perfection in the making of this film. My suggestion would be if you have seen the original movies and then the extended versions, go back now and read the books. Lord of The Rings is sure to become an all star top selling movie in the long haul.
B00020HEL6|4.0|I don't want to put too much emphasis on what I'm about to say, but, really, it's impossible to put too much emphasis on what I'm going to say about Renee Olstead's self titled album: She was 15 when she recorded it. That's fifteen, with a 1 and THEN a 5, not the other way around.    Most mid teens who have dreams of a singing career are imagining getting on \\"American Idol\\" (16 is the minimum age to perform there), This one already has the chops to perform anywhere.    Because of her youth, and her incredibly advanced abilities, her phrasing, the sound and golden tone of her voice, she literally could have a sixty year career... or maybe more! That is an astounding fact! Was Diana Krall as good as she is today at Renee's age? Was Jane Monheit? These are the contemporaries that Ms. Olstead is rightly being compared with, and she's got twenty years or so on them! It's nothing short of incredible.    Ok. This album may not be perfect, so I gave it 4 stars. But the performer was 15 at the time! Every track is listenable thanks in great part to legendary producer David Foster. And Renee is very entertaining, with incredible potential for much more in the future. Definitely worth a listen and it's clearly the beginning of something amazing.

The movie is awesome and wonderful performances by Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash..... The movie deals with Johnny's drug problems and when he sang for inmates at the Folsom Prison..... I truly think that this movie told a little bit about the man in black,but forgot some of his storyline so you would have to watch the E True Hollywood Story..... I think that this movie should have won best picture at the awards,but it didn't..... I think that this movie is a must watched movie and if you love Johnny and June's music then you should check this one out it is worth it!!!!!!!!!!
0060899190|5.0|At once a fascinating, amusing, comforting, encouraging and thoroughly entrancing book. Perhaps the novelty was a little diluted for me however as I had been following the website for a while but the friend I gave the book to was enraptured for the entire day by it. Despite this, I too found the book very captivating and somehow seeing these postcards on paper was different from seeing them on the website. Looking forward to the next one!
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|A young American in a Far East prison meets a mysterious stranger who offers him the training and focus he needs to become what he desires most: an unstoppable force to combat evil. Upon his release, the young American joins the stranger, a man called Ducard, in the mountain domicile of ninja cult leader Ra's Al Ghul, where he begins refining his skills of combat and stealth in addition to learning the arts of deception, intimidation, and theatricality. During his time with this mysterious \\"League of Shadows,\\" the young man reveals the secrets of his tragic life and his obsessive quest for the means to fight injustice. We learn that his name is Bruce Wayne, and he is the only surviving heir to the great Wayne Family fortune of Gotham City. His parents brutally murdered before his eyes in an alley when he was only 8, Bruce has spent every moment since then acquiring knowledge and skills to help him in his as yet unclear goal of becoming an enemy of crime. Once his training with the League of Shadows is complete, Bruce is ready to return to Gotham and begin his fight against the criminal element, but maniacal Ra's Al Ghul has other plans for him! After a daring escape that appears to spell the end for Ra's, Bruce finds himself on a jet plane bound for Gotham, his loyal family butler, Alfred, at his side. On the trip home, Bruce tells Alfred the nature of his travels these past 7 years and of his plans to take on the villains of Gotham with a dramatic dual-identity meant to strike fear into the hearts of evil-doers. With the help of Alfred and a Wayne Enterprises employee named Lucius Fox, a scientific and technological genius, Bruce takes on the identity of his greatest childhood fear, the bat, setting up shop in the caves beneath his family mansion and developing an unequalled arsenal of gadgets and gear to aid him in his fight against crime. Wearing the mask of a billionaire playboy by day and stalking the rooftops of Gotham at night in the guise of the Batman, Bruce becomes both a myth and a living legend to the downtrodden people of the corrupt and dangerous city.  The Batman first sets his sights on exposing notorious mob boss Carmine Falcone, enlisting the aid of childhood friend Rachel Dawes, Gotham's beautiful assistant D.A., and the one trustworthy cop in the city, the kindly Police Sergeant Jim Gordon. However, the Bat's investigation into Falcone soon uncovers much more than he expected, revealing a plot to victimize the citizens of Gotham and involving the sinister and powerful Dr. Jonathan Crane of Arkham Asylum and a higher power so evil that even the arrogant Carmine Falcone is intimidated!<br /><br />After director Joel Schumacher destroyed the promising Bat-franchise created by Tim Burton's 1989 film, \\"Batman,\\" taking it in the direction of the enjoyable yet extremely campy kids' TV show of the 1960's rather than treating the Bat with the respect his fans demand and deserve, it seemed the Dark Knight would never be allowed to grace the silver-screen again. Then came \\"Batman Begins,\\" a fantastic new take on the bat more true to the character comic and animation fans know and love! This is a dark, brooding, even terrifying Batman, angry at the criminal element that destroyed his parents and his childhood, and dead-set on bringing justice to the city his family once nurtured and loved. The always wonderful Christian Bale seems born to play the Bat, bringing the right amount of intensity and emotion to both hero and secret identity. Katie Holmes is both beautiful and noble as the high-idealed Rachel Dawes. Gary Oldman continues to impress and surprise with the most perfect incarnation of Jim Gordon I could ever hope for! And, though I never would have thought to cast him myself, Michael Caine shines as Alfred Pennyworth, bringing his own charming and original take to the role. The great Morgan Freeman is wise and endearing as Lucius Fox, the Bat's gadget man. Of course, we can't forget the amazing villains so crucial to any Batman tale! By far the favorite is Cillian Murphy, who is fantastically creepy as Dr. Jonathan Crane, AKA the Scarecrow, taking the role right to the top at times, but never going over! A perfect Batman villain performance! Liam Neeson is always flawless, this time playing the role of Henri Ducard, a man with a past as dark and mysterious as The Batman's. And the magnificent Tom Wilkinson is terrific as the sleazy crime-boss Carmine Falcone. The story is inspired! The choice of subject and characters is perfect for a tale of the very origins of the Dark Knight, everything about it reflecting the core subjects of fear, deception, theatricality, intimidation, symbolism, madness, and the nature of justice! These are the things the Batman is all about! I certainly hope there will be many more films in this new Batman line, as long as they all share the strength and realism of this one! A tale involving the Mad Hatter would be fantastic! Might I suggest Paul Giamatti? How about Crispin Glover as the Joker? And Christopher Lloyd is long overdue to play Mr. Freeze!<br /><br />What director/writer Christopher Nolan and co-writer David S. Goyer created with \\"Batman Begins\\" is nothing less than a masterpiece for the superhero film genre. There is nothing \\"cartoony\\" about this Batman, something that truly differentiates it from all the live-action, big-screen attempts that came before it. There are scenes of such perfection that they demand mentioning. For example, Cillian Murphy's brilliant performance in the bowels of Arkham Asylum, as he boils-over with anticipation at a 2nd encounter with Batman. There's also the wonderful scene where Batman converses briefly with Jim Gordon outside his own modest home. I love all the Jim/Batman scenes, and Batman's use of live bats as \\"backup\\" at Arkham was fantastic! My favorite scene by far, though, must be the final scene between Batman and Gordon, where we are given a drool-enducing bit of foreshadowing in the form of a simple playing card!<br /><br />The 2-disc DVD of \\"Batman Begins\\" is just glorious! In addition to getting this outstanding film in widescreen, you also get the theatrical trailer, a hilarious MTV 2005 Movie Awards skit called \\"Tankman Begins\\" (starring Jimmy Fallon and Andy Dick, with a special appearance by Napoleon Dynamite!), and a large pile of other extras! There are 8 featurettes on topics like special effects, the development of the film, Christian Bale's physical transformation into Bruce Wayne, the unusual new Batmobile, and much more! Yes, the new Batmobile is very tank-like, and I would love to see a little style added to it in future installments (its crude simplicity is understandable in the beginning). Maybe smooth out the body just a bit and add a couple of bat-wing fins. Of course, I'd rather see less style than TOO MUCH. You also get image galleries and gadget and character overviews. Plus, if you pick up the DELUXE 2-disc Edition (as I did), you also will get a very nice, exclusive comic book and a case to hold the book and DVD together. The high-quality comic features three stories, The Man Who Falls (1989), Bat-Man in The Case of the Chemical Syndicate (1939), and a 48-page excerpt from The Long Halloween (1996). All three stories present situations and characters reflected in the film. Any Batman fan should love the 2-disc Deluxe Edition, just as any Batman fan should love \\"Batman Begins!\\" This is the Bat-film we've been waiting and hoping for! Now, give us many more!ial to any Batman tale! By far the favorite is Cillian Murphy, who is fantastically creepy as Dr. Jonathan Crane, AKA the Scarecrow, taking the role right to the top at times, but never going over! A perfect Batman villain performance! Liam Neeson is always flawless, this time playing the role of Henri Ducard, a man with a past as dark and mysterious as The Batman's.

0553801503|3.0|The story maintains the previous style of Mr. Martin but this book is slow moving and is mainly a setup for the next book.  I felt cheated that nowhere was it advertized that the story would be broken into 2 parts.  He could have flushed much of these plot lines and still maintained the integretity of the story. A true Martin fan will still probably enjoy this story but I bet they feel cheated like I was.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|A great film that tells the tragic story of his destroyed marriage, love for an elusive June Carter, and his many addictions (drugs, alcohol, and chicks).  It also shows his strength in surviving it all and turning his life around.  The movie was very interesting to me because Cash was played so often by my father on Sunday mornings when I was growing up (we didn't go to church much).  Cash's voice was truly unique and the lead actor and actress both did an excellent job of relating the story and bringing back to life what it must've been like for these southern country stars in the 1950s.  I was disappointed in the special features for this film, especially the lack of two or three music videos and which would've been almost expected for a DVD like this.  However, whenever I find myself thinking about a film the morning after I saw it, well, these days that's really saying something.  The movie should hit home with viewers on many levels and get a fella to thinking about his own life.  It is once again time to dust off those old CDs and rediscover that sound...  Cash is cool.
0316172324|4.0|This was a fascinating book, but I'm not sure what we are supposed to do with this knowledge.
B00000K31V|2.0|Jeez, this movie was really hyped. I read about it a lot in \\"The Matrix and Philosophy\\". The movie was quite a disappointment. The acting was weak (except for William DaFoe's great performance as a psychotic gas station attendant), Jennifer Jason-Leigh and Jude Law's roles and performances were both pathetic, the plot was thin, the theme was a copy of numerous other movies (is it real or is it...), special effects were extremely primitive, and aside from a twist at the end that you could have seen coming, the entertainment factor was very low. By comparison, The Matrix had an interesting and stimulating theme running through it on several levels, enough political, philosophical and theological questions to make you want to watch it again and again and to ponder it for quite a while and effects to blow you out of your socks  though it also suffered from weak acting I'll grant. eXistenZ was a B movie by comparison. I'd recommend Brazil or Dark City before this dog. Sorry, but that's the way I see it.
B000002WPI|5.0|Instant Classic! I think this cd SHOULD be in every rap listener collection, and if not then there is something seriously wrong with you. The only Wu-Tang cd I had was \\"The W\\", then one of my friends was like you need to check out \\"36 Chambers\\" so I was like alright. I did, and I was DDDAAAMMMNNN! Every song is good, you won't want to skip any, this cd bring the total package. Bangin beats, and strong lyrics, Wu-Tang was wayyyyy ahead of the game back then. Anyway this a must get if you are a fan of rap music, you won't be dissapointed.

I've bought more than 10 of these for friends or for myself -- because when you lend it out, you never get it back.  \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\" is the sleeper hit that never made it's way onto the charts.
B00003CX9S|5.0|Truly a \\"Timeless Masterpiece\\".  Years ago, raising my first two kids, they didn't believe me that Joseph Merrick really lived.  I had to pull out the encyclopedia to prove it.  Last week I watched it with my new partner and our 6 year-old daughter.  Same reaction.  This time we looked him up on the Internet.<br />One thing that I had forgotten - the use of Samuel Barber's \\"Adagio for Strings\\" in the last scene, where he decides he's had enough, removes the pillows from his bed, takes one last look at his meager possessions, and lies down for the last time.  Very moving, very effective.  Far better use of this fine piece of music than in \\"Platoon\\", where it shamelessly overused.

6305090564|4.0|Although the special effects seem a little on the cheap side this movie is one of the best b-movies I have ever seen. A lot of stuff was stolen from other movies, but that did not bother me for a second. It's been proven again that fine actors can truly add extra value to a movie as well. This movie offers you horror and laughter at the same time, which is a very unique combination these days. (SARR) <br />
B000007ODM|3.0|Though this album has a couple of interesting and entertaining tracks (\\"Ameno\\" and \\"Mother\\"), it is too unoriginal to deserve 5 or even 4 stars. All the trademark elements that are present in this style of music, from the sensual female voices to the chants with electronic beats in the background, have been tried before with better taste by Enigma, Delerium, etc. And where did that awful guitar solo in one of the songs come from? Enigma's first album is far better than this one and Delerium's _Karma_ is also great. My recommendation: buy Enigma's first two albums and then (if you haven't had enough of this kind of music yet) you could try this one. <br />
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I watched this movie and was blown away.  I really enjoyed the special effects. <br /> <br />While I thought Brad's acting was a little stilted, Eric Bana was fantastic as Hector. <br /> <br />Although the movie does not follow history tothe \\"T\\", it was still a great movie. <br /> <br />Full of action.  And the fight scenes were great.

B000002MQ9|5.0|This is the best Dead Can Dance album I own hands down, and on my TOP 5 list of best albums ever. There is something almost divine about this masterpiece and the way it affects me every time I listen to it. \\"Cantara\\" is my favorite song of them all, but \\"Xavier\\", \\"Summoning of the Muse\\", and \\"Dawn of the Iconoclast\\" are all very close. \\"Xavier\\" in particular has brought me to tears several times. Dead Can Dance's approach to music is really unique and this is their most barroque and beautifully dark work. I highly recommend this album, and if you like it, try _The Serpent's Egg_ also, which is almost as good as this.
B0000B3B95|3.0|While this wasn't the greatest movie ever made, you have to give props to Sam Elliott and Eric Bana.  Both did an excellent job with what they had been given. <br /> <br />The CGI Hulk was a little goofy loking. <br /> <br />Eric Bana, did a great job. With those soulful, brown puppy dog eyes, I find myself watching it over and over just to se him.
B00007KQA3|5.0|I was finally able to find this for rental and gave it a look with great enthusiasm as this is one of my favorite novels.  As this is a most talked about and studied novel what I say may not be news to anyone.  This is a great story about the evils of controlled media, the consequences of chaos in society, and the defiance of enforced solidarity.  Everyone knows the story of Winston Smith, a clerk serving in the Ministry of Truth whose function is the fabrication of propaganda that is broadcast throughout the land of Oceania.  Ironically, as Winston weaves the yarns of the ever refining past, he remembers that the facts were quite different at one time.  This is thought-crime, a newspeak term for remembering past events.  One must overide thought-crime with doublethink, to forget the past and accept the facts being told, but Winston struggles with this concept.  Winston also realizes that his struggle is not only known to himself as the dread thought police and citezenry are quick to pick up on the unorthodox actions one perpetuates in thought-crime.  Even his visits to the prole quarters would furrow the brow of any thought-police agent.  His suspicions become paramount when a young woman keeps appearing in his wayward whereabouts.  One day she \\"trips\\" and he helps her up.  When he takes her hand she slyly slips a love note into his hand.  This begins a secret relationship between the two that Oceanic society is working hard to abolish through the anti-sex league and community meetings.  This is the crime of \\"own-life\\", or the act of forming personal relationships outside of the solidarity of society.  After many lusty and secretive meetings above a junk shop in the prole area, the two are busted by means of a hidden telescreen behind an engraved picture on the wall.  A trip to the Ministry of Love, where all concept of time is dissolved and a cure rate of clients is boasted at a 100% rate, brutally dissolves their relationship of one another and re-establishes their devotion to society and the love of \\"Big Brother\\" (the benevolent leader wich no one is sure lives, but worship him anyway!).  All throughout the film you will understand the super media saturation in Oceania as nobody is not within earshot of the increasing lies broadcast via telescreen.  You almost feel the oppression of it all as the scenarios are all filthy and delapitated, save for the beutiful meadows of the forests of Oceania that constantly find their way into Winstons dreams and imaginations.  This film encompassed all the good points of the book but it's still wise to read the novel first.  As contradictary as 2+2=5 and that four fingers is five, this movie will definetely leave an impression (as a boot stamping on a human face forever) that the truth shall enslave you.......
0975991477|5.0|Bruce Lipton is a joyful genius, and that fact jumps off of every page of this book. It's almost as much fun to read this book as to hear Dr. Lipton speak in person, which you should do if you ever have the chance. For someone new to the ideas presented in this book, there is enough information to inspire curiousity but not so much that it overwhelms. If you are already familiar with these concepts, the book is an excellent reminder and reinforcement of previous learning. In addition to being an inspired scientist, Dr. Lipton has the gift of breaking complex ideas into simple modules, making it possible for us non-geniuses to understand. Interesting and relatively easy read.
0689878451|5.0|I think he hit the nail on the head with his review.<br /><br />I got this for my children after the recent hubbub in the news about it. If it upsets the narrow-minded then I usually know it is worth reading.<br /><br />This book was one of the cutest books I've seen yet. There was nothing disgusting or perverse about this book and my youngest son was just happy that Roy and Silo got to have a baby of their own because \\"They wuv babies\\".<br /><br />Anyone who has done nothing more than watch \\"March of the Penguins\\" would know that it is the male penguin who does most of the care of the egg and hatchling. So why should this seem odd? Yes, the story says that the zookeeper realized \\"they loved each other\\" but come on. The focus is suppose to be on the fact that two MALE penguins were able to do something that it was only thought could be done with a male and FEMALE penguin.<br /><br />People who are up in arms about this book really need to get a life. It's sad and disgusting the lows people will go to these days. If this book offends you then please, don't let your children study biology.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Whilst not being as great as Oxygene his debute album,Equinoxe~ Jean-Michel Jarre is leaps and bounds better then many of his later releases. Here Jarre is heavily into space synth and his use of the synth sounds of the time is astounding.. In fact I find myself thinking (just like when I listened to Oxygen) what sound is like coming from which keyboard. Is this coming from the Roland Juno, the Moog or other keyboard.  Equinoxe part 3 is a classic and is right up their with some of his best tracks ever. This is before he becomes too avantgarde for his own best and makes utter junk like Zoolook and tracks like the horrid London Kid. This is such a good album that it lacks modern equivelent and Jarre still has not found the creative touch that he so much had during the 70's. This a cd to be owned by all lovers of great music.

0767834739|1.0|Following the moderate success of the first \\"eh, good enough\\" film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse continues the story of Alice, one of the few survivors of the T-Virus outbreak that turned the Hive facility's employees into flesh-eating zombies. The Umbrella Corporation has reopened the Hive and the T-Virus has escaped into the Raccoon City above it. Now, Alice - who is now superpowered thanks to Umbrella tinkering with her DNA - must once again escape hordes of zombies, hellhounds, and Umbrella-created mutations before the whole city is nuked off the map.    With her this time are characters that are actually from the games the movie is based on - sexy cop Jill Valentine (played by Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Oliveira (Oded Fehr). Since the Alice character was inspired by the Jill character, they are almost exactly the same atttude-wise, and do we really need two of the same character in the same movie? Sorry, we don't. The movie is supposed to take place during the Resident Evil 3 game which Jill is the star of, but whenever Jill gets in trouble in this film, Alice swoops in like Supergirl and saves her ass. They totally waste the Jill character just to keep the awful Alice story going, and it's sad to see the character that stars in the game get upstaged left and right by a character that was never in the games. Booooo! Maybe they should have just left the game's characters out of this film so they could keep the film and game separate.     This brings up the problems with the story. Since Alice wasn't in any of the games and this film is supposed to be about the third Resident Evil game, this puts the film in the \\"it's kind like but kinda not like the game\\" category, so you don't even know where it exists in the canon of the games' storyline. Second, some of the plot points are incredibly stupid from the start. After all, why would a corporation design a research facility with a special security system designed to seal the place off should something disasterous happen and then try to reopen the facility not once but TWICE once something so bad happens that the place needs to be sealed off? Couldn't they take the hint the first time they reopened the place and lost an entire Special Ops team inside? And wasn't the guy that escaped that was infected with their T-Virus enough of a hint that there had been a T-Virus outbreak? The logic that sets this film in motion is so annoyingly flawed. You'd think a major coporation like Umbrella was smarter than this. They could have at least tried to explain it off that the Hive was reopened with the purpose of letting the T-Virus escape to see how effective their bio-weapon was in a major city? That's one of the explanations they give in the game, but they don't even do that in the film.    Second, why are they giving Alice more and more powers? How are we supposed to relate to her? Part of the appeal of zombie films - or most films in general - is that you can relate to the characters. You can mentally put yourself in their position, and you worry about their well-being. But what happens when the character you're supposed to relate to becomes so powerful they can do somersaults, know tons of martial arts out of the blue, and can kill people with telepathy? Alice becomes so powerful and superhuman, you never fear she won't survive. It's called the Superman Syndrome - a character becomes so powerful, that you don't care what happens to them because you already know.    Now there's the Nemesis. They turn a badass killing machine into a good guy in the end! Part of what makes some villains so fun is that they're so bad - they're so bad, they're good. That was part of the appeal of Nemesis. But instead, they turn him into a kinder, gentler Nemesis who saves the day in the end.    The Resident Evil movies are supposed to be zombie movies, but they're made into action/sci-fi bullcrap. Sure, zombie films have some action in them, but it's more realistic action. Sadly, these films use stylized action that look like they were taken from the Matrix Bargain Bin with its slow motion bullets, wire-fu, and choppy editing to try making the film look \\"cool\\". And they fail miserably. Zombie films make the action secondary, but this is an action film and the zombies are secondary.     The first film spent half its running time zombie-free, as they tried to set up suspense and that's pretty understandable. This time around, there should be zombies galore, right? But the plotting is so damn slow, you almost forget there are zombies in the film! And even when the zombies are on-screen, they use this filming style that looks like choppy stop-motion animation! Who thought this was a good idea in post-production? Whoever has this film editor hired now on ANY film, fire them immediately.     UPDATE - This visual characteristic is called \\"dropping frames,\\" and it usually occurs accicentally during editing when transferring footage from film to digital editing software. When the software is having trouble converting one of the frames the footage for whatever reason, that frame is \\"dropped\\". The blur yousee is the footage skipping over the missing frame. It happens rarely, and when it does happen, it's either barely noticeable to the audience , or it requires the editor to make adjustments or find a different method to convert the footage. But in Resident Evil: Apocalypse, it appears that the editor is intentionally dropping frames to create this visual effect. Why? Is there something wrong with the zombies that they have to obscure the audience's view of them? Do they think (erroneously) that it makes the zombies scarier? Or are the zombies too visually disturbing that they have to be blurred in order to make an R rating?  Whatever the reason, this is a TERRIBLE visual characteristic, and whoever masterminded this decision needs to go back to college and take a few film classes.    I'm sorry, the LJ character is so blatantly offensive. Do we really need the loud-mouthed black comic relief these days? The only way this would have been more offensive and cliched is if they had some Vaudeville-esque performer in blackface tap-dancing and eating watermelon throughout the film.    And I'm certain that the only reason they made it possible to kill the zombies by snapping their necks was to tone down the gore and get it past the MPAA with an R rating, not to mention that video games still have the \\"just kid's stuff\\" reputation, and thus movies based on video games suffer a similar stigma so they have to be toned down for \\"the kids.\\" But this is supposed to be a ZOMBIE FILM, it's supposed to be gory! The games, which are supposedly \\"just kid's stuff,\\" actually have MORE gore than the movies made about them. So as far as zombie films go, the Resident Evil films are pretty tame. Hell, they could have gone with more gore, taken it out so the film could get an R, then put it back in for an Unrated Version on DVD. That would have been more acceptable than these zombie film abominations.    And am I the only one who is so tired of the blue tint they see in every action/sci-fi film since The Matrix? I haven't been to a single city where the lighting is blue EVERYWHERE at night. Enough with the blue lighting, damn it.    Believe me, if I could have given this film 0 Stars, I would have. This is truly a horrible film. Horrible-looking, horribly-written, horribly-directed, and so on. It's such a shame that video games are being so poorly represented on film this way.
B000002I6T|5.0|One of Rock's notorious bad boys, David Crosby relied on unusual harmonic intervals and chords to create this moody masterpiece, which I think is far and away the best solo album coming out of the C,S,N & Y collective.      The chemistry on this album is amazing (regardless of any mind-altering substances the musicians may have been ingesting).  Somehow Crosby managed to pull together the biggest egos of West Coast Rock into one harmonious whole.  The playing and singing is totally inspired, and the effect is hypnotic, soothing, ecstatic...(fill in your own adjective.)    I don't care much for the Dead, or the Airplane or for that matter, much of what Crosby produced after this landmark.  It still stands as an effervescent  tribute to a time when the horizons were wide open.  ( It was up to Neil Young to bring the curtain down a few years later with \\"Tonight's the Night\\").  This is music drunk on its own beauty, a true one-shot wonder, unique in its oeuvre.

B0002O7XVI|4.0|I know there has been a lot of praise (and controversy) over Roman Polanski's \\"Tess\\", and while I think this is a good film, I wonder sometimes if it is a bit overrated. Don't get me wrong, I have it in my collection, I enjoy comparing adaptations and such, but it's a bit too subdued and slow moving for my taste at times (and I know that it's not a story that can move quickly) and while Nastassja Kinski (of whom I am a fan) is very good and stunningly beautiful in the part, she just doesn't seem like an English country girl to me, she's quite exotic-looking (due to her Teutonic/Slavic ancestry). Her accent is quite good, despite what some have said, but some of her lines are spoken so softly and lowly you have to hit the volume button just to make sure you can hear her dialogue. The fact that Polanski had to film in France due to Britain's extradition laws (he was on the run from US authorities due to statutory rape charges involving a 13-year-old girl), and he had been having an affair with Kinski while she was underage added to a lot of uneasiness and controversy that swirled around the production and its release. It's dedicated to Sharon Tate (of whom I am also a fan), who suggested that Polanski read the novel and consider making it into a film (Julie Christie gave Tate a copy of the book and inscribed it, \\"To my Hardy heroine\\", Chrisitie herself having played a Hardy heroine in the 1967 epic Far From The Madding Crowd), which I find very touching. Leigh Lawson is very good as Alec, but he strikes me as a bit too old for the role, Peter Firth comes across as quite lackluster as Angel, not a lot of charisma, while Tess's mother comes off more as a silly matchmaking woman (I know Tess's parents are ignorant, but they should also come across as a bit more exploitative, since they pretty much pimp her out).<br /><br />There are other things about Polanski's \\"Tess\\" that bother me. First off, it doesn't show how the death of Prince is what made Tess go along with her parents insistence that she claim kin. Her guilt over the loss of the family horse is crucial foreshadowing in the plot, but in Polanski's film it's only mentioned that the horse died, so that is somewhat of a loss in the narrative, which is a pity. Also, Tess in the novel, while she was naive in the beginning, she did have spirit and pluck, but she was made very passive and compliant in this film. Perhaps Polanski intended the film to be more introspective, since Kinski has very little dialogue for a film that runs three hours. The Chase sequence lost some of its impact for me when Polanski had Tess push Alec off of the horse and her begging his forgiveness, leading to a kiss and while she struggles with him, it makes it seem as if she is \\"reluctantly seduced\\" as one Thomas Hardy scholar noted on the DVD special features than forcibly taken by her \\"cousin\\". Or that it showed that Tess stayed on for a while as Alec's mistress, although the novel did say she didn't leave Trantridge until a few weeks after the night in the woods. The romance between Tess and Angel wasn't developed enough to feel for it or long for their reunion. Also, the fact that Alec became a preacher was totally left out, so the explanation of why he reappears in Tess's life is because Tess's mother wrote him telling him of Tess's troubles (the pregnancy, the baby's death, her abandonment by Angel), which seems absurd when she could have wrote him when Tess returned with child from Trantridge. Polanski said in a 1979 interview about the film that he left out Alec's conversion because it was \\"too Victorian\\". Whatever. I think he missed a big opportunity there, as well as the fact that the movie jumps ahead in time without much explanation which made it a bit confusing and awkward if you haven't read the novel. Both the BBC mini and the '98 A&E/LondonWeekendTelevision adaptations benefited from including those crucial parts of the plot into their presentations. Of course, none of the presentations are perfect (there's no such thing) but I feel that these latest two capture the spirit of the novel a bit better in some respects. Both Arterton and Waddell captured Tess's inner strength and somewhat independent way (it's interesting to note that Polanski also omitted the scene when Tess argues with her mother after she returns home after working for her \\"sham kin\\", regarding the fact that she has been \\"compromised/violated\\" by Alec and she did not get him to marry her and how her \\"condition\\" is something they'll have to make the best of). Also, we don't get much of an insight into Tess's family dynamic in this 1979 picture (such as her relationships with her younger siblings, and their names). With Kinski's Tess, who was a bit more introverted with her emotions, you sometimes had to guess her thoughts.<br /><br />The French countryside (Normandy and Brittany) is gorgeous but it is missing that Wessex/Dorset aura - all you have to do is watch other Hardy adaptations (Far From The Madding Crowd, Jude, The Woodlanders and the other Tess versions), to get the idea. I can usually pick up on the authentic feel of certain locations, and I found that was missing in the Polanski film. That's probably one of the reasons why I prefer the later adaptations.<br /><br />Great costuming though, lovely cinematography and Phillipe Sarde's score is very emotionally in tune with the tone of the story and the changing of the seasons.ct (there's no such thing) but I feel that these latest two capture the spirit of the novel a bit better in some respects.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|Pink Floyd guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour, who used to be quite a productive musician way back when, is clearly slowing down these days. Having just turned 60, and with a wife and four young children at home, Gilmour doesn't seem to get out all that much lately, barring the occasional session work (such as with Alan Parsons and Jools Holland), and the all-too-brief reunion with Pink Floyd at Live 8 in July 2005. Now, twelve long years after Pink Floyd's last (and possibly final) album, 1994's \\"The Division Bell,\\" Gilmour has finally released a brand new solo album, \\"On An Island.\\" And while the album isn't the magnificent return of Gilmour---or Pink Floyd---that so many fans were hoping for, it is a very beautiful, mostly tranquil album that really does grow on you with repeated listenings. With it's surprisingly laid-back, quiet, mellow feel---there's really only one real rocker on it---\\"On An Island\\" won't exactly bowl you over at first, but by the second or third listen, chances are you'll appreciate it. It is, in the end, a very special album, and several songs wouldn't have sounded too out of place had David offered them to Pink Floyd. With many songs co-written with his wife Polly Samson (who also co-wrote several songs with her hubby for \\"The Division Bell\\"), Gilmour takes a very soft, reflective path with this music. The title song, with backing vocals by David Crosby & Graham Nash, is a very lush, Floydian number featuring an amazing solo from Gilmour. \\"The Blue\\" is a stunningly gorgeous tune, a truly atmospheric dreamscape. The album's lone rocker, \\"Take A Breath,\\" shows that Gilmour CAN still rock out if he chooses to, and he does so brilliantly. For the song \\"This Heaven,\\" David shifts gears and goes into a swampy, shuffling blues motif, and it sounds great. The album's simplest song, \\"Smile\\" (which Gilmour previewed for audiences at least five years ago on his live solo DVD from 2001), is very pretty, and it also features wife Polly on backing vocals.And the final, reflective song, \\"Where We Start,\\" an obvious love note to Gilmour's wife, is very lovely, haunting & memorable. And what makes the entire album hold together so well is, of course, David Gilmour's world-class guitar-playing, which is still a joy to hear, and his smooth, powerful singing voice, which hasn't changed a bit.Like all of David Gilmour's diehard fans, I hope that \\"On An Island\\" is not the last time we ever hear new music from the man. But, to be honest with you, I wouldn't be surprised in the least if it is. Even if Gilmour isn't really saying farewell to the music biz with \\"On An Island,\\" the album certainly *seems* like a farewell of sorts. It was twelve years in the making, with introspective songs about being in the autumn of your years and the love of family life, with album artwork that also reflects Gilmour's current domestic state of mind....you get the idea. Whatever Gilmour plans to do---or not do---from this point on, I, for one, am grateful that he's finally given us one more musical gift to enjoy. \\"On An Island\\" is a beautiful, excellent musical postcard from an outstanding rock musician who has been out of the spotlight for far too long. It's great to have him back one more time.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|just a great cd  to listen to in the car or at home while  doing  housework<br /><br />love all  the songs  and the tracks  from the movie,
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I can't say that I am a big fan of Sci-Fiction films example Star-Track, but funny enough I loved every second of this film to bits. To the characters and great storyline I would have to say  amazing. The storyline is about a crew who are bandits in space, stealing what they can to stay alive and healthy , things started to get hairy when they pick up a young girl( River Tam) who is the doctors sister on board.  Captain Malcom Reynolds finds himself running from a skilled Alliance operative who wants River Tam, and who will stop at nothing to get her; meanwhile, River's capabilities become more clear to the crew of Serenity. <br /> <br />If you like Sci-fiction movies this is your cup of tea or if you don't, give it a watch I think you could find it to be surprisingly good.  <br /> <br />The future is worth fighting for. <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|Okay listen, first of all this is a very well done album with strong musicianship to back it up, from a band that has really made their mark in modern music history within the past decade (positive and negative ways both), whether some of the proclaimed- 'Punk Purists' would like to except them or not. Thats not a stab at the punk community. I simply mean that the choices Green Day made in the past were up to them. They took their music where they wanted to take it. And as Billy Joe has put it \\"This is my life, this is my lifestyle, and your not invited\\".       Now I'm not saying that you have to like this album, cause you have every right not to.  However, if you do like something you should have the guts to admit it. Don't follow the crowd and yell out \\"sell out\\" or \\"they're not punk enough\\", just because they don't fit some people's standards, that's all just a waste of breath, and arrogant as well. (By the way the Clash had to deal with the same accusations). If being punk is about rebeling, rejecting the norms of society, and being yourself, then why are there so many rules surrounding it? Sounds like a conflict of interest to me.        Anyway, as I read through some of the previous negative reviews (something I like doing) all i see thrown around is \\"Green Day is not the Sex Pistols\\", \\"Go listen to the Sex Pistols\\", \\"Sex Pistols, Sex Pistols!!!!\\"  If I am not mistaken Green Day has never called themselves \\"Sex Pistol Clones\\" or even compared themselves to the band. That is done by the media hype that surrounds them. I mean, I think that the Sex Pistols were great at what they did as well (while they lasted). After all they were among the first to break through in punk rock, right (think about that one for a second). But to raise them up as the embodyment of everything punk stands for is kind of hypocritical. I'll just let you all figure that one out for yourselves.   This is all just an example of people falling victim to all the media hype that destroys bands. Green Day make the music that they want, and if you don't like it you dont have to, it is as simple as that. They cant help that they appeal to young and old audiences alike, and what's wrong with that anyway, come on grow up, not everything is for you and your ears alone.        A lot of work went in to writing and performing this album, and it shows.  I'm not claiming it to be the greatest album ever made, but is does have all the characteristics that make it a great album, one that will be remembered in years to come, whether people like it or not. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion though.       To sum up all I can say is appreciate the album with an open mind, and judge it for what it is, not what it is not.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|How well you like this album will depend on your preconceptions of what to expect. The Album has a definite Pink Floyd influence stamped on it, but its not altogether Pink Floyd. If you are expecting something edgy along the hard rock genre, you may be somewhat disapointed. But if you are a long time Floyd fan, you will probably be delighted. This is an album for adults, the kiddies need not apply. It is a much more mature David Gilmour, at his most focused and creative. The albums first Track, \\"Castellorizon\\", features surreal sound painting of Floydish ambiance, ending with a very signaturesque and soulful guitar solo. Soulfulness is the recurring theme in this album, the feel is that it is coming straight from the heart. The title track, On an Island, is a mellow folksy excursion featuring backups by David Crosby and Graham Nash. The blue is another mellow track, almost reminescent of some of the soft tracks on Meddle. Gilmours vocals are etherial and moving. \\"Take a breath\\" is more edgy, with a nice drum sound and great guitar work and vocals. \\"Red sky at night\\", is an instrumental with a very deep and textured ambience and some great sax with a subtle but effective orchastral back up. \\"This heaven is a bluesy piece, again reminsecant of some of the older Floyd tracks, with some great guitar jams. \\"When I close my eyes\\" is a nice meandering instrumental track strong on acoustic guitar with piano backup, but featuring a pleasantly suprising bevy of different instruments.\\"Smile\\" is a personal, unplugged Dave, again something that could have been lifted off Meddle. \\"Pocketfull of Stones\\" is a nice ambient orchestral track with again some up close vocals by Dave. \\"Where we start\\" is a goodbye track of sorts, reminds me of The beatles \\"The long and winding road\\" Hopefully this isnt goodbye from Dave. I have to say, as someone who has been listening to the work of David Gilmour for over 30 years, I thoroughly love this album, it is deep and meaty, and it will grow onyou every time you listen to it. It is a bit of a departure from other works, but not so much of one that it is disquieting. To the contrary, it is fresh and takes the music in nice direction. This is certainly his finest solo effort.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|Being a DG fan and A pink Floyd fan since the beginning I personally find this album a letdown. I am travling from Alaska to see two shows in the LA area and I'm sure they will be great but I won't be dissapointed if he leaves out most of this CD.  Take A Breath and The Blue are my favorites but the rest of the album sounds like Dave wrote it while sitting in a rocking chair.  I've waited almost 20 years for this!!! Sorry Dave. I hope you do another soon and that you get a second wind.   Short and Sweet!!!!!  Ray Lapinski

B00000B9BD|5.0|I went to go hear the Strawbs in concert when they were on their \\"Hero & Heroine\\" tour.  I did not own any of their albums, but the FM station I listened to in Albuquerque liked their music and would play \\"Down by the Sea\\" often enough that coupled with commercials for the concert highlighting some choice bits from assorted songs I decided to go check them out (besides, Richie Havens was opening for them).  In the wake of the concert I went out and got every Strawbs album I could find in town, which included \\"Grave New World.\\"<br /><br />I am willing to round up on this one, but I do not think of \\"Grave New World\\" as being a first tier Strawbs album (those would be the next three after this one).  Part of the reason is that the music a lyrics are a bit too pretentious as times, and if you really get into what is going on here it can be a bit depressing.  But that was what was happening in the wake of Rick Wakeman's leaving the group for Yes.  Apparently that is the context in which we are supposed to listen to the opening track \\"Benedictus,\\" in which Cousins sings about blessing \\"all those who cause us pain.\\"  Besides, how many songs have an electric dulcimer run through a fuzz box?  This is the best song on the album, while the title track is the second, even though it provides decidedly contradictory sentiments, as when Cousins sings, \\"may you rot in your grave new world.\\"  The post-apocalyptic sentiments are sung out while Weaver provides some of his best work on the mellotron.<br /><br />Those two songs override everything else on the album, which can make it seem not as solid an effort as we would see on the next album, \\"Bursting at the Seams.\\"  But \\"The Flower and the Young Man\\" and \\"On Growing Older\\" are both solid songs, showing that Cousins could write effectively for both the electric and acoustic guitar.  This digitally remastered reissue contains a pair of bonus tracks, but while \\"I'm Going Home\\" is a solid little track, \\"Here It Comes\\" is a throwback to the musical period the group was leaving behind.  Still, every little blast from the past tacked on is to be appreciated as an effort to clean out the vaults.<br /><br />The Strawbs remain one of my favorite progressive rock bands of the 1970s, but when this album came out in 1972 the group was still a lot closer to their folk-rock roots.  In addition to David Cousins writing songs, the rhythm section of Richard Hudson and John Ford was producing some decent tracks as well.  But this would be the last album with Tony Hooper on lead guitar, who would be replaced by Dave Lambert, who brought more rock sensibilities to the group.  At this point Blue Weaver had replaced Wakeman on keyboards, but I really define the glory days of the Strawbs by the time that John Hawken was in that role.  By that point Cousins was the only one left from the original Strawberry Hill Boys.  The verdict might be that the Strawbs were not on the same plateau as Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, or even Renaissance, but if they were a second tier group they were the best on that level.owback to the musical period the group was leaving behind.

0688135455|5.0|Books of Wonder once again brings a classic E. Nesbit tale back to life for readers young and all to enjoy. Brimming with fun and fantasy, as well as realistic, believeable story-telling, this is an adventure that will keep you guessing what will happen next.<br /><br />This adventure happens when five children (one still more of a baby) find a Psammead, or sand-fairy. They learn that this creature is capable of granting them wishes, although it asks that they only make wishes once a day. So the wishing begins, but the kids come to find that generally the wishes cause them more trouble than fun. Meanwhile, the Psammead seems perplexed, wondering why they don't wish for practical, solid things, rather than fanciful things, like castles, or high-concepts, like being wanted.<br /><br />This book is illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky, who also did the illustrations for \\"The Enchanted Castle,\\" also released by Books of Wonder. Like the book, these illustrations are an excellent blend of fantasy and reality. This book also includes an informative Afterword.<br /><br />I understand that \\"Five Children and It\\" also recently became a major motion picture. I haven't yet had a chance to see it, but I'm really looking forward to watching it.
0786915749|5.0|I happened to pick up this jewel by chance. I was looking for a series that I can spend my time enjoying and would keep me interested. ((I went through books like water)) I believe this is the best choice I could have possibly made. Don't let the LOTR  similarites ((companions of different races out on a quest against evil)) fool you! There are enough twists and turns along the way that will keep you engaged. <br /> <br />This has something for everyone... plot, character development, imagination. The heroes of the tales can easily be related to. ((Raistlin being my personal favorite.)) I started early high school, but can be read by a younger or older audience as well.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I have seen so many, many movies but this one I think has to be my all time favorite.  The whole setting of the liberal arts college, the 50s conservative setup in which the college dwells so firmly in, and the magical aura of a bygone era captivates you right form the start of the film. Top that with some beautiful photography, a nice gripping story and some convincing performances and you've got a great film.<br /><br />This is a movie that will lift you up and make you smile. Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) Encourages students to reject conformity in any form and pursue careers rather than settle down as housewives. Colleagues advise the new professor that the trick to surviving Wellesley is to go unnoticed, as too much independence frightens administrators, who she is told have claws under their gloves.<br /><br />With this movie, I think many people will discover that not only students learn from teachers, but everyone learns from others.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This has the quality you'd expect from the former leader of Pink Floyd.  Worth every single dollar.
078681859X|5.0|I bought this when it first came out a few years ago, but then it went on my shelf and was never touched again until just a while ago. After reading a great review of it, I decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br />It starts out fairly slow, and the writing style needs a little getting used to, but after making my way through the first few chapters, I couldn't put it down. It's very dark and intriguing, yet also has sarcasm to lighten the mood in the form of footnotes that represent the character Bartimaeus' side thoughts. <br /> <br />As people have said before, this is by no means a Harry Potter ripoff. Stroud takes an entirely different approach to magic. Instead of wizardry running in the family, a child becomes a magician by being abandoned by his or her parents in exchange for a hefty amount of money. Someone is reluctantly called upon to raise and provide education for the child, in the form of several tutors. <br /> <br />In Stroud's world, magicians were at one point the world's ruling class, but are being overthrown in each major city, one at a time. London is next, and it's currently waging a war with a terrorist-like group of commoners known only as \\"the Resistance.\\" In the government's confusion, many magicians take part in dirty dealing to gain power, fame, and wealth. <br /> <br />A year before the beginning of the book, one of those powerful, corrupt magicians, Simon Lovelace, humiliates Nathanial, one of the books two main characters. He then goes ahead of his studies, learning complex magic way beyond his level, and eventually summoning Bartimaeus, a powrful djinni (genie). After ordering Bartimaeus to steal the Amulet of Samarkand, Lovelace's prized posession and a key tool in his scheme, Nathanial gets himself into more trouble then he bargained for. <br /> <br />The narrative switches between the first-person experience of Bartimaeus and the third-person story of Nathanial every two chapters or so. The Nathanial story starts a few years before Bartimaeus' does, which may cause slight  confusion. Toward the end, however, the team catch up with each other and you see perspective switches several times within a few chapters to detail the amazing climax. <br /> <br />The end is ambiguous, leaving room for the sequal and foreshadowing what's yet to come, including Nathanial's potential for corruption like his fellow magicians. <br /> <br />The book is a good and easy read from beginning to end, highly recommended to anyone.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to write this, especially seeing as I got the album when it was first released and have been listening to it non stop ever since. I would write a review but this is the kind of ethereal music that just needs to be heard and experienced by the listener. Words don't do this album justice. I rate it amongst the best albums I have ever heard. Check it out!!!!
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is one of the best shows I have seen in a Television world filled with way too many reality shows. I will be the first to admit I have never really been in to medical shows. I bought the first season of this DVD set for a couple of reasons. First because I knew it stared Katherine Heigl who stared in one of my favorite Tv shows Roswell, and secondly because I kept hearing buzz and saw how many positive reviews it got here on amazon. I bought the DVD set and WOW was I glad I did. This is a show that has characters so many people can relate to. Grey's Anatomy is a show that has just the right amount of comedy mixed in with just the right amount of drama, and those two things along with the great cast take this far just beyond another medical TV show. This show just keeps you coming back for more. Along with Desperate Housewives and Lost, Grey's Anatomy is another welcomed addition and a great break from all those reality TV shows. I can't wait till the season 2 DVD set is released!
B000BAQ8A0|4.0|This production is great. The concept is very interesting: it begings in black and white and, as the action develops, the color begins to be add act by act to end full of color and fiesta. This is a bel canto opera... it means all the characters must be able to deliver a pure singing line. Juan Diego Florez really does a great job: the voice is just what the rossini light tenor must be: flexible, beautiful with great coloratura and high notes. Ruggero Raimondi makes a great Don Basilio, even with a noticeable used voice, the singing and acting is, as always, first rank. Pietro Spagnoli, the Figaro of this production, does not make a big impression. His Figaro lacks vivacity wich is essential for the character. Bruno Pratico makes a very funny Bartolo and sings very fluent that difficult part... Maria Bayo is a dissapointing Rossina. I don't understand why she is still singing this part: The voice sounds old and effortful, the coloratura is heavy, and she has lost all the high notes... so, why you need a soprano singing Rossina if she cannot do something a good mezzo can do? Rossina IS a mezzosoprano roll, if a soprano attempt to sing the part there must be a reason for it: for exaple to express a more youthful and playful character... but when the voice shows age and trouble, what is the point if there are great mezzos and light sopranos around to do it? I recommend this DVD basically for two reasons: the production in itself, and Juan Diego Florez, who gives a wonderful show including the aria \\"cessa di piu resistere\\" which is regulary omitted in most productions.

There's been much sexism in some of the comments considering  \\"his wife\\" Polly Samson who btw is a well-respected published writer of books as well as lyrics going back to The Division Bell.

0553801503|2.0|A Feast For Crows is an incomplete bridge.  Hopefully it is a bridge to somewhere we want to go - certainly the characters, pacing and the quality of writing from the previous books in the series would lead us to believe that Martin is worth following.  Unfortunately, this instalment suffers from editorial inattention.  While the other books pulled me through them in a matter of days apiece, `Crows' let me proceed at a trudge, and I took nearly a month of intermittent reading to complete it.<br /><br />Having scanned the various postings here regarding book size and marketability, I have to assume that Martin got caught in a struggle between his editor's sense of what size book could be sold, and his own desire to continue weaving his complex and myriad plot threads.  I should be clear that length is not the issue here - Martin has proven that he is more than adept at managing complex storylines across thousands of pages. Rather, this book feels like a next-to-final draft instead of a final version.<br /><br />A couple minor examples:<br /><br />In previous books, characters are initially re-introduced into the narrative with a two-sentence summary of their highlights from past volumes. Once they're back in the flow, he (rightly) drops such prompts.  But in `Crows' we get these kinds of summaries repeatedly - in some cases almost every time a character's POV comes up.  Thus, we hear 5 times about Brienne of Tarth's past engagements, etc., etc.  There's no new information presented in such passages, just re-statement of things we've already heard.<br /><br />Similarly, Martin occasionally re-states very basic observations/descriptions almost word-for-word.  Mid-book, Cersei observes that Grand Maester `Pycelle had been old as far back as [she] could remember...', and then 32 pages later, Martin begins the next Cersei POV with the words, `Grand Maester Pycelle had been old for as long as she had known him...'<br /><br />These are not criticisms of Martin as author but rather of a distracting lack of editorial focus.  Such problems did not plague past works in the series, and will hopefully not reappear in future volumes.<br /><br />One other aspect of the book negatively impacts the pacing.  A ridiculous number of pages are spent in people's dreams.  These are mostly passages that dump in volumes of back-story (and occasionally foreshadowing), but they are extremely repetitious and generally offer little in the way of new or vital content.  Once again, a good, focused editor would have helped Martin consolidate such passages to clean up the overall ebb and flow.<br /><br />Much of what happens in `Crows' will no doubt prove important to the series overall.  As I said at the outset, the book is a bridge in the overall arc of this story; many characters are transitioning from what they were and maturing into what they must become.

B000001Y5D|1.0|She's better off writing for other people.<br /><br />Just one question, where did Linda Perry find the verse section of What's Up?<br /><br />\\"Here's a little song I wrote, you might want to sing it note for note.......\\"<br /><br />Apparently Linda did just that.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Anyone who's seen this set or read the relevant Wodehouse books will recognize my title as the recurring \\"Yeoman's Wedding Song\\" as muddled through on various occasions by Bertie Wooster. Such recurring motifs render the books timelessly enjoyable, and they have their delightful counterparts as visualized in this series.<br /><br />It's always a question what characters in a book ought to look like, as well as the tone of their delivery. Everyone has some idea of what Jeeves must be like. Fortunately, so has Stephen Fry who plays him in this stellar series, perfectly matched to Laurie's Bertie Wooster.<br /><br />These four seasons were filmed by three different directors, and only the fourth season seems to get the tone wrong, and even then it's above most viewing. Many of the episodes closely follow the books and short stories. Where they deviate, they usually don't improve on PG's version, but neither do they come out a lot worse. A&E changed the episode titles from the Masterpiece Theater versions on VHS, causing some confusion, but in this box set, you know you've got them all. Those who find current television viewing perfectly beastly might be delighted (as I was) to find this series. My suggestion would be to, like the yeoman, hurry along and buy them.
0525948023|5.0|As long as I spend 30 minutes a day reading and rereading \\"A New Earth\\" I'm often able to watch the ego and not become totally identified with the incessant thoughts running through my mind. I am having more and more glimpses of inner-peace when I practice the exercises Eckhardt Tolle suggests. Just reading the book once may not make such profound changes since the ego is very clever but as long as the reader continually reads and meditates on Tolle's profound wisdom, an opening of a change of consciousness emerges.I've written up the exercises that are interspersed throughout the book and the most salient points so that I can review them throughout the day.

B0001WTUH6|3.0|This is a 2 person review... the reactions of 2 viewers, #1 and #2.<br /><br />#1 -  Look, this movie was exciting.  You end up wanting to know more about this world, how these vampires and lycons interact with \\"normal\\" folk like me, and certainly, what happens AFTER the events in this movie.  The action is great, the acting is not too shabby (look tired and thin, but ready for action), and the sets really are interesting, even with the hanging chains and dripping ceilings.  But why are the werewolves called lycon?<br /><br />#2 -  OK, so you don't know where \\"lycon\\" came from.  According to Wikipedia, \\"Lycon can refer to one of two persons.  First, in Greek mythology, Lycon was a son of King Hippocoon of Sparta... Second, a fellow by the name of Lycon was involved in the trial of Socrates, and acted as one of the three prosecuters.\\"  Where they got attached to werewolves I don't know. Perhaps from Lycon pictus, the African wild hunting dog?  Is lykos Greek for \\"wolf\\"?<br /><br />#1 - You're insane.<br /><br />#2 - Hey, I would have used the term werewolf.  Now what about this movie?<br /><br />#1 - It is definitely worth seeing if you like sci-fi action.  I don't know what all the chains hanging from the ceilings were for... mood, I guess.  This is the 4th time I've watched this film, and it gets better each time.  You pick up something new each time you watch it.<br /><br />#2 - Appropriate age range and rating... PG-13?<br /><br />#1 - No, I'd say it is a R-rated movie, for all the violence.<br /><br />#2 - The ending makes me interested in seeing the sequel, Underworld Evolution.<br /><br />#1 - I agree, but I think it is a 4 star movie.<br /><br />#2 - Tough, I'm the one typing.<br /><br />#1 - You're lucky it's not a full moon...<br /><br />#2 - So why did you give it 4 stars?<br /><br />#1 - Because you gave it 3, and I am looking for a meal...
B00005JLWN|5.0|There are few good Sci-Fi movies out there today.  This is one of the best.  It has an excellent story and the concept is very realistic, which I find very appealing.  Everyone person who has watched this movie at my suggestion, have been pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it too.  Definitely, watch this movie, I doubt you will be disappointed.

B00007JVBI|4.0|\\"You are free\\", seems very much like the rehearsal for \\"The greatest\\".  The latter has an overall fuller sound, although on both, she's refined her voice much more than on her earlier work. She evokes Sinead O'Connor while maintaining her very own signature sound at the same time. <br /> <br />\\"You are free\\" also owes a lot to Liz Phair's 1993 debut album in that both share a very \\"do it yourself\\" sparse feel (check out \\"He war\\" as a case in point).   <br /> <br />The arrangements are heartachingly stark and beautiful.   <br /> <br />Sometimes you can tell when a musician's sound is influenced by heroin. I might be wrong, but I think that sound is here.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love the show and this CD I love the CD because there happy songs there sad songs and great singers some of the songs are relly touching and meaningful. There are a lot of shows I love but Wicked's  muisc wins. I do not know any one who does not love this muisc so if you do not buy this CD you will regret for the rest of your life.

1401308201|4.0|This book has all a Wicked fan could ask for. From cast members to pictures and from songs to scrpit and much more I saw the show and bought the Grimmerie. I got it for $40 but it was worth it this book has everything and the pictures and cover are nice. They have the words to all the songs they have the story of wicked from brainstroming to broadway and they have the scrpit. They also have all the cast members talking about their charecter. And I lot more speicle stuff that you will have to see when you buy the book. So if you love like or just think Wicked is o.k. you have to get this book.
B000028U0Y|5.0|With the release of Walk The Line, I, like many people who were for the first time REALLY introduced to Johnny Cash, purchased this item because the movie moved me.  There's something different about this live CD that's different from any other live recording I've purchased and that is just the realism of the performance.  An example is when he calls June to the stage to sing Jackson with him.  He tells her how pretty she looks and she came back with a polite, yet smarty comment.   <br />The only thing that confuses me is I'm not 100% sure this is the first recording, because Johnny says something like \\"the last time we were here at Folsom...\\".  I guess I'll research that. <br />In short, it's a must for anyone who loved Walk The Line.
B00005JOFO|5.0|What a great movie!  The storyline was intriguing and compelling throughout.  The acting was superb as was the beautiful Canadian mountains and streams.  I have purchased very few DVDs for my home collection, but I will definitely add this one.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Franz Ferdinand outdid themselves on this second album, producing a more consistently entertaining lineup of songs.  While songs like 'Take Me Out' are instant classics, just about every song off this album gets better each time it is played.  I would list song favorites, but I would end up filling the screen.  Now I know the answer to 'Do You Want To'...heck yes!
076113719X|2.0|In theory, this is a great concept.  For a busy family, however, the space to write daily stuff is simply too limited/small. We also had trouble getting used to the days of the week going \\"north to south\\" rather than the conventional left to right. It's a great idea-it just did not work for our family. From the previous reviews, it would appear we're in the minority!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The Matrix Revolutions has great graphics and great action, and it's pretty touching too--a surprise for most action-based films.

Except for those slight \\"Hollywood moments,\\" this film rocks on every level--it's full of great special effects, thoughtful introspection (it's got a great meaning) and some superb acting (except for those constant stereotypical curses). Overall, extremely satisfying.

B0006Z2KYI|4.0|To Be or Not To Be is a comedy set during WWII. Although it makes light of a tense time in history, it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease. The story revolves around two actors in Poland, Maria and Joseph Tura. Joseph (Jack Benny) specializes in overplaying Hamlet and Maria (Carole Lombard) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his \\"To be or not to be\\" speech. The man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation. Although she is working for the Allies, a Nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause. Madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess.<br /><br />The film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue and acting. It is a real shame that Carole Lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash; she proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne.
B00005JNZJ|2.0|As you know, `Aeon Flux' has been either ignored or dismissed as nonsense by the critics, and its results on the US box-office are certainly not what the producers would have expected them to be. So here is a question: Is this so bad? If bad, how bad? <br /> <br />I finally saw the film, and at first I thought these critics were wrong. The earlier chapters, in which heroine Aeon Flux appears as ninja-like deadly assassin, are full of rip-roaring sequences that are fun to see, and there are many good ideas in them such as the deadly turf. Though I have not seen the original MTV series, I thought Charlize Theron (and her black costumes, if not her hairstyle) brings life to the thin story that betrays its origin. <br /> <br />But sadly `Aeon Flux' loses steam too soon, after she encounters the target Trevor (Marton Csokas) the leader of this futuristic, totalitarian society. Except for the secrets surrounding Trevor and Aeon, the film has little to tell, and that little is not very interesting. The film also has Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner), Aeon's partner Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo), but their characters have not much to do in the story. Even two veterans such as Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite are buries in the CGI-created halo and the heavy make-up. <br /> <br />But if only there are healthy amount of good actions, every flaw would be forgiven. Sorry, but Karyn Kusama, who directed acclaimed `Girlfight' five years ago, may not be the right choice after all, for she fails to keep the film's good pace in the second half, slackening it with dull and uninspired actions. The concluding part is very disappointing, nothing that you have seen in sci-fi better actions like `Equilibrium.' <br /> <br />Now I checked out the informative site of Rotten Tomatoes, and found that as many as four critics cited the name of `Catwoman' in order to mercilessly ridicule `Aeon Flux.' The unkind comparison is understandable. These two films both contain talented (and safe to say beautiful) Oscar-winners; both have one strong woman in its central role; and both define the meaning of `stylish action' in a quite unique way. Add to them `Tomb Raider' if you like and what can you have? Three Oscar winners and three very good-looking posters.
B000002O5L|2.0|Nice enough as car muzak, unremarkabale otherwise.<br />Among other things, nobody bothered to point out to Mr. Petty that it was I Won't Back Down, not we Won't Back Down. Perhaps a calculated insult to the Man in Black?
B000E1YVZU|5.0|RENT was/is a musical driven by the songs of the characters, not the scenery.  The songs have regained their energy, and so the movie drove me to tears even more than the Broadway show (which I have seen a few times with different casts).  The movie isn't the show, but I can't blame it for not being what it cannot be. <br /> <br />The \\"bonus disc\\" is worth the price of the movie.  The deletion of the song \\"Goodbye, Love\\" was a crime (naming a chapter of the movie \\"Goodbye, Love\\" added insult to injury), and I watch the song in the \\"deleted scenes\\" part of the bonus disc more than the movie.  Another decision was the ending: I much prefer the alternate ending that is on the bonus disc. <br /> <br />Critically, the movie just isn't as stark as what the stage version presents.  The buildings are a bit too clean, the central characters look too put-together.  The Bohemians are too Fifth Avenue, not Avenue C.  As movie adaptations of musicals go, this is one of the better ones.  I appreciate how the camera angles force me to see reaction shots from characters - on Broadway, you tend to look at the person singing.  The movie forces me at times to focus on a character's reaction to what is being sung, which enhances the song. <br /> <br />As for the homophobic comments that have been posted in some earlier reviews, they speak for themselves.  Their message of hate is exactly what RENT speaks against.  As a Presbyterian minister, the scene of Angel's funeral represented a sincere and God-honoring faith that is often missing from our churches. <br /> <br />In the end, the movie accomplishes for me what the show did on an emotional level: it simultaneously gives me a feeling of hope, an appreciation for life and the desire to live each day to the fullest, AND a renewed commitment to remember the less fortunate among us.  That's worth owning. <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|Bravo to the director, bravo to the actors (especially Ledger) bravo to the writers and producers.  Brokeback Mountain is one of the best films that I have seen in several years.  Not since some of the all-time great films has a movie captured the love, anguish, fear, disgust and helpless of two people caught in a situation of which they have no control.  Brokeback will be discussed for many years to come and in time will find it placed ranked as one of the top ten films produced.  Bravo!
B00005HG66|5.0|Moondance is one of my favourite Van Morrison albums, a classic on a level with Astral Weeks and Tupelo Honey. There's a moving description of the numinous in the song And It Stoned Me, which recounts an experience with a childhood friend. The playful arrangement of Moondance with its jazzy infusions celebrates a different kind of magic. His voice turns tender and subdued for the gentle love song Crazy Love but goes into full R&B mode for the soulful Caravan. Every note seems to be in exactly the right place on this masterpiece of an album with its exquisite arrangements whilst the words are sheer poetry, as in the yearning Into The Mystic. Slower songs like Mystic and faster ones like the buoyant ditty Come Running alternate with great effect. Every composition is special and memorable, whether it's a love song like These Dreams Of You or a more overtly devotional piece like Brand New Day. The poetic lyrics, evocative melodies and Van's varied vocal styles all contribute to the sonic splendour of Moondance.
B000AP04MO|4.0|Let me begin by saying that if you are looking for a blast from the past, this is one of those movies.  The 1966 fashions, the local, and the switchbacks in the time line make this a real enjoyable movie.  Albert Finney is SO young and shows his early acting chops that make him the star he is today.  Audrey Hepburn is her usual beautiful self, taking me back to my boyhood when I was so in love with her then and miss her radiance today.  Well, and then there is the Henry Mancini score, which will go on in your mind long after the movie ends.  William Daniels is also great as the efficiency expert trying to enjoy a vacation.

B000001FP8|5.0|I was 14 when \\"New Jersey\\" was released in 1990 and remember being bowled over by how much Bon Jovi had matured in their sound from \\"Slippery When Wet\\" and thinking, \\"These guys are here to stay.\\"<br /><br />\\"Slippery When Wet\\" sounds more dated than \\"New Jersey\\" as sounds change in nannoseconds in the music industry, never mind four years.  John and the Boys wrote and recorded some great ballads, \\"I'll Be There For You\\" and \\"Living In Sin,\\" and created feel-good tunes such as \\"Bad Medicine.\\"<br /><br />While watching some Bon Jovi videos recently on cable, I smiled when I thought about a time when you could turn on TV and watch a video and not a glorified porno short (if that sounds patronizing, my apologies, but there's no other way I can put it).  Those guys never age!<br /><br />\\"New Jersey\\" was quite the departure from the group's previous albums.  It represented a change for the 1990's and beyond.<br /><br />Two thumbs up ... and then some!
0553381407|5.0|When I read the reviews for this book, I was thinking that it was a very narrowly defined work for a very narrowly defined subset of people - it isn't.  It's about relationships - the kinds we have with our parents, our children, our spouses and ourselves. <br /> <br />I got this book for my nephews, as they've been going through a difficult separation; their father is about as toxic as a human being can get.  As I don't believe in recommending books to others that I haven't read myself, I sat down and read this book cover-to-cover - in two weeks. <br /> <br />I'm not a particular fan of psychology, as it has a tendency (in some of its schools of thought) to become a subjective pseudo-science, nor am I particularly fond of self-help books with their childish mantras.  I also believe that every person is ultimately responsible for his/her own actions.   <br /> <br />Having said that, however, this book is a standout.  I believe that it has something to say to nearly everyone.  It brings self-destructive behaviors out into the open and addresses them, rather than the status quo of pretending that they don't exist.  In our formative years we learn by observing (especially our parents) and in many cases in what we observed there are negative influences that impact us and our ability to form/develop/maintain healthy relationships.  Many of us have relationships within our families that are far from healthy. <br /> <br />Its provocative title aside, this book is about self-discovery and self-healing.  Even for those whose relationships are so perfectly healthy as to make this book redundant, this book is a great study of relationships and the learning and transmission of behaviors that might still provide intellectual stimulation.

1400049628|4.0|I am a relatively new fan of zombie fiction (movies, comics, etc.), having just started to really enjoy the genre in the last few years, and I've been looking forward to reading this book ever since I learned of its existence a few months ago. I've got mixed feelings about the result. The book is a lot of fun, but it's not funny.<br /><br />Although labeled as \\"humor,\\" perhaps \\"satire\\" would be more accurate. The book precicely mimics typical \\"survival guides,\\" using the idea of a zombie outbreak as his catastrophe of choice. He covers virtually every scenario one could expect to encounter, gives a rundown of various types of weaponry and which are the best, how to survive in virtually any climate should you find yourself there during a zombie outbreak, and even a detailed timeline of all \\"documented\\" zombie attacks.<br /><br />The resultant book is something that is quite entertaining for someone who is familiar with the genre and knows the stories and conventions that Brooks is lampooning. What the book isn't, however, is funny. I think I laughed just one time in the entire 272 pages. The writing is so spot-on that you lose the knee-slappers.<br /><br />Another mark in this book's favor is how meticulous Brooks is. Even for something so outlandish, it seems that he's put a considerable amount of research into it (and not just watching zombie movies, but into how various weapons and vehicles function, among other things). The result is a book so well-constructed that it could serve as an invaluable resource for anyone attempting to write a zombie story of their own. (This is what a stupid character would do, this is what a smart character would do, this is what would most likely happen with this tactic, etc.).<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book, but to call it \\"humor\\" is somewhat innacurate. It's just fun for people who dig zombies.
B00005JNX0|4.0|The animals of New York Zoo have a good life. They get food on demand and the public adore them, but Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) still pines for the wild. After a botched escape attempt lands him and his friends on a remote beach, the animals have to learn to fend for themselves. Striking a perfect balance between wit, slapstick and self-awareness, Madagascar is as fluffy as a meringue and twice as tasty.<br /><br />From the moment that Marty bounds delightedly across the screen to the ironic strains of Born Free, it's clear that we're dealing with DreamWorks the minds that brought us Shrek. While the brilliant boffins of Pixar concern themselves with timeless stories, Spielberg's gang has always been about the jokes. The noisy, zeitgeisty attitude of DreamWorks' toons can be disastrous - witness the bloated bling of Shark Tale - but Madagascar hits the mark with all four hooves.<br /><br />\\"PLEASURABLY DEVOID OF SENTIMENT\\"<br /><br />Ben Stiller is on typically neurotic form as Alex, a friendly lion whose taste for steak sets him apart from his herbivorous pals, and there's good work from David Schwimmer as a hypochondriac giraffe. But it's the background detail that makes Madagascar roar, from the party-mad lemur tribe led by Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G), to a quartet of psychotic penguins. It's also a pleasure to see a cartoon so determinedly devoid of sentiment, a stance confirmed by the hilarious demise of an angelic little duckling. Highly recommended for kids and adults.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|This album does not tries to break boundaries or be Pink Floyd alike. It is a mistake to compare this album with Floyd's music and although you can find some similarities with Obscured by Clouds and Gilmour's early songs with the band until Meddle, this work is best compared with Gilmour's solo releases, specially the first one 'David Gilmour'. On an Island fulfils almost everything a Gilmour fan is expecting, perhaps the only drawback is that there is'nt a flag song that identifies the album nor an impressive rock guitar solo: 'On an Island', 'This Heaven', 'Then I Close my eyes' and 'Take a Breath' (the most Floyd like) are more recognizable from the others, but this is because the mood and flow of the album makes it feel this way, not because of a lack of quality in any of the songs. The instrumental 'Red Sky at Night' sounds like some of the instrumental Eno colaborations with David Bowie in Low and Heroes while 'Smile' has a similar feeling to Fat Old Sun.  In a nutshell, this is a good work that is appreciated better after some listens. If you are looking for trippy end edgy music, you should look in the original source: Pink Floyd
B00001QEE9|5.0|This animated Disney movie is a timeless classic that contains all the elements of a great story.  The characters are incredibly well animated and sympathetic.  Pinocchio finds himself routinely, and often naively, getting into trouble even when he tries to keep out of trouble.  This classic has action, excitement and cleverly hidden morals to delight all family members.<br /><br />Lonely woodcarver Geppetto (voiced by the late veteran actor Christian Rub) carves a wooden boy that he names Pinocchio.  Geppetto longs for the family he never had, most particularly, a child.  The Blue Fairy (voiced by Evelyn Venable, who has a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame) hears and feels Geppetto's longing, and gives the wooden boy life.  The Blue Fairy also promises that Pinocchio will have an opportunity to become a real boy.  The Blue Fairy also gives Pinocchio (voiced by Dickie Jones, who had an extensive film career as a child) a conscience in the form of Jiminy Cricket (voiced by Cliff Edwards, who voiced Jiminy Cricket nearly to his death in 1971, and who also appeared in \\"Gone with the Wind\\").<br /><br />Almost as soon as Pinocchio goes out into the world, ostensibly to go to school, he encounters mischief in the form of Honest John (voiced by the late veteran star Walter Catlett, who appeared in many movies such as \\"Friendly Persuasion,\\" \\"The Inspector General,\\" and \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\").  Honest John quickly sees opportunity in selling Pinocchio to a showman.  Pinocchio gets out of trouble and then right back into trouble, ending up in Pleasure Island where boys make jackasses (another word for donkey) out of themselves.  Fortunately Pinocchio escapes before completely changing into a donkey.<br /><br />However, Pinocchio's troubles are just beginning.  When Pinocchio returns home he discovers that Geppetto has gone searching for him, and has yet to return.  Learning the Monstro the Whale may have swallowed Geppetto, Pinocchio goes seeking Monstro, finding him.  The encounter with Monstro, the rescue of Geppetto and the end of this movie forms one of the greatest endings of any animated movie.<br /><br />I was quite fascinated by the difference of opinions between reviewers regarding this movie.  Most reviewers find Pinocchio to be a great classic tale of innocence and selflessness.  However, a small minority of reviewers finds Pinocchio to be scary for young children, or they believe the acting and singing to be horrible.<br /><br />I watched Pinocchio as a very small child, and was absolutely in love with the movie.  Had VCRs or DVDs existed back in the 1960s, I would have insisted that we have Pinocchio so I could watch it again (and again).  We need to permit our children to understand fear so that they may conquer their fear.  I am unafraid of whales, though sharks make me nervous.  I saw \\"Jaws\\" as an adult.  Which do you think had the greater effect on me?<br /><br />As for the singing, many people find that Cliff Edwards' singing sends chills down their back.  I am similarly impressed.  Few people are able to put the kind of emotion into a song the way Cliff Edwards did; certainly very few in this era of throwaway pop.  The score and the song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" received two Academy Awards and an ASCAP award.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was very good.  Animated films tend to be a bit dramatic because they are often larger-than-life, and the acting well matched the animation in this movie.  I consider the acting in this movie to be phenomenal when compared to the acting in other animated films.<br /><br />Walt Disney created an animation masterpiece with Pinocchio.  This film came during a creative peak for Disney, along with the great, experimental and often misunderstood \\"Fantasia.\\"  This movie is a rarity among movies in that it is suitable for all normal family members.  The youngest members of the family may benefit from adult attendance to explain certain aspects of the movie.  This movie does contain anumber of very wonderful and subtle morals that Walt Disney smoothly integrated with the story.  Lovers of family films and animated films will absolutely need this one for their collection.

B00009AQMJ|5.0|I must warn the reader that I write this (and any other) review mainly for my own pleasure, and to (hopefully and to some reasonable extent clearly) convey to any other person my ideas about what I like or don't like about a recording (hoping to gain some sympathy, consequently ;-). I do not have any true musical knowledge whatsoever: I can't read music and I do not have any knowledge about any of the technical aspects of music as such. So necessarily, any and every review I lay down before you is simply the result of what I hear and feel are the characteristics and/or differences between certain recordings, and what I love about them ...<br /><br />If I may be allowed to draw a comparison between different performances, I would like to compare these recordings with the ones by Howard Shelley (on Chandos). Elsewhere I have described those performances by Howard Shelley as finely crafted, whereby every note is - to my ear - given extra poignancy. The recordings of Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto's by Earl Wild are different. They are more bold performances in the 'romantic' (?) manner maybe, whereby the melodies are played with beautiful legato and are given extra sweep and grandure (helped by the orchestra), with astounding technical bravoura (I can't read music, but this should be obvious even to me?!).<br /><br />Anyhow, I love these performances, as they are bold, sweeping, full-blooded, with such beautiful (what I would, for lack of a better word, like to call 'singing' or 'soaring') legato. My favorite would be Piano Concerto No. 4. Also, the Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini here receives - to my ears - a wonderfully noble performance, full of technical bravoura (also by the orchestra). (It is certainly one of my favorite pieces for piano and orchestra!)<br /><br />Nobility of playing is also a defining characteristic everywhere in these recordings, I think, but as a result of this nobility (and maybe exultancy), there may have been a slight loss of lyricism and intimacy in the Second Concerto ... Anyhow, the recorded sound is very full and wide, so that one is able to revel in all of the orchestral and pianistic colors. These are heart-warmingly virtuosic, classic performances that - to the ears of this particular amateur listener - lift this music to a higher plain of excellence, and I - for what it is worth - would like to recommend them to you without reserve.e Second Concerto ...

B00005NB8K|4.0|This was a wonderful film, ValKilmer's best in my opinion. As Jim Morrison Kilmer gets to the core of the inner and oft hidden demons with all of us. <br /> <br /> <br />Although achieving wealth,fame and success Morrisson is haunted by a mystical figure who appears to be calling him toward his destiny a destiny which Jim seems so eager to meet and embrace. <br /> <br /> <br />Morrison personifies all that was rock and roll in the 60's , sex drugs and seeminly a taste for pushing ones'self to the limits of physical and psychological exhausion. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|\\"Two Thumbs Up\\"-Ebert and Roeper. \\"Must see film of the year \\"-Paul Clinton CNN.  There is no better way to describe this masterpiece in theater and on the big screen. Jonathon Larson's intriguing story of the life of a group of Bohemian friends living in NYC in the late 80's struggling to find money to pay their rent and to find true love.  Amidst their struggles, most of the characters develop AIDS, and learn along with audiences to \\"measure your life in love.\\"  This story is based on love and loss.  The characters learn to treasure each day with the people they love because before you know it, they may no longer be with you.  <br /> Under the direction of Chris Columbus, this movie is perfectly cast and performed in a touching manner.  The actors portray their roles in such a believable way that they almost become the characters.  You become so attached to the performances of Mimi (Rosario Dawson), Roger (Adam Pascal), and Collins (Jesse L. Martin.)  I could feel the energy and friendship of the cast right through the screen.  <br /> The phenomenal voices of the cast were coupled with a unique music score.  This music was updated from show tunes to pop-rock masterpieces which fit together like a puzzle to form a story and give each character a distinct and very different personality.  <br /> I thoroughly recommend this movie.  I recommend it to all people because it teaches life lessons in a fun and enjoyable manner.
B0002GTWYW|3.0|Great album, Juicy is probably my favourite song on the album.  I had to drop 1 or 2 stars because of Puff Daddy talking all over the records.  I didn't notice it the first time I listened to it, but when I noticed Puff Daddy's annoying voice and echo effect, it just ruined the album for me.
B00000J7JO|5.0|One word comes to mind when I first heard this album.  WOW.  The way that RHCP changes from Funk/Rap (Around the World) to soft, harmonic rock (Californication, Otherside) and everything in between.  The band really pulled a good one here. Great CD. <br /> <br />Around the World - 9 <br />Get on Top - 7 <br />Californication - 9.5 <br />Easily - 8.5 <br />Porcelain - 7 <br />Emit Remmus - 8 <br />I Like Dirt - 8.5 (Strange song...) <br /> <br />all the rest are around an 8. <br /> <br />Total CD Rating : 9.75/10
B000001ESP|5.0|This is one of Rush's most well-known albums, and for good reason! The band shows signs of shedding their progressive rock past and moving towards a more commercial, 80s sound. Tom Sawyer is a classic, you may know this song even if you don't know who Rush is. It has a nice synth intro and that familiar verse \\"A modern day warrior, mean mean stride, today's Tom Sawyer, mean mean pride.\\" I love Alex's playing on this song, and Neil's drumming is some of his best. YYZ is probably Rush's best known instrumental. Alex plays some amazing riffs and solos here. Limelight is another classic that I am sure most people have heard. That opening riff is just so well-known. Very melodic song indeed. Red Barchetta is a beautiful and atmospheric song, I love to kick back and relax to this song! <br /> <br />The Camera Eye is about 11 minutes long, but it doesn't drag at all, in fact it does quite the opposite. It never gets old at all, and I love that synth intro. Very 80s, but still good. Witch Hunt is a very dark song, the synth playing is downright creepy! Vital Signs is one of my favorite Rush songs of all time, it sounds like a Police song. Alex plays his guitar so well here! Awesome closing song. I really think people need to look into this album. Trust me, if you buy this album, you will not be disappointed!
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Wow, of all the glaring (no pun intended) errors that could have been made!  On the \\"re-inserted\\" shots where Paul and other Freeman characters are supposed to have blue-within-blue eyes...they DON'T!  Ooops! <br /> <br />Plus, was it really necessary to keep the Alan Smithee credit for director on the \\"Exentdo\\" version?  I mean, everybody knows its just a pseudonym, and from what I understand David Poorsport Lynch wasn't too wild about either version of this over-bashed sci-fi cornerstone. <br /> <br />The movie does look better here than on the original, and yes the extended is \\"true scope format\\".  (You can't crop scope, by the way, dude, it would look ridiculous).  Bummer they couldn't do DTS for both versions, but to be totally honest I think I'll be watching the theatrical one most often. <br /> <br />Amazon needs to drop the price though.  Wal-Mart sells it for around fifteen bucks.
B0006399FS|2.0|I'm a lifelong U2 fan . . . and alas, this album is the epitome of \\"product\\".  This band clearly is like Michael Jordan if he tried coming back a 3rd time, today - formerly the best, but now tired and way past their prime. <br /> <br />With a few decent exceptions, we've heard this all before on previous albums - MUCH better.  You can almost see the rust on their instruments.   <br /> <br />Still, track 12, the acoustic one on the limited edition, is pretty cool - they should have done a whole album like this . . . acoustic, stripped down, exploring new musical turf for them.  Something different.  That might have worked, and at least thrown a fun curveball to us fans. <br /> <br />Instead, we get a band whose charisma is intact, but songwriting skills eroded like a sandcastle at high tide.  Just gone.  This album is like 90% the ultimate rock n' roll sins - Predictable and BORING.
B0000TB05A|4.0|At this show, the band is clearly having fun and that's nice to see.  In my opinion, the setlist is a bit pedestrian and the DVD as a whole is not as good as their most recent U2 LIVE IN CHICAGO, but it's another solid performance from a great band.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This cd is clearly intended for fans of the tv series, being the soundtrack of what is perhaps the best episode of the whole seven seasons, useful if you want to listen to its music when you cannot watch the dvd.<br /><br />The episode in question is extremely complex, all the feelings and suffering of the various characters concentrated in so intense a way you really feel you face a work of art; what is perhaps the highest achieving is that its surface is shining, glossy, extremely funny: you laugh helplessly while being aware of the many dark corners.<br /><br />The soundtrack of this episode, recorded on this cd together with some orchestral music from some other episodes, fits perfectly into the script but I think the best compliment I can write is that this cd can easily stand on its own and give pleasure even to those who have no idea of what is all this sunnydale thing.<br /><br />I cannot believe Joss Whedon is not an experience musician: he was undoubtedly helped by the producers, but the melodic ideas are his and are beautiful. I have no favourite hit: I just love ALL the pieces from the hilarious \\"The Parking Ticket\\" to the rock of \\"Rest in Peace\\" through the two lines of \\"Dawn's Lament\\".<br /><br />Astonishing is the quality of the vocals: Hinton Battle is clearly a professional as is the unknown singer of \\"The Parking Ticket\\", but I was astonished by Amber Benson and James Marsters who interpret the two most catching hits, the lovely love ballad \\"Under Your Spell\\" and the good old rock of \\"Rest in Peace\\".<br /><br />The others are no great singers, but they manage professionally enough, they sing with much feeling and make the WHOLE soundtrack worth listening.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Although I am a fan of both the book and the BBC film version with Ehle and Firth I approached this version of P & P with an open mind.  It does some things very well.  The production values, landscapes, great estates, and more gritty rural feel are outstanding.  The more understated casting of Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins was effective.  Bingley's sister is superb.  Knightley is lovely by 21st century standards, but she is too thin to have been considered a Regency era \\"local beauty.\\" Judi Dench was an inspired choice as Lady Catherine but unfortunately gets only limited screen time. The distinctions of class and gentility that separate the Bennetts, Bingleys and Darcys are clearly drawn.  Now for what went wrong:  What lifts Austen's works above the average romance genre is her character development and superlative prose.  Both are lacking in this adaptation.  Neither Lizzie nor Darcy seem to change in essentials so their growing regard and sexual attraction for one another is inexplicable.  Wickham never demonstrates any hints of his true nature; why should Lizzie believe Darcy's version of events?  However, the most objectionable aspect of this film is the dialogue.  In some cases, the wording is overly modernized: Charlotte thinks that Jane should \\"snap up\\" Bingley; Lizzie refers to her love for Darcy as \\"incandescent.\\"  Words are added, changed, or eliminated in ways that do nothing to advance the plot.  And in most cases, the pace of the dialogue is so rapid that it destroys the aura of the late 18th-early 19th century.  The setting is largely preindustrial; the pace of life was slower; the characters would not have rushed through conversations.  Finally, the ending scene was so trite and saccharine that I cringed in embarassment for the screen writer and the actors.  Some reviewers have argued, with some justification, that a two hour film cannot provide the nuances of a six-hour miniseries.  That said, there have been successful adaptations of Austen's workwithin a standard movie format.  Persuasion and Sense and Sensibility come to mind as adaptations that conveyed the essence of Austen's world and words despite the time constraints involved.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane was created when Orson Welles was only 26 years old, and came out in 1941, just before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The film is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst and there were many legal battles between Welles and Hearst.<br /><br />It's always hard to read or watch a \\"classic\\" without having huge expectations - and perhaps not just enjoying the film. That's true for books you're required to read in high school as well as for movies. You might really have enjoyed reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - but if you're forced to read it and told \\"this is a great book!\\" you might not enjoy it at all.<br /><br />Let me say first why this is a classic. There are a TON of visual puns, lighting effects, production effects, that had never been used before. The in-focus effects were spectacular when this movie came out. It was an incredible groundbreaker - one that inspired thousands of other filmmakers. If you weren't around in 1941, then in essence everything you watch is \\"based\\" on this. It's like praising Edgar Allen Poe for writing mysteries, if you love mysteries that exist now. They draw their origin from that spectacular start.<br /><br />If you were born after 1941, you might say \\"well that's interesting, but I don't have to like the pyramids of Egypt to like modern architecture. I like Van Halen even though some of their songs were really written by classic blues artists 40+ years earlier; I don't like the blues original songs. I like current stuff and don't care about what it was based on.\\"<br /><br />That is of course true, and a human trait. So if you're not a fan of \\"tracing the roots\\" of movies you love, let's just take the movie itself as a standalone entity - as the story of a man.<br /><br />Orson Wells made this as his very first movie - and he not only acted in it but also directed it. He was a newbie. He did some amazing things in his very first attempt every to make a movie. To start with, you as the viewer are really \\"drawn in\\" to the movie in a way that most movies don't do. The interviewer is usually in the lower right, i.e. sort of where you, the audience, are sitting. You and the interviewer are both directly talking to and interacting with the people on the screen.<br /><br />Kane was \\"stolen\\" from his family at a very young age - raised by strangers, sent off to schools and training. He grew up alone, with only some friends to keep him company. He decides when just out of college to run a newspaper, sort of a lark. He has great ideals - to help the little man. Once he gets a taste of power and public affection, he gets addicted to it. He begins to create stories that don't really exist, to \\"make world events happen\\". He starts to manipulate the people around him to get him more and more attention. When he gets abandoned, you feel sorry for him - but you also know it's completely his own fault.<br /><br />These aren't just random vague events that are happening in outer space. They are very personal events happening to a \\"real person\\" - this was of course based on real life events of that era. Not only that, but they could happen to any of us. We all have tasks that we do, that bring us joy. We all have the potential to have growth with our dreams - but if we got that growth, would we do \\"good\\" with that power, or would we start to be tainted? If we had power over those we love, would we use it 100% for their own good, or would we do subtle things that made US happy and not necessarily them? How many parents, for example, pushed kids to go to a particular college because it appealed to the parent, even if it wasn't the perfect match for the child's personality?<br /><br />This obviously isn't a hack and slash movie with a lot of combat and violence. It's a movie about the trade-offs we all make as we go for our dreams, find success, find failure, try to make love work. This isn't the story of a 23 year old having a fun college life. It's the story of the full life of a man - from sad, lonely young child, to idealistic young man, to a sad, lonely old man.<br /><br />The way life affects us - and the way in which our choices affect our life - are universal concepts that are really important to pretty much every human being. It might be that some particular humans might not care yet. Certainly I remember for example when I was a teenager that I didn't give a lot of thought to the nebulous \\"long off future\\". Now that I'm a bit older, though, the thoughts of choices made, opportunities missed and long term goals are very important to me. Citizen Kane is a very touching portrayal of one man's journey through the years.oung child, to idealistic young man, to a sad, lonely old man.<br /><br />The way life affects us - and the way in which our choices affect our life - are universal concepts that are really important to pretty much every human being.

B000E1155E|2.0|Riding on the current 'band of the moment' hype that has been the norm for U.K. bands that 'cross the pond' for as long as I can remember----- the Arctic Monkeys are a decent band (forgiving what could be one of the stupidest names I have come across) with a few catchy tunes, but there is nothing to really make them stand out amongst a very strong wave of newer acts.  The singles will invite a few repeated listens and may find their way onto a compilation disc/MP3 player while the album itself will be filed in the collection.  I hope that these guys enjoy the ride------(whatever happened to \\"Ride\\" anyway....)
B000BJS4TO|5.0|Loved it....the music transports you instantly. Be sure to read the book which is amazing!

0767812166|5.0|Movie-5 stars, extras 0 stars, tranfer for Blu-ray (anamorphic widescreen I might add) 4 stars<br /><br />As those who have seen the film know Bridges plays an alien sent to Earth after having encountered the a voyager space craft. Using DNA from the deceased husband of a woman (Karen Allen) still grieving, she ends up helping the alien elude the government.<br /><br />\\"Starman\\" plays as an adult version of \\"E.T.\\" Minus the manipulation and had the misfortune of being released after \\"E.T.\\" Even though it was written around the time.<br /><br />Sadly the special features of the deluxe DVD from the UK are not included. It's odd that So y elected not to port over the commentary track with Carpenter and featurettes from that edition as they already paid for them and own the rights. Unfortunately we haven't seen an anniversary edition released with the MIA special features.<br /><br />The transfer itself is exceptionally good with solid blacks, no evidence of fading and excellent detail. The audio also sounds terrific with a lossless, crisp presentation but dialog remains clear. Subtitles are available in English for the film.<br /><br />I'd still recommend the Blu-ray even without special features but am really surprised that so little effort was put into this release.
B000E1155E|4.0|The Artic Monkeys had I not heard all the buzz being raised about them would've been a group that I probably would've never checked out and still after the buzz I hesitated whether I wanted to or not.  Of course, I ultimately decided to give the British group a try and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />In my opinion, The Artic Monkeys are more impressive than the Scottish Indie-Rockers Franz Ferdinand.  However, while WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY I AM THATS WHAT I'M NOT is very deserving of the accolades that it has and is currently receiving, it was still the slightest bit overhyped, just like Franz Ferdinand.  While this is a very impressive debut, it isn't say a record shattering debut nor is it particularly the best rock release of the year. Despite its flaws, this is a very good group who<br /><br />could potentially be an even greater group with time.<br /><br />The most positive aspect of WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY I AM... is the songwriting.  The lyrics are very potent and very well written.  It never leaves you hanging where lyrics are concerned.  Also, the music is very strong and very good. It is reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s guitars sounds.  The vocals are also very strong without having the earthy grit of say Julian Casablancas (The Strokes).  Among my favorites on this album are \\"The View From The Afternoon\\" and \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor\\".  For anyone hesitant about purchasing this overall fine album, don't be because you won't be disappointed.

0553382179|2.0|Normally, when I review a book, I tend to read the lesser reviews (three stars or less) and see what others didn't like about it along with some of the higher reviews.  I wish I would have done that here because I probably would have passed on this one.   <br /> <br />I got this based on a review I read in a catalog that I order from  quite a bit, so I figured that it must be good.  When I first started reading, I noticed that she was quite religious.  I can overlook that (I'm used to that as I'm not a Christian) but it was a persistent theme throughout the entire book to the point where it was turning me off.  Like others, I got the feel that this book is more for a woman that either does not work at all, or works part-time, which is not me.  Along with other people who gave it low marks, I found the book to be a bit syrupy and at times hokey.  I also noticed that it didn't really give any good advice on de-cluttering, just to do it.   <br /> <br />After reading and digesting the entire book, this is not a system that would not be compatible with me.  I work third shift at an industrial complex with forced overtime; I have no choice if my boss tells me that I have to work more than my regular shift.  I also tend to be a 'green' person and find ways to save energy, like putting clothes in the dryer for a short time, then letting them air dry (trust me, it does wonders for the energy bill).  So much for getting my laundry done in one day.  Like others, I noticed that there were several beaming reviews on how this system 'saved' people from CHAOS, if I wanted to read those, I would have gone to the website.   <br /> <br />This book is not without merit.  My sister, who works regular hours, is more religious, a single parent, and is just as much of a clutter bug as I am, found this book to be QUITE helpful.  She has been able to keep house better than I have ever seen.  I did find some helpful nuggets like setting a timer, cleaning in small sessions, and taking a breakhere and there.  I'm still up in the air on the control journal, as I'm sick and tired of every self-help book telling me to keep a journal.  I'd have a stack of them reaching the ceiling and I'd be so busy writing in them, that I'd have no time to do anything else.  <br /> <br />All in all, if you are someone that has a scedule or life 'in the  norm', this could help you out.  If you don't, I would pass and look for something that's more flexible.
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Chicken Little is a cute movie for the little kids.  We know the back story.  Chicken Little cries that the sky is falling, the sky is falling and it turns out that the sky wasn't actually falling.  So what happened after the story ended?  Well, what if I told you that the sky really was falling?  Chicken Little was just not able to prove to the town that the sky did fall, they all thought it was an acorn that fell onto his head.  The movie is about everything that comes after, with a baseball game, silly friends, a falling sky, aliens, and redemption, of course.<br /><br />Like I said, this is a cute movie for the little kids.  The target audience will love this.  The animation is cute and quite pretty, and there is plenty of silly fun.  My wife called me midway through the movie and asked what I thought.  My response was that it was \\"cute, but I really don't care at all.\\"  There isn't much of a storyline to speak of and that won't matter to the little ones.  Unfortunately this isn't a movie that will appeal to all ages, but it is perfectly safe for the kids.  As the kids are the target audience, it was a well done job by Disney.  It wasn't a good enough job to rank with the classic Disney films, but it is also far better than something like Kronk's New Groove.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry

015670160X|5.0|In her most playful and exuberant novel, Virginia Woolf writes the \\"historical biography\\" of Orlando, a young boy of nobility during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.  A wild ride through four centuries, the novel shows Orlando aging, magically, only thirty-six years between 1588 and 1928.  Even more magically, he also changes from a man to a woman.  As she explores Orlando's life, Woolf also explores the differing roles of men and women in society during various periods, ultimately concluding that one's role as a man or woman is determined by society, rather than by birth.<br /><br />From the Elizabethan period, during which Orlando works as a steward for the queen and also serves as her lover, he progresses to the reign of James I, experiencing a profound love for a Russian princess, Sasha, who is herself exploring the role of a man.  When the relationship ends, he retreats, devastated, to his estate, with its 365 rooms and 52 staircases, which he redecorates over the next few years.  An interlude in which he is wooed by the Archduchess Harriet/Archduke Harry leads to his ambassadorship to Constantinople, a period spent with the gypsies, and his eventual return to England--as a woman.  New experiences and observations await her there.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Woolf matches her prose style to the literary style of the period in which Orlando lives, creating always-changing moods and sheer delight for the reader.  Some constants continue throughout the four centuries of Orlando's life.  Orlando is always a writer, always recording his thoughts, and always adding to a poem he has begun as a child entitled \\"The Oak Tree.\\"  He is always returning to his 365-room house whenever he needs to recuperate from his experiences, and some characters repeat through time.  (Orlando is betrayed by Nick Greene during the reign of James I, but he is encouraged by Nicholas Greene in the Victorian period.)<br /><br />Literary historians make much of the fact that Woolf modeled Orlando on Vita Sackville-West, Woolf's lover, and that this study of gender roles was an early exploration of lesbianism, bisexuality, cross-dressing, and transgender identities.  The novel is pure fun to read, however, and though it raises serious and thoughtful questions about sexuality and the ways that it controls our lives, there is no sense that Woolf wrote the novel specifically to make a public statement or prove a point.  Her themes of gender and its relation to social expectations, of imagination and its relation to reality, of the importance of history in our lives, and of the unlimited potential of all humans, regardless of their sex, transcend the specific circumstances under which Woolf may have written the book.  A playful and delightful novel, which broke new ground with its publication.  n  Mary Whipplele-West, Woolf's lover, and that this study of gender roles was an early exploration of lesbianism, bisexuality, cross-dressing, and transgender identities.

B000BTGY7I|4.0|In response to the first review about the Superbit DVD, I thought it would've been the ORIGINAL from the SPECIAL EDITION version, but I was wrong and I did throw my receipt away.  For those who made the same mistake I made, you can buy the SINGLE-DISC EDITION, which is the same 'Disc I' as in the SPECIAL EDITION version.  Once that part is accomplished, you could try and pawn off the DELUXE EDITION SUPERBIT disc somewhere or hand it off to a good friend...*Shrug* that's what I did.<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * *<br /><br />Snatch is one of those rare movies where you might not be expecting much out of it, but when you see it, you fall in love with it and it only gets better everytime you see it.  Guy Ritchie (the director) had won a british award for Best Promising Newcomer Director for his previous film 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrell's' which I have not seen yet, but I will be sure to.  Snatch won some british awards as well for: Best Director, Actor (Vinnie Jones), and one for Sound Editing.  Vinnie Jones (Bullet-Tooth Tony) did give a fine performance for not having much acting experience according to his own words, along with Dennis Farina (Cousin Avi), which he always cracked me up in the movie.  Now...You've got Brad Pitt (Fight Club, SE7EN, Ocean's 11/12, etc...), who plays a gypsy, which doesn't have a lot of character when he makes his first appearance, but makes quite an impression when you find out he's a bare-knuckle championship star, along with his fights in the ring with Jason Statham (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrell's) and Stephen Graham (Gangs Of New York)...I wish Benicio Del Toro (Traffic [Won award for BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR], Hunted, The Way of the Gun) was in the movie more as the famous, Franky Four-Fingers...Was a promising character from the beginning.  The DELUXE EDITION is great, the scrap book from the movie was fun to cruise through, but I didn't really understand the purpose of the poker set...The cards are cool and creative, heh.  Finally, the Superbit DVD...I remember reading on the back that there a couple features it was suppose to have on it like the Director/Producer commentary, along with the \\"Stealing Stones\\" Enhanced Branching Mode...They weren't on it...That's when I read the review down below about the correct disc, which is why I only gave this review 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall, the movie is fast-paced, dark, with that Pulp Fiction-type humor, and funny as hell (is reminded of the squeeking dog).  Own it, but remember to get the SPECIAL EDITION, or if you do get the disappointing DELUXE EDITION, keep your receipt and trade it in for the correct 'Disc I'the Superbit DVD...I remember reading on the back that there a couple features it was suppose to have on it like the Director/Producer commentary, along with the \\"Stealing Stones\\" Enhanced Branching Mode...They weren't on it...That's when I read the review down below about the correct disc, which is why I only gave this review 4 stars instead of 5.

B000AARKO4|5.0|I should admit that I am not a special effects guru, nor do I appreciate bloody, gory scenes (of which this film has plenty). I will also admit that the blacksmith-turned-knight angle can feel a bit forced and therefore be tough to swallow. In spite of these shortcomings, however, I still enthusiastically rank Kingdom of Heaven as one of my favorite films.  <br /> <br />Unlike many movies of the day, it is not riddled with historical inaccuracies, a breath of fresh air. Further, contrary to what a previous reviewer suggested, the film does not demonize one faith over another. Rather, the movie shows that people of both faiths are generally good, while depicting the troubles that a hothead (at least one on each side) can cause. In doing so, KoH does a remarkable job of demonstrating that we are all more alike than we are different; sadly, this simple understanding continues to elude us today. There are some phenomenal scenes to this effect with some great lines, and I found the acting to my liking. <br /> <br />This movie is *not* Gladiator. I prefer Kingdom of Heaven, but because it ultimately sends a true and desperately needed message (and one that is politically and personally applicable today), not because the fight scenes and plotline are flawless. Be warned: you will *not* enjoy this movie if you are married to your assumptions about people of different faiths or if you expect a battle between bad guys and good guys. If, however, you seek a better (albeit somewhat simplified) understanding of the historical context to the current unrest, I highly recommend this film to you.

B000EGDC0A|3.0|It's been a good couple months for dance music with songs by Annie and the group formally known as Astaire, Blondfire making songs for the dancefloor that doesn't absolutely suck, not to mention rock bands like Franz Ferdinand that make song that even I can dance too. Now you can add Goldfrapp to the list of dance artist that you don't need to be high on ecstasy to enjoy with the release of her new album Supernature. Of and for those that don't already know, if you need drugs to make music sound good, then by definition its suck, I'm talking to you Deadhead.  <br /> <br />The album starts off with a double dose of upbeat sons that demand your attendance out on the dancefloor with the thumping (but not the annoying bass kind) Ooh La La and the electric Lovely 2 C U. But the album goes into dance clichs with Ride on a White Horse, a song that gets old quick with its monotone singing and music that overpowers the vocals.  <br /> <br />Then, when things get slowed down, Goldfrapp suddenly turns into Portishead on song You Never Know and Let it Take You with poor results. And it seems lie the two song take forever end. The album gets back on track Fly Me Away but it's really hit or miss after except Satin Chic that has an old time western feel, but of course with a dance twist and the 80's sounding Number 1. It may be best just to buy the best song somewhere else because there is way too much filler buy the album as a whole.

B000002P5W|5.0|This was my 2nd Hendrix album that I ever bought(1/3/06), and it's been my favorite since. I own all of Hendrix's albums and say with pride that this is my favorite. The song writing is a whole lot more focused on Axis than on Are you Experienced?. Noel's bass is heard a whole lot better on this album, and every bandmember gets to shine on this record, though I think Mitch gets to shine the most here(although Jimi's guitar is still the most notable). One interesting thing on Axis is how spacy it is, how out there it is. While it is more organic than Are You Experienced?, it's still a little stranger(in a good way). I think the artwork of every Experience album explains the atmosphere of the album, and I'm sure you would agree with me. The song Castles Made of Sand is a song that Jimi wrote when he was a child, but it proved to be a great song. Every minute is overlooked Hendrix magic that you'll want to hear over and over again!!!<br /><br /> Don't listen to the people who say this album pales in comparison with Are You Experienced, I can guarentee you that they haven't even heard the album. A much as I like Are You Experienced, Axis is even better. You won't be dissapointed!
1577314808|5.0|To take such a beautiful and simple concept - being in the present tense - and build a philosophy of living around it shakes down the Western desire to complicate. Reading the book is calming and following Eckhart's guidelines for how to live in the now is even more calming!

It unravels the web of self-destructive behavior and thinking and lights a clean path to personal peace.

0446677450|1.0|I read RDPD a few years ago back when it was a bestseller. I bought it mainly because of the catchy title, and because I was just starting to get money from my first job and wanted to know what to do with it. At first, it seemed that the book offered good advice but the more I thought about it, the more I realized it was average at best. For this reason I am puzzled by all the 5 reviews people give it.    First, lets start with the book itself (as opposed to the content). Kiyosaki is a poor writer (as he himself confesses in the book, (\\"I am not a good writer, but a good salesman\\")) who takes an entire chapter to make a point that could have been made in a couple of paragraphs. He repeats himself frequently as if the reader will not get his message otherwise. The information contained in the book could probably be compressed to about 20 pages. But then again, a 20 page book would have been a tough sell even for Kaiyosaki.    I am sure most people who give the book 5 stars are willing to overlook bad writing because they think the content more than makes up for it. The gist of Kiyosaki's message is, control your spending, live within your means, save, and \\"have your money work for you, dont work for money\\". That is sound advice but, to be honest, if you needed a book to figure this out, I would suggest dont quit your day job to go off building your \\"empire\\" just yet. My guess is that people who give this book 5 stars have never read any other money advice books and therefore find Kiyosakis advice so insightful. In fact, RDPD probably doesnt even qualify as a money management book - it is an inspirational book to try to set you on a path to investing, rather than tell you how (for that, you can buy his sequel books). Like I already said, this book doesnt have much content and could have been written in fewer than 20 pages. For a detailed analysis of soundness of Kiyosaki's advice, read [...] but suffice it to say, much of it is wrong and misleading. Get a second opinion before you decide not to go to college because education is not important (it is, it is the single best predictor of income in the US), or not to buy a house because it is a liability (it is not, the mortgage is), or that mutual funds a bad investments (they are not).    I think another reason why people like this book is that it offers a simple, positive message - getting rich is easy, anyone can do it! People like it because they want to believe it. It is an easy message to sell. Kiyosaki sounds like a politician, offering vague promises and catch phrases.    I dont want this review to sound completely negative because the book is not entirely without merit. But seeing all the undeserved praise for it is frustrating.

1575666286|3.0|I found the book to be a litte condradictory.   It acknowledges that other alternative therapies have cured terminal cancer via nutrition life style changes.  It later leads you to believe if the protocal is not followed to the letter your cancer will return.    This is simply not true.   Whole foods is the key and detoxification.   I know of a man who dissolved over 50 tumors in his body thru eating more fruits and veggies and coffee enemas and suplimentation of vitamins and minerals not mentioned in this book.  He also has not juiced one drop of veggies or fruit.        The protocal I believe is way to strict and discouraging to cancer patients.   Asking a terminal cancer patients to take in 13 glasses of juice a day is way more than they can take.   They likely give up and sucumb to the cancer.        \\"Beating Cancer with nutrition\\" is an excellent alternative and can be used in conjuction with some of the treatments in this book without the burden of juicing and living by the kitchen.  You dont have to be a slave to your home to heal.     There is great truth to The Gerson Therapy but it is unfortunatly out dated.    There are other therapies out there that work just as good if not better and are not nearly as combersome and demanding.  Max Gerson was a genious of his TIME.            Update:   UPon further research of other existing therapies I came to the conclusion that the Gerson Therapy although very difficlult is the most effective.    All the other Cancer therapies have seen good results but nothing like the results of The Gerson Therapy.     The hard work is worth it for your life.   I know juice 13 times a day and feel better than ever.    Dont take a chance use the proven therapy not all the spin offs.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|The main reason why this film is important is that its presence on the shelves of (mostly used) video stores with serve to raise the question,<br />\\"Why does the much better film released in the 1960s<br />'The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm' continue to remain criminally unavailable on DVD?\\"<br />The answer can only be that the contemporary American film industry<br />is only interested in making as much money on as much mediochre \\"product\\" as it can,<br />and is abyssmally ignorant of the rich treasure trove of folklore that COULD be suitable for cinematic interpretation existing internationally:<br />especially in this case from that rich vein of storytelling gold and gems<br />that the brothers Grimm mined in the mysterious environs surrounding Thuringer Wald.

B000EHRVP6|2.0|I am usually the entertainment at horror films as I flinch, gasp and try to hide in the shoulder of what ever poor person happens to occupy the seat next to me, however; not while watching 'Hostel'. After waiting for the breasts to be put away, I settled in, waiting to be scared. I realised quickly (into the second half) that this was not a scary movie, it was a splatter flick.  <br /> <br />The pack of kids that popped up every now and then were scary, but the plot itself; very disappointing. I'll still watch his other films, as I also enjoyed (in a wierd, twisted way!!) Cabin Fever, but I guess I prefer psychological horror, rather than violence/gore for the sake of it, stuff.  <br /> <br />Oh, I appreciate my next comment may inflame, but didn't a similar storyline of 'Hostel' appear in a John-Claude Van Damm movie a few years ago where homeless people had to get from point A to point B while 'great white hunters' who had killed every other type of beastie around the world tried to stop them, in order to experience the rush of killing people?....
B000002NJM|4.0|I have to admit that my high rating of this album is mostly because of Pam Grier's presence.  I am a huge Pam Grier fan and she can do no wrong.  However, the soundtrack is very good because it does a good job of blending 70s music (Blaxploitation) with the \\"Tarantino movie sound\\" i.e. heavy guitar & rock based. Go back to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.   I have an even greater appreication for Bobby Womack who doesn't have the smoothest voice in R&B, but his raspy/scratchy voice is very unique.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|Because of this album music by Pink Floyd was banned in the USSR for some years in time of the Cold War... Of course in that time we are listened to Pink Floyd and to \\"The Final Cut\\". And I like it.    Some fans think that \\"The Final Cut\\" - is the false-Floyd, some think the same of \\"Division Bell\\". Where is the truth? Hey, we would never get \\"Shine On Your Crazy Dimond-2\\". Listen to what we have and say: \\"Thank you!!!\\"  This album was recorded by Pink Floyd without Rick Wright. The music and lyrics by Roger Waters. The sound comparing with previous albums could seem minimalistic - piano, acoustic guitar, voice, whispers and screams by Waters, symphonic orchestra, some classic epic solos by Gilmour, many sound effects (exploisions etc...).   The album was made in 1983, it was a sequel to \\"The Wall\\", a part of socio-political trylogy by PF - \\"Animals\\", \\"The Wall\\", \\"The Final Cut\\". If in his earlier lyrics Waters depicts mainly internal psychological problems of the individuum (and probably majority of the fans prefered this safe lyrics), in this album he tries to understand the relations between the person and the real political world, in which we all live. There are many polticians of that era mentioned in the songs, but look around - now it is 2006 and the situation in the world is even worse when in 1983 - so the lyrics of \\"Final Cut\\" is still actual...  The music is emotional, scincere, beautiful, may be little bit more simple than on earlier PF albums.  With this album Roger Waters and David Gilmour tries to talk, to communicate with you - so it isn`t Pink Floyd for meditation and relaxation.  Despite all critics I`m sure that \\"Final Cut\\" - is one of the best albums by Pink Floyd and \\"The Gunner`s Dream\\" - one of their most impressive songs.  Probably if you never think of war, live in the safe city or town and your only need - to be entertained with the new light music - you wouldn`t like this album. But if you are smart PF fan - you should listen to \\"The FinalCut\\".  By the way, I could name you albums by other bands which sounded as \\"Wish You Were Here\\", but I`m sure that there is no album which sounded as \\"The Final Cut\\". It is their most original album...
B000000OQF|5.0|I didn't listen to Guns N' Roses when they were most popular in the late 80's and early 90's.  I heard \\"Sweet Child of Mine\\" on a classic rock station last year and imprinted on it.  Axl Rose should be forgiven any sin or excess for having given us \\"Sweet Child of Mine,\\" and for gathering inspired professionals like Slash around him to create it with him.  The music is iconic.  It taps into an aching, primal experience of childhood and love that moves us way beyond words.  I bought GNR's \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" from Amazon.com for that song, and found that the CD was filled with music that is as fresh today as when it was released in 1987.  If you haven't listened to GNR for a while, go back and listen.  Go online and watch the music video of \\"Sweet Child ...\\" to see, in what is grand irony given his reputation, a singer touched by grace.  Buy the CD.    <br />J

B000B5XOY8|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time and it was directed by one of my favorite directors of all time, Tim Burton.  It has paved the way for the rest of movie superhero franchises that have been released since then....the only movies that came before it and can be compared to it are Superman I and II.<br /><br />Great musical score by Danny Elfman.<br /><br />It deserved a Special Edition DVD, even BEFORE the Batman Begins movie was released.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey has taken a lot of heat recently over whether or not details in this book are true.  Regardless, I think this was a fantastic book.  It was interesting, thought provoking, intense, funny at times, and overall very entertaining.  I have never suffered from an addition myself, but James' description of what it feels like to be overtaken by one seemed very real.   <br /> <br />I loved this book!  (I loved its follow-up \\"My Friend Leonard\\" just as much too.)
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Although I love the Beatles, have all of their material, and have this title, I have to disagree with some of the previous reviewers and feel that this, so called release of Let it Be as the Beatles intended, is an insult to my intelligence. I don't know about anyone else, but I love the strings and choir in \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and really have no problem with the Phil Spector production other than George Martin IS their Producer and should have produced this as well as Free as a Bird and Real Love, although I love Jeff Lynne also. Anyway, to get back to my main point, it's unbelievable how terrible some of the things are on this album, noteably the end of One After 909. It sounds like someone quickly slid the volume controls on the mixing board at the end to kill the sound. You don't get the natural decay of the instruments. If this is the way the Beatles intended it, you've got to be kidding me. I have to ask, is this a Beatle thing or a Paul thing. If you'll also notice there's plenty of strings on Imagine, so John appearently had no problem with orchestration and obviously George had no problem with Phil Spector on All Things Must Pass. Two more great albums. They should have just included what they wanted de-Spectorized on Anthology 3. If you want let it Be, get the original its a great Beatles album and this re-whatever you want to call it of Let it Be is ridiculous.
B00006CXGH|4.0|Good story of a San Diego FBI agent in pursuit of a Soviet agent who is killing off Soviet \\"sleeper cells\\".  There's good interaction between Agent Roy Parmenter and high schooler Jeff Grant whose parents are \\"sleepers\\".  Great suspense as Roy and Jeff and parents play a cat and mouse game with the Soviet assassin. This is one of the last \\"true era\\" cold war movies to be made.

B000E8QVWY|1.0|I have come to the conclusion that this movie received the sympathy vote of the year because it is the second worst movie that I have ever seen, with \\"The Flintstones\\" being first.  I'm only sorry that I purchased this movie before seeing it.  I would be hard pressed to want to go to a dollar theatre to view this film; and if I had gone to the theatre to view it, I would have walked out within the first 30 minutes.<br /><br />Succinctly put, this movie is awful.  The best thing about it is the ending.<br /><br />At first, I thought maybe you had to be a fan of Johnny Cash's music to appreciate the film; and since he was a few decades before my time, I thought it only natural that I would feel this way.  After further contemplation, however, I realize this is not the case.  Loretta Lynn was before my time as well, but I love \\"Coal Miner's Daughter.\\"<br /><br />\\"Walk The Line\\" lacks what it needs the most ... substance.  No one could have saved this film, not even Reese Witherspoon, who happens to be one of my favorite actresses.  On the other hand, Joaquin Phoenix has no redeeming characteristics about him whatsoever.  Succinctly stated, I hate his performance from beginning to end.  There is just nothing to like about him.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time watching this piece of puff.  If you have to succumb to the \\"hype,\\" do yourself a favor and rent it or borrow it from a friend.  I have a friend who wants to borrow it, but I feel compelled to apologize in advance before loaning it because it happens to be among the worst films ever!!!

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Awesome movie about the man in black.  As you've heard, Phoenix and Witherspoon definitely earned their Oscar nominations - and do a great job sounding just like them singing.  Phoenix has totally got the Cash manerisms down and the voice.  Well worth watching, even if you're only moderately interested in the music of Johny Cash.

B000068OCS|5.0|The music from Philipp Glass is fantastic, for me it's 50% of the experience. For anyone who likes photography this will be a stunning movie. I have yet to meet someone who has not been impressed by this movie and wonder why it's not better known by the public. As the \\"life out of balance\\" comment suggest it also carry a strong message. While there are no dialogue, this is far from being an emotionless movie either. Of my close friend who watched it recently in my home, said it was of the 10 best movies he's seen. I had never though of comparing it with other movie because for me it's always been in it's own class.  <br />A word on sound and image : to fully enjoy this movie you need two things : 1) a large, high definition screen 2) a superb, high end audio system (if you do not have one this I suggest using a headphone but not one of these wireless ones with bad acoustics).  If you are lucky to have both the overall experience is likely to be better than watching it in a movie theater because the DVD was made from an original tape while the movies theaters are showing  old, used tapes with plenty of glitches and the sound would be better too (if...). <br />There is one tune that seems to have been inspired by techno/transe...except that it was written before the musical genre existed at all...who copied whom ?  <br />Philipp Glass made two follow up to this movie, Powaqqatsi, which is boring and where the music lack any interest and Nagoyqatsi which is very interesting as well, and is also lucky to have good music from Philipp Glass. Still Koyaanisqatsi's the best and the one to start with.
B00000JPYD|5.0|This is it.....you new to Trower? There is no better Trower music than what is on this disc. Awesome......It's soooo deep, heavy, so much mood in his sound. It's sort of Hendrix with a deeper, brooding breath to the sound. Very, very good rock music.

It is an interesting, thoughtful, amusing little book, chock full of good examples. If you study this book it will surely spruce up your sentences. She takes on each punctuation mark one-by-one: its origin, where to use it, where not to use it, etc. It is great! This book should take up residence next to your Strunk's \\"Elements of Style.\\" Buy this book! Study it! Learn the art of forceful communication.
0743243315|3.0|Monica Ali does a wonderful job of transporting the reader into the Bangladeshi community in London and, as other reviewers have said, the characters really come alive.  That said, this book would have benefited from an editor's red pencil. It's disorganized and repetitive, and many of its jokes - like the bumbling of the heroine's husband - go on long past their sell-by date. The post-September 11 section about Islamic radicalism feels tacked on, and given the book's 2003 publication date, I suspect that it was. This book has enjoyable moments, but better editing would have made it a better whole.

0440418569|5.0|First of all, I'd have to say that His Dark Materials has been one of the best set of books I've ever read, and greatest literary experience I've had the pleasure to take part in. Second it is a perfectly written series for its genre, for it is excellent writing overall, but is at a level where it can appeal to not only adolescents but to adults as well, because it is good advanced writing that is not unnecessarily complex. Phillip Pullman Doesn't just tell in his writing what is happening and how in his writing, but gives you the intentions of these said happenings and his own intentions as well. <br />     That being said, if you have not read this book and you are thinking of it, but are not sure to read it or not, please take the time to let my review help you make a decision. Note, if you have not read the other books in the series, don't read the Amber Spyglass yet, and don't read this review. I will try no to spoil anything, but if you haven't read the other books, certain aspects may be ruined. <br /> <br />     The Amber Spyglass starts where the Subtle Knife left off, with Will in the guide of two angels, Baruch and Balthamos, searching for his companion, Lyra, who is in the clutches of the devious Mrs. Coulter. With the help of Iorek Byrnison, two galivespian spys, and the subtle knife, Will and Lyra must set off on a journey through worlds, fulfilling their death defying fates to end fate. Meanwhile, Lord Asriel and his massive and ever massing army are deep in preperation for the war on the Authority. What will be the outcome of this fateful war? And what of Will and Lyra? And is the sole purpose of the Subtle Knife to open worlds, or is it a little more subtle? Find out by read The Amber Spyglass, book three in His Dark Materials. <br /> <br />     I thought this book was the best in the series, and has a meaningful conclusion. If you are a rising fan of this series you should most definately read this book, or else be unsatisfied the rest of yourlife. If you haven't read the other books, you shouldn't be thinking of reading this book, and definately shouldn't have read this review. I thought that the conclusion of this series was perfect, and leaves me perfectly satisfied with it. If you don't already have The Amber Spyglass, go buy it, and then sit down and read it.
B00003CX9E|3.0|It's 2006. 1941's Citizen Kane does not meet modern audience expectations. It shouldn't; it is a product of its time, and if you can meet it on that level you might stay awake. The superb documentary elevates the curiosity, and the movie itself is unfortunately less interesting than the story of making it. <br /> <br />The film is definitely ahead of its time in terms of mood and camera work but if you are honest with yourself you will find your patience tested by the film. I hate to give a vaunted classic such an ambivalent review but caveat emptor, this is a difficult experience.
0553573403|5.0|I had two reasons to buy the book in the bookstore:<br /><br />1. I flipped through the first 20 pages and have not seen any cliche that became so tiresome in the fantasy (elfs, dwarfs, dragons... you name it)<br /><br />2. The price was 5.99 Canadian dollars, so I decided that the risk is not high.<br /><br />Serious mistake... the rest of books have standard prices, but after reading the first one I realized that I must buy the rest of the series! Cool marketing trick, by the way.<br /><br />Anyway - I read a lot of fantasy, but currently got tired of the standard formulaes in it. GRRM does not use formulaes, represents different point of views on the same story, the plot is fascinating, and characters are alive, not your normal fantasy black-and-white (sometimes you actually can not decide whether they are heroes or villains - which is unsettling, but adds to the tension). All this immediately put this book into \\"my favourites\\" shelf.<br /><br />...on the other hand, my husband stopped at the book one and asked me to give him a short synopsis of the rest of the series -he prefers more action, less confusion in the fantasy books, so he found this book \\"too dense\\" for his taste.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Simply, both lead actors give an unbelievable performance. I just saw this DVD last night and I was amazed at the musical achievements both of them produced. The acting is great but what struck me was the musical excellence and all around stage performance. Phoenix is Cash and Reese is June Carter! The duet 'Time's A Wastin' is pure magic! I've been listening to Johnny Cash's music my whole life and I honestly thought the music and vocals was Cash's original versions rather than the actual singing voices of the leads. Phoenix had all of Johnny's moves and expressions as well. Both Reese and Joaquin nailed it. But having said that, for me, seeing Reese solo on stage with autoharp giving an unbelievably geniune and moving rendition of the Carter family classic, \\"Wildwood Flower\\" (and hearing she basically had to learn to sing for the part), is worth the price of the DVD. I can understand why she got the Oscar for Best Actress.

0307276902|5.0|The themes that constantly persist throughout this novel are; addiction, the fight to conquer addiction once and for all, and the struggle with the feelings of being alone and feeling helpless. Though I have never had to battle with any type of addiction, I can really relate to Mr. Frey's experiences as well as his intimate feelings. I felt a strong connection to this book from the moment I picked it up. It truly touches your heart and leaves yourself begging for more. There are two main motifs that follow the theme of addiction in this novel; self realization and love.  <br /> <br /> This memoir is about Mr. Frey's addiction to heavy drugs and alcohol. The book starts off with him waking up in an airplane, distraught and cut up. While exiting the plane he finds his parents waiting for him at the terminal who quickly send him to a rehabilitation center to hopefully end his harmful ways for good. While non motivated and disillusioned in the beginning, he has a very negative image of the place that he will call home for the next six weeks. He isn't social at all and hardly communicates with anyone, but after some time starts to open up to the nurses and doctors slowly and steadily. During his stay he meets another patient by the name of Lilly. After a few conversations they find themselves connecting on a deeper level than friendship and escape at night to meet each other and share their personal triumphs and stories. She breaks through to him and, in my opinion, saves his life by giving him motivation and a reason to live.  <br /> <br /> The personal emotions that I felt just by reading this book, gave me a better understanding of my self and others. I loved the fact that you saw Mr. Frey self assess himself, fix his problems, emotionally grow through this process, and find love on the way. I highly recommend this book to everyone (over the age of 15) who wants a book that you can relate to and grow from, and Mr. Frey captures both aspects. <br />

B0002B55WA|2.0|I have been a Beatles fan since 1964, and I have distinct memories of the band's influence on my young life.  I saw Hard Day's Night, Help!, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be in the theater when they were first released.  This film has always been the Holy Grail of Beatle fandom. <br /> <br />Now that I own it, I can honestly say I understand why it took so long to release it to the public.  That thirty years of isolation, locked up in a vault somewhere in London, only improved its standing in my imagination, not on actual film.  The BBC was right to bury this.  As a film, or television special, it's horrible. <br /> <br />But as a fan, I had to have it.  Now, that's all I can say about it; I own it.  When will Let It Be be released?

B000DN5W4I|5.0|Amazing is the only way to describe this DVD. Let's start with the sound excellent camera work shows off the group and shows them when there soloing joe's guitar work is amazing he is like nothing i have seen in a long time a very long time. the bass player is excellent also. I felt like i was sitting there with the fan's in total amazement as they new what a performance they were seeing. If you like a tight band and a guitar player who seems like he came out of the 70's this show is for you. <br />Joe is by far one of the best going today i rate him and David Gogo 2 of the best going today check both of these great guitarist out you wont be dissapointed that you did. <br />THANK YOU FOR READING <br />

044024157X|2.0|I thought this book was, at best, lame. I have not before read Grisham's work, and expected a thriller, a page-turner, perhaps something similar to \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" What I got was a long, slow, tedious retelling of the trial portion of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" complete with the southern charm, token black woman, trashy white criminal, rape and murder. I had much higher expectations, and was keenly disappointed.
B00003CWOL|2.0|First of all...how did this film get made?  I mean, the actors don't even bother to act.  It looks like and sounds like a group of friends got together over one too many drinks and brainstormed this whole thing.  And good for them if they were able to get on the phone and convince a bunch of idiots to give them money to make it.  However, I think it's equally important to have a few drinks in you too in order to get the right buzz required to enjoy this film.
0784011680|5.0|\\"Chaplin\\" starring Robert Downey, Jr. as the Little Tramp from the silent film era does something truly remarkable.  It tells the story of Charlie Chaplin, flaws and all, and still makes you admire and respect the man.   <br />The film, covering a period of roughly 70-80 years, could easily have become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the history, the characters, the events, but it flows so smoothly that never once did I glance at the clock. <br />Downey turns in the performance of a lifetime.  Nothing against Al Pacino, who won the Academy Award that year for \\"Scent of a Woman\\", but Downey was clearly shortchanged in nothing short of highway robbery in his loss of the big award. <br />His Chaplin is thoughtful, inspiring, flawed, creative, torn, troubled and a genius, all at the same time.  The real Chaplin's obvious gift for pantomine and entertaining is evident in this film, as well as his hardscrabble upbringing and his obvious liking of very young women as his paramours. (His last marriage, to the teenage Oona O'Neill, is shown as a real and affectionate marriage from both sides, and not the leering older man going after the young girl, as was the vast opinion at the time). <br />The film is chock full of talent, from Kevin Kline, Marisa Tomei, Moira Kelly, Penelope Ann Miller, Diane Lane, Anthony Hopkins, James Woods . . .a real \\"who's who\\" of the Hollywood community.  And yet, the film truly belongs to Downey.   <br />The sets and scenery are beautiful and I loved seeing how Hollywood must have been back in the 1910s and 1920s. <br />If you are a Chaplin aficionado, you will embrace and enjoy this look at his remarkable life - - even if you aren't a Chaplin fan, you can learn why Chaplin was such a revered man in Hollywood, and certainly appreciate Downey's acting chops.  This film is proof of why Hollywood keeps letting this particular bad boy come back home. <br />See this movie to pay respects to Chaplin, to appreciate the always great Anthony Hopkins (in a small role) and the many other stellar actors in this film, but most of all, see it to awe over Robert Downey, Jr.'s impressive and poignant turn as one of the Hollywood Greats. <br />Highly recommended.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|Another movie about the great white hope coming to the aide of Africa's expandable and ignorant population. (sarcasm)  Other than great cinmatography (it's very pretty) this movie has very little going for it.  I, too, didn't believe the 'love' story and I'm ify ify on whether Weisz prformance was worthy of an Oscar.  Everyone just confessed to what was going on...so I fail to see how any of it was a secret with so many loose lips involved.  I'm sorry this hardly qualifies as a thriller...at no point was I glued to the edge of seat.  Seems to me if the woman had just established a blog-we wouldn't have had much of a film.  Bottomline: A pretty boring film.

This movie has heart and adventure and it's fun and on and on.  Whenever I'm having a blah day, I pop in this movie and I swear it just lifts me up.  All these characters: from Sharks to Seagulls are just a delight.  If you haven't seen this movie do yourself a favor and join in on the search to find Nemo.

B000089RVX|5.0|I've never posted a review, all i do is read from others, but i saw myself posting one after i listened to Evanescence, the album made me say to myself \\"life is worth living\\". Its listed amongst my fav albums, i dont skip a track to another. I doubt if they'd be able to come up with a better album. It captures all kind of Rock listeners, Soft, Hard, Alternative & even down to anti-rockers, you just have to fall in love with a particular track in there.
B000002AS3|4.0|The last reviewer said that this stood alongside Sgt. Pepper and Nevermind as a seminal piece of rock. Now, I love Oasis, but no matter how much they tried, the guys never stood toe to toe with the Beatles in any category; no way they could compare any work, even the next album (What's The Story (Morning Glory)?), which is arguably their best, to the Beatles best album. <br />That's not to say that Oasis weren't a great band for their time (fact is, they're still a great band, if u ask me). They reintroduced the sound of the guitar into the charts in the UK with this album. Singles \\"Shakermaker\\" and \\"Supersonic\\" are awesome singles, filtering Beatles melodies and Sex Pistols f$#& all attitude through the Stone Roses. <br />A lot of the album has a Stone Roses, atmospheric quality to it; the shoegazing, wall of sound was everywhere in their music back then. They should've kept it, tell the truth - it was when they stripped down their sound (Morning Glory), and later began to experiment and overproduce their work (Be Here Now, the third album, which many see as the beginning of the end of Oasis' empire), that their Beatles influence was recognized as less an homage and more outright plagiarism.  <br />In any case, this was Oasis at their rawest, and most creative; not all of the melodies here are overt robberies of others'. Definitely Maybe is a great album; perhaps it's their best, perhaps it's second to What's The Story (Morning Glory)?, or maybe the two stand side-by-side as equals. In any case, it sure as HELL doesn't stand side by side with Sgt. Pepper's!
B000E6UK5K|3.0|My,how Dave has mellowed with age. His latest release fails to reach the quality of his previous solo albums,the self-titled \\"David Gilmour\\" or \\"About Face\\" (released 22 years ago!).That said,it's a more enjoyable collection of tunes than the last two Waters-less \\"Pink Floyd\\" albums \\"Division Bell\\" and \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason\\". <br /> <br />The best bits are the instrumentals,as most of the songwriting is flacid and forgetable (sorry,Polly). <br />Here's the breakdown: <br />\\"Castellorizon\\" a sound collage from bits and pieces of the album yields to Dave playing his signature leads over orchestration. Kind of \\"Let's Get Metaphysical\\" part 2. Too short. <br />\\"On An Island\\". A slow moving song with Crosby/Nash adding harmonies. The guitar part at the end is the only thing that saves it. <br />\\"The Blue\\" this one will put you right to sleep, but the stratospheric lead will make your dog sit up. <br />\\"Take A Breath\\" The best song on the album and the only one that actually ROCKS. Sounds like it came from the \\"About Face\\" sessions. <br />\\"Red Sky at Night\\" a rambling instrumental with Dave playing sax? Dick Parry has obviously been giving lessons. <br />\\"This Heaven\\" I actually like this lyric but it seems out of place in this bluesy shuffle. <br />\\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" a very nice slow,ambient guitar instrumental built around a loop. <br />\\"Smile\\" Yawn. In the bridge Dave actually recycles the chord progression from \\"Near the End\\" off of \\"About Face\\"! Can ya hear it? <br />\\"A Pocketfull of Stones\\" If you liked \\"Division Bell\\", you'll probably like this song. Not me. <br />\\"Where We Start\\" Another forgetable song.The music however reminds me of Rick Wright's stuff on his \\"Wet Dream\\" album,oddly enough. <br />The best tune is not on the album at all. \\"Island Jam\\" is a cd single packaged with units sold only at Best Buy, and is an instrumental jam with some very Floydian chord progressions. A flashback to Pink's \\"More\\" album. <br /> <br />Thanks Dave for not trying to pass this off as another Floyd album. <br /> <br />I give \\"On An Island\\" 3 stars. It might be nice to listen to while watching the sunset with a glass of wine,or maybe late at night. Very mellow. <br /> <br />If your a Floyd completist like me and want to buy it,get the cd instead of downloading from iTunes. The cd booklet design, packaging and art are first rate. <br /> <br />Okay Roger,enough opera already,let's have a good concept album!
B00005JOWF|3.0|This movie has received universally abysmal reviews, so I thought I might like it. I was right. This is really no more vapid than most action movies. I think there has been more than a little female bashing going on in these reviews. The public can't tolerate a physically strong female lead. I found this movie much more fun than watching Rambo fire a machine gun for ten minutes straight. <br /> <br />Although the script and plot were only somewhat better than Matrix (talk about abysmal), Milla Jovovitch, her personal trainer, and her costume designer really get an A+ for style and appeal. Don't go to this movie expecting a profound story or character development. Go for visual entertainment and fast paced action.

Orlando is pursued by a man who is a woman.  Orlando falls in love with a man and in a bizarre sequence they confess to each other that they are the other sex.  But they remain the sex in which they presented themselves to each other, get married, and Orlando has a baby.  Oh, and all this takes over three centuries. <br /> <br />It's easy to see why Virginia Woolf is admired by modernists, litarati and feminists. Woolf transitions seamlessly between gender and centuries in a classic of modernism that can just as easily be labeled postmodern today.  Whatever you want to call it, Jaklak sez check it out.

I was so pleasantly dissapointed. \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" was a relevation for me, and how I missed \\"Twice Removed.....\\" is still something I am trying to figure out. The first notes notes of \\"Day of the Eagle\\" took me into a world of guitar prowess that not even Hendrix could take me to, except maybe on \\"Band of Gypsy's\\". My only complaint about \\"Day....\\" is that they faded out that bluesy solo at the end, and who knew how long it actually lasted, much like the great track \\"Samba Pa Ti\\" on the sophomore Santana LP. I would love to see those Tracks released in their complete recorded form someday. Every song on \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" is a classic guitar workout, the sound and production are excellent and there is not one flaw. I never understood the Trower - Hendrix comparisons because I never felt it was valid. They were both true originals and Trower still has the chops to amaze. I saw Trower at Radio City Music Hall in '77 and was entranced by his playing and the emotion that each note conveyed. After the original band changed, I still loved Trower but didn't buy his albums. \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" is his best, one of rock guitar's best and an album that you cannot not love if you love great guitar. The bonus Live tracks are ok but he has performed better many times over the years. One of the greatest guitar players ever...bottom line.
B00004STUL|4.0|When it comes to action films there is one man that has come to be known as Hollywood's go-to-guy when producing high-octane action/adventure fare.  That man is Jerry Bruckheimer, \\"Top Gun\\", \\"Days of Thunder\\", and \\"Con Air\\" are just a few of the outstanding action films Bruckheimer has produced throughout the last 20 years.  In 1995, Bruckheimer teamed up with director Michael Bay to make a film that focuses on two hip, young cops in Miami, Florida.  To bring the freshness needed for the roles of Detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, Bay and Bruckheimer looked to the talents of two popular young actors made famous by two very big television shows.  The actors chosen were Will Smith (TV's \\"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\\") and Martin Lawrence (TV's \\"Martin\\"). <br /> <br />\\"Bad Boys\\" story as stated above, focuses on two Miami Detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence), who after confiscating one hundred million dollars worth of heroine come under fire when the drugs wind up stolen.  With the drugs missing, the two lead detectives under investigation by Internal Affairs, it appears that this particular narcotics division of the Miami Police Department will be closed down for good.  So, with no one on their side except for a young woman (Tea Leoni) who happened to witness a murder linked to the drugs, Mike and Marcus must strike out on their own to reaquire the drugs and bring down those responsible, if they succeed they can clear their names and keep their badges for another day, but if not it may just mean jail for the detectives. <br /> <br />Many critics were skeptical about whether or not two actors famous for doing comedy on network television shows could pull of being the leads in a high-profile action movie.  Really many actors would probably have the problem with making the jump from TV to film, especially when their primary job had been comedy, with very little drama and no action, but Will Smith and Martin Lawrence succeed brilliantly.  The comedic timing between these two actors is outstanding, and both pull off the dramatic scenes very convincingly, and the action scenes are well played and laid out thanks to the adrenaline charged directing of Michael Bay and the athletic prowess of the actors.  Jerry Bruckheimer's skill for picking projects and finding the right people to make them come together seems to never fail, and \\"Bad Boys\\" is no exception. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of action films and for some reason have yet to see \\"Bad Boys\\", do yourself a favor and watch this movie, your satisfaction is guaranteed. <br /> <br />\\"Bad Boys\\" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality.
B000002G87|5.0|I cannot add much that has already been said, except that since this double LP was released, it has probably been on my record player, 8 track, cassette player and cd player more than any other album. Not a dud track here, and this album has aged oh so gracefully well. \\"Layla\\" has great guitar tension between E.C. and Duane Allman, and they seemed to push each other to greater heights, and the same with the vocals of E.C. and Bobby Whitlock who never was this good again. If you don't like this music, then you don't have a heart. One of the top 5 of all time.
B000002UYZ|5.0|I grew up and learned my english with this album when I was a kid. I bought this album so my kids could do the same, one generation later. <br />All themes are classical, sound is good, some of the songs have the voices on one channel and the music on the other so you can \\"sing along\\". <br />A CD everyone should have at home, You will never get tired of listening to it.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Ang Lee's film, Brokeback Mountain, is one of those rare events that impacts not only the entertainment industry and its supporters, but also impacts our society by revealing truths of the human heart that may run counter to society's prescriptions and rules. <br /> <br />It is a love story beween two men that emerges out of a totally unlikely place, the cowboy world of windswept Wyoming in 1963. Yet from those first dusty scenes where Ennis del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal)are hired to herd sheep, we begin to see a beautiful world of high mountain pastures on Brokeback Mountain, where the pressures of society and civilization can be left behind and gradually these two men can shed the confines of prejudice and social roles and experience first physical and then emotional love for each other. To a certain extent, high above the world of civilization, in a more natural state, these two young men enter an Eden. It is a Garden of Eden first in its natural beauty and then second in the love that is allowed to flourish there. I use the term Eden because throughout the film, Ennis and Jack try to return there - to recapture the young love they felt for each other, and to meet their sexual needs. <br /> <br />But civilization calls, and these two young men return to the lowlands, collect their pay, and painfully part ways. Ennis hits a brick wall with his bare fist in a hidden alley, for he is a man who is more comfortable with physical pain than emotional pain.  Jack returns to the worksite the following year, eager to relive the experience, but stopped by Randy Quaid, the foreman, as well as Ennis' decision not to show up again. <br /> <br />Both men marry. Ennis marries a vulnerable country girl reared from the same strong stock of no-illusion people from which he was reared. Jack almost starves until he is picked by a rich cowgirl who has been denied nothing by her father. Anne Hathaway plays the wife of Jack. What is it aboutthe man who desires other men that appears mysterious and unobtainable to some women? Part of the dynamic between Anne and Jack is that she is a young woman who has been given everything, yet she marries a man with a hidden ability to love inside that she will never be able to touch, she will only always remain aware that it is there and it is not meant for her. <br /> <br />Michelle Williams plays Ennis' wife, Alma. Some of the most painful scenes of the film involve Alma as she gradually begins to learn the secrets of the silent man she has married. After 4 years, Jack writes a postcard to Ennis, asking if he would like to get together. Ennis responds and a date is determined. On the day that Jack is supposed to arrive, Ennis is a bundle of bad nerves, pacing, sad and fearful of a no-show, restless, depressed as a way to deal with his repressed longing, energized, agaitated at the kids, and this odd state of mind/body is certainly observed by his sensitive young wife. When Jack arrives, Ennis runs out of the house to greet him, pulls him from his truck, and the two men kiss with a flood of repressed love and lust and longing. Yet Alma opens the front door and observes this embrace and knows that this is a passion she has never experienced with Ennis. <br /> <br />Jack Twist, played superbly by Jake Gyllenhaal, emerges as the character that is most emotionally available. He makes himself available to Ennis and is the most open to these two men divorcing their wives and becoming life partners. He is aware of his needs and has sex with other men beside Ennis. He is the one who continually pushes Ennis to experience the hidden rumblings of the heart.  <br /> <br />Ennis del Mar, played perfectly by Heath Ledger, is an emotionally more complex and stunted character. Yet it is the character growth of Ennis that in some ways is the real trajectory of the story. The trajectory of this story is not boy meets boy, boy loses boy, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finally find boy again. It is rather a more complex path of self awareness where pain is the surgical tool that reveals Ennis to himself. He does lose Alma, he does lose Jack, but in the end we see a changed man. When an available attractive young woman begins to seduce him, he is pulled into her orbit due to his need for comfort from his loses. HOwever, he realizes he will never be happy with this young woman and she will never be fulfilled with him. He ends the budding romance in a way that tells us he has gained in wisdom and self knowledge. In the end we see Ennis as a wounded and broken fellow, destined to mourn the love he could have nourished and experienced, and yet we see him begin to celebrate the budding love of his eldest daughter. <br /> <br />This is mature matter. We all make poor or uninformed or unconscious choices. We all treat life as if it would go on forever and we don't need to make hard choices because we will always get a second chance. These two men were not especially strong heroic fellows, they were victims of societal pressures and their own emotional boundaries and awareness. Sometimes we do our best to understand ourselves and the world and it still comes out a tragedy. Knowing this, we must be grateful for those times of communion of the heart, which come to us like grace, like an unsought gift, but which transforms us forever. <br /> <br />
B00005MP58|4.0|This version of Pride & Prejudice is a little long, but very close to the book, and a very enjoyable way to become familiar with the story!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I love this movie. I have watched more than once because there is always new findings each time. Everytime I finish watch this movie, I feel like I missed something.This movie make you think and feel like there is more than what you see in the movie as if it can be happened for real. I even went to website to see if there is somehing more to find about this movie.  I'm personally big fun of Jake and I think he has this charisma that makes you think there is something deeper than what you see. This is definitely one of my collection movies.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|After more than a decade working with bands such as the Trent Reznor-helmed Two and Fight, Rob Halford finally returns to the Judas Priest fold to ensure this is a massive album of old school metal. While this brand of music could easily be seen as corny, Priest's domination of the UK metal scene since 1980's British Steel means they not only bypass criticism with Angel Of Retribution, they also show they still know how to kick arse. The great opening track Judas Rising sets the mood, with intensifying drums, familiar guitar licks, Rob's insane vocals and lyrics about hell, lightning, darkness and war all acting as familiar yet exciting Judas Preist touchstones. The opening moments of the album ensure that listeners are in no doubt that Rob Halford remains a formidable vocalist, with Deal With The Devil and Demonizer having the sort of energy you'd expect from Guns N' Roses if Axl Rose wasn't sitting in his mansion eating fried chicken all day. While not particularly commercial in nature, Angel Of Retribution proves to be a far more hefty listen than Velvet Revolver's Contraband, dishing out the heavy rock without an eye on commercial radio or platinum glories. Worth Fighting For backs off the pace with its lyrical dark clouds and Angel is the obligatory acoustic number, but track titles such as Wheels Of Fire and Hellrider are such clichd titles from the Priest it's surprising they haven't used them before. Nonetheless, these tunes and the epic finale Loch Ness (yes, of course it's about monsters) all add up to an encouraging new chapter in Judas Priest's history that is sure to see them back in favour with metal fans around the world. Ripper who?

B00078XKDE|3.0|Greasy like unwashed hair. Frantic like a smack addict looking for a fix. Dirty like an inner city squat. The Kills make music that feels like it's been made in a filthy apartment with no dcor save for an ashtray full of yellowing cigarette stubs and a couch smeared with indecipherable stains. Like the Mickey and Mallory of the US alternative music scene, Alison `VV' Mosshart and Jamie `Hotel' Hince have created a snarling opus on No Wow that seductively recalls PJ Harvey at her most enthralling. After making a name for themselves on the back of 2004 debut Keep On Your Mean Side, the second album found the partnership between VV and Hotel laying down their sound in a Michigan ghost town. Resulting single The Good Ones is currently getting plenty of radio play and Rage is enjoying the sexy presentation of VV in the video, yet there's a sinister element to the music of The Kills that can't be underestimated. Lyrics such as `I can't get full. Please could you fix my shakes' indicate that I Hate The Way shares more than just a tempo shift with The Velvet Underground's incredible tune Heroin, while the aloof lyrics of Rodeo Town - `If I am so evil, why are you satisfied?' - offer further evidence of a bleak partnership. Of course, like Natural Born Killers, it's bound to end in violence and murder, but No Wow's still a neat ride through makeshift percussion, panicky guitar and haunted vocals. A DVD is included so you can make up your own mind about their chemical and personal addictions, but it's fairly obvious The Kills are more Black Plague than White Stripe.

B000E97X66|5.0|Born To Run had ensured Bruce Springsteen was enjoying critical and commercial success, but with the concert preserved on this live CD you can also practically hear the New Jersey songwriter's transition from beanie-wearing poetic street urchin to assured leather-jacketed rock archivist.   <br />Although this November show in London came just weeks after the release of his breakthrough Born To Run, the warm approval of the Hammersmith crowd at the opening chords of Thunder Road prove Springsteen's third album was already seen as a landmark. Of Born To Run's tracklisting only Night and Meeting Across The River are overlooked on this thrilling two disc performance, with former favourites from Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ and The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle including Kitty's Back, Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) and Spirit In The Night making up for the absence of Born To Run's overlooked glories. <br />In a mood that leaps from playful on Rosalita (featuring a touch of Theme From Shaft) and passionate on She's The One through to incendiary on Born To Run, Springsteen established his performance mastery with this debut performance across the Atlantic. The DVD film of this concert issued as part of the Born To Run: 30th Anniversary Edition set might hold the upper hand over this audio release, but Springsteen's whispered poetry on Spirit In The Night, Lost In The Flood and Jungleland evoke imagery without a need for concert footage. <br />At the close of his Rising Tour, Bruce Springsteen experienced a new-found interest in the initial stages of his career and became inspired to go back into the vault to ensure that early performances could be officially re-evaluated after years of bootlegging. Restored and mixed by Thom Zimny and Bob Clearmountain, Hammersmith Odeon London '75 is a mesmerising performance from The Boss. Hopefully Springsteen's subsequent rock chapters will receive similar live overhauls as their brilliant creator comes to accept his important place in rock history.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Are you DAMNED? Ok, lets talk about AC/DC. This is a band that never gets weak, these guys are by far the greatest rock and roll act around, and heres why.<br />Watch this DVD from 1991, LIVE AT DONNINGTON. I was at the video store the other night renting a movie for me and a lady friend when the box for this DVD caught my eye. I couldn't say no, and proceeded to spend my last three bucks on the rental. Now, as many of us know in 1991 AC/DC was fronted by BRIAN JOHNSON and not the completely legendary BON SCOTT who fronted the original mach in through the seventies up until his death in 1980. Now, there are a lot of die hard BON SCOTT fans out there that would refuse to give BRIAN JOHNSON the time of day, but to me that is a mistake.<br />Now, me of course, am quite partial to the eccentric wails and attitude of BON SCOTT, and BRIAN JOHNSON is a different spectacle all together.. but.. he is still a sight to see on stage. There is ABSOLUTELY nothing lame about it, BRIAN JOHNSON still kicks much, much ace. And the rest of the band sure as the devil himself, blazes the stage as well.<br />I ended up watching this DVD by myself, and a little with my fifteen month old boy (he was hoopin and yellin, and clappin his hands.. ha ha) I was completley into it. With the lights down and the sound up, I was right there at Donington 1991, feeling the energy.<br />The stage show that night was amazing.. with the sight gags.. a giant devil during HELL AINT A BAD PLACE TO BE, a giant balloon fat chick during WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE, a giant brass bell during HELLS BELLS that JOHNSON proceeds to bash on repeatively with a large mallet.. and of course a barrage of cannons during FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK...<br />These guys ain't no fluke. They bleed rock, Angus doesn't play guitar, he shreds the F out it and creates sounds that make your soul scream YEAH!!!! The whole band is in gear, and BRIAN JOHNSON, who can ever imagine how he wails the way he does night after night. Oh man, a few times at the beggining it looks like he's struggling to maintain those vocals as the years go by, but three or four songs in and its flawless. His stage presence is nothing to stick your nose up at either. I was digging it at one point where he loses his hat, keeps running around like a maniac, and then when you think its gone, he spots it on the ground kicks it up in the air, grabs it, and secures it right back onto his dome.. gives us a look like, \\"thats right\\" and then goes right back into being a maniac.<br />The set list is incredible covering all aspects of the bands career. We open with a killer THUNDERSTRUCK to get your chills going, and we are graced with killer versions of FIRE YOUR GUNS, TNT, THE JACK and you know, all the essentials... but the highlight for me was the sensational jam session version of JAILBREAK...  man I hope these guys have one more tour left in 'em... I gotta see these guys at least once for myself. If you never got a chance, well theres lots of discs.. Donington is the one if you wanna see a great BRIAN JOHNSON era AC/DC. Lotta fire in this beast.looks like he's struggling to maintain those vocals as the years go by, but three or four songs in and its flawless.

B000BTC5LW|1.0|I've recently purchased Pulse on VHS.  I'm more than willing to also purchase it in DVD when it's finally released...I hope that Delicate Sound of Thunder will become available on DVD as well.  Until that time comes, I will burn the VHS copies of both videos to DVD with no guilt feelings whatsoever.  I will not sell them, but I also will not chance that they may never be released on DVD either.  I know Mr. Gilmour wants the sound and video to be as perfect as possible when it's remastered.  Fantastic-that's as it should be.  I will be in line cash-in-hand when that day arrives. <br />
B000BD00OC|5.0|_I've always considered this book to be the dark companion to Bradbury's _Dandelion Wine_. Will Halloway is Douglas Spaulding is...young Ray Bradbury. However, where _Dandelion Wine_ dwells primarily on the innocent and uncorrupted side of small-town America in its golden age, this volume dwells with its shadow side. You see, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show doesn't bring darkness to town, so much as it cultivates what's already there. Like all portrayers of vice, if there weren't already a potentially willing market, they would have no success.<br /><br />_Yet, every generation the black train steams into town- always on the cusp of the seasons- always in a long October, half way between midsummer and Christmas. Every generation they tempt and entrap. Every generation must either resist or succumb to their dark tricks. These October people are still out there, still making their infernal rounds....<br /><br />_This book bears rereading. First of all, like much of Bradbury's earlier work it is as much poem as prose. I know that I myself didn't really appreciate poetry, the right brain side of seeing things, until I found his work. Also, as one grows older, one identifies less with Will, and Will's potential shadow, Jim, and more with the other characters. For me, Will's father, an old man who has wandered the world and has suffered a thousand petty defeats- and a much lesser number of minor victories- becomes more and more familiar.<br /><br />_This book will give you nightmares. It will do so not because of graphic violence, but because of the way it subtly undermines the spirit and spreads doubts through the chinks of the soul. Still, without Dark to contend with, how would Light define, and strengthen, itself?
B000003TAB|4.0|Incesticide truly is one of Nirvana's best releases. Sure, it's a \\"comp,\\" but the best thing about it is that it gives Nirvana fans the weirder side of Nirvana alongside the more accessible Nirvana. Thankfully, you don't get the selfish temper-tantrum phase Kurt went through during the In Utero era up until his death. Incesticide captures Nirvana right after they broke big; when Kurt still had a sense of humor. My faves are \\"Aneurysm\\" and \\"AeroZepplin\\" with all of their crazy guitar work. <br /> <br />I definitely suggest this b-sides/demos album over the slop that is With the Lights Out. If anyone out there wants more amazing studio outtakes and demos not offered on Incesticide (like \\"If You Must\\" and \\"Blandest\\"), for the love of God, please just download them or get them from a pal in your local trading community; you'll get better sound quality than the sh*tty sources used for on WTLO. I find it shocking that most of the tapes bootleggers have been circulating for the past 15 years are better than what Krist and Dave scrounged up for WTLO. It's obvious they just want to get more Nirvana material out to make more money; they don't even care that most of their sources are inferior to what we've had for the past decade and a half.

B00008GKEG|5.0|I know where I was. And despite having lived every moment with Cousin Brucie and Murry the K (who later was to be my teacher in broadcasting school) during those begining days, there is still something to be learned and experienced here in this DVD collection. If you never met them, never saw them, this will be the next best thing.<br /><br />I don't know what the Brits were going through, but here in the states we had just lost a President to an assassins bullet, we were at the begining of the Vietnam war, civil rights was on the dawn. Space shots were in it's infancy, television was black and white, and there was actually discipline in the schools and at home, and if you were good and if you were lucky, you could watch the unfolding of the Beatle era on the Ed Sullivan Show.<br /><br />What an exciting time to be begining a young life! Long hair, rock and roll, color......and endless music of the Beatles! Who knows how long it would have taken the world to change if it wasn't inspired by these fellows! There's nothing like it today and there has been nothing before or since. Ah, music I can hum.<br /><br />It's basically all here in this short, but historically rich 5 DVD set, from begining to end. I say short because this DVD, while it is inclusive, will invite you, the viewer, to seek out the full story elsewhere, if you choose to become a die-hard Beatles fan. This is the primer, from the start.<br /><br />I loved it so much, I bought the book !!

B000AP04L0|5.0|This film is a classic comedy.  It has a lot of subtle funny moments that make you laugh really hard.  Peter's calm demeanor make for a great character that is just fed up with his life and doesnt really care anymore.  Anyone who works or has worked in an office knows exactly what its like to be in his shoes along with the rest of the cast of characters.  It's a classic comedy because it's so real and true to everyday life that people can relate to the movie and find solace in the film.  It's all the things people in his situation wish they could do but never really could sacrifice there career for.

0143036556|2.0|This book's punchiest lines come near the end when the author settles scores with a corpse, that of Julian Simon.  While living, Mr. Simon had bad manners;  he made leftist ideologues such as Paul Ehrlich and Jared Diamond look foolish by fumigating their smelly orthodoxies and pieties.  Now that Simon is safely dead and can't fight back, Dr. Diamond gets mad and gets even.  \\"All of our current problems,\\" he writes, \\"are unintended negative consequences of our existing technology. The rapid advances in technology during the 20th century have been creating difficult new problems faster than they have been solving old problems ... An even larger fraction of the world's original wetlands than of its forests has already been destroyed, damaged, or converted.\\" <br /> <br />Original?  What point of origin does he mean?  Big Bang?  Formless & void?  Pangaea?  Diamond is entitled to draw his own baseline for his assertion, but he should tell us what it is.   As for \\"All\\" of our current problems, Julian Simon would be ready to rumble if he were only alive.  During the 20th Century technology almost doubled developed-world lifespans and had pulled up developing-world lifespans prior to the decimation of sub-Saharan Africa and SE Asia by AIDS.  Increased lifespan during a period of almost-exponentially increasing population was thought to be impossible before the technological 20th Century. Just ask Malthus. <br /> <br />Dr. Diamond also gets some things right, particularly his chapters on business, and is more incisive as an economist than as a scientist.  Parts of his intro chapter on Montana are also good.  He's plowing old trails plowed under about Montana as a plundered province of extractive industry, but he plows well the parts about hard rock mining (still operating under 1872 rules -- that's why toxic heavy metals were permitted to pool behind dams a few miles from Missoula's water supply -- and about water allocation regimes adapted badly to the arid west.  <br /> <br />He's unconvincing & unreliable about Montana agriculture, logging, and climate change.  Here is how Diamond discusses the climatological collapse of the Big Hole Valley south of Missoula:  \\" ... (I)t's difficult to recognize that each successive year is on the average slightly worse than the year before, so one's baseline standard for what constitutes \\"normalcy\\" shifts gradually and imperceptibly. ...\\" <br /> <br />Reading further in the excerpt shows that Diamond's baseline standard for what constitutes normal is Diamond's own experience.  Old boomers will be flattered that his baseline decade for identifying subsequent shifts and deviations from the norm into the abnormal and the \\"worse\\" is also their decade, the 1950s, but it's most peculiar that a Pulitzer-winning scientist didn't check his egocentricity at the door.  Anything can be proved, or nothing, depending on where the lines and baselines are drawn. <br /> <br />There was human activity and climate in western Montana before young Jared Diamond first hiked to snow fields in the Big Hole.  And there was climate, changing, before people from somewhere moved in about 12,000 years ago when the landscape was dominated by ice.  About 8000 years ago climate changed so assiduously toward warmth that there's little evidence of anyone living in Montana or much of the west for 2000 or 3000 years.  Had Diamond drawn his baseline then, the \\"worsening\\" abnormal climate he sees in 2005 would look, in comparison, like global cooling. <br /> <br />In recent times there was a prolonged period of hemispheric global cooling that coincided with the collapse of the 450-year Norse settlements in Greenland to which Diamond compares the collapse of Montana \\"civilization\\" as we know it.  The Little Ice Age, mimicking the big ice ages that dominated global climate for most of the last 100,000 years (our data for that baseline comes from Greenland ice cores that Diamond hardly talks about) faded away by about 1850 - 1900, and we've reverted to one of those rare warm interludes that suduced the Norse into settling Greenland during one of those rare interludes when Greenland was green. <br /> <br />Greenland's 100,000-year database correlates with what's known or suspected about hemispheric or global trends, and suggests that cooling was so dominant and destructive that civilization among humans, something apparently unprecedented in our multi-million-year evolution, gained a grip only when climate belatedly deviated away from the cold norm.  Here's Diamond on Greenland's collapsing climate, for which the only constant is change; all the pre-industrial changes he recounts are inconvenient for his later assertions about industry-driven global warming: <br /> <br />\\"(W)e can reconstruct past Greenland climates from Icelandic records, pollen, and ice cores, and the latter let us reconstruct climate on a year-to-year basis. ... (W)e've learned that the climate warmed up after the end of the last Ice Age around 14,000 years ago; the fjords of Greenland became merely \\"cool,\\" not bitterly cold,\\" and they developed low forests. But Greenland's climate hasn't remained boringly steady for the last 14,000 years: it has gotten colder for some periods, then reverted to being milder again. ... Hence the history of the Arctic, including that of Greenland, is a history of people arriving, occupying large areas for many centuries, and then declining or disappearing or having to change their lifestyle over large areas when climate changes bring changes in prey abundance. Such consequences of climate changes for native hunters have been observed firsthand in Greenland during the 20th century. A warming of sea temperatures early in that century caused seals almost to disappear from southern Greenland. Good seal hunting returned when the weather got cooler again. Then, when the weather got very cold between 1959 and 1974, populations of migratory seal species plummeted ... Similar climate fluctuations with consequent changes in prey abundance may have contributed to the first settlement by Native Americans around 2500 B.C. , their decline or disappearance around 1500 B.C., their subsequent return, their decline again, and then their complete abandonment of southern Greenland some time before the Norse arrived around A.D. 980. Hence the Norse settlers initially encountered no Native Americans [but the Inuit returned, 'with big consequences for the Norse', during the warming period around A.D. 1200.] Between A.D. 800 and 1300, ice cores tell us that the climate in Greenland was relatively mild, similar to Greenland's weather today or even slightly warmer. Those mild centuries are termed the Medieval Warm Period. Thus, the Norse reached Greenland during a period good for growing hay and pasturing animals -- good by the standards of Greenland's average climate over the last 14,000 years. Around 1300, though, the climate in the North Atlantic began to get cooler and more variable from year to year, ushering in a cold period termed the Little Ice Age that lasted into the 1800s. By around 1420, the Little Ice Age was in full swing, and the increased summer drift ice between Greenland, Iceland, and Norway ended ship communicaiton between the Greenland Norse and the outside world. Those cold conditions were tolerable or even beneficial for the Inuit ... (W)hy didn't the Norse learn to cope with the Little Ice Age's cold weather by watching how the Inuit were meeting the same challenges? ...  <br /> <br />\\"What about relations between the Inuit and the Norse? Incredibly, during the centuries that those two peoples shared Greenland, Norse annals include only two or three brief references to the Inuit. (A) 15th-dentury manuscript explains how the Norse first encountered Greenland natives: 'Farther to the north beyond the Norse settlements, hunters have come across small people, whom they call skraelings. When they are stabbed with a nonfatal wound, their wounds turn white and they don't bleed, but when they are mortally wounded, they bleed incessantly. They have no iron, but they use walrus tusks as missiles and sharp stones as tools.'  <br /> <br />** [In fact, nothing in the scant record shows that this was a first encounter. Nor does the 'brief reference' state that a Norse colonist stabbed an Inuit colonist, but Diamond leaps to that conclusion.]  <br /> <br />\\"Brief and matter-of-fact as this account is, it suggests that the Norse had a \\"bad attitude\\" that got them off to a dreadful start with the people with whom they were about to share Greenland. \\"Skrailings,\\" the Old Norse word that the Norse applied to all three groups of New World natives that they encountered in Vinland or Greenland (Inuit, Dorset, and Indians), translates approximately as \\"wretches.\\" It also bodes poorly for peaceful relations if you take the first Inuit or Dorset person whom you see, and you try atabbing him as an experiment to figure out how much he bleeds. Recall .., that when the Norse first encountered a group of Indians in Vinland, they initiated friendship by killing eight of the nine. These first contacts go a long way towards explaining why the Norse did not establish good trading relationship with the Inuit. ... If you hope to persuade an Inuit woman ... you have to establish a friendly relationship in the first place. But we have seen that the Norse had a \\"bad attitude\\" from the beginning, referring to both North American Indians in Vinland and Inuit in Greenland as \\"wretches,\\" and killing the first natives they encountered in both places. As church- oriented Christians, the Norse shared the scorn of pagans widespread among medieval Europeans ... Still another factor behind their bad attitude is that the Norse would have thought of themselves as the natives in the Nordrseta, and the Inuit as the interlopers. The Norse arrived in the Nordrseta and hunted there for several centuries before the Inuit arrived. ... \\" <br /> <br />Nothing in Diamond's thin narrative supports these conclusions. Nothing in the scant written record of Norse/\\"native\\" contact supports either the 'bad attitude' assertion or the assertion that these were first contacts. Nothing supports the conclusion that Norse Christians initiated contact with the \\"Other\\" by killing him. Diamond displays ignorance & arrogance here, together with fashionable anti-Christian bigotry and bias.  I cannot say that Greenland and Vinland didn't happen the way he pretends they happened.  I'm saying only that, using Diamond's own evidence, Diamond is pretending.  He's stretching the scientific record like Silly Putty to assert things that the record doesn't prove. <br /> <br />And I believe he's dabbling in reverse racism, the currently fashionable supposition that, in any interaction between the melanin-challenged and the melanin-enriched, the pale people are at fault.  This is the flip side of fashionable racism from a century ago when eugenicists such as Theodore Roosevelt and Margaret Sanger believed and preached that civilization was the special project of God's special people, pasty-white, Anglo-Saxon, Nordic northern European Americans.] <br /> <br />If only the arrogant and ignorant whites had listened, Diamond seems to sigh, if only they had learned from the dark-skinned invaders (not one culture, but many) who drifted transiently through their changing seasons ... Arrogant and ignorant whites built an improbable cow-centered settlement that lasted 450 years, through global warming and global cooling, until it crashed in the crushing years after 1350.  Diamond calls it a failure for crashing, like the failed cow-centered culture of Montana.  I call it a success.  Its collapse after 450 years was a possible consequence of the devastating Black Death that Diamond hardly mentions.]  <br /> <br />It's strange that that the author of Guns, Germs and Steel gives negligible credit to germs for the collapse of Greenland.  In pages of stuff about the settlements Diamondgives one part of one sentence to the plague of 1350, and seems curiously incurious about the plague's effect on the Greenland Norse or on the Norse of Norway.  Did the plague touch Greenland?  How did it affect trade patterns with the home country & other Viking colonies? Diamond doesn't say.  He doesn't even ask.   <br /> <br />Our best guess is that the Black Death killed over half of white Norway and even more of the Norse in Greenland.  That's how Greenland collapsed, I guess, and not from arrogant cultural imperialism.  Although I enjoyed & learned much from parts of this book, the rest made me want to hurl: a rock, my lunch, or the book.   <br />
0385486804|4.0|I was assigned to read a non fiction book for English class and after searching for one my teacher recommended this book to me. After reading the first page it sounded interesting enough so I decided to do my project on \\"Into the Wild\\". The book was different than any book I have read and followed Chris McCandless's life closely trying to make out what drove McCandless to leave everything behind and \\"walk into the wild\\". I still do not understand why a kid that had so much going for him including a college education, a loving family, and a $24,000 savings account would want to leave it all behind and not care that he is causing his family great agony. I just cannot feel sorry for a person like that although that is not what Jon Krakauer is asking for. The book really portrays what it takes to survive and has made me look at surviving in the wilderness differently. It does seem however that the author has taken the small amount of info from journals and friends from Chris's life and stretched it to make a whole book out of it. A lot of the information is conclusions based on small journal entries that could be inaccurate. But besides this fact, the story is compelling and has really made me think about this young man who desired to leave all civilization and walk into the wild long after I've finished the book.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|I bought this movie on DVD this weekend and watched it.  I must say that it was a bit dissapointing.  Other than the first few scenes with them at boot camp the storyline and acting were not very good at all.<br /><br />The best acting role in this movie was the drill sargeant.  The others seemed bland and stale.  Jamie Foxx did not play a very good staff sargeant and was no were close to the excellent job he did in Ray.<br /><br />As you already know this movie centers around the first Iraqi war.  Operation Desert Shield/Storm.  The movie starts off with your basic storyline, marines getting grilled by the DI and going through various Basic training tasks.  After they get shipped to Iraq everything seems to go downhill as far as the movie goes.  To be honest, the movie seemed more like a documentary than an actual movie.  The story seemed to be building up to a climax, it never got there, instead it just hovered along without doing much of anything.<br /><br />Don't expect a Full Metal Jacket type of movie, instead think of it as the Blair Witch Project of war movies; something always seems like its going to happen, but it never does.  Granted the Iraqi war was a different kind war than say the Vietnam war, I think the main thing that ruined this movie was the acting and storyline that never seemed to go anywhere.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|A priest is charged with wrongful death when a young woman dies while he is performing an exorcism. A hot-shot attorney defends the priest even though she doesn't believe in the Devil or God. <br /> <br />Based on a true story, this is a thoughtful movie that will keep your interest. If you are looking for any of the head spinning, puking like the exorcist you wouldn't find it in this movie. There are some scary scenes, but the movie itself isn't scary because it is told through flashbacks in the courtroom. also the question of possessed or psycho is not really answered at the end of the movie. Maybe they are planning a sequel.
0609610570|5.0|Execution should be on the short list of reading materials for anyone managing people in the workplace. The point is simple: don't just talk about it -- do it, and do it well. Strategy is not an end in and of itself -- it is a first step -- and must be implemented well if it is to make a difference. Once this is clear, the rest is about *how* to foster a culture of execution in the workplace, from your personal mindset and actions, to how you work with your team without micromanaging, to asking the right kinds of questions. All excellent lessons to employ. <br /> <br />Sure, the jaded reader will say this is obvious. But after 25 years of working in real companies -- mid-caps to Fortune 10's -- I can tell you with complete confidence that the number of managers I've seen who have execution in their blood could be counted on one hand. Good execution cuts through competition like a knife. It can turn a 'me-to' company in a commodity business into a category killer -- I've seen this first-hand, fortunately from the winning side.  <br /> <br />Read this book carefully, give it to your team (and your management), talk about it with them, and put concrete plans in place to put these lessons into practice. You will quickly see the difference.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet give superb performances in this endearing story of the making of Peter Pan. And 'Peter' was such a CHARM. Talented, sweet, emotional, sensitive.    I found this movie both informative and entertaining. Historical content is interesting, if true. But most importantly, I found a relationship between four young orphaned boys and an unmarried male guardian at the end quite refreshing. Commitment is what it's all about. Love and commitment go together and this story reveals that no matter what challenges life throws upon us, love and commitment to do the right thing is overwhelmingly alive.    Even seemingly unapproving 'mothers' can benefit by learning about the true nature and character of their daughter's love. It wasn't until the daughter's death that Mother realized how tender the heart can be.    Gail Gupton, Author, The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth

B00005JOIF|5.0|Many people who I have talked to about this movie have become a bit confused as to its plot.  Many people think that it is about the Munich Olympics, and that it is a true story.  Well, like Domino, they should have put \\"Based on a True Story: Sort Of.\\"  The movie is about a group of people hired to assassinate the people responsible for the killings in Munich.  No one knows who these people were or what they did.  The only known fact was that they assassinated most of those responsible for the killings.  So, in effect, Spielberg has fabricated, to the already known facts, a story about what probably would have happened.  That being said, this is one of the best movies of 2005.  In my own Oscar picks, I had Munich winning Best Picture, even though I rated Crash higher on my Top Ten list, becuase of its ingenuity and its originality.  It is a sharp contrast to the other Best Picture nominees, and at some parts the film is extremely bloody and violent.  But Spielberg has crafted a work of art.  Many may try to blow this out of proportion and relate it to Spielberg's politics, but I think this is just a well crafted piece of film.  It also has wonderful performances throughout, although not the best of the year, especially by Bana and Geoffrey Rush, who is always a pleasure to watch.  Spielberg's film did not win any Oscars, but it stands as one of the more underrated, and best, films of the year.

B000BKVQTS|5.0|It seems as if our illustrious, self-important \\"film critics\\" nationwide have lost their sense of fun, for the majority of them crucified this movie, for no good reason. It's a rousingly entertaining, enjoyable movie that deserved much, much better.<br /><br />This hyperkinetic, involving fairy tale avoids, unlike most of its type, in taking itself too seriously. It strikes just the right balance of terror, suspense, goofiness, thrills, and even poignance. Best of all, it catches you constantly off-guard with shrewdly placed comedy that's just right: at some points when things get fairly intense, it will make fun of its own absurdity.<br /><br />The movie lightly satirizes the classic fairy tales marvelously, in sly references to all the most famous ones, but the movie's story in itself is just as wondrous and gripping as the best of them.  The \\"Happily Ever After\\" element is handled perfectly, and is genuinely moving, but without making you cringe: it successfully avoids being maudlin or saccharine - and is funny as hell.<br /><br />The director, Terry Gilliam, keeps things moving, with a giddy, galloping pace, and never lets things get bogged down in heavy-handed portentousness. The plot often takes surprising turns, taking us pleasantly off-guard; there's an imaginative, whimsical, childlike glee in the proceedings - it's an adult's recall of how fairy tales sparked our fancies. The sense of danger, especially of sinister hobgoblins hovering ominously in the forest, is  exhilarating: Gilliam makes our childish fears of the dark forces lurking amongst the trees into something particularly unsettling and spooky. The wandering, darting vine tendrils and branches that reach out to grab you are redolent of the nightmares you always wanted to avoid. The \\"special effects\\" are startling: the phantasmagorical computer generated images, are for once, entirely in keeping with the scope of a fairy tale element, hence they look \\"real.\\"<br /><br />Heath Ledger and Matt Damon, romping gaily as the two brothers, are clearly having the time of their lives, both showing their talent for physical comedy. It's surprising to see Ledger, pre- \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" exhibit such goofy, unforced charm, and the sweetness of his character is endearing (he's very moving at the end). It's great to see Damon expanding his range so convincingly; the perpetual frat boy persona has matured into a dynamic screen presence. Ledger and Damon look wonderful in their period costumes, looking truly Dickensian.  Peter Stormare as the bungling villain is a hoot: the business with his hairpiece repeatedly deflates his character's authority. Lena Headey, a Jacqueline Bisset lookalike, is a strong presence  as Angelika. It's hilarious to see her often out-masculinize the 2 brothers. Monica Bellucci, as the evil Queen, is an inspired choice: her alluring, Botticelli-like beauty makes you believe in the force of her seductive powers.<br /><br />It would be a pity if this enchanting fantasy were relegated to oblivion because of some jaded critics.r and Matt Damon, romping gaily as the two brothers, are clearly having the time of their lives, both showing their talent for physical comedy.

First there are actually two different versions of this movie available on DVD and second, the reviews listed for the other inferior versions also get listed with this better special edition.<br /><br />This version of the film is almost as good as seeing it up on the big screen.  The sound is fantastic, the picture quality is superb, and there are even extas on this DVD.<br /><br />The other version of the film is a substandard copy made from someone's TV copy.  The picture is in constant zoom, there are scene's missing, and the audio is terrible.<br /><br />Please do not confuse the two. Stick with the DVD that says The John Wayne Collection at the top of the case.

1857989384|4.0|Flowers for Algernon is a great story written by Daniel Keyes about a mentally retarded man, Charlie, who is selected to try an operation to help him learn a lot. As the story continues on, Charlie learns not only facts, but also new emotions that he has never experienced.  <br /> This book has a really powerful message in it about intelligence. It says that the importance of life is not measured by how smart you are, but by your relationships and how you treat others. If only people in the real world could understand that; that being the best isn't everything. That just being who you are and being the best you can be, makes all the difference in the world.  <br /> I really liked this book, however I have to admit that I had a hard time when I first started reading. When you read the first sentence, you become annoyed, because there are all these spelling mistakes, and there is no punctuation: \\"I tryed hard but I still couldnt find the picturs I only saw the ink. I tolled Burt mabey I need new glassis,\\"(page 3). At first I was so annoyed with this, but then as I read on, I realized that not only does it help the reader understand the level of comprehension of a mentally retarded adult, but it also gave me a new respect for those who use their time to help teach others who are mentally retarded.  <br /> This book has another message in it about how you view life; people who have less in the eyes of a `normal' person, really have more than most ever take time to recognize. \\"What an incredible thing! How much less they had than other human beings. Mentally retarded, deaf, mute - and still eagerly sanding benches\\"(page 228); even though Charlie has gained intelligence, he is still unaware of the intellectual state that he was once in.  <br /> The story of Charlie's experience gave me a new understanding of both really smart people, and those who may have problems with learning. In the middle of the story, Charlie has been to both extremes of intelligence -- mentally retarded and genius; and because he is the only person to have experienced both, no one seems to understand him. This made me feel sad, because I realized that people that are mentally retarded or a genius are often misunderstood and labeled as being abnormal; \\"It had been all right as long as they could laugh at me and appear clever at my expense, but now they were feeling inferior to the moron,\\"(page 106).  <br /> I would really recommend reading this book. Not only does it contain many of life's  lessons, but it also has a great story that anyone can enjoy.  <br />

It is definately more low-key than some of their previous efforts, but that doesn't make it worse. While I don't think of Depeche Mode as a singles band (their albums need to be listened to in their entirety), \\"Dream On\\" ranks with their best. How a previous reviewer could say there is not one worthy song on this album is absurd. I'm not sure if some of these people have even listened to the album, or if they did, probably just once. I love \\"Black Celebration,\\" \\"Music For the Masses,\\" \\"SOFAD,\\" and their other classic albums and return to them often, but I don't want to hear \\"Black Celebration Volume 2,\\" I want progression and new ideas, and that's what \\"Exciter\\" was.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|Hypnotized is certainly the most innovative and conceptual of System's albums. It truly is a great work of art and the idealic representation of a truly amazing metal/hard rock album. It challenges the breadth of all of SOAD's capacities as musicians without compromising their true identity. It succesfully channels the best of all of their abilities. Such songs as Kill Rock and Roll and Lonely Day and Shes Like Heroin are great contrasts to the other songs. I have never really been a heavy metal fan. Having heard their previous works, (most notable being toxicity, which is in the same vein as some of the heavier tracks on Hypnotized)I would not consider myself a great fan of System. But while i certainly do not listen to Hypnotized as much as i do to other albums, I have come to appreciate the talent of SOAD and the album for being one of the finest metal albums i have ever heard.                                                                <br />  The best songs on album: Tentative, Holy Mountains, and Vicinity of Obsenity and Kill Rock and Roll.

1594200106|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. It is a mystery, but the plot is not very strong and the characters are not developed as well as I would like them to be. It has, however, certain charm, which led me to read it till the end... Maybe the key to this novel for me was that it is revolving around books, as the main character, Daniel, whose father is a bookstore owner (his mother is long dead) finds as a boy the unique book (supposedly, all the copies should have been burned) by the elusive author Julian Carax and starts to learn about his life, eventually fully sinking into it, mingling with Carax's friends and enemies. The setting of the plot in Barcelona of 1950's and the descriptions of the dark alleys forming almost a maze, mansions and dusty bookstores, are also an asset. But the novel is imperfect, it seems to be calculated to make it to the bestseller list, and, despite the efforts of the author to appear erudite, it is no match for, let's say Perez-Reverte's \\"The Club Dumas\\". It is a good entertainment, but if you have a choice, make it wait. I am curious if Zafon produces something superior next time.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is undoubtedly Dream Theater's best album yet, and I would consider it (I'm being facetious, of course) the 'Chuck Norris' of concept albums. It's that awesome. <br /> <br />In fact, I might be insane enough to say I liked it better than Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime, Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, and Rush's Moving Pictures. Because this album is so ridiculously good, I will proceed to break it down track-by-track. <br /> <br />1. Regression- A calming, hypnotizing opening track, beginning with a ticking clock and a hypnotherapist voice. Acoustic guitar and vocals fade in, marking the beginning of the story and main character Nicholas' descent into his memories. Extremely cool lyrics. <br /> <br />2. Overture 1928- Upbeat, very cool instrumental and nothing short of awesome. Segued very well with the previous track. A typical Dream Theater instrumental, with shredding solos, breathtaking unisons, and a general great display of their musicianship. You'll also be pleased to hear a few melodies from Metropolis Part I. <br /> <br />3. Strange Deja Vu- A frenzied, quick beginning, which I think signifies what Nicholas is experiencing: a torrent of images and memories as he travels through them during his hypno session. The  second half slightly cheers up in contrast to the first half, and truly shows you the versatility of James LaBrie's voice. The section between Nicholas' narration and Victoria's is one of my favorite moments of the album. <br /> <br />4. Through My Words- A nice one-minute piano ballad, with good lyrics, somewhat significant to the storyline. <br /> <br />5-Fatal Tragedy- One of the three songs that really stick out of this album. Moves sporatically between a haunting ballad, a metal-type riff section clearly reminiscient of Queensryche, and a mind blowing solo section (the latter section sticking out more than the first two). With the combination of what Mike Portnoy describes as the 'Shrink and Grow' section (From his Liquid Drum TheaterDVD), Rudess' two solos (Be prepared to hold your jaw up on the first), Petrucci's solo, and the previously stated musicians' unisons, this song is amazing. <br /> <br />6. Beyond This Life- The first half is a simple 5/4 metal section describing the murder and suicide of Victoria and Edward Baynes, respectively. Between the two halves is a much softer ballad-type chorus leading into the second half. The second half of the song begins with a completely grooving riff and turns into your usual Dream Theater shredfest. Another one of my favorite sections of this album takes place in this section: The absolutely awesome countermelodic unison (a little past 9:00) leading into a truly memorable riff (9:25) and rediculous unison solo (before 9:45) to which you have no idea how on earth Rudess and Petrucci managed to keep together throughout that entire thing. The song is wrapped up nicely with a resolving chorus and a few bars of guitar pickin'. Very cool song. <br /> <br />7. Through Her Eyes- Imagine Pink Floyd's 'The Great Gig in the Sky', but less intense, more depressing, and Mike Portnoy's first and only song using electronic drums. The type of ballad you'd hear in any prog concept album, and important story elements for those of you interested in that. <br /> <br />8. Home- Personally, I don't understand what's so special about this song, and I find it one of the worse songs on the album. I like the eastern-flavored intro, but despite the numerous references to Metropolis Pt I (especially in the percussion), I find the song repetitive and somewhat mainstream, and very reminiscient of 'Lie' off of Awake. (Although I admit, I like the 'decadent scenes from my memory' section after the chorus) This song has many important story elements regarding Edward Baynes, as this is the only song he's featured in. <br /> <br />9. The Dance of Eternity- Amazing. Just amazing.There is not much more I can say to describe this track. This song is definitely the technical crown jewelof SFAM. An extremely impressive display of Dream Theater's ability to use complex time signatures and polyrhythms concurrently with relentless guitar, keyboard, and drum riffs, along with a facetious ragtime section and John Myung's first shredding bass solo, ever! This song is best described as a frenzied flurry of typical Dream Theater musical insanity, and is currently my favorite track on the album. And the last riff of the song beginning at about 5:55 is probably my favorite on the album. <br /> <br />10: One Last Time- A very cool melody, and the intro really displays what Jordan Rudess can do with a piano. Segues into a very cool section performed by John Petrucci, and the song ends with a mysterious 4-bar classical piano bit. <br /> <br />11: The Spirit Carries On- This song is incredible. The lyrics, the melodies and harmonies. This song sounds alot like Floyd to boot, as far as the choir, simple drumming, organ sections, and an amazingly soulful solo (Petrucci's most soulful to date) that can almost compare to that of 'Comfortably Numb'. A very calm, optimistic song, and I'd be happy if the album ended there. But no, it's far from over. <br /> <br />12: Finally Free- This song does a great job of tricking you into thinking the story is over, and Nicholas' mind is free from the turmoil caused by Victoria's memory. Beginning with a major melody, acoustic guitar, and a bright string orchestra sound, it quickly turns into minor melodies, thunder, and a beautifully haunting piano bit. The climax to the story approaches as we hear the true story of the murders. This song does a fantastic job with its fluctuation between a happy and a sad or dark (and occasionally, melancholy) feel. A familiar melody is repeated, and the album closes amazingly with my favorite melody on the album and awesome lyrical closure. But it isn't over until the maddening plot twist that I won't mention here, you need to have a listen to hear it. (And if you've listened to the album and haven't gotten it, keep listening... It may take a few tries to understand) <br /> <br />This album is the epitome of terrific. A perfect example of both a prog-metal masterpiece and an unequivocal concept album. This album is perfection, no more, no less. First-time and second-time listeners alike, if you haven't heard this album yet, it's imperitive that you buy it as soon as possible.
B000E1155E|5.0|This CD is one of my favorites, it is almost all I have been listening to since I bought it. The music gets me on my feet because it's got such a great beat. The Arctic Monkeys have some of the best lyrics I've heard... ever. These guys are genuises, in my opinion. Well, if you haven't listened to these guys give them a shot. A Certain Romance, Mardy Bum, When the Sun goes down, Riot Van, and so many others are just sooo good. <br /> <br />These guys were on SNL Saturday, March 11th. They preform well live, as well as in the studio. This album was one of the best buys I've ever made!
B00005IC2H|5.0|Sheer perfection.    That's the best, quickest and easiest way to define this album. After owning the album for about 3 years and at least 100 straight-through listens, Svefn-G-Englar, Staralfur, and Ny Batteri all still tend to give me butterflies in my stomach, and Agaetis Byrjun is the most beautiful end to an album, ever. (Avalon doesn't count as the ending, since it's only a section of Staralfur slowed down.)    It doesn't matter if you have or haven't listened to Sigur Ros. Buy this album. Now.
B000A88EVE|5.0|I went into this film expecting something more like Walkabout, because that is all I had seen of Nicholas Roeg's work previously, and the thought of David Bowie being in it enticed me. Really, though, I had it backwards... It's David Bowie's creation with a little bit of Nicholas Roeg in it.<br /><br />The whole \\"human alien\\" thing is very much Bowie's schtick, and to a degree I found it hard not to imagine that this was Bowie's entire idea of himself. A sort of silent tragedy encompasses his character, expressed mostly in the scene with the eye-test where Bowie says very smally and pathetically \\"Oh... now I'll never get them out.\\" Bowie sees himself as an alien that just can't escape being human.<br /><br />On a broader sense than this one artist's idea, however, this is a fascinating science fiction film because it points out a side of human nature not often developed very well in other science fiction films. Instead of dissecting the alien, which is what everyone always expects humans will do, the humans do everything in their power to make him more human. Where not actually working towards constructing this \\"other\\" as a human, they try to own him, via capitalism or politics or, yes, even love.<br /><br />It's interesting then the space they put him in, with all of the various rooms like different human-empathetic places. On one hand, it's a self-reflective look at the \\"set\\" of the movie, showing that we are designing this alien to look human, but secondly a lot of it is surreally natural, as if to imply that even nature is forced to be human at our hands.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B00005JKL8|3.0|This was a rather annoying movie- one of those that I don't really enjoy, but manages to be just barely interesting enough to keep me watching it, even though I know how it will end. <br /> <br />Maybe the problem is that the film already seems dated- the music, the lightning fast camera shifts, even the setting in war-torn Bosnia- it just did not manage to retain its relevance in the same way that Black Hawk Down did. <br /> <br />It was strange to see Owen Wilson in a serious role because I'm used to him playing somewhat smarmy characters, but he carried it off quite well. And Gene Hackman was good as the admiral torn by the duty to the soldier under his command and the orders he received from higher up. <br /> <br />But I never could quite figure out what was going on-- why the superiors kept ordering Hackman away from rescuing the kid, and what was really going on. Again, the jerky camera angles and rapid fire music were distracting. It was also hard keeping up with all the subtitles-- okay, I understand having enemy soldiers speak in a foreign language to add reality to the situation, but having to read subtitles on the small screen is a pain in the neck, especially when you're also following weird camera shots and a disjointed plot. <br /> <br />Probably people who are more into war movies than I am will enjoy this, but those looking for a good action flick should look somewhere else. <br />
B000BVD460|4.0|As a casual Eminem fan I'm happy to get a \\"Hits\\" disc, and this is an extremely good one. Not only does it have 17 tracks and run over 70 minutes, but every hit is present. Included are the biggest hits \\"My Name IS\\", \\"The Real Slim Shady\\", \\"Stan\\", and \\"Without Me\\". Plus there's \\"Lose Yourself\\" from the 8-Mile soundtrack, and many others. I'm also really glad this has \\"Sing For The Moment\\" and \\"Toy Soldiers\\", both with great samples. We also get 3 new songs, all I like. Toss on a live \\"Stan\\" with Elton John and it's a sweet collection. I only wish it also had \\"Kill You\\" and \\"Drug Ballad\\". Still though a must for any fan, as nobody else can mix lyrics this filthy and entertaining over such catchy music.
B00008YLV2|4.0|the movie stands up for itself....good action /sound although DTS option would have been good....good all round packaging similiar to directors edition of wind talkers come on you movie distributors help us collectors and bring out more tin box editions aka band of brothers.......great extras/on disc 2 and doco on disc 3 about the real black hawk down....you gotta agree with the soldiers they accomplished there mission albeit that it went a little awry.....
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Hasn't the guy made enough money hamming up the blues for some time now?  This takes the cake and is about as silly as Bush dressing up like a cowboy on his Texas ranch...actually this is worse.  He should be smacked across the face for this stupid suit.  If he's going to keep reliving the past why can't he just relive his own past and go back to Cream.  That was the only time he did anything worth a crap-the new dvd is about as painful as this so I guess he should just stop recording period.   <br /> <br />This guy ONLY cares about a paycheck, or his manager is just shoving him into these stupid recording sessions.  Either way it's still his fault for doing this cheesy blues-zak.   <br />This album should make the whitest man sick to his stomach.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|it just seems to come across a little too flat on screen.  I was kind of dissapointed at first because I was starting to get sleepy.  All the great stuff is still there but ...  When Idina Menzel entered the picture she injected some well needed energy and brought me back to life.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|Even Paul McCartney sounded better with Lennon in my opinion and Paul is a far better songwriter than David Gilmour.  Dave needs some kind of sparkplug here and it's nowhere in sight.  Why did he have his wife write the lyrics?  I guess I'd prefer that over some \\"song doctor\\" or having someone else even more cheesy than Dave himself come in and throw a bunch of crap down. <br /> <br />This was a giant letdown.  I love the David Gilmour DVD he released a few years back.  It does a great job of showing his talents and not trying to create some loud elaborate stage setup to outshine Floyd.  This cd is not what I expected after watching the dvd.   <br /> <br />The production is laughable.  I love how Pink Floyd caked their 70's recordings with reverbs, delay, and any effect they could get their hands on, but this is too much for this style of songwriting.  It sounds so slow and weak.  It's as if Gilmour wrote and recorded these in the moments before he fell asleep each night. <br /> <br />Gilmour needs a Pink Floyd reunion more than we do.  They need to get back together and tour with four of them and maybe 2 extra musicians at most, or even just do a new Pompeii concert.   Let Waters take care of the lyrics and most of the songwriting and have Gilmour lend his vocals and melodic guitar playing where it's needed.  They both clearly need each other if you've heard what they've done over the years since they broke up. <br /> <br />Gilmour is my favorite guitarist, but even I can't behind this crap and support it.  It will be in a clearance bin at your record store soon if it's not there already.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|WARNING:  Plot points exposed in the following review... <br /> <br />As a tremendous fan of the 1995 BBC miniseries I was curious as to how well the story would fare in a mere 127 minutes (versus the 300 minute miniseries behemoth).  Though seemingly rushed in places (there are plot points that could have done with more exposition - the character of Lydia Bennet being the most glaring example of this), I was pleasantly surprised!  Many (including myself) consider the BBC miniseries to be the definitive adaptation of Jane Austen's most popular novel, and as such it is impossible not to compare any newcomers to it.  Happily, this film stands up on its own.  At the beginning of the film, I found myself instinctively comparing the two on a line-by-line basis.  I soon found myself simply enjoying this adaptation.  It is small wonder then that Emma Thompson, whose marvellous adaptation of Sense & Sensibility garnered her a Golden Globe, had a hand in revising this screenplay (though she is uncredited for her efforts).  The script shines with her wit. <br /> <br />The world of the Bennet family is far grittier than the BBC miniseries, the producers of which made a conscious decision to focus on the family in a sort of benign vacuum rather than placing them in the social context of the times.  The resulting reality of the film characters' lifestyle with pigs wandering to and fro in the yard brings the plight of the Bennet girls into sharp focus.  They simply MUST marry well lest they end farmer's wives with no servants and working themselves into early graves.  Or worse yet, poor single women once they are turned out of their home by Mr. Collins, obliged to depend on the kindness of others in Merryton. <br /> <br />The always pleasing Keira Knightley does a lovely job as Elizabeth Bennet.  Rather than portraying her as shockingly pessimistic, she is simply the only member of the Bennet family (save perhaps Mr. Bennet) that does not go through life with blinders on.  Her performance as the conflicted heroine has won her Golden Globe and Oscar nominations, and deservedly so.  Matthew MacFadyen imbues his Darcy with a humanity that makes Colin Firth's Darcy seem wooden in comparison.  Darcy's inward struggle of wills is delicately portrayed with only fleeting glimpses of his utter agony amid the expected reserve of the upper class.  Speaking of wooden, however,  Rosamund Pike's portrayal of the angelic Jane leaves you wanting.  Her \\"reserve\\" as they called it, was a bit overplayed and resulted in a less than sympathetic character.  While Jena Malone does not come remotely close to bringing the bratty self-centeredness of Lydia to her scant screen time.  Had I not been so familiar with the character's innumerable flaws, I might have found myself wondering why she would have been so stupid as to go off on her infamous elopement.  To me, this is the major shortfall of this adaptation.  The elopement is the stomach-sickening climax of the novel, and much of the build-up to Lydia's downfall is omitted as is much of the search for the wayward Lydia.  The result is that the viewer is not as aware of how and why she would do such a thing nor truly the extent of the consequences of her actions.  Brenda Blethyn does an admirable job of portraying Mrs. Bennet as an overbearing, pushy mother without taking on the unbearable shrillness of the miniseries Mrs. Bennet.  Donald Sutherland, though I thought him an unusual choice for Mr. Bennet, is able to convey the guilt and shame that Mr. Bennet carries for not providing adequately for his daughters' futures all the while remaining oddly sympathetic.  Dame Judi Dench was the perfect selection for the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  However, she is much nastier than the miniseries version - to an uncomfortable extent.  Rather than being simply demeaning in that unconscious way that high-born people of her era were to others below their rank, she resorts to out-and-out cruelty.  Unneccesarily, I might add (though this is a shortfall of the screenplay, not Dame Judi).   <br /> <br />In all, this version of the classic tale is remarkably well done, most especially in the development of the relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.  It is in the interactions of these two characters that the heart and soul of the movie resides; in two people so obviously perfect for each other that neither can see it. <br />
B0009WFFS6|1.0|I think the only reason this gets any good reviews is because it's new and the audio quality on the dvd transfers to our lil' home theaters so we can sit on our butts and watch these guys sit on their butts in concert.   <br /> <br />It's not completely horrible.  They're all good musicians, but just a little too stiff and akward.  We all know this was done just for money like most of Clapton's releases.  Bruce and Baker were in need of some $$ and wanted to do this for quite a while.   <br /> <br />It's forgettable and lame.  The choice of instruments for this show pretty much summed it up.  When I saw photos on the internet I knew this was what it was going to sound like and feel like.  I hope most of you bought it used-I'm glad I borrowed from a friend before he sold it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It took me a couple of years to get into Coldplays music, but since hearing Clocks on the radio about 3 years ago, I got hooked on it and today Coldplay is one of my favourite bands.  <br /> <br />These british guys have something to offer. It is not groundbreaking or anything, just plain good poppy rockmusic with a lot of great atmosphere and then also some good messages that makes this world a bit a easier to live in.  <br />Chris Martin has a cool voice that is totally his own (unfortunately other new singers try to copy him) and adds to this somewhat relaxed and at times, dreamy atmosphere that makes up the sound of Coldplay: Reverby guitars, big piano and swirling synthesizers. Beautiful and simple, but effective. <br />Coldplay is to me one of the bands that brings back what I missed in the 90's rockscene, which was very dominated by grunge and so called \\"alternative\\"- bands: Good melodies and lyrics that talks to the average human being and expresses different emotions and moods.  <br /> <br />X&Y became my favourite album in 2005 and actually it still gets better and better everytime I listen to it.  <br />At the first few listens, there were a few songs that I'd skip, namely Square one, Low and Swallowed in the sea. Today I really like these tunes even though they can't compete with my favourites What if, Fix you, Talk, The hardest part, Twisted logic and the untitled last track (Till kingdom come).  <br /> <br />Here are some words about my faves: <br /> <br />What if - A beautiful, heartfelt ballad with meaningful lyrics that makes you think Chris Martin is a guy who thinks about what life and love is worth. This piano and strings-driven song is a true classic to me.  <br /> <br />Fix you - A very big hit in 2005 and a sweet ballad with Mr. Martin singing falsetto through most of the song and being the good friend telling you that he's not gonna let you down when life is just too harsh. I love the way the song builds up from just a slow song with organ, then piano, acoustic guitar and some strings and then delivers a powerful last big chorus with simple, powerful electric guitar and uptempo drums....and then suddenly ends with only Chris Martin and his piano.  <br /> <br />Talk - A great uptempo poprocksong with a big 80es-retro-twist to it, with all the great synthesizers and the hum-along guitarriff taken from Kraftwerks \\"Computerlove\\". I really dig this song! <br /> <br />Speed of sound - A very big hit and a very typical Coldplay-song, if one can speak of such a thing from a band that has only released 3 studio albums. Very piano-driven and reminescent of Clocks because of the chords in the verses, as well as the intriguing drum-rhythm.  <br /> <br />The hardest part - This is a nice radiofriendly song that reminds me a lot of R.E.M because of the sound and the chord-changes. Not much to say about it, except that it's a really good song. <br /> <br />Twisted logic - Haunting lyrics and a strong melody with a slow guitarriff that sounds very much inspired by the last period of the Beatles (1968-1970). Rocky, but still very soft in the verses, while more powerful in the chorus. The strings and chord changes gives this song a very melancholic feel.  <br /> <br />Till kingdom come - A hymn that was originally written for Johnny Cash and sounds totally as if it could have been included in one of his last 3 albums. Chris Martin sings in a very humble manner, only accompanied by acoustic guitar, piano and pump organ. The lyrics are somewhat a prayer to God, carrying hope for reconsilation and resurrection on the day Christ will return.  <br /> <br />What more can I say that hasn't already been said about X&Y at least a 100 times? ;-) If you like modern melodic rockmusic on the softer side, this album is definitely worth every penny. I highly recommend it!!!
B00004RHZU|5.0|I LOVE PINK AND THIS IS THE ONLY CD I DIDNT HAVE I LOVED HER CAREFREE TELL IT HOW IT IS SONGS AND ITS GREAT TO EXERCISE TO --GETS THAT HEART PUMPING
B000E1155E|3.0|so eeeeveryone i know who knows anything about music has been going on and on about this band and how they're the biggest thing in england right now... and i'd already heard \\"i bet you'd look good on the dancefloor\\" and thought it was ok... i was hoping the rest of the songs would be better, if only to validate the hype in the least. um ok, it's a good record, i'll probably give it a couple more listens, and i'm sure they're a sick band to see live, but c'mon learn a lesson: Just Because They Are Big in the UK Does Not Make Them Great... hello anyone remember a little band called the Darkness? yeah well, they have a new record out now, and does anybody care? uh huh, that's what i thought. but to be fair, the Darkness had some rad songs too... ahem.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Im a sci-fi nut that loves movies that deal with post appocolyptic time periods or futuristic facist governments (Philidelphia Experiment II). I thought it was unique calling the futuristic police in this movie clerics and the government forces everyone to take a emotion supressing drug. This means, no emotions.<br /><br />Christian Bale was pretty good, and even though the stunts looked a lot like The Matrix, I liked it. The movie moved at a quick pace. If you watch the movie for the first time and you are trying to soak it in, wait a few days then watch it again. If you are questioning the movie as you watch it for the first time, you're going to get lost. Anyway, the ending was pretty good and I will admit I was a little disapointed mainly because I was so intrigued at the end that I wish it went further and didn't end with Preston's son smiling after the \\"big explosion\\". The ending capped a great movie. The special effects were good, and the plot and setting were excellent.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi/post appocolyptic worlds then I would recommend this movie.
B0000A36J5|5.0|***** <br />The Best <br />AAA
B00000IQV7|5.0|This movie will make you laugh, cry, and think.  It's definitely a good date movie.  Bring a box of kleenex though.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is an incredible album, but I must correct \\"Britton\\" from the University of Alabama. He states that Layne Staley wrote \\"Them Bones\\" and \\"Would\\" when in fact Jerry Cantrell wrote both of those tunes. The only songs that Layne wrote without the assistance of the other members are \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Hate to Feel\\". Those are great songs as well, but give credit where credit is due. Jerry Cantrell was the driving musical force behind this band, and lyrically he and Layne made AIC what it was.
B000089CJI|5.0|this is the best album i have ever lisened to. if you are a death cab for cutie fan you will lo lo lo love this album it is death cab times 10 they are now my favorite band and i hope they collaborate again to make a fallow up album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0316168815|2.0|I shall review the book with a list of positives and negatives.  Unfortunately, I can name only one positive. <br />POSITIVE <br />The story begins like a murder mystery, albeit told by the victim, Susie Salmon, who is in heaven.  It held my interest almost to the end.  How would the murderer be discovered?  Would the victim, looking down from her heaven, lead the guilty to his judgment? <br />NEGATIVE <br />1)  I read the chapters quickly, expecting a twist or a turn with a plausible ending typical of a good murder mystery.  Only in the last couple of chapters, after much anticipation, does it become apparent that Sebold did not intend the book to read as a mystery.  Her goal, as I see it, was to portray how, after a devastating and horrific event occurs within a family, relationships go awry and the family becomes dysfunctional - a  skeletal form of its once normal body left pathetic with missing parts;  yet somehow, guided by the celestial Susie, there is recovery, and normalcy is regained. And so, the skeletal form is healed - voila, \\"lovely bones.\\"  How misleading!  300 pp of \\"mystery\\" is tossed away as if it never happened! <br />2)  Sebold rambles on excessively and unnecessarily about simple events and thoughts.  Skip some paragraphs and not miss a thing. <br />3)  Sebold's writing lacks originality. <br />    a)  Susie's father's absolute certainty that Mr. Harvey is the killer is based on no real evidence, only on flawed assumptions.  Harvey acts weird, looks weird, never socializes, builds spooky things, looks guilty!  On that basis, I suppose we all could condemn a number of innocent people to the electric chair. <br />    b)  Susie inhabits Ruth's body to make love to Ray.  Is that original?  Absolutely not.  You need only think of the movie, GHOST, which was filmed long before Sebold's book was published.  GHOST stirred favorable emotions within me.  \\"Unchained Melody\\" still rings in my heart.  But this copy-cat scene left me frowning and groaning. <br/>    c)  Sebold devotes chapter after chapter to the misdeeds and sins of the murderer.  Yet, his end, though \\"icy,\\" is abrupt and benign.  No remorse.  No justice served.  Okay, many real-life murderers do get away with it and probably meet a normal death.  But they have no Susies in heaven to watch them and to relate their stories. <br />CONCLUSION <br />The book is easy to read.  It was praised by many and achieved best-seller status for many months.  It is yet another example or proof that popularity of a book does not necessarily equate literary merit.  I read the book for a discussion group.  I suspect my disappointment with the book shall be a minority view. <br /> <br />
B0007M22TI|4.0|I really liked this DVD alot.  It had the whole concert (which plays regularly during PBS pledge drives)without annoying interruptions asking for your donations.  It also had 5 \\"behind the scenes\\" interviews with the soloist which were quite interesting, as well as a short interview with David Downes, the musical director.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoy Celtic music or just like really good singing, you'll enjoy this DVD.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Another one of those shows that you want to continue on into the night. I get upset when it ends at the end of the hour.
B0002858YS|4.0|3.5 Stars is my actually rating for this.  Mr. Brightside is the best song on the album, but there are a few other songs that are equally as good.  I was just expecting this album to be better then it was, however it is still a good album and worth a listen, after all they are one of the hot new groups out there.
0140187650|5.0|Such was the description of Eichmann given by his lawyer, Dr. Servatius. \\"Mailman\\" is quite apropos. What we have in Eichmann is the farthest thing from a dominant personality. He was a joiner and a conformist, but not a man who'd likely be evil outside the historical context of the Third Reich. Honestly, as Arendt's account makes clear, the fellow was a complete non-entity who only felt comfortable when speaking in his native tongue of officialese. As one of the Israeli interrogators pointed out, it is rather inconceivable that such a marginal talent could rise to the level of Lieutenant Colonel in the SS (but look at his peers).<br /><br />A complete psychological study of the man is what Arendt's account achieves, and this is a book to read and read again. Eichmann in Jerusalem is valuable for its journalism, as it covers his trial aptly, but also for its history. As a narrator, Arendt is erudite and clever; although, sometimes she can border on the snide. There are a few things she makes note of which are not entirely accurate as well such as assuming that the July 20th conspirators only turned on Hitler when events went badly in the war. That's not the case. They leaked information to the allies before the war even started. Also, that the Nazis would back down when presented with determined civilian resistance to their anti-Jewish measures is highly dubious. Generally, they always met force with more force, and reprisals were their rule-backing down was the exception. Of course, the information available to Arendt back in 1961 cannot be compared to the tsunami of documentation we have at our fingertips today. Overall, this is a stunning work.

1881273156|5.0|This book is absolutely essential in any married individuals library and life. It helps you understand that what might be important to you in expressing love towards another is not always understood as equally important by the other individual.  But, that each individuals attempts are absolutely valid and must be valued. This books ideas caused numerous flashbacks of my childhood; how I was taught what \\"love\\" meant in Dad's language, but never in Mom's language. It unlocked the mystery of what \\"love\\" truly is to each unique individual and how important it is to speak your loved one's love language.  Its a strange title, and maybe some think its corny, but it is a must read for anyone serious about keeping their marriage alive and well.

B000AADYYO|3.0|Opeth keeps progressing their sound... But this album is not one of my favorites... I have all of their albums so I am rating this album out of their other releases.  When Opeth says they are going to play their heavy music again... I want to hear more albums... like Orchid and My Arms Your Hearse. Orchid was a great debut album and I know they do not want to sound like that anymore... they want to progress from that (like any artist strives to do with their work)  I just feel there was a certain intensity in that album that made it be one of my favorites even after the release of their other albums. My Arms Your Hearse captured that same intensity... and this is the intensity I wanted to relive in their latest heavy album.  I have read other reviews on this site... some good and some bad  just to see some constructive critisizm ... it seems the bad reviews I read were very un-intelligent. I have to laugh at someone saying APC is a ripoff of Tool... APC is going to have some likeness because the lead singer is Maynard. Opeth ripping off Tool? I do not even understand that comment... the only similarity to me is that they both have some lengthy songs (which i LIKE) ... Otherwise... the lyrics and sound... are completly different...
B00070Q7VO|2.0|This is my first Michael Buble CD, and I gotta say I was disappointed.  After all the hype, I was expecting something really great, but Frank Sinatra leaves Buble in the dust (as does the rest of the ratpack).  When I was listening to the CD,  I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in some cheap hotel lounge.  I kept expecting to hear the clinking and clanking of glasses and silverware during the music.  I think this singer has some talent, but there is nothing special here so far that distinguishes him from every other lounge singer.  I also did not like the female who did the duet with him.  Her voice sounds kind of nasally to me, and I keep skipping over that song so I don't have to hear her.  I mean, this CD is all right if you want some background music at a cocktail party or something, but it's not so great for just listening to.
B00006L83N|5.0|I've heard people refer to Symphony X as geek metal because of the subject matter (dragons, wizards, medusa, boats).  don't worry,  There's more here than just \\"The Clash of the Titans.\\"  Just so you know, I am a long-term drummer, a short-term guitarist, and a lowsy keyboard player. I've also been forced into the arena of lead and backing vocals at various times.  this is also my first Symphony X album, so this is my viewpoint of the album: <br /> <br />This Russell guy's voice is intense and he really displays his ability to bring about soul and agression to support the mood of the song at any given moment. On top of that, he can read. It seems,according to other reviews, that they get subject material from mythology and literature and write an intense musical soudtrack for us to listen to. These men are atleast classically (lyrically and musically) oriented and not just singing devi, devil, devil for the heck of it.  Most prog metal lyrics out there require interpretation because they are so flowery, vague, and artificially artistic. If you've ever read the Iliad or the Odyssey by Homer and you also like prog metal and aren't ashamed to be numbered with the geeks, get this album. It's a viable alternative to playing Dungeons and Dragons and/or reading Star Wars novels. <br /> <br />The guitar work is very engaging! Especially in the opening tracks. Everyone has an opinion on who's the best, but I think that this guy is better than me so there's alot I can learn from him. I think he's more comparable to Yngwe (however you spell his name...) than petrucci because he's, for the most part, a diatonic and scalar shredder in his solos and more speed oriented in most of his riffs.  If you read the insert in the special edition bonus version they admit that they wanted to focus on the guitar on this album...and it is the most prominent. <br /> <br />The keyboards are very cool, not as prominent as Dream Theater's typical arranging and mixing, but nevertheless, present anadding alot to the songs. I don't know much about the keyboard, but a good one can add a considerable ammount of power to a song.  You'll notice this in the last track especially with the french horns or whichever sound he's emulating...it gives you the sense of hidding a horse with a sword...or sailing in a ship with a canon...intense geek feelings. <br /> <br />Of course the drummer is good.  I love me some doublebass drumming!  He doubles well and complements well. He exhibits nice cymbal work on top of some intense double kick action.  The album picture doesn't show him with this huge siamese monster like portnoy (if that is a virtue to you) but he sounds very polished and complex without all the pots and pans.  I particualrly like the way his snare sounds, it's very well mic'd and cuts through but doesn't over power the mix. <br /> <br />The bass really doesn't stand out in this album, but isn't that always the case? You guys need to star a Bass Player's Tone Union.  I just figure (as with John Myung) that if he can double these riffs, he's good. Most drummers and bass players are underrated anyway. Get used to it. Think of the trade off...along with all the attention, guitarists and singers get 98% of the criticism too. <br /> <br />So wether you are a prog enthusiast, an unemployed musician, a Chronicles of Narnia/Lord of the Rings type geek, or are a connoseur of good 20+ minute songs, direct your mouse to the \\"add to cart\\" button, you won't be disapointed. If you are offended by the album artwork, (look closely at the picture before buying because I didn't) just do what I always do, have your wife open the box first and put happy face stickers over all the naked bodies. <br /> <br />So to all you guys out there that call this album cheese...back off. Some of us like the geek stuff or can overlook it long enough to enjoy some good metal prog neo prog classic baroque prog and roll or what ever the official category is. Think it sounds too much like 80's metal?  Is that really a problem?  Some of us like 80's metal, we don't wear the clothes anymore, but we like the music. You know you want to want to put on your Ratt t-shirt, bang your head (mullet), pump your fist (while wearing a sweat band) and sing along with the over-dubbed Rusells at the end of the title track (The Odyssey)...\\"Triumphant champion of Ithica!\\"  Don't be ashamed, geeks unite!
B00003CX9E|1.0|Try as I may, I just can't seem to enjoy this movie. <br />I got together with some friends who had all seen just \\"parts\\" of the movie before. We decided that we would watch it from start to finish, to see just why it was considered to be \\"the greatest film of all time\\". <br />Every one of us is still wondering why. <br />It's slow. <br />It's boring. <br />It'll put you to sleep faster than counting sheep. <br />Maybe it WAS great for it's time, but can you honestly say there has NEVER been another movie made that is better? <br />I can't even include this movie anywhere in my top 100 movie list. <br />But I can easily include it in my worst 100 list. <br />This has nothing to do with my not liking \\"old\\" movies. My all time favorite is It's A Wonderful Life. And I enjoy the 1933 edition of King Kong as another example. But then again, these two movies are ENTERTAINING. <br />Which is more than I can say for this \\"classic\\".

6304696515|5.0|I loved this film, it really is such fun to watch Close and Malkovich give career performances.  I am so perplexed as to how Glenn Close did not win best actress for this movie, she is absolutely fantastic, one of the best performances I have ever seen by an actress, Jody Foster won that year for The Accused, go figure. The acting is top notch across the board, with the exception of Keanu Reeves, but at least he looks good.  Malkovich looks like he is having so much fun with Valont and his peculiar quirks really work here, it is the perfect movie for this actor.  The ending is so well done and the last shot of Close is perfect.  The setting is stunning, the movie perfectly captures Ancient Regime France and the inner sanctum of the nobility.  All the debauchary and malicious gossip, is on grand display here and you can't take your eyes off of it.  Really a great movie.

B00005JMYI|1.0|I'm a mild Will Farrell fan, but Will should be embarassed <br />to have written this.  Steve Carrell's role was also offensive. <br />We had to turn it off after about 15-20 minutes.
0767817710|2.0|Well, if you want a film with lots of violence, good guys and bad guys, and happily fulfilled vengence - I am not giving anything away unless you can believe this might be a trajedy - yet don't care that it lacks a soul, this is your film.  However, if you hope to find good drama, better-than-formulaic acting, and quiky surprises, forget this.  In my view, there is nothing to this whatsoever that makes it any better than a waste of time.  And not a good waste of time at that.<br /><br />Not recommended.  It is nothing but stereotypes, indifferenct acting, and utterly predicatable.
B000006TRV|5.0|I love Pink floyd.They are my favourite band and this is one heck of a great album.This is a work of art which you should possess.
0192838679|5.0|I had seen the great film Dangerous Liaison's, so I was drawn to reading the original sourse material, I was at first taken aback by its being an epistolary novel, but I got used to that in short order and really enjoyed the book.  Ancient Regime France is a perfect setting for a story of this sort.  The intrigue and debauchary among the aristocracy was at its zenith during this time, is there any wonder the French Revolution was so uh, unpleasant.  Really an interesting read and I totally recommend the movie Dangerous Liaison's and also the movie Valmont...frankly Firth and Bening cannot hold a gilded candle to the great Malkovich and Close, but it's fun to compare the two films and Valmont is not bad, it's just not Dangerous Liaison's.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|First off I have to say that I am a music snob. I had disregarded punk rock several years ago as my teen angst subsided and decided that there was more to life than three chords. But \\"London Calling\\" is on of those classic albums that really doesn't fit into any genre. I was blown away by it and it hasn't left my cd player since I got it. The bottom line is these guys are musicians. Do not pass go without a copy of this.
1593081308|5.0|Persusion is the story of Anne Elliot, a girl trapped in a classic example of listening to bad advice.Anne falls for the charming Captain Wentworth, and after many sunny days spent toghether, the couple decides to marry.When Anne tells this to her dear and only friend, Lady Russell, she is informed that he is too poor and far below her status as a daughter of a baronet. After succumbing to Lady Russell's persuasion, a broken-hearted Anne ends the engagement. The miserable pair then goes their separate ways.Eight years later, the Elliots are struggling for money and decide to lease their house and move to Bath,leaving Anne with her sister Mary. Who should be their new tenant, but Cpt. Wentworth's brother. Anne and Wenworth are soon thrown together again. This begins a journey of reconciliation, leaving the reader with the constant question,\\"Will they forgive their past and rekindle their love?\\" <br />I thought this was an excellent literary classic that truly captures the point and makes a great romance without being sappy or the characters being shallow. I would recommend this book for middle school on up, and primarily for girls. I can't picture many males sitting still for this one. The characters are perfectly molded, and some, like Sir Walter are humorous and very entertaining.I would give Persusion 5 stars and 2 thumbs for an excellent novel!
B00004RFFS|4.0|Anyone who is a Ricean Vampire Chronicles fan knows that Hollywood does the books injustice. Louis has black hair and green eyes, Armand should of looked 17 with auburn hair and hazel eyes seeing he was from Russia. Louis was depressed because his brother died, not a wife and child. Daniel, had violet eyes.. the time that Louis was giving the interview should of been 1970s.  <br /> <br />They never talked about Armand's attempts to make Claudia a woman, etc etc.  <br /> <br />The only thing that they did get right was Lestat, somewhat. Tom was a perfect choice because of the smile, but Lestat himself should of looked at least 20 years old and he looked older. <br /> <br />Other than that, they kept to the storyline. <br /> <br />Kudos.

0060763280|1.0|I was disappointed in this book for a couple of reasons.  The first reason is that there is nothing new here.  Anyone who has read at least two self help books in their lives, realizes that change in one's life of any sort starts from within.  Changing your inner world before your outer world can change is definately NOT a new concept.  What is the big secret there??  Eker writes as though he believes that he created this concept, but \\"don't believe a word\\" he says!!.   <br /> <br />The second part of the book lists reasons how rich people differ from poor people i.e. \\"poor people work hard for their money while rich people have their money work hard for them\\". <br />Oh please!!! <br /> <br />The number one reason I do not recommend this book is all the hype and push to spend more of your hard earned dollars and attend one of his seminars.   <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and read \\"Start Late Finish Rich\\" instead.  This book gives you REAL advice about how you can begin growing your money.  I highly recommend it.
B00068CVJ4|4.0|It's hard to see how the remnants of At the Drive In turned out. One half turned into a shadowy image of their former selves, Sparta. The other half turned into a pair of dudes who take themselves too seriously, The Mars Volta. Yet, right before all that happened, these guys managed to get out one more creative piece, Relationship of Command.    Many have commented that this one is the best album ATDI has released. That is a rather dubious statement, considering the high quality of their previous efforts. This one happens to be a bit over produced, which is both a good thing and a bad thing.     The production values give the album a more solid punch. It's clear some of these songs benefit from the treatment. On the other hand, it would have been better to concentrate on the actual songs, as the production tends to drown out some of the emotion and energy that ATDI is known for. Still, you can't beat the energy coming from the opening track, Arcarsenal.    The album is well developed, as it does show a maturity that these fellows have obtained. Yet, there in lies their fault: They seem to make everything a little epic on this one. Sometimes, making things simple and straight to the point is better because some things are not meant to be exxagerated. Listen to Invalid Little Department and you will know what I mean.     Overall however, this has to be a solid album. It is very accessible, meaning you will have an easier time to get into this one as opposed to the band's other releases. Chances are if you like this kind of music, you will be very pleased. It does have some amazing songs. But take heed, as ATDI has released albums that better caption their fury. Still, this one is comes highly recommended.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|We all know the story.  Chicken Little got hit on the head by an acorn, got the whole town into a panic by proclaiming \\"The sky is falling,\\" and then suffered humiliation for his mistake.  Clearly, the little guy is in need of some redemption - and, thanks to the folks at Disney - he finally has it.  He really did get hit on the head by a piece of the sky - actually, a cloaking panel from an alien spaceship.  Redemption doesn't come quickly, however.  A full year after the original embarrassing incident (which never faded into the background, thanks to billboards, a book, and a forthcoming movie about the whole fiasco), it happens to Chicken Little again.  Even with friends to verify the event, no one believes him yet again, not even his father.  It's a terrible thing for a child to tell the truth and have one of his parents not believe him.  The trauma of that feeling, even more than the continuing public embarrassment, has haunted Chicken Little ever since the original incident.  Buck Cluck loves his son, and he tries to be a good single father to him, but he's really not there for Chicken Little in the bad times.  That gulf between an otherwise loving father and son is really the emotional crux of this story, carrying with it a meaningful message to both children and parents alike.<br /><br />Michael Eisner did at least one good thing during his time at Disney - he saw the original image of Chicken Little as a female and changed the minds of the filmmakers on that score.  From that point on, it was smooth sailing - due largely to some wonderful casting for the voice actors.  I think Zach Braff is great as the voice of the little hero, but Joan Cusack and Steve Zahn are pretty much perfect as the voices of Abby \\"Ugly Duckling\\" Mallard and Runt of the Litter, respectively.  With all of their comedic antics, these two characters (along with the amazing Fish Out of Water), really make this a movie that kids are sure to love.  Garry Marshall brings Chicken Little's dad to life, while a whole cadre of talented stars, including Patrick Stewart, Amy Sedaris, and Don Knotts, make even the minor characters delightful.  The only little issue I might have with this film is the music, and I only say that because a good bit of it goes back two or three decades.  When Runt starts doing Bee Gees and Gloria Gaynor songs to keep up his courage, few kids are going to recognize the music - maybe the filmmakers just threw this stuff in as a little extra for adult viewers.<br /><br />As usual, Disney proves quite generous with the extra features on the DVD.  You get the obligatory behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film, three alternate openings and a deleted scene, the music video of Shake Your Tail Feathers by The Cheetah Girls (featuring Chicken Little, Ugly Duckling, and Runt getting down with their bad selves), a music video (not to mention karaoke and sing-a-long versions) of One Little Slip by the Barenaked Ladies, a trivia-related game of \\"Where's Fish?\\" and sneak peeks at gobs of upcoming Disney releases.  The alternate openings are interesting, reflecting the fact that the filmmakers were unsure at first how to introduce the film to the audience, and one of them is quite special indeed, as it features the late Don Knotts narrating the classic tale of the unfortunate little chicken.<br /><br />I'll never be too old to enjoy a good animated film, and the sort of 3D animation that brings Chicken Little's world to life is still quite an amazing thing to see.  At the same time, the animators attempt to retain the essence of the classic Disney style, which ensures that the look of this movie won't be anything less than impressive.  Ye olde squish and stretch never gets old, while the move and zoom point of view technique really goes to show how far animation has come over the decades.  It's that mix of the past and the present that makes this film a real winner in my book.  Chicken Little certainly isn't Disney's most magical film,but it is cute and entertaining enough to delight children as well as a fair share of adults.cal film, but it is cute and entertaining enough to delight children as well as a fair share of adults.

B0007QJ1MK|5.0|It has been roughly one year since this album was released. As of today, I still find myself listening to it regularly, as this cd just has classic written all over it. The opening pair of songs are  nothing more than tastes of what is in store for the listener. <br /> <br />Queens of the Stone Age may not have Nick Oliveri in it, but you can tell that this cd still kicks. All of the elements fall into play, creating a cohesive piece of music that captures your mind. You will find yourself rocking out with Medication and Someone's in the Wolf. You may find yourself singing along to the singles Little Sister and In my Head. You may find yourself lamenting to Long Slow Goodbye and I Never Came. In fact, there is not one bad track on this album. <br /> <br />This one can be considered an overview of the band's output from their inceptiion to today, as most of the songs sound like they could be from another album. That is why this one is amazing. It is definitely Queens. It has the stoner grove from the first record, the pop elements from the second and the heavy parts from the previous effort. It also hints at what's in storage for us fans in the future. <br /> <br />Lullabies is utterly amazing. The high quality of the songs, as well as the tendency for you to hit the repeat button suggest this one to be a modern classic. It is the kind of cd that our kids will be listening to in about 20 years. Do yourself a favor. Pick it up. NOW!
B000BKJ78U|5.0|We bought this set for my four year old.  He had been given a lot of the toys for Christmas. Having previewed the more recent Star Wars movies, and finding them to violent for a four year old, and we figured this trilogy was a great way to introduce him to the Star Wars characters.  We were happy to sit and watch with him, reliving this great epic story.  We did notice a change ... the last scene of Return of the Jedi has a different Anniken Skywalker than the original movie had.  They updated it to go along with the new, more recently made Star Wars movies.  That did not diminish the thrill of revisiting these characters.

B000002513|5.0|Shouldst thou purchase this CD then you will be making a wise choice. Mr. Springsteen's musical authority is hard to question when such an album is presented. From the E Street Shuffle to Rosalita's overbearing father, the album presents a lifestyle just waiting for change. That change will come with Born to Run but for right now it's just sitting around waiting. It also represents someone's strong desire for that change to come, waiting to leave. It starts with the E Street Shuffle, a song about living in a high-crime area where the cops are constantly after Power and his girl, it would seem, so Power's girl picks him up and they leave. Next on the list is 4th of July, Asbury Park, a song about a guy from the shores of Jersey describing the boardwalk life and why he's done with it and he wants Sandy to let him have her just one time before he's gone. Then we have the jazz influenced Kitty's Back, a good period in the middle of the song is spent mostly on jazzy music but the lyrics, as best I can tell, are about an influential girl who left to go live with some well to do city fellow but got left by him and now she's back. We are now presented a rock and roll (sorta) song called Wild Billy's Circus Story, with a tuba mixed in. It's a slow song about someone who ran away to the circus, in essence. Then it describes the circus life some. Interesting song. Then when that song edges out we are hit by David Sancious' (I think I spelt that right) piano as the next song gears up and becomes Incident on 57th Street, an absolutely beautiful song about two youngin's living in the underworld with the drug racket and gangs and pimps. A Romeo & Juliet  story (Rom and Jul are even mentioned in the song) which does not end tragically but when one's imagination goes past the lyrics we can only think that it does end quite harshly. Just as this song slips away the true rock and roll comes right back to ya with Rosalita. \\"Damn, that's a good one.\\" A boy in a rock and roll band with no money loves a girl. The girl's father says, \\"He's got no money\\" while Mom says, \\"He's in a rock and roll band\\" as they don't want their daughter to date him. But the singer now has himself a record deal and a \\"big advance!\\" So as far as one can tell the girl hops on the back of his motorcycle (never mentioned, I'm trying to sound smart) and they peel out and go live their life. Lastly we have New York City Serenade. Nothing I type here can give you a true understanding of this song. The piano dominates the two minute + intro with some hard hitting notes but it finally softens up and shows you the easy tune you were being built up for with the guitar joining in. Then Bruce goes to talk about two kids boogalooing down Broadway, a fish lady and vibes man stinging a trashcan. The lyrics make sense when you hear them but if you simply read them you'll think Bruce was on drugs. But it has such a beautiful tune and the lyrics are sung just right that one almost could cry the song is so perfect. A perfect ending to an album.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I have been a floyd fan for most of my life.  The sublime experiences I have had with their albums over the years have touched my life and, in some dark times, have given voice to my fear and rage and awe and yearning, etc.<br /><br />But, here I am... in the middle of life and I don't feel quite so much fear or quite so much rage.  I'm concerned with companionship and family and kind of looking in front of me and looking in back of me with some apprehension, a little sadness and, dare I write it, gratitude and hope.<br /><br />I have grown so much through and with Floyd.  Why are fans so bothered by what is being termed: adult contemporary musak.  It is still beautifully produced and worked with the woman he loves.  This is about love.<br /><br />No, of course it is not \\"Wish You Were Here\\" or \\"Meddle\\" or \\"The Wall\\".  But then again, nothing every really will be,  including anything the long-suffering Mr. Waters might come up with.<br /><br />I for one am happy for the Gilmores.  I would feel very sorry for Dave and his family if he were still producing that beautiful but pained sort of music.  Angst is for the young.  A sense of well-being and peace is what we all hope to attain.  That is what this album is.  Music for the middle-of-life.<br /><br />BTW, I get uncomfortable when rock-stars refuse to shed their 20-year-old selves.  I mean, really life is about personal growth and evolution.  Dig a little deeper and you might find that this is a fine album, indeed.<br /><br />Lighten up on the guy and his wife.  He really doesn't \\"owe\\" us anything.

0446577383|2.0|This book has all the requisite thriller ingredients but the result somehow came across as a rote exercise, lacking in inspiration.    The political viewpoints of the author came through too loadly and overwhelmed the plot, which had too many logical flaws to be very believable.  The constant shifts between people and locations made it hard to relate to any of the thinly developed characters and bogged down the story instead of making it more suspenseful.  Finally, the Camel Club itself turned out to be rather incidental to the resolution of the conflict, a let down from the huge buildup it received in early chapters.     Baldacci is too talented of a storyteller to settle for such a mediocre product.  I'd like to see him put more care into his future novels.

B0000025D0|5.0|To truly appreciate this album one must first come to know Born to Run. Born to Run tells us of the romantic dreams of running off into the sunset, chasing whatever hope we have left of our youthful optimism, this is Bruce going major and meeting his dream. But then for almost three years Bruce didn't release any albums. This is because of legal issues and production issues I don't understand but I'll give you that much. It was in this time Bruce also read the Grapes of Wrath; something I don't have any authroity on either. But eitherwho; it led Bruce to realizing that life, even when you make it big time, is still crappy. It starts with Badlands, a deceptive song; the tune is maybe not happy but it's shake-your-fist rock and roll but a tone deaf reading of the lyrics seems to say that being Born to Run down Thunder Road getting away from the boardwalk life of 4th of July Asbury Park leads one to more badlands, that wherever you go things suck. Bruce simply tells us how angry he is that things suck no matter where you go. So the character is basically singing to any girl who'll listen that things are crappy and they're going to be so for a while, lets just take eachother and go make a relationship happen. Adam Raised a Cain is the next song, a song both in lyric and tune that is very angry, a young man rebelling against his father. I won't go too much into it. Next is Something in the Night, lyrically depressing, it sings about that car ride from Thunder Road ending in a way that we didn't expect. Candy's Room comes next, a lustful song about a man who has preconcieved (that's my view of it) notions of being loved by a girl who may or may not be a hooker. I don't know, everybody reads things different. My mom thinks Secret Garden (a few albums down the road from here) is about hookers. Next we have Racing in the Street, a song I truly enjoy about a love soured by time. Then the Promised Land, very upbeat lyric about someone who's in the same crappy world as the guyin Badlands but this guy realizes things will get or at least could get better if he had some control. Factory is a short song about \\"the working, the working, just the working life.\\" Streets of Fire I can't quite get what it's 'about' but it's a good song, simply enough. Prove it All Night is a classic song, mostly a romance song about proving their love to eachother be it through physical actions or superficial items. Darkness on the Edge of Town moodily closes this album basically painting out Born to Run as having limits, that you can only run so far. Yes, a short review, but I'm tired. Long story short is this album is definately worth your money.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|This movie obviously tries to become a classical movie. The pictures and the acting performances are perfect and it is difficult to believe, that Kong isn't a real gorilla..but I think they shouldn't have given Peter Jackson such an enormous budget for this movie as he put in way too much computer material. Watching a supergorilla would have been enough already...Having dinosaurs from Jurassic Park and huge insects from Eight legged Freaks there at the same time simply is too much. Undoubtedly the movie is great to watch, but personally I believe the story of King Kong isn't interesting enough to make a blockbuster out of it. I only hope no one is thinking of a sequel.(SARR) <br />    <br />

B0006VIE4C|1.0|Mr. Lucas claims that this particular cut of \\"Star Wars: Episode IV\\" is his \\"original, intended vision\\" for the film.  Thank the Maker he failed in 1977, and we got one of the greatest films of all time.  Certainly not the first time great art has come from the failure of the artist to express his exact vision. <br /> <br />We don't get to see the better film on DVD because George says so.  It is the opinion of the lawyers and the judges that he \\"owns\\" the film.  This, of course, is typical of any Empire's behavior.  The power rests with the State. <br /> <br />George owns nothing.  We, the people own it.  Not in any financial sense, but in the very real sense that it changed our lives.  Having watched it, it became a part of our memory and a part of history.  No man owns my childhood.  No man owns history. <br /> <br />George bucked the system getting this movie made, and now cowers behind that very system to keep it from being circulated once again.  To say that this DVD is not only the best release, but the ONLY release you are allowed to see, and that the will of the fans amounts to droid droppings next to his Holy word, is Lucas' own definition of going over to the dark side of the Force. <br /> <br />At least, there is a New Hope : Almost hidden from the Empire, his name is Joss Whedon...
0790731940|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  I bought it for my husband, but I have to admit I truly enjoy it too.  This is one of the best comedic westerns around!  It has a great plot that keeps you guessing right up until the end!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I have to qualify this review with the caveat that I spent a lot of time with the Firefly TV series DVDs before ever viewing this feature. So if you're new to the Firefly universe, I'm not sure how useful my perspective on this film will be to you. From that backdrop, having listened to all the comments from Joss Whedon about what he wanted the show to be, how he adapted it to make it palatable for the network execs, etc., I was not that surprised at the difference in tone from the TV show to the movie. Still, it was a bit jarring at first. The main characters are all a bit darker, a bit colder and harder, than in the TV series. There is an element of warm whimsy in the TV show that is lacking here; or at least it's buried deeper. Of course, it could all be explained by the passage of time and the fact that they've all been cooped up on the ship together for that much longer, and have been having a tough time finding work, etc. At any rate, I felt like I had to make a sort of shift in my perspective, view these characters from a slightly different place, before I could relate to them as the same people I'd grown attached to in the TV show. Once I made that adjustment -- and I really didn't pull it off until the second time viewing the movie -- I found myself in more or less familiar territory. The clever, witty dialog, fine acting with great chemistry between characters, live-action feel with ambient lighting and hand-held camera shots, extending even into the excellent but unobtrusive special effects. One thing I found puzzling was the absence of the western element; as far as I can remember, there was not a single horse in this movie. Puzzling because that was Joss Whedon's original idea for the show -- a Sci-Fi Western. But anyhow, it's a really great story, very well told. I don't think I'll be spoiling anything for anybody if I say that some of the ongoing threads from the TV series will be tied up here. I think the tying-up of the old threads is very artfullyand seamlessly integrated with the present very compelling story, but my perspective may be skewed on that since I'm so steeped in the old threads. Anyhow, not all the old threads are tied up, and that's good news for fans because it means more is coming; let's hope JW finds a way to make it happen.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Very, very Floydian... Same beat, the distingushed psychedelic <br />sound of David's guitar, solos, awesome sax.... Maybe even the best of David's ever. I was listening to it yesterday while driving in a pouring rain and it was unbelievable experience... Out of space sound..... There is only one drawback- the album is very short........you want more and more and more............ <br />I was lucky to get tickets for David's concert and I am looking forward to his show. Highly recommended album!!!!! I love it!!!! <br />
0800177177|3.0|I honestly cannot fathom the reason as to why this film is called 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', when it hardly resembles his infamous book. I was.. disappointed, to say the least, when I first saw this movie. The cast was dreadful, the acting appalling, the story-line way too dramatically changed. Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were just.. too young and amateur to play their parts convincingly. Reeves managed to look cute and innocent on screen, but also very wooden; and what on earth was with the so-called 'English' accent?! Anthony Hopkins put himself across as a mad, disturbingly perverted old Van Helsing. The parts of Lucy Westenra and the mentally instable Renfield were played rather well; in fact, they were the only redeeming aspects of this film. Dracula himself.. was done quite admirably, in essence. But portraying Gary Oldman as a tragic romantic hero, was not a good move; it just doesn't work.  <br />What I am annoyed about, is the inappropriately named title. It is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, it is Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula. C'est tout.  <br />With my criticisms in mind; for the viewer that has been untainted by any former knowledge of the original Count Dracula, it is a rather good film. But for me, Dracula is not just the fictions of a demented Irishman.

B0007XAWB2|4.0|The Master and Commander is a book about Captain Jack Aubrey and Doctor Steven Maturin aboard the ship Sophie (a Spanish ship) in the Caribbean, and is part of a huge series of books (20) following the Aubrey/Maturin duo.  While this book may be very popular to some, I found it to be very confusing to someone who is not acquainted with common sea-terms.  The first 150 pages or so are nothing but descriptions of life as a naval officer, but it finally takes off and gets a little more interesting afterwards and become a decent book by the end. <br /> <br /> However, by no means is it a war book.  A few battles happen (I won't say what so as to not ruin the book) but otherwise it is more about life at sea.  The theme that seems to be apparent throughout is that of characters and their interactions with the crew and sea life.  Each main character is very dynamic, and remains to be throughout the story.  Aubrey is a sensible character, but also uses a lot of authority, and Maturin is a timid, intellectual.  The two seem to counter-balance each other frequently throughout the book. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint with this book however is the amount of typos that are present to even the most casual reader.  They are somewhat frequent and do deter the reader.  Every sentence is well worded however.  Patrick O' Brian's vocabulary is obviously at a high level, and his research and knowledge about life at sea is second to none.  Overall I enjoyed the book; however it could have been a little more interesting in the beginning.  I almost felt like putting the book down before I got through it, and I am glad I did not stop.  I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the English Navy, for it is factual, and historically accurate throughout the entire book.  However I would not recommend it to someone (like me) who has (or had in my case) no previous knowledge of basic Naval terms.
0783225482|4.0|and they are admirably supported by Isabella Rossellini, Bruce Willis, Ian Ogilvy(remember him as The New Saint in the 80s?) and Adam Storke.<br /><br />But the true star of the film is Mr Special Effects although \\"he\\" let it go over the top towards the end. Nevertheless; my friend BarbieDonna laughed his head over this in the theatre in 1992 and it still is a campy piece of fun because of the star power and great production values.
B000001ZS5|4.0|Chants Magnetiques~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a good album but it is not anywhere close to his first two albums. Oxygene and Equinox are much more consistent. Magnetic Fields has some nice tracks but the keyboard sounds are terrible compared to the first two albums. I know that this was one of the first albums to use digital keyboards and for the most part it sounds like using protoype keyboards and that is not a good thing. Jarre is here steering a bit too much in the realm of art for arts sake and it does sound a bit too avantgarde at times, but still nowhere close to the zoolook disaster that he releases some years later. On the whole a pretty decent album that lacks consistency and could have been so much better but it is alright and gets 4 stars.
B000001G7O|5.0|This is a unique performance of Chaikovsky's  violin concerto. Most professional violinists take the opportunity, when performing this concerto, to demonstrate technical prowess. When listening to most recordings of this piece, you will hear the artist offering certainly very fast tempi in the first and third movements, though in almost every case the tempi in the third can be described as extremely fast. This recording is not one of those. Karajan and Mutter present a fresh interpretation of this piece, and one that adds to the richness and variety of the recorded catalogue. In this performance, rather than the elicitation of dazzling technique (though the technique in the recording is as flawless as live recordings can be), HVK and Mutter seem to strive for the extraction of as much music as possible from the concerto.     If, when listening to music, your enjoyment depends in large part on the extent of pyrotechnics demonstrated, then this is not the best recording for you. But if you find beauty, as I do, in dark and rich tone and color, in smooth and flowing phrases-in essence, the transforming of the violin into the fluid and primal beauty of the human voice-then this is without question a recording you should buy. Here, Mutter does not merely play the concerto on her violin, but instead she \\"sings\\" the concerto through her violin.     Although this recording of the Chaikovsky concerto is likely different from any other you will hear, it is in no way inferior. This is a world class performance in every sense. My ultimate recommendation would be that you buy this recording along with one eliciting more pyrotechnics. Finding one of those won't be difficult-almost every famous violinist you've heard of has made one. If you like Mutter, her second recording of this piece could be a good choice.
1563894696|4.0|I'm Giving this book 4 stars out of 5. The story was amazing well told throughout the entire year and a great retcon of Two-face's origins. The only thing i disliked about it was the artwork although there were points to the artwork that fit the story well  I absolutely hated selena kyle visually and Two face looked like he had maggots crawling all over him the art in some places just seemed a bit second rate or rushed. Having said that It's a great read. Overall a recommended buy for any Batman fan.
B0006MT314|5.0|I really enjoyed the variety of bands, including stars of the show, on this CD.  The collaboration is excellent!  Also, when you can relate these songs not only to the show, but to your own lives, it is truly amazing!
0425180638|4.0|Patricia Cornwall seems to be cranking out novels without much thought these days.  I keep reading them, hoping for the best but disappointed each time.  The ridiculous coincidences, implausible plot lines and annoying characters are just plain embarrassing.  What is she thinking?  Nonetheless, though Cornwall isn't at her 5-star best these days, her writing style is still better than most of the bestsellers out there.  I wish Cornwall would go back to the days of crimes committed by unknown perps who have never met much less have an internationally-conspired vendetta against Kay Scarpetta or Benton.  I wish there would be a return to the heart-warming, home-cooked meals with the old interaction between Kay, Lucy and Marino -- this is the element that kept the earlier books so entertaining and made one love the characters.  These days, Lucy highly grates my nerves, and Kay doesn't deserve Marino's friendship.  If you like Patricia Cornwall, you'll love Kathy Reichs.  Her stories are much more realistic, probably because the author is actually a forensic anthropologist.  Her writing style is more clever, too.  Patricia Cornwall's imagery used to be so creative and well-constructed; I loved how she could paint a vivid picture in so few, but perfectly-chosen, words.  Now she seems to ramble on without concern for style whatsoever.  Hypocrit that I am, I read all her books, true;  I keep hoping they'll get better!

B000002U6E|5.0|Althought I never had or heard of any other Enigma records before, one specific song caught my attention a few years ago, this song was \\"Return to Innocent\\".  I did a bit of research to find what other songs Enigma had performed and definetely \\"masterpieces\\" I must say.<br /><br />This is music to be heard,\\"Cross of Changes\\" (which is the only record I own thus far) takes your mind away, makes you picture an image of an unfolding lyrical story in your mind, you listen to one track and you need to listen to the next, I call it a \\"soothing musical story\\".<br /><br />\\"Enigma: Cross of Changes\\", execellent from my perspective!
B000E1155E|5.0|For the record: I hate Franz Ferdinand, the Kaiser Chiefs are flacid, The Killers blow, Oasis is overrated, I simply can't understand the Radiohead phenomenon, and Coldplay should be dragged into the street, shot, dismembered, and their bits driven over with a steamroller.  These guys, however, tear it up. I can't get this CD out of my player, I've been listening to it non-stop for 2 weeks now. The lyrics and cover art remind me of exactly why I hated living in England.  My fave track: From the Ritz to the Rubble.  Buy it.
B000003489|5.0|I have always been \\"somewhat\\" a fan of Trane's but this disc is in my opinion his best work. For his fans, \\"Giant Steps\\" has to be in their collections. He gets busy but not too busy on these cuts. I've occasionally had a problem with Trane's over-improvising and over-playing of his sax. This time around I have no such problem. He is masterful and there's a lot of music here that he masters. His playing is not overstated but just right.

0679422714|5.0|My review does not intend to compete with the next few exhaustive reviews. Instead, I intend to capture the essence of the book, which is a fierce exposee of the petty, tyrannical, arbitrary, callous, ruthless and vindictive nature of Chairman Mao. The book is divided in 58 short chapters, each one describing two or three years in Mao's life (usefully referring to his age as well, e.g., 1925-27 * age 31-33).  The strength of the book lies in the extremely documented sources (Russian and Chinese archives and relevant literature were consulted; scores of people were interviewed, such as diplomats, politicians, military personnel, ordinary people). The Bibliography at the end of the book is an impressive 52 pages long, written in small print.  The authors make a convincing case that:  a) Mao was not the benign, enlightened \\"Great Helmsman\\" portrayed by Edgar Snow, Sartre, and the world wide Leftist elites, but a murderous tyrant.  b) Mao did not improve the lot of Chinese people.  c) Mao was a Chinese Stalin.  d) Under his leadership 70 million people died, thanks to his catastrophic policies (e.g., the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution), purges (the campaigns launched against revisionists, rightists, capitalist roaders), famines and paranoid fear of being deposed.  The authors did a fantastic job in describing the relationships Mao had with his subordinates (Lin Biao, Chou En Lai, Liu Shao Qi) and his wives.   After reading this book do not be surprised if you experience a profound disgust with dictatorial regimes, corrupt human nature and the irrational policies of Communism.   P.S. JUST CURIOUS....What are the reviewers of my review objecting to? No one left a comment, but so far, 76 people did not find my review helpful? What's up with that? Please advise....

B00006DEFA|5.0|There is really absolutely no reason anyone who enjoys the art of film should glance over this masterpiece. None of the reviews on this website, or any other media outlet for that matter, can possibly stress enough how fantastic Amadeus truly is. It is a timeless, one of a kind movie that will pull you threw an incredible range of emotions, and in the end you will feel like you have been hit by a freight train. Strait in the heart.<br /><br />It is a perfect portrayal of the role of music in life; a flawless study of human nature. An absolute must see. Do yourself a favor and buy this now.

B00000272N|4.0|How I do really like Facelift i must say it is the oddball of the Alice In Chains collection. A good debut that paved the way for the success of grunge. When they were young and released thier first album i don't think AIC was sure which musical direction they would go in. This album is more of a hair metal album unlike the rest of catalog. however this situation appered more times in their carrer every album was different than the last. with the hair metal sound of Facelift, the true grungeiness of Dirt, the acoustic melodies of Jar of Flies, and the heaviness of Alice In Chains. This helped AIC never go stale. I don't know which AIC album is my favorite, but It's not Facelift. <br /> <br />1.) We Die Young 7.8/10 pretty good song, good start for the album, really catchy but if you want a better version of the song get the demo from Nothing Safe. <br /> <br />2.) Man In the Box 10/10 undeniably a AIC classic one of my 3 favorite song by AIC, the only thing that could make this song better would be if it were 15 minutes long because it never gets old. without a doubt Jerry Cantrell's finest solo. <br /> <br />3.) Sea of Sorrow 8.2/10 good song, great guitar riff but thats about it. <br /> <br />4.) Bleed the Freak 7.2/10 Great when you first hear it but it gets kinda old fast. this is Layne's song. <br /> <br />5.) I Can't Remember 6/10 all right i guess if i were listening to the cd i probibly wouldn't skip this song. <br /> <br />6.) Love, Hate, Love 8.7/10 here's a little pickup, awesome song when your high. starts off a little boring but the last 2 minutes are what makes it a great song. <br /> <br />7.) It Ain't like That 3.5/10 BORING!!!!!! <br /> <br />8.) Sunshine 2.5/ 10 REALLY BORING, MORE FILLER!!!! <br /> <br />9.) Put You Down 7.4/10 Very catchy good guitar. <br /> <br />10.) Confusion 9.2/10 This is the kinda song that get's stuck in your head and wont go out. The song has a great chorus, and once agian incredable guitar work. <br /> <br />11.) I KnowSomethin' 9.7/10 this song would be the result of if you were to put the 80's superstars in one room and tell them to right a song. It sounds as if AIC was replaced by Axl Rose, Flea, Dave Navvaro, and Micheal Anthony. But I still love it everything is perfect most people would probily give it a 10. <br /> <br />12.) Real Thing 6/10 They probibly could have ended the album with something better but it's not bad. If you want a better version of this song get the remix entitled \\"Heroin\\".  <br /> <br />If you are a true AIC fan get this album after you get Dirt, and Jar of Flies. so you can understand AIC the best by having the summary of all of their different sounds. Even though it was the 7th AIC album I got I do reccomend it.
B00005J6UP|5.0|No problems with the seller.  Sent on time.  Great Job!
B00004XONN|5.0|Where do I begin. Well first I want to say that Kid A is tied for my favorite album ever with Nine Inch Nails \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". This is one of those albums that you cant listen to the songs out of context it just doesn't work. Im not afraid to admit it this is the only album ever that made me cry. It's that deep, (and smoking 3 bowls of weed helps the cause too.) Kid A is god's gift to stoners. I can not get enough of this album. I can't say it's Radiohead's best album because I only have this album and OK Computer, but I like this more than OK. Kid A marked the change of Radiohead's sound form Rock and Roll, to A Pink Floyd direction. I will admit Radiohead is a little overrated by Rolling Stone and Spin but that does not change the fact that they are an amazing band. The kind of artist that comes once a generation. Thom Yorke is an incredably talented singer, he is up there with the greats like Robert Plant, and Layne Staley. As for the rest of the band they don't really make any great accomplishments on this album but thier still good. But I love the saxaphone solo on \\"The National Anthem\\". here is my revieew for each song.    1.) Everything in it's Right Place 8/10 This was my favorite song when I first got the album but as I explored deeper into the album I discovered better tracks but it's the best way to start this album.    2.) Kid A 7.5/10 A little boring but it's neccesary to complete the album.    3.) The National Anthem 9.4/10 Here is were it gets good, wow what a song, this song is mostly about the bass, and saxaphone. wow I have never herd anything else like it under the rock catgory.    4.) How to Dissapear Completley 8.4/10 Here is where it calms down a bit after the storm of the natinol anthem. really soft but neat. Thom Yorke demonstrates just how talented he truly is.    5.) Treefingers 8.7/10 the only insturmental track on the album. it's not dominated by one instrument inperticular it's a fair balance of all of them that's why it's so good.It's somehow pretty depressing.    6.) Optimistic 7.4/10 This is where it picks up the pace agian. Even though I like this song I think it kind of meeses up the pace of the album they probibly should have put in on a different record.    7.) In Limbo 9.5/10 I cant understand one word Yorke says in this song thats the beauty of it. The acoustic is terrific. the only bad thing is the ending where the song toatlly changes. without the ending I would have givin it a 10. You can't classifie this song as either soft or loud it's like right in the middle.    8.) Idioteque 9.1/10 This sounds almost identical to In Limbo just with louder drums and you can understand what Yorke says. this is the last at all loud song.    9.)Morning Bell 9.9/10 This is it folks. this was the part that I busted into tears at. It's that meloncholy. my favorite song off the album. probibly my 2nd favorite Radiohead song. 1st being Subterranean Homesick Alien off of OK Computer. get high and listen to this song it's amazing. words cant describe it just listen. this is reason enough to purchase the album.    10.) Motion Picture Soundtrack 8.9/10 The softest song on the album and a great way to end it. I have no idea what instrument that is in the background but it's still really good.    I strongly recomend this album to anyone with taste, does illegal activitys (if you know what i mean). but i don't recomend it to someone who is sucidal cuz the work of album just might make you kill yourself. You have to have paitence though and be willing to sit down and listen to the entire thing. but don't let that discourage you. Any Radiohead fan will truly apperciate this.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|For the true \\"Sex and the City\\" fan, this collection is worth every penny.  Not only do you get all six seasons in one convenient collection, it comes in a beautiful photo-album-like booklet including pictures of the cast members dividing the seasons.  Each disc menu provides a brief description of the episodes contained in that disc which makes it very convenient to locate that particular episode you want to watch.  I bought this as a gift for a family member, and she hasn't stopped thanking me for it.  I've asked to borrow it, but I haven't gotten a response yet!

This book is boring, full of repetitive examples (some of them very interesting, specially the first chapters), but at the end you get nothing in conclusion.  We all know that people with more experience on their fields can get a very accurate explanation to some phenomena with very little information, is this new?  My gut intuition did not work for this book.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|David Gilmour's new album is a waste of great talent.  From a textural standpoint, this is all retread of Division Bell, which was a retread of Momentary Lapse of Reason.  Don't get me wrong Dave, I thought \\"Reason\\" was a great album, but it's almost twenty years later and time to experiment with some new sounds.   <br /> <br />I would kill to be able to play guitar like Gilmour, but he really needs to stretch out into some new directions.  For a more interesting blend of old and new, try any of the last few Jeff Beck discs.
0739313126|5.0|Great book, nice having it on tape to listen to in the car. Its so good that I am going to listen to it over and over again. Its very interesting. It is a fictional book, which is important to note, especially for the folks out there who are gullible and think that its true. Jesus was NOT married, and the Priori never existed. Great book.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Now that I have seen Disney's three most recent animated productions, my faith in their ability to keep you entertained while they deliver a good message is restored. \\"Chicken Little\\" made me and my 2-year old laugh all through it with its cute and fun characters. In particular I loved the star of the movie, voiced by Zach Braff, of \\"Garden State\\" fame.<br /><br />This production is special for Disney because it is a 3-D animated movie, which is unusual for them. They looked back at the studio's long legacy and borrowed some of the best practices they could add volume to, in order to come up with a great animated feature that beats Dreamworks' recent \\"Madagascar\\" and \\"Shark Tale\\". It makes you imagine what Disney will start producing in coming years, now that they will be combining their history with the talent of animation powerhouse, Pixar.<br /><br />While the story seems familiar at times, borrowing in a not-too-subtle way from movies like \\"War of the Worlds\\" (the aliens) and \\"Finding Nemo\\" (the secondary `ugly duckling' female character, which reminded a lot of Dori), it still feels fresh and keeps you wanting to see it all the way to the end.<br /><br />The DVD package is nicely enhanced with an 18-minute long feature about the movie's making, which always sheds interesting light on aspects you tend to overlook. Other features include games, deleted scenes and previews for other movies. The overall result is a well rounded DVD that you will want to view again and again. Maybe not a classic, but definitely one fun and entertaining family movie that you will be able to get quite a bit of mileage from.
B0007GAERG|3.0|Mariah Carey is no doubt a talent and beautiful singer. However, this album was somewhat boring. I love We belong Together, but I wasn't feeling any of the other songs.  <br />One thing admire about her is songwriting. She's a excellent songwriter. Good to see Mariah back on top, doing her thing though.
B000CPH9I4|5.0|After only being available as an import for several months, The Corrs latest CD \\"Home\\" has finally hit U.S. soil. To be honest, the wait was well worth it (although I bought the UK version when it was released in September of 2005).<br /><br />\\"Home\\" finds the Corr siblings returning to their roots with an excellent collection of traditional Irish songs as well as a few personal favorite pop songs. While there are only two tracks on the album that are in a genuine traditional flavor (Old Hag and Haste to the Wedding), the Corrs trademark Celtic stamp is heard all over this album. Also, for the very first time, the band is heard singing in Gaelic on two tracks.<br /><br />While all four Corrs shine brilliantly here, the spotlight is clearly focused on Andrea Corr whose angelic emotional vocals are at their very best on this album. Her soulful heartfelt rendition of \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\" is a big spine-shivering highlight. Elsewhere violinst Sharon Corr displays dynamic vocal talents with a rare lead vocal on \\"Dimming of the Day\\" (her first lead vocal since \\"No Frontiers\\" on the \\"Unplugged\\" CD).<br /><br />Indeed, all of \\"Home\\" is a geunine treat from Ireland's finest musical family. This is probably The Corrs best album to date and is their strongest and most focused effort. Everything from the music down to the arrangements and vocals are all in place here.<br /><br />This is Irish pop music at its finest, guaranteed.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!
B000E97Y6K|1.0|this movie was so bad. The only part I enjoyed was when they got to the island and it showed the tribe. After that its all downhill. I left the flick before it was done. I should have demanded my money back.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|My family and I live overseas so we did not have a chance to see this in the theater.  Normally, I am very skeptical of movie hype.  I figure, the more hype a film has, the less they deserve it.  However, this film lived up to the media frenzy.  I love the book and it is part of my family's Christmas tradition.  The film had the same rich detail and look of the book's illustrations. Of course, much was added to the film to make it feature-length.  But none of what was added would have been out-of-place in the original story.  The basic premise of \\"faith in what your heart tells you is true\\", shines through in the movie, and makes the most cynical of people believe in the magic of the Christmas season.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|This album has all dance songs. No Ballads. This album reminds me of the 80's. When we were all in track suits and leotards and leg warmers. My favorite track on here is Push. I also  I hate: Hung Up, Isaac, How High, I love New York, Like It Or Not,Future Lovers and all the other songs.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Between this and the \\"How the west was won\\" CD I've been overloading on Zeppelin lately. I haven't listened to this much Zeppelin since high school. The performances are jaw dropping. They just don't make rock and roll bands like this anymore. Each musician is amazingly talented in their own unique way. One thing about rock bands then as opposed to now (aside from the music being better) is that bands back in the late 60s and 70s had members who were equal as individuals. Each his own character that added that something to the mix. And this is why a band like Zeppelin folded when Bonham tragically died. Could you imagine anyone else filling that drum throne? You don't get that now. Now you hardly know the names of all of the members outside of the singer. I don't think anyone would blink if Fallout Boy's drummer was replaced. Watching the change in the band from 1970 to 1979 is cool also. They look a little more tired by '79 but they still kick ass. You see how Bonham had changed his style to conserve some more energy on stage by the later years due to practicality and not being in the shape he was in when he was 21. In any case for any music fan, this is WELL worth the price. Buy it, you won't be let down.

B000001IQH|5.0|Rancid has come out with uncompromising punk music, from harder streetier stuff like on Rancid 2000, to laid back experimental ska on Life Won't Wait. ...And Out Come the Wolves is a classic anthemic mix of those two extremes, with straight-up modern punk to please the Let's Go fans. The brilliance of ...And Out Come the Wolves is that all Rancid fans can enjoy it, whether they're into poppy melodies, harder punk, or ska and reggae.  <br /> <br />Some highlight tracks for me include Roots Radicals, Time Bomb, Ruby Soho, Olympia WA, Lock Step and Gone, and Old Friend.  <br /> <br />Roots Radicals is an anthemic punk song, kind of like Radio on Let's Go. Matt Freeman has an irresistable bass line during the chorus.  <br /> <br />Time Bomb is a catchy skaish reggaeish tune, sounds minor in the verses, and then reverts to a fun chorus.  <br /> <br />Ruby Soho is slower and calmer in the verses and loud and bombastic during the repetitive chorus of just \\"DESTINATION UNKNOWN!!! RUBY RUBY RUBY RUBY SOHO!!!\\" Very catchy <br /> <br />Ok that's all the song descriptions I'm gonna do <br /> <br />If you only buy one Rancid album, let this be it.
0393035158|5.0|You have to read a book like this with an open mind in order to truly hear the viewpoint and then bring your own world view to the table and evaluate it for yourself. I would reccomend this book to everyone.  <br /> <br />I agree with the basic thesis of the book and I think the author makes many compelling and well-stated arguments. I also feel there are moments when I find he falls off the same deep end he accuses others of. For expamle, I really feel that his arguments concerning the Third Reich are a little off the mark. Do not, however, make the mistake of tossing the entire argument because you don't agree with every particular.  <br /> <br />This book, while I am not in complete agreement of all of its statements, does provide a brilliant launching point for some honest and open discussion on faith and religion.  <br />
6304111258|5.0|PUT SIMPLY: \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" really has its act together. Filmed in Color, \\"Robin Hood\\" like \\"Gone With The Wind\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", and \\"Citizen Kane\\", are among the very first truly great modern films. Released in 1938, this was high adventure, and yet was much more than a costume piece with swashbuckling Robin Hood fighting evil, and finding romance. Basically, Robin Hood, a saxon nobleman, lays it all on the line for doing the right thing. To this end, everything about the film, depicts doing the right thing for the right reasons, and in style. What movie theme could possibly beat that!  <br /> <br />ROBIN HOOD IS ALL ABOUT DANGER - FUN & ROMANCE: Robin Hood played by Errol Flynn appears to be a brash rabble-rouser. A rude outlaw without constructive purpose or common decency. In short, lacking any admirable traits beyond his fearless, cocky, boorishness that Maid Marian [Olivia de Havilland] could ever appreciate. Well, that is if such things could be seen as admirable traits.  <br /> <br />Needless to say, Robin Hood wins Maid Marion's heart, and deservedly so, as she comes to know him by his deeds. To this end, the film shows - rather than tells, and in ways that further the plot while maintaining the action, and pace of the film, just like fine literature.  <br /> <br />ROBIN HOOD FIGHTS WORTHY ADVERSARIES AS AN UNDERDOG FOR NOBLE CAUSES!  <br /> <br />Like all great adventures, \\"The adventures of Robin Hood\\", have great personalities playing the roles of heros, side-kicks, but most of all -- VILLIANS! Basil Rathbone, as Sir Guy of Gisbourne, is an able adversary for Robin Hood in all things, and covets the affection of Maid Marion, which Sir Guy's obvious evilness will prevent him from ever attaining.  <br /> <br />The Good King Richard the Lion-Hearted has as his sly nemesis, his own brother, the shrewd and treacherous Prince John. For John, it is England itself, and its plunder that he covets. His brother, the King, is simply in the way, and Richard's absence has made this prospect for John, appear possible. With the ransoming of Richard by Leopold of Austria, the time for the coup was now!  <br /> <br />To this evil end, the two chief villains have henchmen, and sidekicks, the principal being, The Sheriff of Nottingham, played for excellent comic relief by Melville Cooper.  <br /> <br />THE GOOD GUYS ARE THE MERRY-MEN & THE BAD GUYS ARE REAL \\"SOUR-PUSSES\\"!  <br /> <br />Of course, Robin Hood has his merry men. Each of the main three is introduced via a little vignette which illustrates their mettle.  <br /> <br />First - Herbert Mundin, as Much-the-Miller's-son, is the first of Robin's merry men to join up, as he is protected from a death sentence imposed on him by Sir Guy, for poaching, by Robin's physically heroic intervention.  <br /> <br />Second - Alan Hale as Little John, literally runs into Robin when crossing a river on a log. The two do a nice job of joisting, kendo syle, over the river, until Robin falls in after he is bettered. Naturally, the character of Robin is illustrated by his jovial good-sporting nature as he declares, \\"I like a man who can better me\\"! Enter, Little John.  <br /> <br />Third - Eugene Pallette as Friar Tuck. An even more comical confrontation introduces this distinctively stout and coarse voiced character to Robin, and us. Again, Robin ends up in the water, and again, he makes a friend.  <br /> <br />The meetings of Robin with his principal merry-men is from folklore, and well illustrates the basic goodness of Robin, and the company he keeps. This basic \\"merryness\\" is the determining difference between the good-guys and the bad-guys. In this film, the good are merry and bad are real sourpusses!  <br /> <br />----- THE CAST -  <br /> <br />-----*- Errol Flynn - Robin Hood  <br />-----*- Olivia de Havilland - Maid Marian  <br />-----*- Basil Rathbone - Sir Guy of Gisbourne  <br />-----*- Claude Rains - Prince John  <br />-----*- Patric Knowles - Will Scarlett  <br />-----*- Eugene Pallette - Friar Tuck  <br />-----*- Alan Hale - Little John  <br />-----*- Melville Cooper - Sheriff of Nottingham  <br />-----*- Ian Hunter - Richard I the Lionheart  <br />-----*- Una O'Connor - Bess  <br />-----*- Herbert Mundin - Much-the-Miller's-son  <br /> <br />----- ABOUT THE PRODUCTION CREW -  <br /> <br />The production work on this film was absolutely top-notch and reputed to be the rare product of synergy derived from production by committee. The results are a terrific cast and screenplay that the studio converted into a great epic film.  <br />Director William Keighley, who was behind schedule, was replaced during the filming by Michael Curtiz. Curtiz, an astute detail oriented pro, has been credited with the quality of the sets, scenary and costumes.

However, of more relevance is The Adventure of Robin Hood's pure and enduring, entertainment value which rivals any film ever made. Is there a better reason to see a film? <br /> <br />
B00004RFFI|3.0|This is a rather interesting movie about two stormchasers, chasing twisters in America. The plot was weak and the story-line was weak. I didn't really enjoy watching the movie. But if you have some spare time on a really, really boring day, it might not be so bad a watch.
0385507755|4.0|I read this book because of the big stink people made about it.  I found that I liked the book and most people that made a stink about the book missed the important message of the book.  Yes maybe he didn't tell the complete truth about everything in the book, but most of the time I find that when someone is telling their story they remember it one way and that may not always be the way that the events unfolded but it is still their truth. I was moved by this book and think it was well written, I got the message!
B00004U28G|5.0|I watched this because I adore Dean Martin and the Rat Pack, but only after putting off watching it for so long--I was afraid it would be really stupid and not be worthy of being Dean's next to last movie. I had no reason to fear :) . It is absolutely hilarious! The second one is a million times better (more Dean & Sammy and a huge plus with Frank), but this one's great. It's just crazy and silly and a ton of fun.
B000002J1U|4.0|It seems like everywhere I go people are either saying \\"OMG I LOVE IT!1!!\\" or \\"I used it for skeet.\\" Well, not this review. Nope. I am going to give you a general overall description with being as non-biased as possible.  <br /> <br />-History- <br /> <br />After an exhausting U.S. tour, Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page went to a cottage in Wales called Bron-Yr-Aur. It had no electricity or running water, and it was here that the two were able to relax. It was also here that much of the material for their third album was going to be written.  <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin III came out in 1970 and was attacked by many critics, and although this had an impact on sales, it still reached number one. While the band's first two albums were a mix of hard rockin' and swingin' blues, Led Zeppelin III combined the elements of blues, rock, and a new element, folk rock.  <br /> <br />-Tracks- <br /> <br />The first track, \\"Immigrant Song\\", is one of the band's most recognizable songs, if not one of the most recognizable songs in rock history. It's sturdy riff and powerful vocals make it easy to remember and sing along to. It may even make you want to get up and dance. It did for me, but that's not saying much. I dance to everything... somehow, someway. Though many people find Plant's Viking-esque screaming somewhat... \\"gross\\", for lack of better words, the guitar makes up for it.  <br /> <br />The second track, \\"Friends\\", is probably my favorite track on the whole album. The first couple of seconds consists of muffled conversation; what these people are talking about I couldn't tell you. The conversation is then replaced with acoustic folk guitar, starting off the actual song with a nice rhythm that you can clap your hands to. Plant joins in with vocals along with orchestrated strings. This adds a nice, though seemingly unnecessary, touch to the song, and it almost adds a nice Eastern style of music to the song. I guess it fits, in someway, since the lyrics remind me vaguely of searching for inner-peace and good karma. Though the bongo-like percussion is rather muffled by the guitar and strings, it's still a rather catchy piece.  <br /> <br />Track three is \\"Celebration Day\\", another well-recognized song. As the title suggests, it's got a party-hardy feel and fast-paced rhythm. The beginning of the track is tied together with the end of \\"Friends\\", which adds a nice touch. In a way, this song reminds me of another Zeppelin hit, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\".  <br /> <br />Track four is \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", a bluesy-rock song that reaches a nice seven minutes in length. It's very... dramatic, almost, and rather sad. The guitar and vocals fit perfectly, and it's definitely one of those songs you'd wave a lighter to. Another recognizable hit.  <br /> <br />The fifth track, \\"Out on the Tiles\\", is hardly recognizable at all. I had only heard this song once or twice before I bought the album, and that wasn't even on actual radio. However, the beginning guitar chords can be recognized as the introduction used in \\"Black Dog\\" in live albums, such as \\"How the West was Won\\" and \\"BBC Sessions\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Gallows Pole\\" was described by Robert Plant as one of his favorites. It's a folky song about getting ready to be hanged, so it's... morbid? I don't know. It starts off almost mournful sounding, but it picks up the pace with great acoustic work and some nice drumming.  <br /> <br />\\"Tangerine\\", track seven, is another one of those classic love songs. It's very slow, but relaxing. It mostly consists of acoustic guitar, gaining some drum work with the chorus and solo. Plant and his dubbed voice create a nice harmony, and the song was apparently good enough to land itself in a movie.  <br /> <br />Track eight is \\"That's the Way\\", a song that expresses Plant's views of ecology. In other words, it's a hippie/environmentalist song. This song also introduced John Paul Jones' ability to play the mandolin, which adds a nice touch to the acoustic strumming. And, of course, what hippie/environmentalist song isn't complete without the lead singer beating a tambourine at some point? Either way, the song is nice and mellow and lets out a good message.  <br /> <br />Track nine is \\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\\", which was inconveniently mispelled on the album as \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\". As the title says, it's a song to stomp your feet and clap to. It starts off with a nice acoustic solo and later joins with the \\"stomp\\" made by drums and clapping on every other beat. Plant then sings about his dog, Strider, where he is cut off by another nice solo. The \\"stomp\\" and clapping comes back once again, accompanied with spoons as well. This only adds to the catchiness, which is nothing bad.  <br /> <br />Track number ten was described by critics as \\"pointless noise\\". \\"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\\" consists of only acoustic guitar and distorted vocals. Had it some kind of percussion, it would've been one of those amazing blues tracks, but alas, it does not. It's still very interesting to listen to, so it all levels out.  <br /> <br />-Conclusion- <br /> <br />Overall, all who like a wide assortment of music (mostly folk) will probably love Led Zeppelin III. I certainly did. It's definitely one of your more mellow rock albums, and it's certainly understandable why it would've been so attacked. Here was a rock band that had been known for its powerful riffs letting out an album that was mostly acoustic. Of course, if you want something that you can still clap your hands to or help you remember the good old days, by all means, buy this album! <br /> <br /> <br />
0446677450|5.0|My wife bought The Millionaire Maker for me along with Rich Dad Poor Dad.  The latter explains what you should be doing to accumulate wealth, the former explains how to do it.  Together, they provide a philosophy different from the old get an education, get a job, and save/invest which seems to no longer work in today's world.  These two books are well worth the price.
B000E33VWW|5.0|\\"Capote\\" is the best film I've seen for many, many years. It's thought-provoking to the nth degree and fills in and/or illuminates some of the issues and questions raised by \\"In Cold Blood\\" (while raising and/or murkying others).  I like to come out of a film with my mind racing, and this film did just that.  Seymour is mesmerising. I had to keep reminding myself that he was *not* Truman Capote.  He pulls off - with deceptive ease - the incredibly difficult job of giving a fully-realised portrayal of a man who fashioned his own caricature. It's also wonderful to see that an almost shoe-string budget (by Hollywood standards) can produce such a compelling result. And hardly a CGI in sight!  <br /> <br />A great central performance has to have great support. Chris Cooper as Dewey and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee are superb, as is Mark Pelligrino in the small but effective role of Dick Hickock. The only nigglette I have is about Collins Jr as Perry Smith. Smith must have been particularly difficult to cast; his physical appearance alone would have been hard to replicate.  But Collins Jr's Smith comes across as a misunderstood lad with `issues', rather than the deeply damaged, paranoid schizophrenic of the book. However, the 'ordinariness' of his description of the murders, contrasted with the brutal imagery and sound-track, was just right. Anyway, \\"In Cold Blood\\" itself raises all sorts of issues about the characters and motives of the `real' Smith and Hickock. <br /> <br />This is probably not a film that will be at the top of many people's `must see' list, which is tragic.  It demands attention and rewards concentration. I hope, after the Oscar success, more people will give it the attention is deserves.  <br />
0553801503|3.0|I love this series and couldn't wait for it to be released.  Unfortunately, it seems Mr. Martin has taken the Robert Jordan route to writing, meaning lots of name dropping to plump up the page count in lieu of a good plot.  Example: On page 230- Ser Tallad the Tall, Strongboar, Kennos of Kayce, Ser Dermot of Rainwood, Lambert Turnberry, Beardless Jon Bettley, Humfrey Swyft,Alyn Stackspear, Red Ronnet Connington, Ser Loras, Maegor, Lord Merryweather, Master Pycelle...etc.  Do I really need to wade though a list of names every other page to glean a nugget of plot?  If he had writer's block, I would have much rather waited another 4 years until he had gotten back the pacing of the other books of the series, than this tripe.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Solid film, very clever, I was pleasantly surprised.  But by know I'm guessing most everyone has at least heard of this film and its plaudits, so I'll skip to what I did come here to make everyone aware of.   <br />For this particular DVD, be careful with the special little liquid cover thing.  Mine ended up leaking somehow and ended up ruining both disks and covering the entire thing.  Hopefully this is not typical, because I do like the film very much and would like to still own it especially if it can be this version...but just in case everyone ought to be cautious with this particular copy just in case.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|After listening to this album for several months, I have come to the conclusion that, while overall better than Exciter, it still feels comparatively mediocre for a Depeche Mode release. <br /> <br />The primary problem, in my eyes (or ears, rather) is that the production is just not quite up to the job. DM were clearly trying for a very dark, hard-edged \\"industrial\\" sort of sound with most of the album, and often they just don't seem to push hard enough. The bass synths on songs like \\"John the Revelator\\" and \\"Sinner in Me\\" are trying to be agressive, but still sound relatively tame, and don't have the sort of toothy bite heard on songs like \\"Mercy in You\\" and \\"Rush\\" on Songs of Fath and Devotion. The screeching siren on \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" is cliched and feels like a retread of \\"The Dead of Night\\", which was one of the worst songs on Exciter, IMO. <br /> <br />Other times, there are just small oversights and mistakes here and there which prevent the songs from being as powerfull as it could be. Dave's delivery on the words 'console', 'control', 'rules', 'fueled', etc. feels weak, and doesn't have the powerfull baritone quality that his vocals are known for. The same can be said on his delivery of 'in the name of fun' in the song \\"Lillian\\". When working with synth music, the particular sound chosen for a note can be just as important, if not more important than the note or melody it plays, and a few of the sounds here and there on many songs feel poorly chosen. In particular, there is a proliferation of \\"buzzing\\" sounds on songs like \\"Lillian\\" and \\"John the Revelator\\" which are just irritating, don't bring the melody across, and feel like other sounds could have acheived the desired effect better. <br /> <br />Additionally, I'm not sure if Martin's songwriting is quite as good as it used to be. In particular, his ballads (\\"Macro\\", \\"Damaged People\\"), while among the stronger songs on the album, retain some of the over-the-top 'showtune' quality of Exciter's \\"Breathe\\", which keeps them well below the rank of classics like \\"Home\\" or \\"Question of Lust\\". \\"Prescious\\" was nice at first, but feels like a thin and paltry pop single after repeated listens. \\"Prescious\\" was nice at first, but feels like a thin and paltry pop single after repeated listens. It's not a terrible song, but I would not place it among DM's best work by any means. Dave's songs are some of the better ones on the album, and bring a much-needed amount of variety to the mix. <br /> <br />That said, Playing the Angel is not all bad. \\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"Lillian\\" are pretty damn good..not quite on par with \\"Behind the Wheel\\" or \\"Walking in My Shoes\\", but close enough. The beats comes off as a bit generic, but still succeed overall in driving rythim through the song. Dave's and Martin's vocals in these tracks, particularly when harmonized, are powerfull and bring across the heavy sense of angst Depeche Mode is known for. The rest of the songs are not as good, but generally have enough mood to keep you listening through the whole album to get to the better songs. <br /> <br />It's difficult to say deffinitively whether Playing the Angel is truly a better album than Exciter. On one hand, I think Exciter was much more experimental than Angel and suceeded much more in bringing to the listener a sound we had not heard from Depeche Mode before. Particularly for a band which is getting on in it's years, I think it's important to continue to innovate from album to album, and not fall back on retreading old habits. Unfortunately, I think that new sound Exciter brought to the table was just not very enjoyable. \\"Shine\\" and \\"Freelove\\" were great, but the rest of the album was unremarkeable. <br /> <br />Angel is on the whole much more consistent in quality, and much less 'hit or miss' than Exciter. It delivers precisely the fast-paced, empowered hits which were needed as a counter-point to Exciter's mellow ballads. However, nothing on Playing the Angel does anything particularly new with DM's sound... it is largely a rehash of attempted \\"industrial\\" agressiveness which was done by DM with more originality and more subtlety on past albums. I also don't know if \\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"Lillian\\" are quite as good as \\"Shine\\" and \\"Freelove\\", though they are most deffinitely better than \\"Dead of Night\\" or \\"I Feel Loved\\". For these reasons, while Playing the Angel is on the whole much more listenable than Exciter, I am inclined to say that both albums are merely equal, and each only succeeds where the other failed.

The European edition is from the same company--Disconforme--that did such an excellent job of mastering the \\"Complete Duke Ellington at Fargo Concert,\\" and at an affordable price.  Score them another winner with their edition of the Massey Hall concert.  Not only does the Jazz Factory version contain 24 additional minutes of music, but it has more \\"presence\\" in the treble frequencies (especially noticeable with Roach's drum kit) and features Mingus' original bass lines, which to my ears are sufficiently audible without Mingus meddling with them after the fact.  Moreover, the tunes are complete (the OJC version begins \\"Perdido\\" after the bridge).<br /><br />The strengths of the Spanish import may not be so apparent to listeners who prefer a tighter and shorter program and who have become accustomed to bottom-heavy modern recordings.  Also, the reduced crowd noise on the OJC edition may permit more exclusive concentration on the soloists.  But this was an historic musical event, and no doubt many listeners will wish to experience \\"up-close\\" and in full the magical moment that occurred in Canada on the night of May 15, 1953.  If so, the Spanish import is definitely your best ticket to Toronto.
0393327655|1.0|I do not agree with many writings in the bible.  So, after I was told about this book and read the book reviews in a nearby bookstore, I couldn't wait to read it.  Unfortunately, my reading speed slowed down drastically after Page 2.  On Page 2 of this book, Sam wrote \\"A glance at history, or at the pages of any newspaper, ....... generally have their roots in religion.\\"  This sentence pretty much sets the tone of this book.  Unfortunately, it was not a thoughtful conclusion.  Logically analyzing history record, I found that the root of any war is \\"animal nature\\" or to be more precisely \\"male animal nature\\" which is basically the need of food and female.  For human beings the \\"need\\" developed into \\"greed\\" and \\"heroism\\".  All leaders with much of these personalities know that any \\"difference\\" between two groups can lead to conflict and can be used for them to gather people.  In ancient Asia and Europe, it was always the northern people attacking the southern.  The \\"difference\\" between the north and the south is farmland with sunshine.  In modern days, the \\"difference\\" becomes \\"rich and poor\\", \\"moral and immoral\\", and \\"religions\\".  After a politician tells poor people that he supports ware fare or rich people that he will cut taxes, he will pay a price for his promise after he takes power.  But by emphasizing the \\"difference\\" of morality or religion, the politician doesn't need to do anything for the \\"no cost\\" promise. <br /> <br />So, religion is not the root that divides people.  It is just the cheapest tool, among others, for politicians to gather people to satisfy their greed and heroism.  I'm not sure if Sam tried to use readers' difference on religion to sell his book.  But obviously he is successful in doing so by attributing all evils to religion.  I'll keep on reading this book and provide my opinions by comparing the book with my science training (PhD at Stanford) and personal encounters with people who allow them to be possessed by spirits.     <br /> <br />

B00005JOFO|5.0|I went to see \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" on the advice of a friend. I didn't know what to expect. Heath Ledger was a <br />mystery to me. But ever since childhood days cowboys fascinated <br />me and I sort of became addicted to westerns, particularly <br />Randolph Scott. The opening scenes moved slowly and there was <br />Ledger...quiet, mumbling, in a way reminding me of James Dean <br />in \\"Giant\\" with that simple presence. Then came the tent scene. <br />Wow!...was I  seeing things? Had the wrong movie get turned on <br />by mistake? No...this was really happening on the screen. Here <br />were these two rugged macho guys...cowboys up there doing what <br />makes men tremble at the thought of doing: making love. I managed <br />to stay in my seat...then came the ride on the stallion, the <br />foreboding sky, the journey to tend sheep but really only God <br />knew where to. My eyes misted thinking what the cowboy must have felt seeing that butchered sheep. I suddenly thought of lots of <br />things, like what the rest of the movie was like, thought of my <br />friend and why he kept the sex scene a secret, but mostly I <br />thought of an old admonition I'd heard about how a man isn't supposed to have a romantic interest in another man. Yeah... <br />I'd hoped the movie would show the two cowboys turning into <br />standard creeps for whom I could have no sympathy for. But I was <br />not so lucky, for by the time the movie was over my cup ran over <br />with empathy for these two. Something touched me and my eyes misted over by film's ending and Ennis sad. <br />     I left the theatre in no mood to shop. I decided to drop <br />in on my friend. He was busy developing film, but listened anyway <br />as I asked him why he didn't warn me about you know what. \\"Cause <br />if I did you wouldn't have gone, am I right?\\" Yeah...I had to <br />admit he was right. I am just the type who avoids the strange. <br />Then he said \\"Now tell me what you liked?\\" Then I unloaded and <br />told him the directing reminding me of George Stevens. The <br />music breath-taking...the scenery gorgeous. Then, saving my best <br />for last, told him of Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack with doe-like eyes <br />that worked so well for him, making his character easy to read. <br />That look of devotion he gives to Ledger...so convinced me he'd <br />wait around forever! Then there's the amazing Heath, a virtual <br />treasure trove of talent. The look, the gesture, that walk of <br />his, even his grunting...they'd be crazy if they didn't give <br />him the Oscar. He has all these and he breaks your heart with <br />them. His scenes at the end were brilliant. He could open up a <br />school for acting any day. In his quiet moments he does more with <br />less than anyone acting today. My friend smiled and then casually <br />asked me if \\"Brokeback Mt.\\" changed me in any way. I didn't know <br />what to say. Suddenly something hit me, something that had been <br />looking at me that I'd not wanted to recognize since I left the <br />theatre, thinking it would go away. <br />     \\"Well?\\" my friend asked. I said it may sound funny...but <br />I was sure Randolph Scott was looking at me. My friend let out an <br />enormous laugh. Yeah...like he's waiting for something from me. <br />Like what my attitude was towards Ennis and Jack. Would I approve <br />of them riding along the chisolm trail with him? It's dumb, I know, but since they've been through so much misery that maybe... <br />maybe we'd show our hearts are in the right place and allow them <br />to come? I even remembered my childhood toy gun and holster and <br />cowboy hat...one that had puff balls like fringe around the crown. My mom bought me that hat. Yeah, maybe this movie held <br />objectionable things in it when examined using the head. Yet <br />some things and some movies should be looked at with the heart <br />more than with the head. This movie is one like that. <br />
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This is one hell of concert. Not only Buble's singing is so damn fantabulous that it can melt hearts (and pants too) but also Buble is such a rare entertainar nowadays. I've never seen a fun concert like this in my whole life. If you can't afford $60 for a live concert(that is if you're lucky, cause his concert tickets are selling out like crazy), this DVD is the next best thing you can get and I assure you it totally worth every penny.    And another thing I must add, Buble's touring band which played at this concert is amazing!!! All of them are hot, hot, hot, not just in performances, but also in looks.

When a band loses two of its members, it loses two fifths, 20%, it's a big knock to confidence. We had fans who were Andy and Roger fans who just......well they left us. You know, when Roger and Andy left, they left, too - or they'd just write letters, `Get Roger and Andy back!'\\"<br /><br />Nick Rhodes: \\"They basically didn't want to be involved for their own reasons; it was to do with the pressure of the situation.\\"<br /><br />Simon LeBon:  \\"You can't make someone do what they don't want to do.

B000DZIGDU|2.0|Jake Gyllenhall did a great job as his performance of a Marine sharp shooter.  However, the best part of this movie was the first five minutes where there was a \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" type boot camp scene.  Jamie Fox was pretty good, but a little underused as the Staff Sergeant later on in the movie.  This movie is about the progression of a man through Marine boot camp to sharp shooter school to the Gulf War and then nothing.  The first third of the movie was the progression, then the last 2/3rds was the Gulf War.  I felt this movie was more of a political statement based on the memoir of Anthony Swofford (book by the same name \\"Jar Head.\\"  I felt as this was a story of a disgruntled employees rather than a people who understood what their presence there was actually for.  I did not read the book and will do so, so  I can get a better feeling of the memoir that this movie is based on.  However, the movie was about Marines going to a war that was not there.  As a result, they get bored, mess around in the sand, wonder why they are there (the oil theme again) and wait for their first kill.  However, I wonder if it came to it, if they got the opportunity that they could do it, get their first kill during war.  Though, the acting was good, the script was crap.  This movie is the equivalent of the landing at Normandy, but the rather than landing at Normandy, the folks landed at the Bahamas-But at least there would be plenty to drink if they landed at the Bahamas.  I don't doubt that the lack of action in this movie memoir took place, and they should feel lucky that they didn't have to go into harms way, however, I believe the lack of action was an isolated incident and during the first Gulf War was fought after all through technology (missiles, airplanes, etc.).  So all that did stay out of harms way while liberating a country from the grasp of human rights criminal Sadam, should feel lucky.  Then of course, the return from the war to lost girl friends and return to their boring \\"regular\\" lives and a feeling of  let down..  The movie was a liberal political statement as the left leading Hollywood continues to move that way.  However, it is odd that the director, Sam Mendes also directed Oscar winner \\"American Beauty\\" which was about an adult man's fascination with a high school teenager.  So, Hollywood thinks it is OK for sex with a minor (or close to it), but not to protect an invaded ally of this country.  How things change and too bad that Mr. Mendes did not have the magic that he did with \\"American Beauty\\" and Tom Hank's \\"Road to Perdition.\\"  It is an OK rental, but don't waste your money on buying it.boring \\"regular\\" lives and a feeling of  let down..

B00068ULLY|5.0|Once upon a time in El Paso, Texas a wedding party is slaughtered execution style. However, it turns out that the Bride (Uma Thurman), who is pregnant, is not dead but in a coma. Four years later she wakes up, no longer pregnant, in time to save herself from insult being added to her injury.  Then the Bride puts together her list of people to kill: (1) Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), (2) O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), (3) Budd (Michael Madsen), (4) Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and (5) Bill (David Carradine).  In \\"Kill Bill, Volume 1,\\" the Bride only gets to the first two names on her list, albeit not in that order the way the film is cut, and then proceeds to the rest in Volume 2.  This does not constitute a spoiler because you cannot have a film called \\"Kill Bill\\" that does at least get to the title character, regardless of the results.  But then this was a do-it-yourself \\"Box Set\\" (I bought the two DVDs and they gave me a box to put together).<br /><br />There is more happening in the each film besides the kill list, such as an anime telling us how O-Ren Ishii became the Queen of the Tokyo underworld and the training sequence in which the Bride studies with the great Pai Mei.  But in the first film the primary emphasis is on how the Bride takes out her first two victims and the triumph of style as substance, especially when style means fountains of blood gushing from human beings that would make Akira Kurosawa proud.  With \\"Pulp Fiction\\" Tarantino made his impression upon our ears with scene after scene of great dialogue. No wonder the soundtrack for that film had clips of some of what came rolling off the tongues of the actors (usually Samuel L. Jackson, who only plays a corpse in these films). But with \\"Kill Bill, Volume 1\\" Tarantino's blood feast is mostly for the eyes. This film is not for everybody, but then what Quentin Tarantino film ever was?<br /><br />The biggest complain about Volume 1 is that it has the two most memorable sequences in the entire epic, namely watching O-Ren Ishii and her posse walk glide into the House of Blue Leaves with the blasting soundtrack giving them energy and the final showdown in an exquisite garden at night with gently falling snow where O-Ren in her white kimono and the Bride in her yellow biker suit do their dance of death with Japanese steel.  Nothing in Volume 2 tops either of those scenes, which is not necessarily a bad thing, just a cinematic reality.<br /><br />The caveat when Mirimax decided to split this four-hour revenge film into two volumes was that those who sensed a lack of character development and motivation in Volume 1 would be appeased by what was put forth in Volume 2, and this is indeed the case. We finally get to go back and see a couple of pivotal scenes set before the \\"beginning\\" of the film's opening, such as the massacre at the Two Pines wedding chapel. The net result is that character is more important than killing in the last half of the film, which makes sense because it would really be virtually impossible for the Bride to slice and dice more opponents than she did at the House of Blue Leaves.<br /><br />I watched Volume 1 on DVD again before I went to see Volume 2 in the theater, which I thought would put me perfectly in the narrative flow.  However, Quentin Tarantino has set up his audience just to play with their minds, which, of course, is what he was doing from the start and at the climax of this film I was not at all sure who, if anyone, was going to come out alive.  Certainly what happens with numbers 3 and 4 are not what you expected after seeing the fate of numbers 1 and 2, but that certainly puts what happens with the final name on the list up for grabs.<br /><br />There are a lot of oppositions between the two halves of this film. The beautiful setting of the duel between the Bride and O-ren in the gentle falling snow is countered by the showdown with Budd (Michael Madsen) in the harsh sunlight of his trailer in the desert. Having devoted an entire chapterto Hattori Hanzo creating his most perfect sword for the Bride, it is amazing how hard it is to get the sword out of its scabbard in this one. Volume 1 was a feast for the eyes, but in Volume 2 Tarantino's dialogue becomes more prominent, although not quite up to the level of \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" But the dialogue is important because before we get around to the titular business of this film, the Bride and Bill have got to have themselves a conversation. Sound also matters more in this film: there is one sequence that is effectively done in the dark.<br /><br />I am barely acquainted with the genre of Hong Kong films that Tarantino was apparently weaned on, so everything is fairly new to me and consequently smacks more of homage than parody, which is no doubt the director's intent. I probably will not go out and check out some of the films that inspired Tarantino to do \\"Kill Bill\\" which have been pointed out to me, because they will undoubtedly pale in comparison to the slicked up version that he is serving for our American palates. All things considered, I have a definite preference for Volume 1, which seems to run counter to the prevailing sentiments, but it took me a while to be comfortable with how the two parts fit together.  The key thing is that they do, without Volume 2 being simply more of the same, because it is definitely not. There is something to be said for Tarantino pulling out all the stops just to have fun.entire chapter to Hattori Hanzo creating his most perfect sword for the Bride, it is amazing how hard it is to get the sword out of its scabbard in this one.

B000003CMD|4.0|1973's BROTHERS AND SISTERS was the first full-length studio album from the Allman Brothers Band in nearly three years, during which time the band had lost both guitarist Duane Allman and bassist Berry Oakley, who were replaced as it were by pianist Chuck Leavell and Lamar Williams. Surviving Duane's death had been nothing short of miraculous; surviving Berry's, without a major shift in the group's sound and sensibilities, proved impossible.   <br />   For this reason, as well as the remaining bandmembers' ongoing slide into the personal and chemical excesses which have always made the big time what it is, BROTHERS AND SISTERS presents a largely revamped ABB, with songwriting replacing jamming as the chief priority and a crisper, more commercial attitude than that of any previous Allmans release coloring the results. Guitarist Dickey Betts, having already proven himself capable of singlehandedly tackling the string-strangling front line he'd once so famously shared with Duane, here also takes the lion's share of composing credits; it is clearly his vision which predominates on this, the ABB's last genuinely great LP. <br />   The first two tracks on BROTHERS AND SISTERS were the last to feature Berry Oakley, and the tragedy of his sudden exit is underscored by the fact that one of them, Dickey's country-rock anthem \\"Ramblin' Man,\\" would become the band's only major hit single. It's a phenomenal piece of work, to be sure, with stinging guitar work from Dickey and guest strummer Les Dudek and a made-for-radio chorus which suggests that the Brothers could still go anywhere and do anything if it involved making music. Gregg Allman's opener, \\"Wasted Words,\\" is a bit too similar in both title and mood to EAT A PEACH's \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More,\\" but that hardly makes it bad. <br />   As for the post-Berry cuts, Gregg scores winners with both the soulful, lovesick \\"Come and Go Blues\\" and the updated Ray Charlesish \\"Jelly Jelly,\\" while Dickey contributes \\"Southbound\\" -a tune so much in Gregg's vein that he gives Gregg the vocal - and a bright instrumental (\\"Jessica\\") which, inevitably, would be greatly expanded upon in concert over the years. \\"Pony Boy,\\" the closer, a down-home acoustic number on which Gregg doesn't even play, is one of the album's strongest numbers, mixing clever and humorous lyrics with a flawless instrumental track which must have left listeners at the time wondering whether the next release from this group would be credited to the Allman/Betts Band. <br />   It wasn't, of course, though perhaps it should have been. In any case, more than three decades later BROTHERS AND SISTERS stands as the right bookend on the ABB's top shelf of recordings, posthumous live releases by the original sextet excepted of course. A fully worthy addition to the catalogue, nevertheless; Duane and Berry would have been proud.

0812550706|5.0|Out of all of the books that I've read, Ender's Game is by far the hardest novel to put down. From beginning to end, it has a captivating, and very real (though most would consider it a sci-fi) nature to it. Even as there are many characters who seem to be almost completely opposite, you often find yourself able to almost completely relate to them. Personally, this is the only piece of literature that I've been able to see myself in the main character's position, and really feel the experience first-hand so distinctively, that, contrary to any other story, not once did I hesitate about a decision made, thought expressed, or word spoken, and say to myself that I would have acted differently, or thought otherwise. <br /> <br />The basic plot of this story is that the human race is in danger, entering the third war against an alien race. Assumingly due to population reasons, every family is limited to two children, by law. The Wiggin's family however, is an exception. The government monitored their children to see if they could fulfill the role of a perfect fleet commander, as Mazer Rackham from the previous war had. The first two children were almost perfect, but the first, Peter, was too selfish and powerful, and the second, Violet, was too compassionate, so they persuaded the family to have a \\"Third\\", Ender, who was just what they were looking for. They send him off to Battle school, where he proved to be a military genius. The problem was that when it came to reality, he didn't like the thought of killing or harming others, although he was often forced into the situation; and to say the least, he was good at it. His teachers and mentors were aware of this, so throughout the story, even though they care for Ender, in order to rescue the human race, they feel obligated to manipulate and shape him in a way that would preserve his creativity, and motivation to continue on the path that he has already began to take. <br /> <br />One of the main themes that Orson Scott Card depicted in this book, was the idea of a game. As humanity struggles in it's war against the alien \\"buggers\\", everything, in a sense, is viewed as nothing more than a game. When Ender is sent off to Battle School, the majority of the combat training is taught through games. The reason that Ender is considered so special and important is that he has the rare ability to analyze his enemy and create strategy that ensures his victory consistantly. However, as he is able to understand his enemy he gains compassion for them, and in reality his victory is his last resort. When the time comes where his skills are needed, the officials convince him that it is just a game, as if it were his final test in Battle school. <br /> <br />Another important theme to consider is that of compassion vs. ruthlessness. As these are the two extremes that prevented Peter and Violet from being chosen for Battle School, you can see the traits conflict with each other from within Ender, as he is necessarily balanced between them. This is not just limited to Ender though. As the officials in the government and at Battle School see it necessary to be ruthless with Ender, they are compassionate with him and loathe the fact that they are obligated to do so, in the same way that Ender feels about defeating his enemies. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a rare book that underneath the story, asseses human nature in the deepest way. One that brings out real feelings that makes the rest of the story a giant metaphor for any situation that would reach us in the same way. This is most efficiently expressed in Card's message that, in a way, reality is a game that we all play, and the reality this novel contains, is Ender's Game.

B000E1YVZU|4.0|Wonderful and Beautifully inspiring musical movie. I saw the movie opening weekend that it came out. I have yet to see the stage version, but I definitely will next time it comes to Pittsburgh. I loved musicals, and the movie is fantastic. My favorite character is Angel. I bought the dvd because I enjoyed the movie at the theater so much. Unforunately some scenes were cut from the version I saw at the movie theatre versus the version on my DVD, and some of them are not even in the deleted scenes. One is, but the ending of it is different. That was disappointing, I liked those missing scenes. They made the movie even more powerful. I don't know how they can cut scenes from a movie in between the theatre showing and the reproduction of the DVD. That is so wrong. Fortunately I have those scenes in my head because of how powerful they were and I also have the soundtrack from the movie, so when those songs come up, I picture those missing scenes. \\"Goodbye Love\\"
0679422714|3.0|Chang's version of Mao held the reader's attention but proved to lack objectivity that made one question the research put into the book. At times repetitive as if the author's didn't quite believe anyone really read the previous chapters. It is still unclear how Mao was never successfully overthrown with all the enemies he made through persecution, denunciations and torture.  How and why did the Russians tolerate him? The book left many items unanswered. It was well established that Mao was a demonizing, tyrannical despot but what would have been more interesting is an anaylsis into what was the driving force behind it all.   It is amazing that after what the Chinese population has been through and the void of education and culture during the Mao years they have progressed and have emerged as such a \\"Superpower\\".  Mao's quest has been fulfilled.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|There are too many people refering of this new installment of Batman as the fifth movie. Wrong! This is the first one of a new serie! The four movies from the last decade never happened!! The director took them all and flushed down the toilet! As a matter of fact, it's a good thing pretending that these movies never happened because all of them are very untrue to the comics, so forget about them!  <br /> <br />Batman Begins is the first movie that adapted Batman's comics the right way. There is no such things as a Joker killing Bruce's parents, bat-nipples, bat-card or an excentric Two-faces. EVERY BATMAN LIVE ACTION MOVIE FROM THE 90'S ARE WRONG! They never happened and they never will!  <br /> <br />Batman Begins is the only one Batman movie now. Even the things that Nolan and Goyer created for the movie can be incorporated to the comics mithology, like Ras being Bruce's master, for example, or the assassing, Joe Kill (his name in the comics) being dead by that woman, witch explains why the assassing was never found again. The new Batman is not only true to reality, but also true to the essence of the character.  <br /> <br />Even better: this movie can also work as a prelude to Mask of the Phantasm (the 90's masterpiece animated movie). It fits great! No reason for the live action craps of the 90's to be remembered, so forget all about them and stick to this movie.

0316172324|5.0|It puzzles me how some could not find any practical use for this information.  It was pretty clear that snap thinking works, as long as you have fed your sub-conscious more complete data, and if you don't allow yourself to panic.  I think it helps clarify what I have seen in successful decision-makers, both in business and the military.  It is therefore no surprise that floor traders and professional soldiers can have a surprising amount of common ground.   <br /> <br />The book is well worth reading.

0684853523|5.0|I've always wanted to pursue writing as a career, or even as a part-time gig.  But one thing or another has always held me back.  I picked up this book because of my writing goals and I'm also a big fan of Stephen King's work. I couldn't put it down.  Reading about the development of his career and the practical and useful advice he gives for getting started really inspired me.  I've purchased some of the reference material he suggests and I've actually been writing ever since I finished the book. I'm still a long way from submitting anything to be published, but I am writing.  And this book did that for me. It was really an inspiration to finally do it.
B000E1155E|2.0|First of all, this is not a bad record. It's catchy--that's about it. Is it horrible? No. Is it good? Kind of. But this is the main problem to me: every song nearly sounds the same, the lyrics are nothing special, and the music is nothing that I haven't heard before from any other British band. In the first listen you are hooked, but after the third or forth time you begin to realize that the main singer can barely sing, just shout, and that for the most part there aren't any surprises or new tricks done here. I still don't have any idea why this band is soo hyped up to the point where people are calling them the best British band of all time, etc. To me it seems as if people are giving them such lofty praise simply because they're a band from Britain. Nothing wrong with that, but that doesn't necessarily make them the greatest. I mean c'mon folks, at best Arctic Monkeys are a fun band who will probably blow you away in concerts, but seriously, it's nothing THAT special.
0684867621|5.0|I started reading this book on a Saturday morning and didn't put it down again until the end.  The main character (and really the only character of note)is a 9 year old girl who gets lost in the woods. She managed to inspire me with her toughness and strength as she faced one challenge after another. Her will to live almost jumped through the pages. You will find yourself liking this girl more with each page and rooting for her along every step of the way.  This is really a great read.
B000E1155E|4.0|This is a great cd, there's no doubt about it. Is it really better than OK Computer by Radiohead? I doubt it. Although the cd really is very nicely done, there is one blatantly obvious problem: all the songs begin to blend into one another. These songs end up sounding so similar after a while, it's ridiculous. This is mostly due to the limited vocal range of Alex Turner, the lead singer. However, many of the songs on here are superb. There are many stand-outs on this album, and it is excrutiatingly obvious why this band is so popular after just one listen. While this is definitely not a bad album, it does have it's flaws. Arctic Monkeys show a lot of potential here, and in one or two albums, it all might break free. Be on the look-out.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears' fourth CD is a transitional album, released in 2001 under simply the name Britney.  Her less popular of her releases (it included only one hugely successful and universally known single, \\"I'm a Slave 4 U,\\" but significant follow-ups with \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\"--\\"Boys\\" and \\"Overprotected,\\" with the latter being the better of the two, did not chart as well in the US but did well internationally), the record showcases her vocal abilities (the sentimental but decent ballad--in Spears terms--\\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\"); Britney also happens to be one of her most consistent releases to-date.  The aforementioned \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" is by far the standout track because it's different than anything she put out by that time, but \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" is also brilliant; \\"Overprotected\\" is fantastic pop music, and although still teen pop, it (like the album as a whole) is more mature transitional teen pop.  Other noteworthy tracks are \\"Lonely,\\" \\"Let Me Be\\" and the dance-infused \\"Anticipating.\\"  Though her less likable of her four studio releases to-date, Britney Spears rocks on Britney.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|It is not usual that I would recommend, nor indeed watch a film which is firmly camped in the teen anxst genre, but this film is so much more than it's narrow descriptive box.<br /><br /> It explores the divisions and commonalities of the stereotype personalities in a teen setting, but it does so with tenderness, reality, a resonant sense of the pain and anguish of transitional lives and mostly with a startling freshness. The freshness remains 21 years on and there is also now the added commentry on 80's life.<br /><br /> A time when fear of the world's demise began to ring home and as such affected a disillusionment in western youth at perhaps a greater a degree than ever before seen.<br /><br /> This is strikingly in evidence here and it is aided and embelished by a range of powerful, candid and comedic performances.<br /><br />Truly the pinnacle by which all other teen anxst films and shows should be judged.
B0000033RY|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see these guys open up for 10 Years After at the Capitol Theater in Porchester, NY back in the early 70's (1971 to be exact).

0307276902|1.0|I'm reading this book for my book group right now--I didn't vote for it.  Right from page one it is such obvious fiction.  And not even good fiction.  No one would be allowed to board a plane covered in every bodily fluid and a literal hole in their cheek.  I'm pretty clear on what happened here.  The book was shopped around as fiction (to 17 publishers), but no one was interested because it just isn't that compelling to read about a character someone made up who has survived such horrendous obstacles.  Now---make that person real and whoa!---you've got a story.  I believe Frey was an addict and that he did go thru rehab---that part is proven.  However, I also believe that he had a perfectly mundane addiction/rehab experience that he embellished from stealing parts of other people's lives.  I'm just sickened that he lied about his involvement in the true story of a classmate's accidental death for his own gain.  That poor family.  I hope they sue him.
0321344758|5.0|This is an excellent book on web site usability.  It's a very easy read with great supporting images.  It's actually pretty entertaining in the way it's written & holds your attention.  It's not your usual boring industry-read.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I was listening to the radio one day on my way to work when a radio ad came on concerning the Kochella Festival (Forgive me if I spelled it wrong.) with Tool as its headliners, which immediately caught my attention. As they scrolled through the band list, which includes Depeche Mode, Franz Ferdinand, and other powers in the world of rock, the last name mentioned scored its own background music, and guess who it was? Madonna, with 'Hung Up' playing for a few seconds before heading back to Tool's 'Sober' Anyway, back to the review. <br /> <br />Listening to the album a number of times has brought me a verdict: As a theme, 'Confessions on a Dance Floor' delivers from beginning to end. If this CD were played in a club from start to finish, you wouldn't get much of a break since every song is made first and foremost to be danceable (And they are). In that sense, this album has accomplished its goals. Thus the 4 stars. <br /> <br />However, it has its flaws. Lyrically, this album doesn't have the staying power to keep up with the driving beats of the music. Particularly in my thoughts is the track 'I Love New York' with the verse that ends with 'Isn't that where they golf?' Just because people golf in Texas doesn't mean it's the only place people do it, and just because people will dance to your work doesn't mean you can write subpar lyrics. For someone in the industry as long as Madonna has been, this song was a razor sharp disappointment.  <br /> <br />For the most part though, this album works. It has a certain kind of energy to it.  The dancefloor energy will keep the clubgoers happy, and the pacing of the songs themselves give them an ambient quality to them...you know, the songs that sound best while driving at night when you're most at ease. While all the songs are admittedly similar, I get the hint that it was sort of the point. A standout track on this album, 'Isaac', is by far the most beautiful and artfully done song, with sampling from a chant, and well-done lyrics to boot. On a final note, the way this futurepop disco album ends in minimal acoustic guitar on 'was, in my opinion, a superb way to close the album. <br /> <br />It could be much better, but if you think this is terrible, I suggest listening to a Britney Spears or Hilary Duff album, and see just how much worse it could be.
B0006L0LOS|2.0|I often cite films by Ed Wood and Uwe Boll as perfect educational films. Why? Well they're perfect examples of how not to make a film. So when films come out every year that are really terrible, you just gotta ask \\"is this worse than Plan 9 or Alone in the Dark? Well with Catwoman we find a film that's better than those but that's not saying much. <br /> <br />Patience Phillips(why they changed it from Selina Kyle is beyond me) works as an advertisement artist for a beauty creme company. In order to make a deadline, she searches an old factory and finds out something bad about the upcoming Beau-Line(prounounced Beeyoo-Lin for some reason) and gets washed up in the river. Brought back to life by a mystical cat, which for some reason worked better under Tim Burton, she comes back as Catwoman ready to do battle against justice, and flirt with a cop. <br /> <br />I haven't heard of a Rogues Gallery villain in Superman or Batman that got their own movie. You don't see Brainiac trying to save the world somewhere, or Two-Face fighting crime. So when Batman comics jewel thief becomes a crime fighter, it's kind of \\"huh?\\". And like I said, the decision to name her Patience Phillips instead of time tested Selina Kyle is forever lost to me. Imagine Superman being called Trevor Smith. Not to mention the costume looks quite ridiculous since not only does Halle Berry have an obvious skin tone but it just smacks of laziness. <br /> <br />An unfortunate by-product of upstart directors is they're a little clueless on how to edit action scenes, believing the more faster the cuts, the more energetic it is. Compare this to Spielberg, Cameron or Zemeckis films that allow the action to unfold at its own pace. Here it's literally blink and you'll miss it shots. I know kids today have ADD when watching a movie but this is pushing it. <br /> <br />It's right up there with Punisher and Fantastic Four as bad comic book movies but it's kind of borderline dumb entertainment and nothing more...unless you get a kick in seeing Halle Berry in her costume.

B0009F2EPU|5.0|As much as this production detracts from the teutonic tradition that Wagner designed the Ring for, this centenniary production of the Ring with Patrice Chereau as the director, Pierre Boulez as conductor, and Brian Large as the very talented producer, is possibly the best in the market.  No, it doesn't have a cast that has the dimension and experience of the Solti or Karajan rings, but without a doubt, it is the most visually engaging and dramatically correct rendition of Wagner's tetralogy.  Others would say that the Levine Ring provides the most traditional and faithful production with respect to Wagner's score, and I have no doubts that the sets used in the Met are very beautiful.  This set, however, changes the concept from a legendary setting of mountains and god-palaces to a more French social hierarchy environment.  The interpretation makes sense, but it isn't only this which makes this Ring come to life.  It is the involvement of a very talented conductor and a cast of marvelous singers which make this Ring a most memorable moment. <br /> <br />Donald McIntyre may not have Hans Hotter's great voice or James Morris' great bel canto interpretation of Wotan's role, but it certainly exudes a nobility and a richness absent from other recordings.  Gwyneth Jones is a marvelous Brunnhilde.  For her alone would I see this Ring day after day.  It is note perfect, powerful, and very dramatic.  I'd say that she has the best Brunnhilde overall of the ones I've heard. <br /> <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I do not have much to say than this is a great finish to a story. Most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy.

And the stuff they put in their was clever enough. <br /> <br />Characters - 9/10, Well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into 90 mins. <br /> <br />Sound - 10/10, since I am a metal fan I love the fight music..and piano just reach right in there. <br /> <br />Tilt/Replay - 10/10, Enjoyable everytime. <br /> <br />Overall - 10/10

B000002OVJ|4.0|For the 1995 reissue of this legendary live album, MCA went back to the vault to restore additional material from the original concert. The result, surprisingly, is less powerful than the edited concert that appeared on LP and initial CD issues. The original running order of \\"Young Man Blues\\" \\"Substitute\\" \\"Summertime Blues\\" \\"Shakin' All Over\\" \\"My Generation\\" and \\"The Magic Bus\\" was a stunning display of the Who at the peak of their rock 'n' roll power; interspersing this material with the rest of the concert tracks provides a more accurate view of the Who's stage show but greatly reduces the carnality of the home listening experience.<br /><br />Among the new additions, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is an Entwistle B-side that's among his best tracks, but still doesn't live up to the Townshend (and cover) gems that make up the rest of the show. \\"I Can't Explain\\" is a Who concert staple (and usually in the opening slot), and Benny Spellman's \\"Fortune Teller\\" provides a nice transition from medium-tempo R&B to more sprightly rock 'n' roll before segueing smoothly into \\"Tattoo.\\" This is all well and good, but following Townshend's spoken introduction to \\"Young Man's Blues,\\" the set kicks into another gear - the gear with which the original LP started. The expanded edition then takes a breather for another lengthy spoken introduction that isn't nearly as effective as the original disc's direct edit into \\"Substitute.\\"<br /><br />The inclusion of \\"Happy Jack\\" \\"I'm a Boy,\\" eight minutes and forty-one seconds of \\"A Quick One, While He's Away,\\" and nearly eight minutes of Tommy's \\"Amazing Journey / Sparks\\" similarly saps the power from the original disc's jump-cut to \\"Summertime Blues.\\" It's more Who, but the sustained pace of the original simply induces more adrenaline. The one un-edit that works is the applause between \\"My Generation\\" and \\"Magic Bus\\" that frames the Who being called back for an encore.<br /><br />In remastering for CD the producers also took the opportunity to remove the crackles that plagued the original LP and CD. Those who grew up on the original may find the sonic cleansing disturbing, but it doesn't seem to impact the music itself. The original CD's budget-styled four-panel insert is replaced here with a full booklet that includes pictures, liner notes and song-by-song discussion. The inner fold-out pages reproduce the original album's inserts (contracts, handwritten financials, etc.) in miniature. There's a certain excitement in knowing this disc documents the concert as-it-was, and having more Who live tracks is generally a good thing, but for raw visceral impact, it's hard to top the original vinyl's tune stack. 4-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

B000E0OBK6|4.0|I went into this expecting something else and now I'm glad I didn't get what I expected. From the previews, you would think this to be a gulf war version of such films as Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now, with young men scarred by horrible visions of combat and violence. In the end, they are changed but as the protagonist says, \\"I didn't get to fire a single shot.\\" <br /> <br />Jarhead is the story of Anthony Swofford, a disenfranchised youth who enlists in the Marines because he doesn't have anything better to do and because he wants to measure up to his old man who served in Viet Nam. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford with all of the ennui that the role requires. The movie takes him through basic training, into area specific training (he's a scout sniper) and into action in the first gulf war. I actually enjoyed more the acting of Peter Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx. Sarsgaard does a better job than Gyllenhaal of conveying the sense of loss and disillusionment that followed the first gulf war. From the previews, I expected Foxx's character to be a stereotypical gung ho marine sergeant but by the end of the film you realize how much he cares about the men under him. Most of us probably don't realize how many good men like him we have in our military. <br /> <br />If you see a parallel to Full Metal Jacket, that appears to be intentional. The filmmakers want us to understand that it is films like that which make men want to go off to war in the first place. I found it difficult to feel sorry for the marines for not getting the chance to shoot and get shot at. I think veterans from some of our more costly wars would have traded places with them in a second. I was, however, surprised to find that the men in this unit seemed just as scarred by their experiences as veterans of other wars. It makes me suspect that much of the damage is done in the process of turning them into people who are capable of making war. <br />
B00005M91K|5.0|I bought this DVD on impulse last week because Amazon paired it with Waking Life, and as I waited for it to arrive, I went hot and cold constantly, at one point thinking \\"wow, this must be so powerful and amazing, considering that there's no narration and no traditional plot,\\" to \\"oof, well, can I sit through ninety-some minutes of this with nothing to tie the images together?\\"  Let me just say that when all was said and done, my initial excitement was  more than justified. <br /> <br />The language of this film, where in most others we would look to dialogue, is found in the music (which is incredible in its own right-- note to self, see if the soundtrack is available).  Through the segues, peaks, and valleys of the sound, Fricke actually manages to cogently connect such starkly different images as traffic in Tokyo with human breathing, the intensely different architechtures of distant cultures, menial factory labor and upper-class executive professions, prayer and chant-- all the while jumping from one end of the Earth to the other, creating a spectacle of similarity that will leave you shaking your head in amazement. <br /> <br />Surprisingly enough, as is mentioned in certain other comments, there is a poignant emotional charge to the piece as well-- I won't go into details of course, but I have to say I was just as moved by scenes of this film, completely devoid of words and (what I am now forced to view to be) more superficial human drama, as I was by any big-name actor-driven drama like Schindler's List, Green Mile, or anything like that.  Some parts are drop-dead hilarious, others are terrifying.  Never a dull moment throughout. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, to speak of the film more technically, it's still a masterpiece.  This is the first piece I've ever seen that was shot in 70mm film, and I was blown away.  I'll tell you, it doesn't even matter whether or not you've got an HDTV with 7.1 surround sound-- I watched Baraka on a 20\\" JVC TV/VCR combo, with its standard stereo speakers-- the depth of field is almost dizzying.  Even simple dolly shots (some scenes toward the end focus most on architechture) are strikingly rendered, and the color quality is absolutely insane.  Every frame could conceivably be printed and exhibited as a professional photograph, but of course then you'd lose the soundtrack!  I can barely begin to imagine what it must look like on an HD display. <br /> <br />Overall, there is not a single thing I can criticize about this movie-- it's quite possibly one of the best I've ever seen, and one I plan to strap all my friends down to watch at some point soon.  Definitely worth the investment to be able to watch it over and over-- my skepticism was totally dashed. <br /> <br />My particular copy was damaged slightly-- I wasn't able to see chapters 5 or 6 when I watched it, but Amazon's been really great about getting a new copy to me as fast as possible, so I'm all-around pleased!  Definitely a great buy-- grab up Baraka straightaway if you're a fan of documentary, experimental film, cultural studies, poetry, photography, anything!

And though I hadn't held out hope that Cosmopolis would propel author Don DeLillo to the ranks of Joyce, Salinger, and Hemingway, I did imagine (in vain) that his development of character would at least keep me entertained for the book's 200-plus pages.<br /><br />This is the first book from Mr. DeLillo I've read, and I can only hope that the dialogue is better in his better-known efforts, like Underworld and Libra. Here, it's just forced, mechanical sounding, and so strangely similar that it's often difficult to tell who is saying what by what they believe and say. To wit:<br /><br />\\"There's a common surface, and affinity between market movements and the natural world.\\"<br /><br />\\"An aesthetics of interaction,\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, but in this case I'm beginning to doubt I'll ever find it.\\"\\"<br /><br />\\"Doubt? What is doubt? You don't believe in doubt. You've told me this.\\"<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />Yawn. Wake me when they're finished.<br /><br />The book's main virtues come from Mr. DeLillo's insightful descriptions of every-day scenes and his dark humor. But even in those areas, the narrative seems to work too hard for a limited effect. There is no shortage of better books to spend your time and money on.
B00004R9A4|5.0|Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks is probably one of the greatest films to ever come out of the studio.  It is often compared  to Mary Poppins and criticized for their similiarities, but I however feel that Bedknobs and Broomsticks is an improvement over Mary Poppins, even when Mary Poppins had little to improve.  The main reason for Bedknobs and Broomsticks' criticism is due to having been made in the period after Walt Disney's death, in which all of their films were criticized, even when they were superior to many Walt Disney era films such as the weak 101 Dalmatians (1961), The Sword in the Stone (1963) or The Jungle Book (1967).  Bedknobs and Broomsticks is yet another Disney '70s jewel in the lights of The Rescuers (1977) or Pete's Dragon (1977).    World War II is haunting England and children are being evacuated from the city of London into the safer countryside.  All children have found a nice home with a stranger family, except for the last three, Carey, Charles and Paul Rawlings who are then sent with Miss Eglantine Price into her large home.  The children aren't happy about being with Miss Price at first, they wish to go back to London, even though they have practically nowhere to go there.  This all changes when they discover Miss Price's secret, she is in fact a witch, an apprentice witch studying through correspondence and taught by Professor Emilius Browne, who is in fact nothing but a fake who takes his spells out of an old book.  However, Mr. Browne is a nice person and he is amazed to find that his senseless words work for Miss Price and they soon start working together.  With the aid of Mr. Browne's Traveling Spell, Miss Prince, Mr. Browne and the three children are able to travel around England by means of a bed and its magic bedknob to search for only one thing, the missing spell of Substitutiary Locomotion, a spell fit for bringing the help needed to end the terrible war.    As corny and out of place as the plot may seem, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a rather deep and serious film.  Comparing it to Mary Poppins is silly, for Mary Poppins was a light-hearted comedy with no real plot, where Bedknobs and Broomsticks features a fantastic plot and clever dialogue.  Another similarity may include two new live-action/animation scenes, \\"The Beautiful Briny\\", an underwater animated musical festival and a wild soccer match with King Leonidas. The acting is fabulous, Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson play Miss Eglantine Price and Emilius Browne.  Special effects in this film are top-notch and help to fully capture some scenes, the flying bed parts are some of my favorites.  The music and songs are gorgeous!  The Sherman brothers once again made a memorable and excellent soundtrack, songs include \\"The Old Home Guard\\", the Academy Award Nominated \\"The Age of Not Believing\\", \\"Portobello Road\\", \\"The Beautiful Briny\\", \\"Substitutiary Locomotion\\" and the newly added \\"With a Flair\\" and \\"Nobody's Problem's for Me\\".  Indeed, a lot of new scenes and previously cut segments were re-added to the movie, and the entire film has been remastered for better picture and audio performance.     Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a wonderful film and I'll recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Mary Poppins or Pete's Dragon or to anyone who wants a new and magical way to travel back in history to the era of War World II.  This one is a classic!! 10/10.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I just bought and listened to this CD. I love it. Was very satisfied with the \\"relaxed feel\\" that this album has. Gilmour has always been my favorite guitarist and he doesn't let me down here. I also am a huge Pink Floyd fan. This disc did remind me of mellow moments from pre-DSOTM Floyd which I always enjoyed, and kind of missed with later albums. Mr. Gilmour is superb!

B00000K3D4|5.0|I love this movie...I used to watch it all the time as a kid on the VHS version.  I was so happy that Amazon.com had the DVD version! :-)
B00015YVD6|5.0|This was one of my favorites when I was a kid. I decided to buy it for a girls night out. It went over very well.  I even watched it with my husband, who found it very entertaining. Extra features on the DVD are interesting, but don't add a whole lot to the film itself.
B000B0WODA|2.0|Does anyone else like to hope that a band is good because they have a really creative name? Or is that just me? <br />   It seems that Franz Ferdinand (FF) spent all their originality on their name, referring to the (beware...this is a mini history lesson!) Archduke of Austria whose assassination sparked World War I.  <br />   The problem with dear old FF is they don't seem to have an original bone in their body or song on their CD. In fact, some of it seems to be a blatant rip-off of something, like their single, \\"Do You Want To,\\" which is \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand,\\" by The Beatles with different lyrics.  <br />   I actually rolled my eyes at several lyrics like in the power-pop \\"Well That Was Easy,\\" verse, \\"Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, `cause I'm leaving you.\\"  <br />   Oh, cheer up, FF. You gained enough success off your last, self-titled album to maybe skate by on this clichd, overdramatic, really-not-all-that-special CD. <br />   Maybe. <br />   Nowadays, everyone seems to have an MP3 player, eliminating the dilemma of liking a song, but not the whole album. Now get to the nearest computer and enjoy the beauty of technology! Since FF is so much better mellow, get \\"Fade Away.\\"   <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Gene Roddenberry (my apols to Trekkers if misspelled) back in the dark ages originally pitched to television a concept he called \\"a wagon train in space.\\"  Of course, \\"Star Trek\\" moved forward from that vision, but it did put forth a great future dream of many peoples living in harmony.    While \\"Firefly\\" doesn't reside in that perfect world, I think that Gene would have recognized it.  In the power and strength of its family of odd characters, and its wonderful reality, Gene would have recognized a kindred spirit.      I am deeply sorry that this wonderful, intelligent, and engaging series died after so few episodes.  ALready the buzz is beginning; and already a small group of hardcore fans is hoping for a future and not willing to let this go.  So maybe this show has another resemblence to Trek as well.    Hey Joss--You shouldn't let this die.  Hey Fox--Didn't \\"Family Guy\\" teach you ANYTHING?!
B00000J7J4|5.0|I know this is an old album. But who doesn't like it? It's awesome. My favorite song is \\"SMOOTH\\" with Rob Thomas. I HATE \\"MARIA MARIA\\"!

B000BEZQ18|5.0|Of all the nominated films, this soundtrack richly deserved to win the Oscar. It complements the film and sets the gut-wrenching mood for many of the films scenes. Sparsely orchestrated, it is not one of those bombastic soundtracks that have become so popular of late. <br />The soundtrack also contains some of the songs used in the film, like the Golden Globe winning song by Santoalalla and Elton John's old lyricist Bernie Taupin and performed by Emmy Lou Harris, plus two great songs by Rufus Wainwright.
0805076476|5.0|Amazing book. Regretfully, I saw the movie prior to the book but still a great read. The book had many parts that were not in the film.
0895260131|5.0|The books is frightful.  You know why most gays and lesbians support Muslims.  We have this stupid logic that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Basically, Muslims don't like Christians and we gays support muslims who dislike gays. <br /> <br />We are stupid.  Gays will be destroyed by the Muslims.  That is a fact.  The Taliban celebrated when gays were killed when a wall was pushed down on them.   <br /> <br />If America was smart they would pass an ammendment allowing the Federal Government to deport the followers of Islam and their teachers.  If we don't do this then in 20 years this nation will be under a Muslim dictatorship.
6305313687|4.0|I love the film. It addresses many of today's race problems and tells that if we don't get along, it will only get worse. Edward Norton's acting ability in this film is the main reason why he is one of my favorite actors today.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|The Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (as daft a name for a band as you can think of) have scored a terrific five stars with this feast of an album. It runs the gamut of styles from a tub-thumping harmonica and guitar driven \\"Ain't No Easy Way\\" through to the velvet tones of \\"Fault Line\\" - which, though reminiscent of Dylan, sound so much better than the Master's strangulated vowels. A top, great value buy.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Again the stone faced Christian Bale performs with amazing acting. This film is filled with plenty scenes with lead-filled action and brilliantly choreographed fighting. Definitely a must-see for the action and adventure movie watchers.
B0009H1CK6|3.0|This is a great party DVD - the music keeps you on your feet the whole time and the band's infectious energy is great ! Definitely one to get !
B00030590I|5.0|The way the story is told in Hero is quiet amazing and fresh compared how most films unravel in a linear fashion.  The story is told in the past with multiple versions and the emperor who is listening to Nameless' story has to figure out which tale is real or a lie.  Each version of the story puts a great angle to the plot and at first I wasn't sure what was going on until I stuck with it.  The natural scenery is flat out stunning and it is nice to see a movie that isn't stuffed with fake looking computer graphics.  My favorite scene is where Nameless and Broken Sword fight on a lake and the imagery is just amazing.  There is much to be said for the content that is non-verbal in this film so it is better you watch it for yourself and make your own conclusions or judgments.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|If Peter Jackson dies as of this writing he can die a happy man for <br />not only bringing to life perhaps the greatest trilogy ever made of <br />the Lord of the Rings (sorry Star Wars fans) But for recreating the <br />granddaddy of all adventure films Despite what those will say of it <br />being too long,this that and the other, No one will deny this film <br />is was a labor of love not only for the director, but for all those <br />involved. There are so many great images & attentions to detail the <br />average viewer would have to watch a few times to catch even a hand <br />full of them.  True Kong devotees like myself won't be disappointed with the special 2-disc edition which also contains <br />King Kong post production log among other features. The movie <br />itself is beautiful 2.35 transfer which brings out all the great <br />sights from the lush jungle of Kong's island to the harsh stone island of depression era New York. 16x9 for those interested but <br />whether your watching on a 60inch big screen or your portable  7' <br />inch. This is one film every King Kong fan should have.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|This is a so-so group of renditions - it kind of puts you to sleep at times - but not too bad.
B000000OMP|5.0|This, in my opinion, was Whitesnake at their peak before getting less consistent with their next 2 releases 1987 & Slip of the tongue. It was where they combined their bluesy rock with commercialism to just the right balance. The previous release, Saints and sinners has also got that winning formula. Thats why they picked 2 songs off that album to make 1987 as popular as it was. Those songs of course being Here I go again and crying in the rain. Whitesnake were never as consistent as they were on this and Saints and sinners. It definitely would have been interesting to see what the follow up to this record would have been like had Coverdale's main collaborator, Mel Galley, not been forced out of the band due to an unfortunate accident (involving his successor John Sykes). Oh well. After that the guitars and overall production was given too much American hard rock treatment and its probably because of that that the majority of people remember the band for the 1987 album and being referred to as a \\"poodle rock, hair rock etc\\" band which isn't really accurate considering what the majority of their work consists of.
B00005K3O4|4.0|If anyone tells you that this movie is a scary, or even a grammy winning event, then you've definitely been \\"clowned\\" (Sorry for the corny joke...just couldn't help myself on that one). In fact, I'll never forget the weird look my friends gave me when I brought this film over for all of us to watch. But once it got started, none of them could stop laughing.    The movie starts off with your typical, big-haired, tight jean wearing 80s couple lying in their town's local \\"lover's peak,\\" when a shooting star whizzes past them and lands somewhere nearby. Naturally, the couple just has to go and investigate. What they find is a massive cirus tent swarming with creepy, psychotic alien clowns. After making a narrow escape from almost being shot down by killer popcorn, the couple runs to report the incident to the police, only to find that the clowns have inundated the town and are killing everyone by turning them into giant balls of cotton candy!    I swear the makers of the film have manipulated every clown-related trick known to man. For example, one of the clowns uses a hand-shadow to swallow up a \\"handful\\" of unsuspecting people, caustic, lethal pies get thrown, and the clowns even use animal-shaped balloons to murder their victims. Of course, there's the one token black guy in the movie who, surprisingly isn't the first to be killed.     On the other hand, this movie is filled with all sorts of bad, yet darkly hilarious scenes. One of my favorites is when a tiny killer clown comes out of a girl's toilet (if you look closely you can see the hand/arm of the pupeteer holding the clown's head as it rises from the toilet bowl). Of course, the actors and their lines are also less than stellar, which in many ways only helps to make the film even funnier. So if you enjoy fatuous, B-rated horror films, then you should definitely check this out.
0060926317|5.0|What amazes me is the people who rate this book with a one star.  If you focus on the negative, you get more of the negative.  If you focus on what you want you get more of \\"wanting\\".  However if you ASK (Ask and thou shall receive) with conviction, faith and certainty you get results.  <br /> <br />Wonder what is wrong with the world?  Look within yourself.  Are you all about the \\"negative\\"? Putting people down, causing conflict and then you wonder why your life is not working well?   <br /> <br />Hmm... I guess the Bible is a fiction story too.  Not that I am comparing the Bible with this book.   Jesus fed hundreds of people on one loaf of bread.  He walked on water.  Perhaps it was all just an illusion.  <br /> <br />Keep in mind that - Truth is stranger than fiction! <br />
B000DZIGDU|5.0|A truly excellent movie. The portrayal of the Gulf War is done in a realistic and blunt way, which is not to say that its bad. Its actually exactly the kind of account I was looking for. People who are used to movies about World War I and II will take some time to adjust to this since the events that unfolded in the Gulf War are drastically different.  <br /> <br />I read the book for this movie a couple of months ago, and after seeing the movie, I must say I am impressed. Anthony Swofford's brilliant writing style has been exhibited well by the producers of this project. You can see the anxiety felt by marines who are trained to kill but never get the chance to. You notice the subtle hints at the domination of oil companies in our industrial war machine. This is in no way a conspiracy theory, it is sheer reality. Without giving away spoilers, I can say that you should watch closely when the marines land in Saudi Arabia aboard the commercial airliners- take a look at the words on the tent they sit under the first time.  <br /> <br />The interactions between the characters also occur at many levels, really setting the mood for the \\"brothers\\" type of relationship that Anthony Swofford and the other scout snipers had. Please take note that this is all based on a true story, so you will see the realities faced by troops, including 110 degree scorching weather in the desert, training drills in which marines don gas masks in preparation for a chemical attack, and the lonely moments away from loved ones during the holidays.  <br /> <br />All in all, an excellent movie. Having watched this with a former marine, and having him confirm most of the things content-wise, I feel confident in recommending this as an honest account of events. Of course, the Marine Corps has changed quite a bit since Gulf War times, so don't use this as any type of indicator. However, watch it to see exactly what Swofford and the other marine scout snipers went through in their part in the Gulf War.

B000099T2L|4.0|So I'm not a total fan, but Beyonce knows how to make what she has work.  While not the most talented of Destiny's Child (Kelly has the better voice) and definatly not the most unique (Michelle has the unique voice, like a melodic Macy Gray) she is the most 'over-hyped' and the most promoted thanks to her father being producer for so long.  She's been front and center since the beginning so it only makes sense that if anyone from Destiny's Child would reach solo success it would be Beyonce...not to mention her BF Jay-Z being, what, king of the Hip-Hop world...so her album is not bad by any means...it's as good if not better than any Destiny's CHild album, thats for sure...and Beyonce is talented, but more importantly she knows how to pick the right songs and then how to market herself right...I mean, just watch the video for 'BABY BOY'...'NAUGHTY GIRL' and 'CRAZY IN LOVE' are great singles...'HIP HOP STAR' with Big Boi is great, and thats the great thing here is that she picks the right guest stars that, while blazing out the track, don't take her limelight.  My favorite track is her version of the Desity's Child is 'DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE' which is pretty much the same song just sung only by her (didn't she sing it already?) but it's beautifully sung.  With some slowed down tracks to offset her club hit's 'Dangerously in Love' turns out to be a well rounded album.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|I grew up in the Saturday morning Western era, so I thoroughly enjoy finding many of the serials in DVD's.  I will admit that some of the old Westerns that I really liked as a kid are pretty bad.  But the Maverick series was every bit was good as I remember.  Sunday night it was the Warner Bros hour--Maverick, Cheyenne, Sugarfoot, Bronco--with Maverick my favorite followed by Cheyenne.  The plots are pretty good and the acting--James Garner, Jack Kelly and many of the guest stars are pretty darn good--and are far superior to most of the old Westerns.   <br /> <br />I watched all 3 episodes as I traveled from Boston to San Francisco and when I find a little time, will search your website for additional episodes.
1881273156|5.0|This is a super-useful and accessible tool in helping couples speak the \\"language\\" of love that their spouse or significant other will understand.  Just as you can't communicate effectively, if at all, with someone who doesn't speak your verbal/written language, the author contends that it is difficult/impossible to understand the wishes, desires and needs of your mate if you can't speak his/her language.  Intuitively, this makes sense and the author clearly reveals the 5 love languages; how to recognize the 'lovespeak' of your mate and most importantly how to speak his/her love language.  A real door-opener for much better understanding and real things that you can DO to improve what for most people is a critically important relationship.  The author truly cares about and believes in the importance of his subject and it shows!  <br /> <br />I loved the book and have put several of the suggestions into place with great results!  <br />
B000E1YVZU|1.0|This movie has everything that I thought I would like! I am very diverse, I am Latino and I am gay (but straight looking and non stereotypical). So going into this movie, I was expecting something really good!! NO. It was just ridiculous. It tries too hard to be good and entertaining that it actually turns you off! This movie is more like some diverse party overnight with them filming themselves singing and talking about their problems. I can't believe people actually like this! Inclusion of diverse characters doesn't mean that it is automatically a hit. There has to be a character development that you can feel...it was just not in this movie!
0385513755|5.0|I've been planning to read The DaVinci Code for some time. Off work with some surgery, my wife picked-up the book at the library and after a couple chapters I ordered it from Amazon (who, by the way was significantly cheaper the B&N.) I wanted the illustrated edition, but I couldn't put the book down and practically read the whole book before my edition arrived. This is a great, page turning book that I feel is filled with more truths than a lot of people would care to admit. Regardless of that, it's just a \\"great read\\". Spend a few extra bucks and get the illustrated edition; it really adds to the enjoyment and overall understanding of the story line. Can't wait for the movie!

Sgt Pepper by the Beatles , Disraeli Gears by Cream , Are You Experienced by Jimi Hendrix , Days of Future passed by the Moody Blues , Spirit of 67 by Paul Revere & The Raiders , even the Monkees album Pisces ,Aquarius,Capricorn & Jones LTD was a pretty decent album so many more groups came out with a great album that year including a New Band with their self titled album simply called the Doors would be considered a Classic just by the first song on the album  Break on Through , <br />followed by Light My Fire which became  a big single for them all songs written by the Doors except Back Door Man & Whisky Bar but still some great covers and the last song on the album The End says it all !!!
0064471837|5.0|This book is just wonderful; Fantasy hidden in the depths of an amazing author, and yet it is also hidden to so many people. Please, if you have not yet picked up Sabriel, you have no idea what you are missing. The book follows the journey of Sabriel, the daughter of a necromancer, as she travels through a mysterious land she has only heard about in order to find her father who has gone missing. It is a beautiful book; the writing is almost like that of J.R.R. Tolkien, though with a distinct flair. Only Garth Nix could pull off such brilliant fantasy. I congratulate him, and look forward to his next book.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|Given the title, one would have to be an idiot to think this movie was a typical horror movie.  Having said that, sit back and enjoy a good giggle.  The obvious humor entangled with this appocolyptic story is fun and engaging.  However, it is the subtle moments that make it worth watching.  Even the zombies themselves have compelling moments.  Personally, I think the scene of Shaun walking to the corner store after \\"it\\" has all started is a great commentary of just how self absorbed we all are.  Don't miss it.

B0006Z2LH4|2.0|Cube Zero (Ernie Barbarash, 2004)<br /><br />NOTE: this review contains a really, really major spoiler. If you're planning on watching the movie, be warned.<br /><br />Cube Zero is a movie so unspeakably horrible, so ineffably awful, so utterly insincere to the mythology around which it is based that it breaks through the ceiling of the thoroughly awful and may even come to inhabit that special place that one holds dear in one's heart for films so bad you can't help but feel affection for them-- Night of the Lepus, for example, or Gymkata.<br /><br />While it's impossible to believe that a movie this inept could have possibly come from anyone even remotely involved with the Cube franchise, it's true: writer/director Ernie Barbarash wrote and produced Cube 2: Hypercube. This is his first (and, if there is any justice in the world, it will be his last) directorial effort, and he comes off as the Jamaican Bobsled Team of directors; he may perform something else behind the scenes of a movie reasonably well, but the man should never be allowed near a directors' chair again. Ever. To expand on his own talent, Barbarash recruited a production team so skilled that he might have had to dole out minimum wage (for the rest of us, not Hollywood) to the whole lot of them. But maybe they all took one paycheck and just split it. For with the exception of makeup wiz Scott Hamilton (I, Robot), unless Barbarash's utter lack of talent simply eclipsed anything else, no one on this crew is worth a thing. \\"Shoddy\\" doesn't even begin to describe it. The set design was conceived by a rabid wombat (who, I might add, had obviously never seen either of the first two films), the dialogue was written by a drunk sloth, and the costumes were rented from the local dry cleaner, who I'm sure promised they could have them for free as long as they were back by nine the next morning.<br /><br />The worst travesty, however, is in the casting. (I warned you about a spoiler. I will do so again. If you haven't seen the movie, and you plan to, skip the rest of this paragraph.) The box lets you know it's a prequel. What they don't tell you is that in order to preserve the suspense-- or, more likely, simply because some asinine copywriter forgot to do any fact-checking-- they changed some names around. Why I prefer the second interpretation in the last sentence to the first: when they recreate a key scene from the first movie, the actors portraying the characters in the first movie not only don't look like their first-movie counterparts, they couldn't possibly be more different. While that may have been intentional, it comes off ludicrous at best. The production team were either insulting our intelligence as viewers, or trumpeting their own stupidity ot the high heavens. More probably, they were doing both.<br /><br />So given all that, what could I have possibly liked about the movie?, you may be asking. And you'd be right. First, the dialogue and situations are so insipid they often inspire unintentional hilarity. The \\"exit procedures\\" scene is one of the funniest I've seen in a movie in quite a while. It's always fun playing \\"spot the inconsistency\\" in a film based around a popular mythology. And as woefully miscast as they are, Queer as Folk's Stephanie Moore and Dog Park's Zachary Bennett have a kind of earnestness about them in the lead roles here that hearken back to Ray Milland and Sam Elliott squaring off in Frogs.<br /><br />Cube Zero is a stupid, stupid film, but if such a thing is possible, it's stupid in a good way. While the original Cube quite rightly became a bona fide underground smash hit, this one has a chance to become this generation's Reefer Madness or Red Asphalt. Yes, folks, it's that bad. * ½f you haven't seen the movie, and you plan to, skip the rest of this paragraph.) The box lets you know it's a prequel.

First, the dialogue and situations are so insipid they often inspire unintentional hilarity. The \\"exit procedures\\" scene is one of the funniest I've seen in a movie in quite a while. It's always fun playing \\"spot the inconsistency\\" in a film based around a popular mythology. And as woefully miscast as they are, Queer as Folk's Stephanie Moore and Dog Park's Zachary Bennett have a kind of earnestness about them in the lead roles here that hearken back to Ray Milland and Sam Elliott squaring off in Frogs.  <br /> <br />Cube Zero is a stupid, stupid film, but if such a thing is possible, it's stupid in a good way. While the original Cube quite rightly became a bona fide underground smash hit, this one has a chance to become this generation's Reefer Madness or Red Asphalt. Yes, folks, it's that bad. * 
1400032717|3.0|This book begins as an unconventional story about an autistic teenager determined to solve a murder mystery in spite of his social disability. It's charming. Christopher has a unique and believable voice and a refreshingly simple take on the world. I wish it stayed that way. But it doesn't. Halfway through, the mystery goes `poof' and the book becomes about divorce, deceit, troubled relationships and all the standard moaning of modern dysfunctional fiction. A disappointing detour from a promising whodunit and detective.

B000005ZGZ|2.0|2 1/2 stars    While not an inspired work, their are many great ideas on this album, especially given the narrow genre that fugazi helped innovate..Alot of the compositions seem to be trying a little too hard in the wrong directions..There is a huge attempt to bridge out as far as possible on every track in an individualistic sense, but the notes just arent really there..It is in its most simple moments ironically, that fugazi affects their listeners most earnestly one last time.....
B00005JOFO|5.0|I was extraordinarily disappointed at the failure of nerve displayed by AMPAS at the Oscar's Ceremony to give so many Oscars to such less deserving \\"winners.\\"  Brokeback Mountain deals with so many of life's profound mysteries on so many different levels it is hard to summarize it in a short review.  Heath Ledger, whose creativity in bringing Ennis del Mar to life monumentally surpasses the achievement of any other actor in 2005, was upstaged by an actor who was recognized merely for his ability to impersonate.  At least BAFTA recognized Jake Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance as Jack Twist.  \\"Best Picture\\" Crash deals with issues of racism.  Would racism be an issue if everyone were treated equally regardless of race? Gender?  No one chooses to be born different from everybody else.  No one chooses to be born disadvantaged, handicapped, or gay.  Regardless of what we are born with, we make of life what we can and we play the cards we are dealt. The tragedy of life is that some of us play our cards better than others and clearly some of us are dealt better hands than others.  Thats what makes Brokeback Mountain timeless - Ennis and Jack had no choice in who they were, who they loved or when and how they discovered they were different and this movie reflects that poignantly, beautifully, tenderly and with a quiet honest respect for its subject.  Here in 2005 we think we have more choices, but clearly the reaction to this movie indicates many people are still as crippled emotionally today as people were in 1963.  Growth comes slowly and emotional growth is fraught with pain.  All of us can look back at choices made and regretted.  Annie Proulx said she wrote her short story about homophobia.  She did, but like all great art it was predicated on an underlying truth: love is a force of nature.  Ang Lee, Diana Ossana, Larry McMurtry and everyone who worked on this movie transformed a New Yorker short story into one of the centuries' epic morality tales.  It is not a morality tale for red or blue states, heterosexuals or homosexuals; it is not a morality tale of what is right or wrong - its moral is love or die, and the corollary to that moral is God gives you no choice in whom you love because we are commanded to love everyone as yourself.  If we all did that this movie would never have been made.  It is worth seeing over and over and over again.  This movie will be on the 100 best list for centuries.
B000002U82|4.0|4 1/2 stars    Landmark release from a still somewhat humble band redefined the album listening experience when it was released..To this day, you will find that most people starting up on their \\"alternative perceptions\\" of reality will be using this album as a tool to refine their approach to music appreciation..Meaning as long as there is someone trying a joint for the first time, there will be dark side of the moon rampant in our culture...From the opening breeze of reinvented keyboards, to the mechanical grandeur of their futuristic soundscapes, right down into their triumphent climax, this is as solid as solid gets for an album as a whole, with the only discrepencies possibly being either the over usage of the Breath/Time themes being to similar, or in contrast the inclusion of money, a song that breaks up the album brilliantly, but does not fit in with the rest..I must go on record and confess that, while numb to a majority of the album by now due to the typical over exposure associated with such a notorious work, The Great gig in the Sky still seems to exemplify utter heart wrenching beauty at its finest, in no small part due to the amazing vocal work..
0553278223|4.0|Bradbury is a master of social commentary.  His books consistently hold up the mirror, challenging us to face the best and worst in human nature, and \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is no different.<br /><br />The story is set in the early twenty-first century, making its exploration of Mars dated.  Although reading more like a cohesive series of short stories, \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" provides an interesting view of mankind's urge to find something better out there, a paradise, an escape.  At times frightening, at times beautiful and haunting, the stories touch on very human elements.<br /><br />At its core, this collection seems intent to explore the motives and ethics of space exploration.  This theme rings true and has parallels to America's global tactics.  Bradbury's tight prose and weighty themes prove once again why he is a master of his genre.

0553573403|5.0|I don't usually read fantasy, but this book came recommended to me and I couldn't be happier. It's rich, intriguing and I consumed it. It is one of those books you find yourself staying up far too late to finish \\"one more chapter\\".  The multitudes of storylines are woven beautifully.  I'm halfway through the second book, \\" A Clash of Kings \\" and grateful for not having to wait for the next installments !
0307276902|5.0|I understand that some people looking for guidance in James Frey's former situation may feel let down by his exaggeration of the events of his life.  I do feel, however, that he did an amazing job of sharing his life's experiences with substance abuse. <br /> <br />As with this book, and all things in life, why do we always feel the need to condemn?  James's book is fabulous.  It is filled with poignant moments that have nothing to do with jail time, being a tough guy, or root canals without anesthesia. <br /> <br />There have been moments that I was so captivated by his style of writing and the events he was describing, that I felt I was there.  James Frey is an amazing author.  If James had his book reclassified as fiction to \\"validate\\" it for those living in their polished glass houses, I can't help but believe it would only appeal to a larger audience and become even more popular. <br /> <br />My thanks to James for writing with such poignancy and style, and for developing vignettes that hold the reader captive.  As an avid reader, I feel I am qualified to state that this is truly one of the best books I have ever read.  I read it as if it were fiction, but the pain of addiction shines through as truth.  Whether the addiction be drugs, alcohol, food, people, or behaviors - James has left us no doubt as to the immeasureable degree of the pain one experiences trying to find their way to wholeness. <br /> <br />How about we celebrate James's accomplishments instead of his embellishments?
B000BKJ78K|1.0|It's nice to see the original artwork took from the 'original' star wars saga. One thing I dont understand though, why didn't George Lucas edit their faces with the latest art graphics technology? He could have morphed Obi Wan to look more like Ewan McGreggor. He could have made Princess Leia look more like her mother, Natalie Portman. I dont see why we can't have Jar Jar Binks in there. Oh, I know he's not in those movies but I'm sure ol' George would agree it may just a freshen up the old farty art work for the new generation. <br /> <br />Ok, ok... I'm obviously not insane I'm joking around, I'm trying to make a point. Although the original pictures of the old movies we all loved are printed on the box, the content (of this pictured DVD boxed set) is 'not' of the original movies. This I almost asmumed immediately. \\"Whey-hey the originals with the original artwork,\\" but no I was wrong. My shock reaction was too curl up into a ball on the floor of the wallmart store and wish the nightmare away. For those who were there, I apologise for the difficult time I put all the staff thru. It was my one and only mid-life crisis moment! <br /> <br />Looking out for the year realease dates of the movies was also another sign that gave me false hope of... well you know... Its hard looking out for the original films on dvd as the single release of episodes 4-6 are dated at their original release. If they have been added to then I believe 'Star Wars Episode V: Empire Strikes Back (1980)' should be dated around the 2005 mark not 1980. Doing that just leads me down the path, to the dark side... or again leads me to falsely believe that the old episodes have finally been remastered and original to their theatrical release. <br /> <br />Seriously though, its important to bomb this DVD set till Kingdom Come! or till George Lucas understands that his 'ideal' vision of the star wars saga shouldn't be imposed on everyone. What happened to freedom of choice? Refusing to release a classicversion of a movie thats one of the greatest films of all time surely must be a crime. <br /> <br />If you do want to see the original there is a petition you can sign at originaltrillogy dot com, but I also saw the old laser disc collection (found in some internet stores - sorry I dont advertise) which will be the closest you can get to owning them on DVD. I haven't a clue about the quality of laser discs though and probably wont buy them unless I'm certain of good picture/sound quality. <br /> <br />If you read all of this, I apologize. <br />I am truly sorry if I wasted your time. <br />
B000AMJDHY|2.0|I enjoyed about 4 songs on this album...the rest sounds IDENTICAL to fall out boy. When i put the album in my stero I could have SWORN I was listening to FOB. I must admit a few of their songs that are very original I do enjoy. After looking at the book though The lead singer and the Lead Guitar man have so many other instruments under their belt I can see this band being so much BIGGER and BETTER if they run as far away as possible from Peter Wentz. Too much talent to be run by a man who wants a carbon copy band.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|As parents of young children, the TV does not always offer a good selection of movies that we can watch together.  This DVD set gives us 4 family movies.  We do prefer the original Karate Kid and the sequel, but they are movies that we can all agree on, young and old.
0312340958|4.0|but well worth getting through the gritty parts.<br /><br />I picked this book up on a display table in my local library just as I was checking out and was not disappointed by what I read. In this autobiography Karen Armstrong tells what it was like to be in training to be a nun and ultimately become a nun in 1960's England. What I found stunning was the complete figurative death of self that this order had to go through to prove themselves worthy. Not being of the Catholic Faith, I didn't realize how terribly, terribly hard it is/was for these girls and women. The stripping of all emotions, that in order to be completely filled with God and his love, you have to empty yourself no matter what happens to you...sickness in body, sickness in mind...it is just a matter or pushing through whatever is ailing you...mind over matter. After reading this book it makes sense to me that in order to be a good nun you would have to do that, even if you don't want to and struggle daily with the feeling of self-doubt. I have a new admiration for nuns and what they go through. That Karen Armstrong left her order is of no surprise to me. She is a powerful writer and I can't wait to read her book \\"The Spiral Staircase.\\"<br /><br />If you are at all interested in nuns, I would highly recommend this book

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Discontinuing this show when they did was a tragedy. Now we'll never know the answer to so many of the mysteries that Joss Whedon wrote into the show.  <br /> <br />As for the series itself, it is uneven, as the first season of most science fiction shows are, but even when it misfires it is never stupid (unlike Fox TV executives).  <br /> <br />Four stars only because we'll never get to see the real story arc (which would require 21 one-hour TV episodes, not 2 hours of made-for-DVD movie, in order to tell it right), thus you might feel a little cheated at the end.

B00005JMJG|2.0|An original idea but absolutely miserable execution result in a highly overrated movie.  <br /> <br />The main characters are self-centered, neurotic, emotionally unattractive and unhealthy people. As a  result, the viewer doesn't care about them.  <br /> <br />The movie is one of the most horribly photographed and unattractive films I've ever seen! The color palate is hideous, the sets ugly and cluttered, the lighting something from a freak show, the viewing angles constantly shifting, and the camera incessantly moving and bouncing. When I saw it in the theater, I hung on to the end just to see where they were going with the premise. It wasn't worth it. I left with a headache and feeling nauseous. <br /> <br />My first reaction was to give this the lowest rating possible. I finally gave it a 2, but only because the idea is original, and because of a subplot with Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, which is the only part of the movie with any emotional impact. Not surprisingly, it's the part of the movie where the director is the least hyperkinetic with the camera. Dunst and Wilkinson succeed despite the direction and photography, not because of it.  <br /> <br />2 is a generous rating. The producer and director richly deserve a 0. <br /> <br />If you feel compelled to watch this one, keep the maalox and aspirin handy. But my strong advice is: don't bother!!!
B000009HF2|5.0|I listened to this album for the first time in 1976. I just couldn't believe that I would find a live album in which every song is so cool, considering the fact that I haven't heard to a single song before. Everything in it is just perfect. This album made Rock'n'Roll history! If you still doesn't have it, don't think twice, buy it right now.

0060920084|2.0|I love Bill Bryson's books.  Love the way he writes.  But in \\"Lost Continent\\" (and also \\"Neither Here Nor There\\", his European travel account) he tirelessly complains about everything.  Towns aren't pretty enough.  Towns are too prettified.  Too loud.  Too quiet.  The people are fat.  The television programming is terrible.  The awful food.  The expensive prices. On and on and on.   <br /> <br />The irony is that Bryson himself is fat and slovenly, and in \\"Lost\\" drives, of all cars, a Chevette.  How is it that Bryson can complain about American's lack of cultural appreciation and yet for every hotel he stays at in America (and Europe, in \\"Neither here nor there\\") the one thing he's sure to comment on is the television and/or the TV programming at the hotel, as if that were a reason a person travels.   <br /> <br />In short, Bill, you are yourself the embodiment of the fat American traveler from Des Moines that you take such pains to deride throughtout both of these books.  It's no wonder you always travel alone - you'd be an excrutiating travel companion.   <br /> <br />
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill was originally going to be one big movie. But then, naturally, Quentin Tarantino, world famous for his style, director decided to split it up into two volumes.<br /><br />From the get go, we are introduced to battered bride. She is scared and shivering until the man she was aquainted with, takes out a gun and finishes her off. But, on a poetic irony note, she looks him in the eye and says, just as he's pulling the trigger, \\"Bill, It's your baby.\\"<br /><br />Bang!<br /><br />Afterwards, after a long spell of a coma in the hospital, we are thrusted into the life of The Bride . . . and her speeding train of revenge.<br /><br />The pure driven storyline, old-fashioned dialogue, huge sets, and creative period piece gives way to something that quentin Tarantino likes doing best - paying tribute to the genre of kung fu seventies movies. But, it is not totally ripping from the era. Qeuntin's style is thrown all over the place. It is said that Uma Thurman AND Quentin Tarantino came up with the plot and character of the bride themselves.<br /><br />The stunt work and fight scenes are exquisite and they will have you hungry for more. When The Bride is battling the Crazy 88's, a group of O-REN Ishi, one of the people who took part in the supposed killing of the bride, there is a heavy degree of hate and skill combined to make the perfect battle sequence. Uma Really Handles that Samurai Sword well.<br /><br />Not only is this a live action film but there are also certin style types to telling stories from the past.<br /><br />O-ren's past- done in complete Anime.<br /><br />There are also spagetti western characters.<br /><br />Some of the battle scene with the crazy 88's is done in black and white. Some speculate that the mpaa took a hand in that but I think it gave it a classic look.<br /><br />There is even a point where Uma is Breakdance fighting.<br /><br />For the women: If you are intrested in a grown women being a hardcore killer that is skilled with knifes, guns, kung fu, samurai swords, and such then this movie is for you. You'll thrill at the chance of seeing Uma fight and will also prove that women really can be deadly sometimes.<br /><br />For The Men: If you are looking for classic cinema coupled with a revenge story with many fights scenes and a lot of action than this movie is for you.<br /><br />True, there is some gore here and there but it's done in the same way that the kung fu movies were done in, and believe me, sometimes those movies can get pretty graphic.<br /><br />But, as always, Quentin never sacrifices his style, script, or direction becuase it's the thing that we are constantly craving. We just can't get enough of it. It's Just that Simple, folks.<br /><br />Final Verdict: A revenge Cut 'em Up rampage that doesn't hold back and still has time to look cool doing it.killed with knifes, guns, kung fu, samurai swords, and such then this movie is for you.

0440214041|4.0|The Pelican Brief is a trilling novel by John Grisham.  It follows a suspenseful chase after an attractive female law student. She is hunted for knowing just a little too much then the government can handle. I was not her fault that she was seeking the truth about the resent murders of the chief justices. But, it was her fault that her lover, who was also her professor was killed in a hot wired car bomb accident that was actually intended for her as well. The book follows her insane escape out of the country to escape death that she was well overdue for. <br />    <br />  I do not major in law nor am I a fan of lawyers. However, I found this book interesting because of its continues changing plot that keeps the reader under a slight suspense.  The chase after the female law student had more twists and close encounters then the affair of Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton. <br />  <br />    The book is recommended both individuals with or without legal background as well. And anyone that is interested in a different perspective on the United States Government and their ultimate domination of power over people.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|When it comes to comic-book spin off movies; this is the worst case scenrio moment, ladies and gentlemen.<br /><br />Here we have one Pateince Phillips ( This is not the same woman in BATMAN RETURNS.

After witnessing the criminals talking, she follows a series of piping that eventually leads to her downfall. She is ressurected, somehow, by cats, and is on a juorney of special-ability discovering.<br /><br />If you ask me, the story is all hype and style and no substance. It's a mock up to the legendary villian that is CATWOMAN. Although Halle Berry looks the part it's just too sloppy of a plot. It's good for a thought but not for a whole movie.<br /><br />There's even moments of a CGI catwoman. God Help them is all I have to say.<br /><br />Along with some crooked lines and too many musical cues, this makes for a music video of Catwoman, Muscial Montage, that is just too long for comfort and too silly to be a movie. They should have left it alone or tried again.<br /><br />Final verdict: Curiousity didn't kill the cat . . .the movie did.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I purposely avoid shows when they are hot and the whole world is watching.  Not too long ago I picked this up, just to see what all the hype was about.  After the first episode I locked myself in the house and refused to come out until I had watched the entire first season.  Ha ha ha ... <br /> <br />The series opens with the suicide of one of the wives on Wisteria Lane, Mary Alice.  While the entire neighborhood reels from her death, her four friends, Susan, Lynette, Brie and Gabrielle, are left without their fifth (unless you count the man eater, Nicolette Sheridan, who they are all bitterly jealous of but aren't saying a word about).  Mary Alice, while only appearing in the first and final episodes, never leaves them and looks down upon her friends and the audience with obvious love.  She does, however, wish that she was able to tell them the truth about her suicide, and that they will all realize the truth about all the dity little secrets on their otherwise ordinary suburban existence. <br /> <br />Each of the four friends represents a part of us all: trying to juggle a thousand things at once, dealing with family problems, etc.  Susan, the most likalbe despite (or maybe because of) her bumbling antics, is trying to raise her daughter as a single mom, keep up with her career, and hide her embarassing crush on the plumber, Mike.  Lynette lives across the way, a former power lunch career woman who is now a stay at home mom to four of the most undisciplined children ever (well, three at least, the fourth is just a baby).  Brie is perhaps the most perfect, most well mannered, and most Martha Stewart of them all, but is hiding her dysfuntional family troubles under a thin veil of fresh baked goods and interior design.  Last of all is Gabrielle, the trophy wife who is given everything on a silver platter by her adoring husband, but is carrying on a secret affair with the teenage gardener. <br /> <br />How well do we really know our neighbors?  How well do you reallyknow your friends?  And would you really want to?  After seeing a show like this, where you as the audience are exposed to all that goes on behind every closed door, you realize that still waters run deep.  We all have dirty little secrets, tell little white lies, and are not who we may appear to be to others.  Are we truly better people for hiding things or do we really want others to know what goes on in our houses?  That's a question for the ages.  It seems that everyone in the circle of friends as well as the secondary characters (kids, friends of the kids, new neighbors, etc.) is trying to keep up appearences.  We're all happy.  We're all holding it together.  When under the surface, we really aren't. <br /> <br />What makes this a great show is not just the hilarious moments and the exposure of these dirty secrets (see the scene where Brie's husband is cheating with the neighbor lady whose side business is prostitution), but the underline horror story that keeps building.  Mary Alice had some terrible secret from the past.  Susan accidentally set a house on fire.  Lynette is frazzled and popping pills.  Gabrielle is having an affair but her husband is closing in on her.  And Brie, poor, harassed Brie, has a rake of a husband who could care less about her, and a son who is so sociopathic, so evil, so void of remorse, that she has no idea how bad it will get until it's too late.  The tensions build and keep us in suspense until the very end.  This is a true gem in television history.

Written by the same man who directed AS GOOD AS IT GETS.<br /><br />This Dramedy acomplishes what so few have tried. A little taste of how embarassing it is to not know a language.<br /><br />But this one movie has heart. Adam Sandler flexes his dramatic funny bone here and leaves room for the others to develop.<br /><br />the whole movie is told through the eyes of the maid's daughter via an essay to a college that she wants to go to where she tells the story of how her mother had trouble adapting to one family's life style.<br /><br />Adam sandler plays the sympathetic Father who is all for making his children happy. He recently transferred from a high 4 star resturant to a lower class one. But, after the mom realizes that she can't handle everything around the house, she decides to hire a maid. The maid knows only a little bit of english . . . which is a classic tool for comedy. The comedy of Misunderstanding someone.<br /><br />After repeated problems, and under control of the nutso mom, adam sandler's character shines and is able to rise above the rest, even having a touching scene with the maid.<br /><br />The dvd has some special features but the one that really gets the taste buds tingling is a way to make THE WORLD'S GREATEST SANDWHICH. The sandwhich that adam sandler eats in the film. He was taught how to make it by a chef who was training him on the film.<br /><br />Final Verdict: Lives up to AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

B000BBOUU4|4.0|Roald Dahl is an excellent author for both children and adults, and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is by far his best book, although \\"The Witches\\" is a very close second. This movie adaptation of Dahl's masterpice for children is both humorous and poignant. The Jean Wilder version is superb as well, surpassing this one only because of the excellent songs. However, Burton's version has catchy songs as well which are sung by the Ompa Lompa's, and that are adapted from actual poems within Dahl's book. <br />Everyone should know the famous plot line of this superb story: a poverty-stricken little boy named Charlie Bucket loves chocolate and seeks to find a Golden Ticket hidden within an ordinary looking Wonka candy bar. Willy Wonka is the most famous and extraordinary candy maker in the world, and has decided to allow just five children to tour his famous factory. Four of the children, Agustus Gloop, Violet Bauregarde, Veruca Salt, and Mike Teavee are obnoxious and overly indulged by their equally despicable parents. Only Charlie is virtuous and truly deserving of finding a Golden Ticket. What will happen when each child succumbs to their own greed and disobey Willy Wonka's orders? The story is both fun and moralistic. <br />Burton's adaptation is very true to Dahl's book, and includes scenes which are not in the original movie, but are in the novel. For instance, the stories told by Grandpa Joe to Charlie are included, and the sceen about Veruca Salt has squirrels instead of geese, which are the appropriate animals. Also, Charlie Bucket is from England, which is true in the book as well. Burton  adds an interesting touch by relating sceens from Wonka's childhood about the strained relationship between him and his dentist father who forbids his son to consume candy or to pursue his dream of becoming a chocolateer. These sceens are very poignant, and emphasise the importance of family over riches and success. <br />All of the actors are very good, particularly Johnny Dep, and the man playing the Ompa Lompas. The boy portraying Charlie, who was also in \\"Finding Neverland\\" is excellent. This movie is very good and well worth watching. As a chocoholic, I recommend having plenty of candy bars on hand. You will get very hungry for sweets after watching this film. Happy viewing!
B0007ZIYM4|5.0|Okay, I'm totally hooked on this recording.  I had never heard of Ms. Jansen before recieving this CD, but this woman's playing is just so exciting!!  It inspires me as a musician that not all baroque music has to be stuffy or dull....I highly recommend this recording for anyone who may have that notion, and dare them to be proved wrong...
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I remember seeing this movie and walking out of the theater thinking that that was the best female performance I had ever seen in any movie.  I was also impressed by the fact that all the actors did their own singing.  Fortunately, this is becoming more and more common in movies.  Recent examples include RAY, BEYOND THE SEA (about Bobby Darin), and Christopher Guest's hilarious mockumentary A MIGHTY WIND. <br /> <br />I'm not a die-hard Johnny Cash fan (although I'm a much bigger fan than I was before I saw WALK THE LINE), so if there are innaccuracies or things in the movie happening out of sequence, I wouldn't know and probably wouldn't care even if I did know. <br /> <br />My primary problem with the movie is that all we see of Johnny Cash are the tough years.  We don't get to see his post-marriage life with June Carter.  I would love to have seen the happy years.  But for that I suppose I'll have to read his autobiography: CASH.  But I suppose the book is always better than the movie anyway.
B000002LEM|4.0|Great CD , fast delivery & great service.
B00004U28G|3.0|This movie is pretty original in my opinion.  From the crazy doctor to the beautiful farrah fawcet, I like pretty much this whole movie.  If you go into this wanting to see some great car chases like the original gone in 60 seconds, you are not going to get it.  The story is only set around the car race, so all the comedy plays off of the race.  Some things are just so absurn and unbelievable in this that you will actually liek the over-the-topness of it.  For instance, there is a part where bert and dom are are flying around and need some beer, so they just land the airplane in the street.  that was freaking awesome.<br /><br />So don't expect a great movie, just a fun one.<br /><br />AND TO CALL OUT TRADE AND 5 WHO IS FOR SOME RASON TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE TO TRY AND FIND THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS, YOU ARE SO FREAKING RETARDED, YOU SHOULD BE BANNED FROM THIS SITE FOREVER.  i HAVE NEVER SEEN ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS MOVIE EXCEPT ON TNN, SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHAT VERSION YOU HAVE AND WHY IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS.<br /><br />oR BETTER YET, WHY DON'T YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE BFORE YOU COPY AND PASTE YOUR REVIEWS UNDER MOVIES LIKE THIS AND SHANGHAI KNIGHTS(WHICH IS ALSO THE AMERICAN VERSION, YET YOU ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO TRY AND FIND AN ORIGINAL VERSION OF THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!)<br /><br />JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION, THESE MOVIES WERE MADE FOR AMERICAN AUDIENCES, SO PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO TRY AND FIND A DIFFERENT VERSION.  yET WITH YOUR UNBELIEVABLE STUPIDITY, PEOPLE WILL MISS OUT ON MOVIES LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE TELLING THEM IT IS THE WRONG VERSION.  sO COPY AND PASTE, STOP PUTTIGN YOUR EFFING REVIEWS ON HERE, OR AT LEAST WATCH THEM FIRST.
B00000DD1S|5.0|Astonishing 2-CD set, excellent value, good packaging (except for ugly cover) and outstanding booklet with notes from Nat Hentoff and Robert Palmer.  Impulse! usually equals quality and this offering is no exception. Combining the live dates was a particularly good, and customer-friendly, idea.<br /><br />It's been said of Coltrane that he didn't so much play the music as \\"play through it\\" in order to reach a higher spiritual goal. One can also hear this in the playing of Eric Dolphy who, though quite technical at times, appeared to be constantly exploring, looking for that pure place. Pharaoh Sanders reveals the same struggle. But in the playing of Albert Ayler one finds the apotheosis of this approach.<br /><br />Listening to Ayler is akin to witnessing old-testament revelation, he plays with the inspired intoxication and sanctified fury of a man who has not only been to the mountaintop and seen the Promised Land but already has one foot in it.  You will never hear this music in an elevator for the simple reason that it would cause businessmen to rip off their ties, weep like infants, get on their knees and pray, and confess their countless sins of mediocrity and cowardice.<br /><br />While Ayler certainly deserves center stage for his euphoric and completely original contribution to jazz, the other players fan the flames expertly.  Brother Don, on trumpet, shares the vision and is no slouch.  Both drummers featured, Beaver Harris and Sunny Murray, understand that Ayler generates such intense rhythm that timekeeping is not an issue; they are free to maneuver around the beat expressively.<br /><br />Most intriguing of all is the use of strings.  Ayler went with two bass players on both sets, also using a cellist and violin player on some tracks. This adds an unearthly and highly unexpected texture to the playing that works marvelously well. The stunning Michel Samson violin solo on Truth Is Marching In demonstrates that Ayler has surrounded himself with fellow musicians who completely understand his style and ambition.  The result is a kind of rapture, this is what it sounds like when a soul catches a glimpse of heaven and starts its voyage home. Truly righteous music.erstand his style and ambition.  The result is a kind of rapture, this is what it sounds like when a soul catches a glimpse of heaven and starts its voyage home. Truly righteous music.
B00023B1LC|5.0|I thought that i would go ahead and and write a review on this since there are so many bad ones.  This is a story about Jason Bourne, some guys on a big fishing boat find him floating in the sea, and when jason wakes up he cannot remember anything about his life.  He can remember certain things like HOW TO DRIVE, and his bank account #, but can't remember simple things like his name.  So this leads to exciting event after event that leads jason to discovering  more about who he is and the people that are after him.  i could give you all the highlights of this movie, but I really don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />Overall a great movie with exciting stunts, fights, and chases.  But don't think that it is all about that because you will learn all about these characters and this movie keeps you interested all the way through, even the parts that are supposed to be slow.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|it was just another detention Saturday. the people? a jock, a rebel, a beauty queen, a brain, and a basket case. during that Saturday, they would break through social barriers and discover that inside, there all the same. it was then they became the Breakfast Club. this is definently a great film, not just because its a Hughes film but the movie just breaks down the bounderys that keep people apart in school and shows that everyone from the high and mighty to the small and tiny have problems like everyone else. the actos are also great, Ringwald, Estevez, Sheedy, Nelson, and Hall each bring there characters to life with vibrant results. the movie through out then turns these typicall stereotypes into regular people. watching it, i realized why it was so popular in the 80's and i wonder why arent more films like this? even if the movie is a little old, its still fresh when watching and it still can effect people today. so see in my terms, the best 80's flick (screw the oscar's)
0446519456|4.0|This book is about many individuals who have serious conflicts and insecurities they are not quite able to pinpoint the sources of. Although for the believer of such a method as past life therapy or regression therapy this might be something interesting to look into, however, it did not have me sold. This book is well written but I came away feeling like the author was selling past life therapy to me which I don't think I am convinced exists. After reading this book I decided to look into conventional medication therapy instead.
0670824399|5.0|Ever since the day i read this book, and saw the movie i was just completely swepped away by the way Matilda had been treated. It is really good for girls who dont rele like to read.... i no because that was me in the 4th grade! :) I love the way the character miss honey is potrayed.... I've always wanted to have a miss honey figure in my life. It's just an amazing story and it should be shared with everyone!
B00005O5CM|5.0|When I speak with people from the East Coast I get a common responses that Californians act fake. No...I think it's the cows. Oh, sorry, it's the sun and closer, loving, family and friend relations that makes us so happy out here. So happy, infact, that it makes us burst with ambition, curiosity and confidence. Reese Witherspoon and her family do a pretty good job at portraying the typical California girl cliche.

Maybe because of her familiarity with balloons, our granddaughter was the first to spot the balloon floating in every page of this book (she received the larger size). Once she identified the balloon, she really seemed to understand that the pictures in books were images of real things! We have since bought the smaller Goodnight Gorilla for the car and now we also have the delightful Goodnight Gorilla DVD (by Scholastic Books)
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Aliens is one of my all time favorite movies and I really had no Interest in the other movies. I watched them in the theater Aliens3 & Ressurection but were not pleased at all. Alien I never actually sat down and watched because when I saw it as a teenager it seemed campy. but now sitting and watching all 4 Back to back I have gained a better appreciation for all of the other movies not Directed by James Cameron. I even enjoyed the deleted scenes of Aliens. Though i understand why they removed them, except for the Colonist piece the rest seemed like filler. <br />You just have to take the other films for what they are Alien is more of a sci/fi suspense film, the latter two  are more Hollywood summer Blockbustrer fodder but entertaining none the less. It gives you a greater appreciation for the subject and the Aliens do make a great monster. you have to be a true fan to enjoy the films completely but I do recommend the set.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|This CD is great on so many levels, if you care to take it as a whole or movement by movement, it is musicianship at it's highest level. Pat's music is so wildy varied, adventurous and of such quality, a recording like this should come as no surprise, even though it reaches in scope beyond anything previous. The amazing thing about Pat Metheny, is his music always sounds so effortless and natural, and he always is able to nail whatever tangible feeling he is  trying to communicate, be it a phrase, progression, movement , entire song or entire CD. It just comes out, and you can wrap your ears, heart and soul around it. Any musician can surely appreciate the expertise and fluidity by all the performers here, but it also has Pat's innate musicality that seperates him from the pack. It's great music.
B00000DFRS|5.0|Great album, strong voice, deep lyrics, this cd really worth it,really ms Houston makes a huge comeback to the musical scene.<br /><br />\\"In my Bussiness\\" \\" I Learn From The Best\\" and \\"I was made to Love Him\\" are the proof of that.

0596007124|5.0|Absolutely this book is useful. As a software engineer without a bs in cs, I often struggle with the books out there to formalize the things I \\"get\\" conceptually with the \\"right\\" way to look at it and talk about it. In this case, the opposite, this book is fun. I enjoy reading it, and it really helps cement the concepts and give everything names for me.<br /><br />As for the reviews that say the content about the way the book is written is over done, bah! They give one chapter to explain Why they write the way they do, and it was interesting too. As a former teacher, I know that they are accurate in their info about how people learn.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|\\"The Warriors\\" is a great movie and this DVD captures that, however my complaint is about the extras. Besides the featurettes in a \\"Director's Cut\\" you expect more: deleted scenes, commentaries, but this DVD fall short, besides giving a brief explanation at the beginning, Walter Hill the director of this cult classic doesn't give much info. Buy it for the movie which is great.
B0007R4TAS|4.0|Delbert Mann's direction is somewhat pedestrian but the cast and visuals more than compensate his static approach. George C. Scott is wonderful as Rochester while Susannah York is capable and satisfactory in the title role (Jane Eyre) yet she seems to lack some passion either from an inward or outward perspective. Jack Hawkins is brilliant as the malevolent headmaster. However, the motivations for his hideous nature are left unexplored. This version of JANE EYRE is beautifully photographed and richly textured and very compelling. John William's score is very British and appropriately composed to augment the visuals. In all this is a well intentioned and splendid production but seems to lack some of the mysterious and enigmatic qualities of earlier versions. Yet it is still very enthralling.
0156027321|5.0|I just finished this in two days while on vacation.  I can't stop talking about it and can't wait to get home to discuss with friends!  I have had it for a while, but delayed reading it because others had told me the middle was slow.  If anything the beginning was slow, but also very memorable and worth discussing.  I don't want to give anything away because it would spoil it.  The back cover should be more than enough to intice you.  I recommend running out and buying this book and savor it!
B000000XCA|4.0|This was CCR's second album.  It is unusual in that it spawned only one hit single, \\"Proud Mary\\" (but it was their biggest hit).  John Fogerty wrote all the songs, with the exception of a cover of Little Richard's \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\".  It's a solid album, but it doesn't quite come together as well as some of their later efforts.  Still, a very good album that fans of the band will enjoy.
B000001F5F|5.0|As a U2 fan I found this CD very excited , although this concert was recorded on the 80's the music is really awesome . Great music from one of the best bands of these times.
0316168815|2.0|This book was recommended to me in the wake of a tragic loss. It would console me, I was told, and for most of the way it did; console, encourage, and enlighten. But then I came to the end and felt cheated and angered by what I found to be a phony and damaging conclusion, and so I chose to write this review to let other people know what they may be in for if they read it. I say \\"may be\\" because some will react far more positively to the hopefulness of its ending than I did. For me it was as if the closing scenes of \\"Citizen Kane\\" had been scripted by someone at Disney. <br /> <br />Susie Salmon, murdered 14-year-old girl, is recounting her life from heaven and the lives of those she left behind, on Earth, as she both observes and interacts with them. There was a lot about this book I genuinely enjoyed, starting with the quality of the writing. Alice Sebold has a marvelous facility for turning a phrase in just such a way as to make it especially memorable; a sharp poignancy when you wouldn't expect it or a surprising and profound insight. And she never lets up, with the result that the book has a wonderful feel of wholeness for much of its length. Her ear for dialogue is excellent, too. A little less successful was her characterization, especially of the female protagonists. While Jack, Susie's seemingly inconsolable father, is sharply drawn, as is her brother Buckley and her friend Ray, Susie's mother Abigail somehow never gels as a person, making her dramatic turns (first running after the officer who's investigating her daughter's case and then leaving her husband) hard to understand. At the time she absconded I hadn't even realized there had been any difficulties between them. And that points to another weakness: a lack of dramatic weight. Somehow a grieving family should just plain grieve more than the well-scrubbed and polished people here did. Grandma Lynn much too often crosses the line into parody, though better that than the blandness with which Susie's sister Lindsey is drawn, and George Harvey seems too easily the stereotypical mama's boy gone wrong. <br /> <br />But for me the real problem with the book was its ending: happy, sappy, totally out of keeping with what came before it, and ultimately wrong-headed. In one of the best scenes in the novel, possibly one of the best and most provocative scenes I've read anywhere, Susie's brother Buckley, eight years after Susie's death, finds some old clothes of hers and uses them to cover some vegetables he's planted in his garden. His father, seeing this from the house, runs out to ask him what he's doing, and while Buckley explains that it's been years since his sister died their father sees the act of putting her clothes out to help his son's gardening as akin to sacrilege. Suddenly he hears a voice saying \\"Let go, let go, let go,\\" and I assumed (as I suppose most people would) that it was that inner voice telling him that it's time to put the past behind him and move on. But it's not! He's having a heart attack and the voice is his daughter's calling him from heaven to let go of his earthly life. She's lonely for him and wants him back with her. And then she asks if there's anything wrong with that. If the book had ended there, or shortly afterward, it might have been a miraculous accomplishment. But it didn't. <br /> <br />In the end, the family, minus Susie, comes together to reaffirm their faith in one another and move on to live happily ever after, leaving the memory of their daughter, and their need of that memory, comfortably behind them. Too comfortably. I have known and continue to know many people who have lost children and not one has ever been able to forget it or move on the way these characters did. And while many readers will take comfort from the belief that such damage can be put behind them, just as many (I imagine) will feel terrible that they are incapable of finding equal solace. To those readers, and to the people like me who believe that memories are among the most companionable assets in one's life, the conclusion of this book will seem bitterly disappointing. <br />
B000E5N62U|5.0|What a wonderful album from the Genius of new frontiers' atmosphere! Back to I.G.Y this is a mixture of sophisticated jazz, soul, and pop, with the well known ability in creating music as well as poetry. Drums, chorus, and guitar are simply perfect, neo-Gothic lyrics carefully polished as it usually happens in the Steely Dan's style. A little jewel, thanks Donald!!!!!!!!

B00005JKDR|5.0|Its difficult to find movies that my Mother (age 73) enjoys.  Monsters, Inc.  Was fun to watch in terms of animation, the caracters were easy to relate to, it has comedy, action, and the drama of a little family love story.  All around thumbs up for youth, adults and seniors. <br /> <br />Other movies I recommend are shrek 1,shrek 2, and nemo.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For those turned off by science fiction, you should know Firefly is not a science fiction show.  It is best described as a mixture of drama, action, and comedy with a bit of technology and western thrown in.  The soundtrack is beautiful, the dialogue is very well written and the acting is top-notch.  The best thing about the show is the diverse and interesting characters.  Not a single character on the ship is without plenty of depth.  Even better, they aren't the stereotypical crew you're likely to find in other shows.  I love every character and it's likely you will too.   <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a show that demands multiple viewings; not so much because it'll help you understand the plot (it's pretty much straight-forward), but because you'll be addicted and won't be able to stop thinking about it.
B00005NKKY|5.0|The first time we laid eyes on Richard Avedon's stark, black and white cover photo in early 1968, all of us instantly knew that we were about to be treated to one of the greatest folk-rock masterworks of all time. I'm not going to waste words describing this landmark album. The gripping emotion and beauty of this effort hit all of us like a ton of bricks when we experienced it in 1968. This album is the \\"Sgt Peppers\\" of the folk-rock era. Preserve your memories........ they're all that's left you.
B00004VWAF|5.0|Don't listen to the antagonists and nay-sayers.<br /><br />Listen to this:  On the Corner is WICKED COOL!  This is one of the most interesting recordings I own.  It never grows old, everytime I play it I hear something new.  Miles and Teo were lightyears ahead of everyone in the music business when it comes to sampling and tape loops.  Brian Eno and Danny LeNois must have learned an awful lot from On the Corner.  I gotta get one of those \\"On the Corner\\" T-shirts with the album art!  Anyway...<br /><br />Many years ago, way back in the 70's, I let a \\"friend\\" who was a jazz know-it-all talk me out of purchasing the Lp \\"On the Corner\\"  He told me it was crappy experimental funk and that this record was a disaster to be avoided at all costs - even if it was Miles.  Fast forward a good 30 years. I saw some of these great reviews out here on Amazon.  I decided to take a chance and picked up a copy.  I really didn't know what to expect of the \\"cartoon\\" album when I popped it into my car's CD player. I expected something a bit like Davis's \\"Big Fun\\" release.  Indeed, some of the same instruments, notably sitar and tabla find their way onto \\"On the Corner.\\"  But this music is much more in your face than \\"Big Fun.\\"  It's full of odd percussion and polyrhythms.  There's all sorts of interesting sounds, some even sound like furry woodland creatures!  At times it is a complete cacophony but it all works together somehow.  It might take a few listens for the average electric Miles listener to get his/her head around this one.  If there is any fault with this release I would say it is the way the listener is sort of dropped into the middle of a very busy piece of music - there is no introduction, the opening edit is right in the middle of a very busy passage!  That's a small problem though, the music is just amazing!  Stay with it and you'll end up loving this CD.<br /><br />If you happen to be a musician it's also fun to play along with \\"On the Corner\\"  When I play this CD at home I find it is impossible to resist the urge to plug in the telecaster and pedal board (especially the wah-wah and distortion pedals) and play along, and you will too.  You'll fit right in with this menagerie of a band.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm sorry I waited so long to pick this up.  Maybe back in the 70's I wouldn't have understood it, heck, I'm not sure I do now, but I do know I really love this CD.  The remastering job is superb!  I can't get this thing out of my CD player, it is so wildly weird and funky!<br /><br />A must have if you enjoy Miles's work from the 70's.<br />By the way, if you like On the Corner then I strongly recommend you pickup a copy of Herbie Hancock's \\"Sextant\\". \\"Sextant\\" has much in common with On the Corner.ble to resist the urge to plug in the telecaster and pedal board (especially the wah-wah and distortion pedals) and play along, and you will too.

B0006Z2LP6|5.0|Ron Howard really did history justice in this rendition of America's journey into space and the lunar expedition.  Tom Hanks, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, and Bill Paxton were excellent in their portrayals of their characters.  If you're thinking about seeing this film for the first time, I guarantee it will take you back in time, and literally entrance you.  The moon destined astronauts and the inevitable near death trajedy that occurs hit too close to home and show us raw emotion as well as a willingness to go against the odds and do what it takes to survive.  You will see the interplay of a body of individuals working against the clock, here on earth, to assist the astronauts in space: and you will be struck by their teamwork and unity to accomplish the goal of survival.  This is a story about unity.  About accomplishments.  About strength and survival.  It is a story about family, love and honor.  I have watched this film over a few dozen times, each viewing reminding me of the human struggle factor and what can be accomplished when unity is attained.  The support of family, the knowledge of love, and the faith of honor fully present throughout the film.  Ron Howard makes one mean telling of a team of astronauts who attempted to fly to the moon.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Had this record a week or so and I would say that dispite my 2 star rating there are a couple of tracks I quite like. But this album is far from a great work. I think the truth is Gilmour is a superb performer and improvisor but a lousy composer of structured works. I would rate Richard Wright's compositional skill significantly higher, he wrote some beautiful bits on Dark side and Animals. Ultimately I think its a crying shame that Gilmour and Waters can no longer work together. I cannot image how good Amused to death would have been if it had been given the Gilmour treatment. That's basically how pink floyd worked on golden albums like Animals, waters comes up with a demo tape and the thing evolved into greatness using the other band members considerable talents. For me the closest to something like Animals is a Roger waters solo album, Amused to death.
B00020HEG6|4.0|\\"Azkaban\\" is simply wonderful.  John Williams has quite the handle on Harry and his pals on this album.  It moves the movie along at a nice pace and perfectly sets the mood for each part of the film.  From the exhiliration of \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\" to the sheer terror of any of the scenes involving the Dementors, Williams sets the tone exactly as it needs to be.<br /><br />Personal favorites include \\"Lumos!\\" and \\"Quidditch, Third Year.\\"<br /><br />The entire album is fun to listen to, and it actually works wonders as mood music when you're reading the books these wonderful films are based on.<br /><br />Highly recommended to any fan of Potter and especiall fans of the \\"Azkaban\\" flick.

B000002UE9|5.0|May be the best Poison Cd, it has energy and fun, trademarks of Poison's songlyrics,  glam/hard rock music and wildlife style,  that why it became the album of the summer of '88, starting from the \\"Love on the Rocks\\" opening with a cool riff of CC DeVille to the \\"Bad to be good\\" where Boby Dall played bass on a 70's street style, playing this  CD is a purely \\"Nothing but a good time\\" that with a high volume can \\"Tearing down the walls\\", with one of the best rock and roll ballad of the 80's \\"Every Rose has it's thorn\\" making  you remember  a long forgotten \\"Good love\\" on a \\"Fallen Angel\\" that you can only \\"Look but you can 't touch\\" and made you wish going \\"Back to the Rocking horse\\", so if your \\"Mama  don't dance\\" and you Daddy don't rock and roll, surely this Cd will make them go to  dancing & rocking! This is a MUST  for every music collector or is you  are looking for good times this is the CD you must pick up! <br /> <br />I hope Capitol will release soon this CD remastered and adding the 2 B-sides: \\"Living for the minute\\" & \\"Gotta face the Hangman\\" for the recording sessions of this album, also as cool value add the full MTV Accoustic with the 6 songs recorded (good love, let it play -these 2 unreleased- talk dirty, unskinny bop, Every rose and Your mama don't dance, there is enough room on the 80 minutes that a CD can hold- surely will be a hit!!!!

B000BO0LKY|5.0|This is an excellent album! I have never bought a Mariah album before, but this was well worth the money. This album is one of the rare ones that can be listened to straight thru from beginning to end. It presents a good variety of songs from \\"party-mood\\" (Like That), to \\"reflective\\" (We belong Together), to \\"spiritually-conscious\\" (Fly Like a Bird).
0743424425|5.0|I had never read a Stephen King book until I read \\"The Shining\\". Without a doubt it is one of the best books I have ever read. I really enjoyed the movie, yet the book is better by far. The movie is what made me want to read the book. The movie is good, but if I had read the book and then watched the movie, I would have been disappointed. The book is far greater than the movie. <br /> <br />The book was hard to put down from the get go. I could picture everything in my mind. I pictured the life of the Torrance's and the struggles that they had been through in the recent past. I pictured the Overlook Hotel where Jack Torrance and his family stayed while he was the caretaker over the winter.  <br /> <br />Slowly throughout their stay at the Overlook, Jack uncovers a lot of strange happenings that occurred in the Overlook. The more he uncovers, the more the hotel gets to him, as if it were alive itself... He begins to lose his cool, as well as his mind.  <br /> <br />There are many things that haunt the Overlook, and Jack's son, Danny, is able to see all of it. He can see all of the horrible things that happened in the past, as well as get dreadful hints of the future. He can see the hotel get to his father, yet he has no power to stop it.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. King makes it so real that you start to question whether it is really fiction or not. <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback has the most touching subtle acting in it.  Ang Lee's direction is excellent.  The story slowly unfolds over you.  It doesn't CRASH into you like other movies.  It lets YOU think (and feel) for yourself.
0380799006|5.0|This book offers sensible and compassionate advice for diffusing sibling conflict and minimizing resentment.  Like the authors' earlier book, \\"How to Talk So Kids Will Listen,\\" it's written in an easy-to-use format, with cartoon dialogs and summaries to highlight key points.  The comments from adults reflecting on the impact of their own experiences growing up with siblings were quite poignant.  Sibling relationships are often the longest relationships of our lives.  This book is an excellent resource within in-depth descriptions of what parents can do to help sibling relationships be strong and peaceful.<br /><br />---Eileen Kennedy-Moore, PhD, author of<br /><br />'WHAT ABOUT ME?<br /><br />Twelve Ways to Get Your Parents' Attention<br /><br />Without Hitting Your Sister'<br /><br />(for children ages 3-8)
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Purchased the soundtrack after watching the movie. The soundtrack is absolutely awesome. I found myself very attached to the music played throughout the whole CD.
B0000047EC|4.0|I can understand how people can say that this CD is boring. I just don't agree with them. It depends upon what kind of mood you are in. If you are in a danceandrockandroll kind of mood, this ain't gonna cut it. If, on the other hand you are looking for music to listen to while having a quiet romantic at-home dinner (i.e. wine, roses, chocolate mousse and coffee after dinner) this is perfect. It's a great prelude for...a long evening with your significant other. It's the kind of music that is the perfect soundtrack to watching the snowflakes fall (preferably while snuggled in the arms of the above person) or soaking in a hot tub. I listen to it while doing design work as well as it seems to allow the creative juices to flow without distracting me from the work at hand.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|For those of us who cannot get enough Stargate SG-1, Atlantis helps fill the gap.  Like most spin-off programs, it slightly lacks the punch and character development of the original, but is still very good.  If you LOVE Stargate SG-1, you will LIKE Stargate Atlantis.
B00004ZD69|4.0|This is a significant improvement over the mediocre UXO release. The music herein moves with a compelling direction and there is an internal logic to what's on offer here that sets them apart from their own work as well as others like Explosions In The Sky and the knob-obsessed Pelican.  <br />Throughout the progress of the tracks on each disc there is an intriguing blend of instrumentation, each passage rising organically from foundations laid as the music progresses. I haven't heard this sophisticated a stream of musical consciouness since the Topographic days of YES. While not as overtly Stravinsky-based as Anderson and Co, these Canadians have that sense of working on a much bigger canvas with an incredible array of colours on their palette. All of it works. I found myself surprised when each disc ended. That in itself is a significant improvement over UXO. <br />Hopefully they shall survive as a working team. Who knows what recognition in GOURMET magazine will do to them. An odd karmic twist for a band that disdains its own success and the retailing efforts to which it must concede. With this release they establish themselves as having quite a lot to say musically in the dialogues among each other, and I'm hoping that discussion continues.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Gay cowboy movie or not, you will not be able to shake the pull of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" once its' through.  The acting is too strong, the writing is too perceptive, the direction is too smart and the cinematography is too spare and beautiful to just flow away into indifference.  Director Ang Lee pulls off one hell of a love story that transcends sexuality.  It's about two people who truly fall in love.  One summer Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet in the Wyoming Mountains to herd sheep, a job both expect little out of.  What they don't anticipate is that both share deep commanalities, such as broken homes and dreams of a better life.  What they really don't expect is too fall for each other.  Both leave the mountain, and eventually continue on with their lives the way society has told them to.  Ennis marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack marries a rodeo chick (Anne Hathaway), but neither of them finds the happiness that they felt with each other that special, innocent summer.  Jack eventually finds the bravery to push for what he wants, but Ennis, closed-off and emotionally inexperienced (Ledger gives a performance of epic emotional intensity), can't bring himself to acknowledge what he knows, whether it is love for Jack or his paternal need to be with his daughters.  And he learns too late what it is he really wants. <br />  <br />Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are emotional knockouts and the actors who beat them for the Oscars had better have given superhuman efforts to best them.  You don't find two performances like these just anywhere.  The same goes for Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, who hit grace notes that almost any other actor would have overlooked.  Credit director Ang Lee for obsessively scanning the small things that make a good actor great, and a good movie a classic.  A movie about gay cowboys it may be, but it's the humanity and love between Ennis and Jack that make \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"universal.  You won't be able to forget it.
B000E5N62U|4.0|I do not claim to be a Steely Dan or Donald Fagen expert.  I have only been listening (not hearing) the music from them for about 2 or 3 years (been hearing them since about birth).  I find \\"most (80%)\\" of their stuff, from the beginning to present, nice and refreshing...their music to me is timeless.  This is one of the few bands that has had this affect on me.  For you, the review reader...I am, and have been for years, on a constant quest for music that tingles my ears, mind, and heart.  This is one of those bands that does that for me.     I own the CD/DVD Audio version of this recording and have been trying to build up my 5.1 audio collection with everything from Steely Dan and Donald Fagen.  The music on this newest release is catchy.  I have been repeating \\"Mary Shut the Garden Door\\" all day long.  Although this isn't quite what you would expect from Donald Fagen (songwise), it would have to be my favorite so far.  As with most of the SD and DF recordings, I think most of them need some break-in time to really appreciate most of the songs on each album.  This one, I can tell, will definately need some of that time although there are about 4 on here that are immediately \\"catchy\\".    The 5.1 surround mix version is well put together.  It isn't overly done with surround effects diverting attention from the main recording, although there are just enough fun effects here and there that will make you scan back through the song to appreciate the things occasionally whirling around your head.  All the instruments in the surround mix are nicely placed and work well together providing an entirely new experience to this album (as are most of the 5.1 SD and DF releases).  Real fun stuff!    This offering by Donald Fagen is somewhat different from \\"Nightfly\\", \\"Kamakiriad\\", and \\"Everything Must Go\\".  But, it is different in a pleasant way and will most likely not be a problem for fans of his music.
0060899190|5.0|i think postsecret is one of the best books ever. <br /> <br />you are literally in tears one moment, and laughing the next. <br />perfect coffee table matter. <br />i've looked at this book countless times, everyone loves looking at it...amazing.
B000929AJQ|4.0|High points  <br />\\"Only\\" 9/10  <br />The best song on the album, catchy but not to poppy (like a  few songs on this album)  <br /> <br />\\"Right Where It Belongs\\" 8/10  <br />This albums \\"hurt\\" is a keeper even though it is lacking in complexity. It makes up for this with sincerity.  <br /> <br />Low point  <br />\\"You Know What You Are?\\" 6/10  <br />Trent is Definitely try to recapture some angst that he has lost. Let it go man you are no longer as pissed off as you once were.  <br /> <br />Many fans don't like this album because it mixes more mainstream almost pop electronic elements into nin standard style. I think the main thing holding this album back is nin's angst that seems forced on this outing. Despite this I still recommend the album.  <br />
B00008J4P5|4.0|The White Stripes impress me very much with the originality of their songs. Being one of the few rock bands with only two members, they craft their songs very well. Jack is a great guitarists while Meg doesn't play the most difficult drum beats in the world but that is part of what makes the music unique.  <br /> <br />My favorite songs on the cd are: Seven Nation Army, There's No Home For You Here, In The Cold Cold Night, Ball and Biscuit, and Girl You Have No Faith in Medicine.  <br /> <br />To the person that wrote that The Air Near My Fingers is a rip off of Nirvana's Rape Me is wrong. The song sounds somewhat similar but is in no way a rip off. If you want a real rip off go listen to anything Bush ever put out and then you will have a Nirvana rip off. <br />
B00000DFRS|5.0|THIS HAPPENS TO BE MY FAVORITE CD FROM WHITNEY... THIS OUTING HAS POP'S PRINCESS BECOMING HIP AND I ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. SURE, THE VOICE IS DEEPER AND THE NOTES ARE NO LONGER SUSTAINED BUT INSTEAD, THEY ARE TWISTED UP IN A RIFF OR TWO.  WHITNEY IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST VOCALISTS EVER. I LIKE ALL OF THE TRACKS BUT IF I HAD TO CHOOSE FAVORITES, \\"IT'S NOT RIGHT BUT IT'S OKAY, \\"GET IT BACK\\",AND \\"I BOW OUT\\" WOULD BE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. \\"I WAS MADE TO LOVE HIM\\" IS A MODERNIZED, MORE HIP VERSION OF STEVIE WONDER'S \\"I WAS MADE TO LOVE HER.\\"  HOUSTON SHOWS OUT IN THAT ONE. THIS ALBUM PROVES THAT NO MATTER THE STATE OF WHITNEY'S LIFE, SHE'LL ALWAYS MAKE GOOD MUSIC. IT'S HER MOST SOLID AND CONSISTENT PIECE OF WORK; HER MASTERPIECE....
B00005ATQD|5.0|...after Barry Lyndon. Exegesis could be endless on this much misunderstood film, so I'll keep it short: this is the finest movie about marriage EVER MADE. And the truest. From a male perspective, at least. One day an astrologer may explain how the stars came into alignment in 1999 and Tom Cruise, an actor I have absolutely no use for in any other context,  gave us two of the best films of the last 25 years, EWS and Magnolia.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This was a great movie.  I'm not a fan of musicals, but this one was awesome!  You are able to follow along fine.  The picture was great.  The story was accurate to the play.  This is a must in your movie collection.
076781214X|5.0|I have read all the reviews and they are mostly correct, so I will not go over territory covered.  Nicholas Cage chose to sound like Gumby on purpose, much to the consternation of the rest of the cast I have read, but it was his uncle directing so it is what it is.  All the other reviews are right--this is a very good film.  What they forget to mention, however, is the incredible set design.  Every small detail seems perfect--the houses, cars, knick-knacks, everything.  Yes, the speakers in the basement scene are not yet invented--too bad they were as they are among the worst speakers ever made--but I believe a good bit of the charm of this film is the background.  It sets the scenes and gives the actors an authentic backdrop for the story.  Part of the enjoyment for those of us who lived then was the visual transcendence into the past that accompanied the script/plot.  One reviewer got it right--it sometimes brings a tear to your eye.

0812975219|5.0|I am a finance prof.  I must admit that before reading Taleb my view of applying probability theory outside of academic use was somewhat naive, probably because I have too much training in probability theory.  From my angle, the major intellectual contribution of Taleb is his contextual analysis of statistical and probability theory in finance and investments.  In both areas we apply mathematical, numerical and other structured approaches to describe quantifiable history of prices and returns, and extrapolate these series into the future.  When we make assumptions of distributions, we introduce assumptions and biases.  We are aware of these biases, but doing anything about it is an unresolved intellectual challenge.  Generally, we reject the normal distribution in financial market returns, but we ignore the fact of 3, 4 and 5 sigma events happen considerably more frequently than what many probability distributions imply.      Taleb describes processes we believe are controllable as fundamentally random is refreshingly nihilistic.  If we can control a process, we can also model it.  All in all, Taleb makes series of excellent points about the systematic bias our ove-reliance on probability theory has on investments, investing, and the role of modeling probability.  One of the largest culprits is the proprietary trading industry - look at LTCM.  While I disagree with Taleb that Warren Buffet is an aberration, I agree with him that many fund managers are not successful because they are skilled, but because they have been lucky long enough. In a world of randomness, where everything is random and random effects affect other random effects, I like his idea.  Extrapolating his view, the entire universe is an effect of randomness and our lives are as random as the universe.  \\"Have a large number of monkeys sit by typewriters and one of them will produce the Ulysses\\".  Looking forward to an updated or expanded edition.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|Lets get this out of the way first. I am not a huge A7x fan, and my review of this album and thoughts on this band probably sound more negative than they are. <br />I first heard of a7x from a friend, who had sounding the seventh trumpet. He claimed they were similiar to 80's metal, iron maiden, judas priest and the such, but with a little metalcore thrown in.  Im not a fan of metalcore either, but i enjoy bands like unearth, shadows fall, lamb of god, and trivium from time to time. <br />So i bought Waking The Fallen when it came out, and liked it, alot. <br />Now, this album comes out.  When i first heard about it, it sounded great to me, i didnt really care if they lost the screaming (shadows and his throat surgery), and had a more \\"focused-on-80s/speed-metal\\" feel seemed great, as no modern bands recently had done that.  <br />Well, i dont think it was that great after all.  Granted, if you play this type of music, you are a talnted musician, so theres points for them (but, for the record, ive been playing guitar for over a year now, and i can play all of unholy confessions the same pace as the song normally goes. So, they actually improved thier songwriting from Waking the fallen to create harder music on city of evil, props there, as those solos are very hard to learn). Shadows singing, both either hate or loved, i think is somewhere between tolerable, good, and then downright annoying.   <br />The thing that annoys me most about this album though, is the feel that they tried to hard. That, they tried to pay homage to the bands that created the music they loved, but it really just comes out cheesy and uninspired by a7x.  I should have really expected that, but those of you who think this album is better than decent, that it is a masterpiece, well you might not listen to enough metal to understand what i mean.  Dont get me wrong, im sure some reviwers here love true metal, or all different kinds of metal so they have an unbiased opinion, but they still enjoy a7x music. to me, it just doesnt do it. <br />Iron Maiden is still making music <br />Judas Priest is still making music <br />Megadeth is still making muisc <br />Metallica...wait nevermind <br />Anyways, there are tons and tons of thrash, progressive, power metal, speed metal, and hybrid bands of these styles around, that all do it better than avenged sevenfold, in part because bands like Iron Maiden and Priest invented that great \\"cheesyness\\" that we all love today, and perfected thier genre of music. A7x just dont pull it off as well. <br />With the media today it isnt a suprise most kids view \\"real metal\\" as this, as its shoved down thier throats 24/7, all over the radio and tv...they are on a major label. I dont really care to much about that, as its so common place now...if you like your style of music fed to you go ahead. If you like a7x, thats fine by me. Ill go listen to my music, or at least wait till a7x put out another album...maybe then ill eat my words because they put out something so great. You never know. <br /> <br />By the way, musicians dont have an obligation to be role models, but from interviews and video clips and articles ive read/scene, these guys have massive egos they dont even deserve. They say they are, \\"keeping the torch of metal alive\\" claiming they are destined to be as great as the real greats (how many times do i have to mention iron maiden), brag about getting drunk after shows, tons of groupies, basically the whole rock and role lifestyle. We know what its like, we dont need you to brag about it to all the kiddies to prove you have crazy parties and you throw your morals out the door. I could careless that they do that stuff, but when you brag about getting groupies to suck your guitar tech's you-know-what after the show because hes never got any, and continue on in many paragraphs on how much you adore drugs alcohol and groupies, it gets me to think the band really isnt about the music as much as i thought...maybe more for image?? <br />2 stars for good musicianship, i like the song \\"trashed and scattered\\", and a good try to \\"bring back real metal\\"...sorry, ive still got preist, maiden, exodus, megadeth, dream theater, sonata arctica, death, iced earth, blind guardian, lost horizon and countless other bands to listen to. <br />
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay is more than just a rising star and this is a prelude to many more great CDs.
B000BWI9U0|5.0|the strokes are the best band ever. they have some sort of driving force powered by albert hammonds backup nick valensi's solos nikolais complex bass lines and fabs beautiful drumming. julian casablancas came out of his melodic tone voice which we so loved in \\"is this it\\" and \\"room on fire\\" in \\"First Impressions of Earth\\".Juicebox shows julian can bring his voice wherever it needs to go. I saw them live in atlanta and they played \\"ask me anything\\" which was better than the cd. this album has some catchy songs such as \\"you only live once\\" \\"heart in a cage\\" and \\"red light\\".First Impressions has a sort of acquired taste that requires listening to their first and second cds so if uve just started listening to the strokes buy \\"is this it\\" and \\"room on fire\\" due to the fact that you are bound to fall in love with the melodic, wonderful, band that is The Strokes
B00003CXAA|5.0|Rank this right below Cecil B. De Mille's The Ten Commandments! Definitely a vintage classic. Makes Goodfellas and the Sopranos easier to capece.
B000002UTY|5.0|This cd represents some of the pioneering work of the psychedelic rock era...especially the guitar playing. In it's day, it was revolutionary. I can almost see myself at a 60's 'Frisco rock concert with a light show and people dancing everywhere...
0689829590|5.0|I bought this on a whim because my daughter likes saying good night to the moon.  It was one of five books I purchased in one order, and the rest remain unread because my two-year old daughter immediately picked this one as the one she wanted read - over and over and over again.  She can recite practically the whole thing and so strongly identifies with the little girl in the story she likes to pretend to be Monica (or she gets confused and thinks she IS Monica).  It's a cute story and the fold-outs are unusual and compelling, but it's one of those rare books that has struck a deep chord with her - and that I can tolerate reading over and over and over again.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|It didn't scream with power the way \\"Ray\\" did last year, but this is a pretty good film.  Johnny Cash had a broodier personality than I realized, but it was because he felt incomplete without June Carter.     Much like Ray Charles, Cash was also traumatized by the death of a brother.  However, there the similarities end. In \\"Ray\\", it was revealed that Ray Charles loved music above all else, including his own family and the many, many women.  For Cash, his heart's desire was for one woman only: June Carter...an obsession that drove him to drug addiction.  I liked this approach to the film versus focusing on Cash's rise to fame.  This flaw makes him seem more human and less iconic.        Joaquin Phoenix is hot in this film and did a wonderful job; Reese certainly deserved this Oscar...her best role to date. Forget Vanity Fair.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|Soooooo Goooooddddddddddd!!!!! I'm still at a loss for words on this album, so i'll just point out the highlights. Intro is kinda pointless. Its ok though. Her Voice Resides has 2 of the most insane guitar solos i've ever heard in my life. 4 words(To Choke Upon) was carried over from their Ep, Hand Of Blood, and is still awesome. Spit It Out, track 12, was my first favorite song on the album. Not much to say, just listen and let the song speak for itself. Cries In Vain has also been carried over from Hand Of Blood and is an ok song. There are no \\"bad\\" songs on the entire album and for all those who say BFMV is \\"good not great\\" really need to have your head examined. These guys WILL be the next FFAF trust me. Mabye just a little different kind of sound.  So once again i reitterate....SOOOOO GOOOODDDDDD! Or, rather, So GOD!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Loved the movie and I don't even like Jane Austen's stories.   <br /> <br />This interpretation was completely honest and surprisingly contemporary while still using Austen's words to effectively portray the emotions of the characters.  Keira, for such a tiny thing, is surpringly forceful and powerful in her prideful portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett.  Her acting style is so natural that you wonder if she was acting at all.  If Reese Witherspoon hadn't won the Oscar, it clearly would have gone to Keira Knightly.  I haven't seen the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice, but this was well done, straighforward yet still cinematically beautiful and pleasant. <br /> <br />I'd love to see more of Keira in strong roles which is what she's clearly suited for.  English Rose she may be, but dainty dame she is not.  Clearly a lovely tomboy who can hang with the boys...which acocunts for her solid performance in Bend it Like Beckham. Her off screen persona is not too far off.  When interviewed on the Red Carpet by Isaac Mizrahi, she told him with quick frankness she didn't think she would win.  Mizrahi responded that she needed a plan when her name was called.   <br /> <br />Keira:  Whether or not I win, I'm going to party afterwards. <br /> <br />Mizrahi:  Great!  Who are you going with to the party? <br /> <br />Keira: I don't know...I'm just going to...follow people.  <br /> <br />Now that's how a 20 year old talks.  You could tell she was clearly there to have fun and wasn't taking herself too seriously. <br /> <br />Star in the making.  She's got plenty of time for Oscars.  Might as well enjoy herself.   <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I am a huge fan of Pride & Prejudice (the book, BBC, and AE version). I was very disappointed with this adaptation. It was choppy and felt a bit too rush. I can't believe that this classic was reduced to a two hour mush. If you have never read the book, I suggest you read it before viewing this movie. You will have a difficult time following the plot otherwise.

0767802470|2.0|German director Wolfgang Petersen's sprawling, fatally uneven WWII/Submarine epic is a surprisingly dull film, especially considering the intense nature of it's subject matter and the amount of critical and popular acclaim it has recieved.    Told, of course, from the Nazi perspective during WWII, the movie takes a potentially fascinating premise and turns it into what is quite possibly one of the most over-rated films ever commited to celluloid, a mind-numbingly boring, interminably paced movie (calling it over-long would be an understatement) filled with repetitive moments and meaningless shots in which a fuzzy bearded, deranged looking officer spends ten minutes staring into the screen, then stares away...ten minutes staring into the camera, then at his midshipman...and so on, into what seems an eternity (apparently such scenes are intended to build suspense...and at first that almost seems to be the case, but it soon becomes merely tedious and exhausting when, after literally hours of patient viewing, nothing much happens and the action grows redundant). While admittedly successful in it's attempt to render the claustrophobic and oppressive atmosphere of a U-boat, \\"Das Boot\\" fails to generate any kind of real emotional drama or character development, ( it also has an overbearing soundtrack which sounds like some 1980s soap opera, or worse, the background music of a Nazi Propaganda film), other than the usual exhausted war-movie-cliches (i.e, the jaded and skeptical officer, the naive and idealistic youth) and hysterical shrieks of unsympathetic nazis during the three second attack on their ship in which no one is killed, so that it's historical authenticity and technological ingenuity is not enough to salvage it, like some washed up wreck of a post-WWII U-boat, from the scrap heap.
B00000J7SS|5.0|In college, I went through a period of obsession with this album and played it almost nonstop, much to the frustration of some of my dorm neighbors. The music itself is hard to describe (especially for a relative jazz neophyte such as myself). Suffice to say that it is like nothing else. The interplay between horns, guitar, bass, and drums is so intricate that you hear something new each time you listen, yet the structure and repetition can carry you into a trance if your mood suits. <br /> <br />Even if you think you're not into jazz or fusion (or not up to anything more adventurous than \\"Kind of Blue\\"), give \\"Bitches Brew\\" a listen; it may just take hold of you.
B000E5N62U|4.0|Morph The Cat is Donald Fagen's first solo release in thirteen years.  The album, must like most everything he's done with Steely Dan and his previous two solo releases, is an impeccably produced mix of jazz, rock & soul.  The album is built around the fears of the post 9/11 world.  Much of Mr. Fagen's lyrics are cynical in nature and while his bite is still intact, there is a more personable feel.  \\"Security Joan\\" is a funny look at the sexuality of a frisking by an airport security guard.  \\"What I Do\\" revolves around talking to Ray Charles. Darker tones creep into \\"The Night Belongs To Mona\\" which tells the tale of a woman afraid to leave her apartment after 9/11 while \\"Mary Shut The Door\\" is the most overtly political song that contains thinly veiled lines about the Bush administration like referring to a thuggish cult gaining control of the government.  Mr. Fagen perfectly balances these darker feelings with his sardonic humor.  While he is a noted studio perfectionist, the sound of the album never feels over manipulated.  There is a fluidity and natural feel that allows the songs to breath.
B000CPGZHA|5.0|Wow!!!  What can you say?  I got to see this concert in Paris, and can't watch the DVD enough times....she sounds and looks as amazing as ever....and what can you say about those back-up dancers???? Yumm....
B000002A3T|4.0|Let's face it folks, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" was a David Gilmour solo album in everything but name, but this one is the real deal.  This sounds more like a \\"band\\" album than a album with Gilmour and a bunch of studio musicians.  Granted, there are plenty of studio musicians here as on AMLOR, but this album has the feel of \\"Pink Floyd the band\\" instead of \\"Pink Floyd the brand name\\" as the core trio of Gilmour, Mason & Wright are mixed to the fore. \\"Cluster One,\\" the obligatory instrumental that opens the album, I could've done without, but once it gives way and charges into \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" you realize right away that The Floyd is back with a vengeance.  This song wouldn't have been out of place on Wish You Were Here.  Rick Wright returns with \\"Wearing the Inside Out.\\"  His voice has always worked well with Gilmour's.  With the songs \\"Take It Back\\" and \\"Coming Back To Life\\" we find an uptempo, almost upbeat Floyd, but things slow down for the final three songs, \\"Keep Talking,\\" \\"Loss For Words,\\" and \\"High Hopes.\\"  \\"High Hopes\\" is perhaps one of the best songs David Gilmour has written in his long career, on par with \\"Comfortably Numb\\" from \\"The Wall.\\"  It closes \\"The Division Bell\\" on an appropriately Floydian grandiose level.   <br /> <br />The guy who reviewed this album for Amazon lamented Gilmour's guitar playing, but my thought is that the reviewer simply wasn't paying attention.  Gilmour's guitar playing on \\"The Division Bell\\" is the same as it ever was - stellar.
B00006RCNJ|4.0|We enjoyed this DVD very much, it was wonderful enternaiment for the whole familiy.   I would reccomend you buy and enjoy it too.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|If you liked Pink Floyd's swan song \\"The Division Bell\\", you will like this one as well.  This is a well-crafted disc, and very laid back.  If you're in a bad mood, put this disc into your CD player and you'll go to a much calmer place.  Soundwise, this disc sounds like Pink Floyd during their \\"Meddle\\" period.  It's much more intimate than \\"The Division Bell,\\" but the orchestration on this disc is just as effective as it is on \\"The Division Bell.\\"  I don't detect any overarching theme for this disc - to my ears this is just a good collection of songs.  The first surprise (and a pleasant one at that) I heard on this disc was to hear David Crosby and Graham Nash harmonizing with David Gilmour on the title track.  The instrumentals (three in all) are pleasant to hear.  David Gilmour makes his recording debut on saxaphone on one of them.  In addition to guitar and the aforementioned sax, he also plays bass and various keyboard instruments, all to great effect.  This is another must-have Gilmour CD.
B0001US62I|5.0|...and they caused me to pass it up for about 20 years, too.  I don't recall many kind words about this movie when originally released.  Most reviewers never got past the notorious scene -- you know the one I mean.  How sad.  Anyway, I took their word for it, movie sucks, don't waste your time.  They were so wrong. <br /> <br />I finally saw it this weekend.  Wow.  What an outstanding little thriller.  And, I gotta say, a fairly important film.  Along with Jacob's Ladder, this seems to anticipate almost every major thriller of the past 15 years.  But this one came first, and it may be the stronger film. <br /> <br />Rourke is terrific.  Seeing this, it's hard not to wonder how different his career might have gone if the critics hadn't chosen to make him their personal whipping boy.  I'm not quite ready now to rush out and snag copies of 91/2 Weeks and Wild Orchid, but I'm thinking about it.  They were so wrong about this one...maybe these others weren't celluloid vomit, either. <br /> <br />Anyway, excellent film.  If you're a horror / thriller / mystery fan, and have steered away from this one because you didn't want to see the Cosby kid defiled, I'd encourage you to give it a chance.  And if as it unfolds you're thinking, man, this is pretentious trash...well, hang in there.  When the story is over you might feel differently. <br /> <br />Only complaint.  DeNiro's character's name.  Come on.  As effective as the movie was, it might have been that much more so if they hadn't telegraphed DeNiro's character every step of the way.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Eventhough it sounds like Fall Out Boy, Guess what? the singer from FOB or someone from FOB(Which I don't know the band member names)were fascinated and choose them. If you go to panic at the disco site you'll know what I mean. Anyway their music is different from what I've heard in my entire life. It's music is a mix of Punk/Pop/Disco. It's really cheerful and It makes me exercise everyday.<br /><br />Oh... and all the songs are my favorite!!!<br /><br />Buy it if you like to listen to new music.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Just an incredible movie honoring a great show that was stopped way before its time.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I found this DVD very interesting.  It has a lot of extras in it, that make it even more interesting.  It's the battle between Lou Ferrigno and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  They show behind the scenes shot of the contestents and the mind battles they use against each other.  It's also shows the thinking process of Arnold and his absolute dedication to his sport.  Defnitely worth the buy if you like bodybuilding, Arnold, or even a good little movie.
B000E97X66|4.0|...I was at this show. To say it was excellent would be to understate the case...I don't think the UK had seen such a committed performer in years...<br /><br />...the CD is a reasonable capture of the set list. But I distinctly remember a truly riveting version of 'Pretty Flamingo,' with a long spoken intro, and a run at the Mitch Ryder version of See See Rider as highspots...but it was getting on for a three-hour show, so you can't have everything, I guess...<br /><br />...this was most definitely his best period...to me, anyway...
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I really love this movie. The acting is first rate and the overlapping but separate stories are fabulous.
037571457X|5.0|This is merely the memoir of a single young woman, but anyone interested in the real lives of real people in the Muslim world should check this out. Marjane Satrapi was born in Iran to a progressive and western-leaning family, and she was about ten years old when the fundamentalist revolution hit in 1979. With understated and minimalist artwork, Satrapi tells us about the revolution's destructive effects on Iranian society and how progressive families were persecuted under the very uneven ideology of the new demagogues. Here we see how the free-thinking young Marjane chafed under the strictures of the new religious regime; while her family faced many hardships that eventually inspired them to send her off to school in Europe (that aspect of her life story is the subject of this book's sequel). This memoir is very effectively told in the graphic strip format, and while some may deem Satrapi's artistic style to be simplistic or even amateurish, she is excellent at capturing body language and facial expressions, and that very same artistic simplicity makes this interesting life story even more compelling.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Watch this with a friend and let the conversations begin. Utterly facinating and the best thing Jake's done in my opinion. Great soundtrack, funny, scary, thought provoking and basically everything a movie should be.
B000687M48|3.0|If you're a fan, buy it.  Good setlist, some nice spruced-up live versions of the songs, good audio, good picture.  Having the MTV videos is certainly a major attraction.  The standout feature is the cover of Thoughtless.  At the very least, this is much better than a bootleg.   <br /> <br />Lots of flaws though.  The editor/director inserted a cut pretty much every two seconds, rendering the video nearly unwatchable. He should be banned for life from manipulating motion pictures of any kind.  You can last through one song without much problem, but getting through the whole concert like this is tough.  Before you start the show, have some dramamine at the ready to counter the impending motion sickness.  I suppose all these cuts are to quicken the pace, but that is a real departure from what most concert experiences are (standing or sitting in one place).   <br /> <br />Also, Amy Lee jumps around so much that it causes her singing to suffer.  If these were the Sex Pistols that wouldn't matter, but for Evanescence the killer voice is what makes or breaks it.  She should consider settling down a bit.  Her rocker-girl enthusiasm doesn't even seem genuine.  It's as though she does it because that's what people like to see (do they?).   <br /> <br />Last gripe, and a small one, is that she uses a backing track on certain songs when they should have just hired a backup singer.  With all the money invested in this band, you'd think the record company could get a 2nd voice on stage instead of going el-cheapo.   <br /> <br />Despite how grumpy my review sounds, I'm happy with the purchase and looking forward to the next album.  Buy it!
0743454537|3.0|I'm reading this book because one of my neighbors chose it for a book club we both belong to. I'm sure she chose it because of its serious subject. <br /> <br />The writer knows how to write a good book. You care about the characters. You care about the situation. I find myself thinking about this situation a great deal. In that way the book succeeds. <br /> <br />The problem is the ending. Which was both unfair to both characters and readers and totally unrealistic. For me, it takes a book that should have had 4 or 5 stars and pulls it down to a 3. I am also unlikely to ever read another book by this author. <br /> <br />Of course, when you think more deeply about the situation you begin to wonder if a hospital really would have ignored the ethics of the situation not just at the point when the younger child was going to be giving up a kidney, but earlier when she was put at risk of her life to give up blood marrow? There is the question of informed consent which no 6 year old can give. Wouldn't someone have stepped in years before the time of this story and provided an advocate for the child who's only reason for existence was to provide spare parts? One would hope the real health system is doing better than the one in this book.
B000E8N690|2.0|This movie was pretty disappointing, and certainly not worthy of the rave reviews it seems to be getting... Now, I'm not one of those people who will write negative rants about movies or actors just because they are popular or win awards... I'm also not writing mean or snappy things just to show how clever I am or how catty I can be, but rather because I sincerely am baffled by the acclaim this film has gotten, and wanted to drop in a few comments that I hope will be helpful.<br /><br />I'm writing this review as a fellow who's been listening to country music since the early '70s, who's written about it quite a bit, played it on the radio for over a decade and thought about it a lot. Johnny Cash is clearly one of country music's great iconic figures, and the story of his courtship with June Carter is a great love story.  No problem there... The trouble lies with the flatness and predictability, the blandness and utterly cliched nature of the storytelling -- everything is telegraphed from a mile away, all the characters and their relationships are thinly drawn and unremarkable, the dialogue is flat and the music fails to overpower or excite.  In short, there's little here that can overcome the difficulties presented by trying to portray such larger than life figures as the Cashes, and while there are little glimpses when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon look a little like the craggy, unglamorous Johnny and June, never for a moment do either of them project the true gravitas and solemnity of their roles.  Although there is some grand and purposeful cinematography, the film itself feels like it could just as easily have been an ABC after-school special from the '70s.  Seriously.  It's just a cinematically and intellectually weak, facile presentation, sadly unworthy of its subject.<br /><br />And then there are the little things -- for example, we see June Carter writing \\"Ring Of Fire\\" at some unspecified time (with co-composer Merle Kilgore nowhere in sight), but we never see the payoff, which is that the song became a collossal hit for Cash in '63.  Similarly, his move from Sun Records to Columbia -- one of the biggest decisions of his entire life -- is glossed over in a split-second image as part of a breezy visual montage.  Then there's the gratuitous insertion of would-be country rebel Shooter Jennings, playing the part of his father, Waylon Jennings, in a scene where Waylon and Johnny become roommates while down-and-out in Nashville.  It's kind of a cute in-joke, son playing the father and all that, except that Shooter doesn't look much like Waylon, and he *certainly* doesn't look like Waylon did in the mid-1960s, when the scene is supposed to take place: Jennings didn't have hippie hair and a beard back then.  He just didn't.  It's lame to present him otherwise.<br /><br />Finally... jeez, louise... couldn't the DVD producers even manage to spell Johnny Cash's daughter's name correctly in the subtitles????  Poor Rosanne!  Oh, well.  I guess the answer is, \\"it's only a movie.\\"  Can't take it too seriously, right?

B000055Y0Y|5.0|Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is an FBI agent who had bungled in his duty of protecting President Kennedy, and has never forgiven himself since. He is now much older, and makes a number of false moves in trying to protect the present President. He comes across as unfit for the job and comes close to getting suspended. Life is hard for poor old Horrigan. <br /> <br />Leary (John Malkovich) is an ex-FBI agent who had the misfortune of thwarting his partner's attempt to murder him on a direct FBI order. He now holds a grudge against the FBI for this incident, and plots to kill the President. <br /> <br />While we are aware of Leary's methodical planning, it is still suspenseful to see if Horrigan can figure it out. The movie is thrilling to watch and is never boring.
B000069AUI|5.0|I'm not much into mainstream bands except every now and then one will come along and sweep me away. Coldplay is definitely one of those bands! A Rush of Blood to the Head IS my favorite Coldplay, and probably has to do with all the soul-searching I did around the time I was really getting into it.  <br /> <br />Of the 11 tracks on this CD I have, I find that 10 of them are just amazing! The eleventh song (track 9 - A Whisper) I don't really care much for because I believe it doesn't flow well with the rest of the album. Altho, it's still a good song in it's own right.  <br /> <br />There's always a good hook in whatever song you're listening to. Vocals are emotionally convincing and not mellow-dramatic. You'll hear a lot of piano throughout the songs, which is a nice change from the norm. A lot of songs will just wash over you and give you a warm fuzzy feeling - very lush soundscapes.  <br /> <br />Pick it up...despite even if, by chance, it happens to be Matthew Perry's favorite band of 2003 :P  <br />

B0002B15XI|5.0|In this review I compare MASH with Catch-22, and then include a little plug for another funny, anti-war movie at the end which you may not have heard about that's worth seeing too.<br /><br />I'd never seen the original movie all the way through until I watched it for the first time last week, so for me this was truly a blast from the past. I was familiar with some of the funniest moments, such as the broadcast of Dr. Burns's and Hot Lips' little tete a tete, but had never actually seen it. Having watched the TV series, I was familiar with the concept, but the legendary original Altman flick that the series was based on was something I'd somehow missed.<br /><br />As a previous writer here said, it's really a series of four vignettes rather than a coherent movie with a real plot, and the whole movie is an irreverent, sacreligious, and anti-authoritarian and satirical spoof from beginning to end. In other words, it's a very funny movie perhaps lacking any redeeming qualities whatsoever except for that. :-)<br /><br />For me it was a bit of a shock to see all these actors 30 years younger, as I mostly knew them from their later work, such as Rene Aberjonois, who I mostly knew from Star Trek Deep Space Nine as the constable Shape Shifter. Gary Burghoff was the only member of the original cast who ended up in the TV series, and Donald Sutherland still looks the same. And I really only knew Bud Cort from his classic movie, Harold and Maude.<br /><br />I made the same comment to a friend about the movie, that it's reminiscent of Joseph Heller's Catch-22, but my friend, who's much more knowledgeable about movies than I, pointed out that they're really two very different flicks both in spirit and in content. Although both are ostensibly anti-war, Catch-22 is a much more cynical and dark movie which sees little good in human behavior and society and doesn't even hold forth the hope let alone the promise of something better. In that sense it's a truly nihilistic film.<br /><br />MASH is much more lighthearted and shows the characters trying to make the best of a horrible situation as they stumble through the trials and tribulations of the war with, as someone once said about Cary Grant, a sort of \\"goofy exasperatedness.\\" As one of the characters said, we're all basically crazy anyway, and in MASH that's how everyone keeps their sanity.<br /><br />So overall, if not a great movie, a great period piece that is still worth your time and money to rent it.<br /><br />Since we're on the subject of anti-war movies, I can't resist plugging another of my favorites, since it's a great flick and is much less known than the above two. This is The King of Hearts, a French film starring a very young looking Alan Bates and Genevieve Bujold, who are known the U.S., but the other main actors mostly aren't, although some people will remember Adolpho Celli as the heavy in Goldfinger, the James Bond film.<br /><br />As with MASH, the film is a darkly satiric comedy that pokes fun at the absurdity and futility of war. The main plot concerns a group of inmates from a local insane asylum who escape during the chaos and confusion into an abandoned French town, which sets the stage to ironically contrast the insanity of war brought by supposedly sane people with the harmless behavior of the supposedly insane inmates who are acting out the roles of normal town citizens. And yet it is the innocuous and inoffensive inmates who are caged and the supposedly sane people are making war.<br /><br />The inmates wander into the town and assume various roles, acting like typical citizens, from the barber to the mayor. The inmates do this so convincingly that the young corporal (played by Bates) who is sent to warn them of the approaching Germans at first doesn't realize they are escaped mental patients, which becomes a metaphor for the real question in the move, which is, who is really crazier: the inmates, or the \\"normal\\" people and soldiers fighting the war?<br /><br />Unfortunately, although he tries, Bates is unable to avert the confrontation between the British and German companies who march into town, and when the two contingents shoot it out (everyone is killed to the last man), the inmates realize the fun is over, that they don't belong in \\"sane society,\\" and it's time for them to go back to their former home in the asylum.<br /><br />As I said, I didn't know most of the cast, except for Adolpho Celi, Alan Bates, and Genevieve Bujold, but I thought all the performances were superb, especially Jean- Claude Brialy, who played the mayer, Pierre Brasseur, who played General Geranium, and the barber (unfortunately I don't recall his real name. As with the above two flicks,  it's a great movie and a brilliantly witty satire and stinging indictment of the futility and absurdity of war.ween the British and German companies who march into town, and when the two contingents shoot it out (everyone is killed to the last man), the inmates realize the fun is over, that they don't belong in \\"sane society,\\" and it's time for them to go back to their former home in the asylum.

015603008X|5.0|The feelings I had toward this book are based on a direct correlation of events. These events I believe to be the most direct, creating the largest overview of this science fiction novel.  <br />    Charlie Gordon of Flowers for Algernon is a fictional character, but through the techniques of author Daniel Keyes, Charlie comes alive as if he was a real person. <br />    With a mental disability, and an extremely low IQ of 68, Charlie would do anything to become smart. When scientists discovered a way to surgically enhance the knowledge of a human, Charlie reacted with great excitement. \\" I tryed the hardist becaus I reely wantd to lern I wantid it more even then pepul who are smarter even then me (Pg4).\\"  Charlie's hard work and dedication are easily seen by the reader, and people surrounding him in this novel. The positive attitude that was shown in his presence was an aspect that the scientists were looking for in a person to try the surgery on. Encouraged by Miss Kinnians, Charlie's teacher at the center for retarded adults, Charlie was seriously evaluated for this experiment.  <br />    Being part of this experiment, Charlie had to participate in tests that compared him to a mouse named Algernon, the only living specimen this surgery has been conducted on; Charlie became very frustrated with the results. \\"And the other ten times we did it over Algernon won every time because I couldnt find the right rows to get to where it says FINISH (pg8).\\" It was hard for him to comprehend how a mouse could have more knowledge then himself.  The realistic anger Charlie displayed allowed this book to seem very sensible. His emotions were described in a way that enabled his presence to be felt. This growing complexity of characteristics allowed a mystery behind him to be wondered. Charlie's actions were not predictable, and often the reader was struck with astonishment.   <br />    With the end result unknown, and the risk of survival at state, Charlie agreed to be a part of this experiment. Charlie agreed to document his every thought and action in progress reports. It was through these reports that I watched Charlie grow on paper. The book is written in Charlie's eyes, which is an advantage to display the exact way Charlie would think. As he struggles with his vocabulary, I also became familiar with the feeling of his mental disorder. Continuing on in the book, Charlie's sentence structure grows to the point of a genus.  <br />    Intertwined in these reports are very unpredictable flashbacks Charlie has from his childhood. It is incredible how familiar I became with Charlie; watching him grow, he no longer seems a character, but rather a person with whom I have formed a connection with. Reading these detailed flashbacks was very surprising and disturbing. The interactions Charlie has with characters throughout the book enables him to discover himself. \\"Afraid of passing Howlls Street where the gang use to tease me and push me around (pg 110). \\" Charlie sorts through memories of the past and finds himself very upset at where he is today. The beliefs about his family and the joyful feeling that comes when thinking about them is no longer true. Charlie has now come to realize that those close to him may no longer be trusted.  <br />    When the intelligence of Algernon begins to deteriorate, scientists begin to question Charlie's lasting intelligence. With the suspense growing as Algernon becomes deathly sick, Charlie's future is unpredictable. At this point the science fiction book no longer seemed unreal. Charlie, I now view as a friend, and this unpredictable ending made it impossible to stop turning the pages.  <br /> <br />

B000AADYYO|1.0|Let me start of by saying that the \\"kid\\" realy knows what he's talking about this band in a way has become a fad to listen to And they are not talentless but not very creative or talented musicaly live opeth is for lack of a better word \\"pathetic\\" most band have superior musicmanship .This band is not the best metal band out there in fact they rank amongst the worst ever even worse than 80s hair metal At least they could play guitar .As an excuse for how horrible and sad they are opeth plays lenthy songs And these newcomers to metal think that opeth is origanal and sophisticated well i have knews for you Opeth is anything but that .Alright ive finished dishing out the dirt for these pitiful losers ,now i will support my argument By stating some things which i hope will change your mind . <br />Listen to the guitar Closely And I Mean Closely it can be described as tuned up,Since the guitarist is also the lead singer when singing his guitar is completly off tune Also the guitar is about as heavy as any Emo band out there <br />Although the song are lenthy they lack origanality Some people might say they are breathtaking and amazing It's all been done before you need to read up on your history of metal ,if you continue to love and adore Opeth you are an ignorant fool  <br />The drums are slow and once in a while speed up and then die away nothing specail at all  <br />And finaly the thing that is most pitiful about this band is that they are trying to establish a persona of being frightning and scary , pretty lauphable if you ask me . <br />O i forgot to mention the lead singer is absoutley pitiful the occasional growling and snarling is just plain idiotic the scream is about as weak as a Screamo band ,and thats pretty sad  <br />In a nutshell opeth realy nothing more than a bunch of phonys 1 star i couldnt exagerate more dont buy this.
B0002DKCMG|4.0|I have to admit when I first saw this movie in theaters I couldn't stop laughing.  The movie reminds me of how far facht our Highschool perogitive on life were.  I can remember friends of mine talking about drinking worm wood or smoking weed in Holland.  But the main point I feel is how the movie relates to each one of us.  Maybe we as highschool graduates or alumni yet to come can't relate to drugs, drinking, travel, or even parting. But instead relate to adventure. The adventure of walking off the stage and going into the real world and trying to put some of the studies to the test. This is what makes Eurotrip so rememberal. <br />~jamesralex~
B000000WCA|5.0|The first real cd I ever got was \\"Spice\\" by the Spice Girls. You don't ever forget your first cd because it's just the start of your whole music taste. Although I have rather different taste now (see my other reviews), this cd just holds strong memories for me. From \\"Wannabe\\" to \\"2 Become 1,\\" all the way to \\"Mama\\" and other lesser known songs, this stuff never gets old. I can't find one bad track on this cd because it's all just amazing.  <br /> <br />Sure, it's not original, but the sound is more innocent than most \\"girl power\\" bands of today. These 5 girls are better role models than the Pussycat Dolls and other decrepid artists who call themselves \\"true to themselves\\". There's a lot of trash that little kids get exposed to and I wish the Spice Girls cds would make a comeback. Perhaps then the younger set would grow up listening to quality pop music, better than the likes of Ashlee Simpson. Even if they don't know the true meaning of some of the lyrics(2 Become 1's meaning never became apparant until a few years ago; little kids don't pick up on that stuff), none of it's blatantly raunchy like the R&B and (C)Rap songs of 50 Cent, etc. Listening to the Spice Girls makes me feel like a kid again, giddy and alive. So definitely, this music is worth it, much more than what is on the whole seen today.
0375507256|5.0|Every review I've read fails to do justice to the book's structure, so I'm not going to attempt my own explanation. <br /> <br />Some people may call Cloud Atlas \\"difficult,\\" but that's only because a few chapters -- including the first -- use prose that's either heavily stylized or pulled from past generations. It's clear Mitchell likes to explore the ways language changes as time moves forward, and if it requires an increased effort on the part of the reader to adapt to the book's shifts in language, the effort always pays off. <br /> <br />People have interpreted or picked up on a range of themes in Cloud Atlas, including the concept of reincarnation or feeling trapped in life. The thing that stuck with me was the overall theme of human nature -- every chapter reinforces the notion that people do horrible things to each other, and the book has some very dark moments, but there are times when the situations and dialogue are hilarious, and a kind of optimism boomerangs through the book like the stories do. <br /> <br />It's been more than a year since I've finished this book, and its ideas are still swimming around in my head. I've become a David Mitchell fan since Ghostwritten and number9dream, but as good as those books are, this is easily the best of the three.
B000000WFF|5.0|Much like \\"Spice\\", this music is poised, dance-y, and also defines my childhood. I was about 7 or 8 when this came out, and even though i was young, this music stuck with me. I really dislike what little kids have to listen to today because this stuff was amazing. It was carefree enough for the younger set, and even to this day, i still like it.    Although my music taste has changed overtime, i can't forget the Spice Girls. From \\"Spice Up Your Life\\" to \\"Viva Forever\\" (one of my all-time favorites) all the way up to \\"The Lady Is A Vamp\\" i love it all. Some highlights would include \\"Never Give Up On The Good Times\\" and \\"Too Much,\\" as well as the other songs I mentioned.    '90's music is a gem. This stuff should be advertised again for the next generation. I seriously think kids wouldn't grow up so fast if they listened to all of this. SPICE GIRLS FOR PRESIDENT.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I rented this movie knowing that it probably wouldn't be as well played out as the A&E version with Firth and Ehle because of the time frame, but even though, I was dissapointed. If I had never read the book or watched the A&E version, I would've been perfectly happy.  Because of the time frame, the story was so rushed that the little, but important, elements were left out and the romance didn't have a solid ground from which to bloom and grow.  One minute Elizabeth hated Mr. Darcy and then the next minute she loved him.  I was also dissapointed with the little screen time that Mr. Wickam got, whereas he was one of the pivotal characters in Elizabeth's view of Darcy and their romance, he was just another character. The characters themselves did not have enough depth, I was not convinced of Knightley's Elizabeth, Macfadyen's Darcy did not have depth rather he was two dimensional, Wickam was only on the screen for a few minutes to smile or frown, and Bingley became stupid. The one character who became real was Judi Dench's Lady Catherine, Dench just sparkled and was absolutely brilliant, unfortunately she got very little screen time.  The scenery in the movie though, was beautiful and well shot. Overall, if you have never read the book, this movie will be substantial and pleasant.  But if you want a movie that stays true to Jane Austen's book and spirit, I would recommend the A&E version. It brings it to life with breathtaking scenery and superb acting that brings each character to life.
1400079179|4.0|I am very conflicted about the book, mainly because Dan Brown uses a theory that has been proven false by reputable historians, and holds this theory up as truth. The idea that this underlying theory is true gives the book much of its gravitas that has elevated it to its best-selling status. That being said this is still a well written thriller that hooks you from the beginning and keeps you turning pages! And in spite of the false premise there is still plenty of history and classical art and architecture to keep it all interesting. My recommendation is read the book, but try and find a used copy--Dan Brown already has enough Money!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|When I first heard Sufjan Stevens it wasn't when I put Illinoise into my CD player, it was on an ipod during a long drive between Tempe, AZ and El Paso, TX.  The first 30 seconds of Chicago made me feel like music was being re-created through that stereo.  My first thought was that some one took Connor Oberst and told him to write emotional music for an older generation.  A sweet melodic sound on all tracks that any one could appreciate.  One of my favorite albums.

B000000W5L|5.0|This is the greatest album of all time, no question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is closely followed by Sticky Fingers, Beggars Banquet, Tatoo You, Some Girls, Let It Bleed, It's Only Rock'n Roll, Goats Head Soup in that order.  You just can't beat Exile though!!!!!!!!
B0009X75RO|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I bought the DVD as soon as it came out. I just can't believe it took me two years to realize that they had realeased a Razzle Dazzle Edition. I bought it as soon as I saw it. It has an interview with Chita Rivera, which I found interesting. I haven't gotten to view all of the features yet due to school, but I am thrilled with what I have seen. They have a Vh1 special (I missed the original airing because I refused to watch anything having to due with the movie until I saw it), they have rehearsals for the dance numbers, extended versions of the dance numbers, commentaries, and well...it says it all above in the product description. To sum up my review, this is a fantastic buy for fans of Chicago. I also recommend the book with all the lyrics and the script, as well as the history of the origins of the play. I still can't belive it's been out since 2003!

B00005J6T1|4.0|Mmmmmmmmmadonna. You never forget the early eightees (1982,1983) just before the Like a Virgin CD when she`s exploded into popheaven with here first album, just before the CD revolution with the Album Madonna:The first album. Simple earcandy popmusic to make youre day happy in \\"pleasentville \\". It kicks off with the funky and realy right to the point  Track 1 song Lucky star, and this has the most for you and the ghost, because she`s already there shows the great potensial how a good ear for how a hit song should sounds like. Track 2 Borderline, is more in the borderline country, with not so much to shout hurray for (there goes the 5 star, sorry to say). This is of course quality all over, but not up to Track 1 standard. Track 3 Burning Up, is more like a \\"flashdance\\" song, with it`s more rock and roll disco hybrid sound. It`s how disco should sound`s like and a potensial winner on the dancefloor. Very melodious to sum it up in a simple way. Track 4 I know it it`s more traditional, and is a minor let down. It`s very tiny, with an irritating saxophone in the background. Track 5. Well. Heeeeeeey. It`s time for a Holiday, and this one realy sparks and shines.<br /><br />A simple refrain, and gives hope for all happy shiny people out there. Holiday. A song to realy celebrate. In other words: A classic. The ultimate popsong. Track 6 Think of Me, is more in discoland once again, and it`s funky enough, but not a classic. It`s anyway cool enough. Track 7 Physical attraction. Well it`s once again in funky discoland, but doesn`t take off into pleasureland, but a good earfiller anyway. Track 8 Everybody, is a synthpop classic, with \\"teen pleasure\\", for the young at heart. It has a refrain which is effective, but not much more, sorry to say. This CD one is anyway earcandy from you ears. The remaster version has two new version of two of the hits. Ive have the original, and im courious why they put them in , but maybe theire would give you more values for the money.
0307276902|3.0|First of all I thought that this book was pretty good. I think what was more interesting was how people made it such a big deal through the media. This is a true story about a guy trying to destroy his addiction. Yes, some of the parts were altered but that wasn't the point of the book. The important thing was the message he tried to show people. This was suppose to effect people's emotions. He was uncovering the truth of addiction and how he fought it mentally and how physically hard it was to overcome some many obsticles. I give props for this guy for making it this far.
B000002KDZ|4.0|So what if they sound like a Santana clone.  That's not half bad, plus they formed at about the same time so they may be the original Latin hard rock group.  Unfortunately their catalog of music is about 1 cd long vs. Santana's multitude of music.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|This movie really strays away from the actually story of Titanic. IT is basically a porno with a small story line. Basically the two main characters sneak around various parts of the ship enjoying various moments of sexual pleasure. Eventually the man dies when the ship sinks and she won't let go of him in the water because all she wants is more sex. This movie really falls away from the true story of Titanic. It was disgusting and I do not recommend it.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|on an island is a smooth and mellow album with plenty of slow jams and relaxing solos. those who know pink floyd will find this sound is very similar, especially in songs like in the instrumental opener \\"castellorizon\\", the more upbeat \\"take a breath\\", and the guitar-filled \\"then i close my eyes\\". david gilmour has always been known for making music that makes you escape to another world. listening to on an island really gives you the feeling of being on an island. i am a huge fan of floyd and i fond myself listening to on an island more than any floyd album, and that is really saying something. i highly recommend on an island to any floyd/gilmour fans or anyone who loves music that is more mellow and with plenty of guitar.
B000031WD9|1.0|This is a terrible movie. I could barely sit through it. The most exciting part was when they showed nudity. I used it as a porno when I needed to masturbate. Overall do not buy, unless you need a low quality porno
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched the show a while back on netflix and didn't realize that I had skipped one whole disc, which left me a little confused. But after seeing the movie Serenity, I wanted to revisit the characters.  So I watched it again and was pleasantly suprise to find that there was a whole disc- 4 new episodes I hadn't seen! <br />Well anyway...the problem I had with the series before was that it didn't have enough time to develope a full story arc. It pains me that there was so much great material that didn't have time to go anywhere- like the 2 by 2 blue gloves... So I wasn't able to get into it as much as Buffy or Angel or Lost or anything with an arc.  But I think the movie supplied more of the arc for me and watching it again, i was able to see how character driven it was and how much I absolutely loved the characters.  I'm so sad that we'll never know the full potential it could of been.  The same way we'll never know what Joss could of done with Elyria on Angel if he could of had the chance...I HATE THE STUPID NETWORKS AND STUPID HOLLYWOOD WHO PUSH MICHAEL BAY MOVIES BUT DON'T KNOW GENIUS WHEN THEY SEE IT.  AND WHY IS CHARMED ON FOR 7 SEASONS???? WHY IS THAT OUTLASTING WHEDONVERSE?? AHHHH.  Well I guess some of the blame goes to the stupid viewers who pay money to see the stupid spoonfed stuff.  Okay I'm not bitter...
067088278X|4.0|This is a cute book that has a great deal going for it.  First it has wonderful, sweet  artwork  -- though the one reviewer is correct, there are guns pictured on several pages.  Then there are the fairytale characters (Tom Thumb, Mother Hubbard, Cinderella, 3 Bears, Baby Bunting, Bo-Peep, Jack and Jill, a Wicked Witch, and Robin Hood), and the I-spy aspect which children tend to love.<br /><br />Certainly my just turned 4 year-old son and nearly 6 year-old daughter like this book and they haven't tired of looking for the characters yet.<br /><br />One of the things I like is that there are some `tricks' to the spying.  You don't see all of Mother Hubbard for example.  You see her from behind, partially hidden.  Similarly you see Cinderella's arm with a dust brush, not all of her until the next page.<br /><br />The following is an example of the rhymes:<br /><br />Mother Hubbard down the cellar<br /><br />I spy Cinderella.<br /><br />Cinderella on the stairs<br /><br />I spy the Three Bears<br /><br />Bo-Peep up the hill<br /><br />I spy Jack and Jill<br /><br />Four Stars.  Good art.  Good fun.
0345363132|5.0|I bought this book a few months ago, and kept putting off reading it because it is *very* long.  But I picked it up about a week ago, after hearing a lot of people on one of my bookgroups talk about it.  And with good reason- I truly loved reading this book. <br /> <br />It's long, yes, and not exactly quick reading.  But Penman, as always, manages to pull you into her world so convincingly that you really feel as though you understand Medieval England's political situation.  I finished the book late last night and today, in spare moments, I find myself mulling over the fickle nature of history, which is always written by the victors, and wondering just how factual our history lessons might be.  Penman almost overnight made me a staunch fan of RIII. <br /> <br />Richard III is portrayed as a loyal, idealistic man who adored his elder brother the king and was greatly shaken when he learned Edward had feet of clay.  His family, friends, and enemies all come animatedly to life, but Richard (IMO) steals the show. <br /> <br />This is a gripping read that pulls you immediately in- I was sniffling almost non-stop through the last hundred pages.  Highly recommended if you are a historical fiction fan.  I also recommend SKP's Welsh Trilogy, starting with Here be Dragons.

0312340958|4.0|Karen Armstrong has written a compelling memoir of her time in the convent in formation to become a nun.  She wants this life so badly that she will forsake everything, including her own mind, to attain a perfect relationship with God.  This is what she was told she must do.  She did this despite gut feelings to the contrary, despite physical illness, and despite slowly dying inside.  In fact, she believed this was a sign of progress.<br /><br />The cruelty of her superiors, whether intentional or not, truly shocked me, even in the era before Vatican II reforms.  That someone is put in such supreme authority over others (the superiors are seen as direct agents of God, to be obeyed no matter what) is just inviting abuse, even if the superiors believe they are acting correctly.  The austerity of the order (which is not named) also seemed misguided.  By denying themselves friendships, intellect, and enjoyment of God's creation, they seemed to be missing the whole point of a relationship with God.<br /><br />As someone who was raised Catholic, I found this a very eye-opening tale.  I do hope that the sort of abuse Ms. Armstrong suffered is the exception rather than the rule in religious life.  And I'm amazed that she came out of her experience without more bitterness.  But her story reminds all of us that blind faith in any human authority figure is very dangerous indeed.
B000683VI4|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, but loved the book! The actors were perfect for the parts, from the time they met to the end of the movie. I would suggest that you see the movie first and then read the book.
0316172324|2.0|My gut feeling after reading a few pages was that I shouldn't waste my time by reading this book. I still did. My gut feeling was right - I found the book quite noninteresting and repetitive save for a few passages.
B0000VD04M|5.0|ED WOOD is a fascinating film in regards that a truly talented and original filmmaker such as Tim Burton would choose such an inept - yet optimistic - subject such as Edward D Wood Jnr and turn him into a viable celluloid-biography. <br /> <br />This is by far Burton's best work. Shot in crisp black and white, this has actors turning in career best performances. Johnny Depp is perfect as the infamously terrible filmmaker, redeemed only by his will and optimism and an iron ignorance of his own failures. Despite this, Depp's Ed Wood is so likeable that we root for him and his quest for his ever elusive `success'. <br /> <br />Bill Murray is nearly unrecognizable as the very neurotic and festive Bunny Breckinridge. This is the best performance I have seen him in, and does more to support the theory of Murray as a substantial actor as well as a celebrated comedy actor. However, the film belongs to Martin Landau, as his mirrored Lugosi is at times sad, bitter, pathetic, and heartwarming (at first, he sees Wood as nothing more than a harmless idiot, but later relies on Wood and cohorts as his only friends). <br /> <br />Wood's other friends include The Amazing Criswell, played energetically by Jeffrey Jones, and the sulking Vampira, played by Lisa Marie (her waist is literally 6 inches wide!). And last but not least the hairiest Swede ever known, Tor Johnson, played by George `The Animal' Steele. <br /> <br />If these guys were around today they would be the coolest gang on the planet, if not the most talked about! <br /> <br />My favourite scene is when Wood meets Orson Welle's in the smoke-filled bar. One of the greatest talents ever in the history of movies meets Orson Welles! <br />
B00005JOE8|5.0|\\"V For Vendetta\\" was originally a graphic novel illustrated by David Lloyd and written by Alan Moore, who became famous from the great \\"Watchmen\\" series and may be known to movie goers for \\"From Hell,\\" and \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,\\" neither of which were the best-executed or successful of film adaptations. <br /> <br />\\"V For Vendetta\\" gets it right this time, for sure. I don't like it as much as \\"Sin City,\\" but I also don't think it's fair to make that comparison seriously - the two works/movies succeed on different levels and have different objectives. <br /> <br />Also, I can say right off the bat, this movie is not going to please all fans of \\"V.\\" The look is somewhat different and some of the character traits and subplots are gone. But in my opinion, it doesn't hurt it. But there will be acrimonious debate. Oh yes, there will be. <br /> <br />Like most comic book/graphic novels and their accompanying movies, \\"V\\" brings a wonderfully epic feeling by interspersing larger-than-life goals, scenarios, and characters with the more intimate, personal, and emotional aspect of human life. Instead of \\"wonderfully epic\\" some critics might suggest \\"overblown melodrama.\\" I do not agree, but to each their own. <br /> <br />The United Kingdom of the \\"future\\" (no surprise or problem this was different) is under the control of a dystopian, Orwellian government. It is a world sorely in need of a hero. On Guy Fawkes Day, such a hero arrives. A masked freedom fighter (or \\"terrorist,\\" whichever you choose) blows up Parliament in an act of rebellion. But there is more to it than that, something that has deep ties to the corrupt totalitarian government, how they achieved power, and the dark history of those involved. Something that demands vengeance. Along the way V saves Evey, the requisite Mysterious Beautiful Girl with the Mysterious Past. However, \\"V For Vendetta\\" was written before these things became such tired conventions, so I'm forgiving in this instance, and furthermore it still works to this day when handled correctly, as it does here. But this is all the plot I want to give, the rest should come as a surprise to those of you who have not read the original work. Needless to say the stakes rise faster than maybe even the irrepressible and Byronic V can keep up with, and Evey will have a lot to find out about the both of them. That should be enough to entice the casual review reader.  <br /> <br />The acting is very good. Hugo Weaving plays a not-unfamiliar comic book/anime type hero that could be easily and unintentionally hammed up. He does not. I am actually not a big fan of his at all, but I have to give the man his due - he shows us what a fan of the graphic novel series expects to be shown, in most of the important facets. <br /> <br />Some people have expressed discontent because Natalie Portman is \\"too high profile\\" or \\"not British\\" or because they just plain don't like her. As with Weaving, I wasn't really a fan coming into this movie. Roles like Evey's are pretty meaty and easy to look good in. However, Portman did more than I expected with the role, which is saying something because I was expecting a lot and ready to write a snarky little review trashing her performance. Instead, I have to eat my words of a few days ago - \\"I think there were better choices for Evey.\\" Whoops. Looking at the job she did, I'm dubious now. Even as a Portman detractor, I have to say, she's forging an interesting body of work that may soon begin to silence her critics. <br /> <br />I like Stephen Rea in virtually everything I see him in and this is no exception. The man is one of the most talented supporting actors of the day. <br /> <br />The rest of the supporting cast was fine but of course these three jumped out at me. <br /> <br />The cinematography was indeed flashy, as you'd expect. I refuse to draw comparisons to certain other movies, and while I'm not usually a fan of the all-out style of these other movies that have been relentlessly parodied, there are some very well-done and exciting scenes, with an eye toward a more leisurely (and interesting) pacing than you might expect from a movie such as this. As I said above, the look of Alan Moore's world is not well captured, and that's my biggest mark against the movie, but the filmmakers have their own style, and it is not a bad one. <br /> <br />Lastly, I am surprised at some of the angst expressed that \\"V For Vendetta\\" promotes, justifies, and glorifies terrorism, particularly as viewed in a modern context. \\"V For Vendetta\\" was started back in 1981. Whatever broader themes or messages people may think the movie touches on in lieu of the media firestorm over Middle Eastern terrorism and scorn heaped on movies like \\"Valley of the Wolves,\\" I rather think the vast majority of them are brought to the table by the viewer's interpretation or bias, not by the filmmakers. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone reading these reviews and fans of graphic novels and comics. It's a great ride.
B00004T9VY|5.0|I am not going to \\"hype\\" this recording because it doesn't need hype what it does need, however, is the hope that are really serious about purchasing this great piece of music. This is clearly a standout of the time as well as a standout in the time we are in now. It's timeless music because it delves with timeless issues. I originally bought it because my friend does a pretty great cover of \\"Father and Son\\" and through repeated listenings to the song it really made me want to extend my heart to my own father instead of just closing myself off to him. I'm not going to go overboard into explanation about each song because I am hoping that you'll just buy it and more importantly listen to its beauty, its depth, and its bittersweet melodies about a life that just wants to be lived out.<br /><br />Live your life out with the help of this CD.<br /><br />Peace & Blessings.
B0000A7W14|5.0|Despite what some people might think, Boyz N The Hood is in no way a film that glorifies a gangsta lifestyle.  It is a hard hitting look at growing up in the hood as a young black male in America.  I would challenge anyone to watch this film and not be emotionally moved by the events particularly at the end of the movie.<br /><br />This was John Singleton's first film as a director and it is hard to believe that a then 22 year old could write such a powerful script.  Every actor plays their part and you can empathise with all of them, Cuba gooding Jr is superb as Tre Styles, a troubled boy who is sent to live with his strict father Furious (Lawrence Fishburne).  Furious is also played excellently by Fishburne, despite appearing as strict, he keeps Tre on the right path and as a 17 year old Tre is a mature and well rounded individual.  Tre's friends are brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) & Ricky (Morris Chestnut), two very different people, Ricky like Tre is an aspiring college student, while Doughboy is fresh out of jail, and looked down upon by his mother.  The script is so well written that even a character like Doughboy can be sympathised with, though he appears agressive and trigger happy on the surface, he is also loyal and caring to his friends.  It is the depth of all the characters, and several superb acting performances that make the film so great.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any plot details for those who haven't seen it, but the film is really tragic in the end, and is a realistic take on life in the hood in South Central.  I don't care where your from or what colour your skin is, you can enjoy and be moved by this film, a true masterpiece
B00008LOS1|5.0|How does one define classic? If I had to take a stab at it, something tells me this album would be somewhere intertwined in the definition. Not to call myself the greatest who fan (I only possess leeds and next), I still can recognize a classic when I see it, and this album most certainly qualifies. <br /> <br />For years, I had planned to invest in this album, knowing Baba O'Riley from the radio and thinking that I had maybe heard some of the others (as it turned out, I had heard just about all of them). However, I put it off and made excuses until, one day, I stumbled upon this magnificent set. I had no $$ to purchase it (I was younger), and instead borrowed the original CD, without any bonus tracks, from a friend. The album passed the test, and eventually, I gathered cash and bought this for a fair price of just around $30. <br /> <br />To say the least, I am blown away by the set as a whole. Every song is a classic, so why do a song by song review- Baba O'Riley, Bargain, The Song Is Over, Behind Blue Eyes, Won't Get Fooled Again...these are all songs that will forever be radio favorites, as well as classics. Love Ain't For Keeping is one of the greatest short songs I've ever laid ears on, My Wife is a great song from John Entwistle, and Getting In Tune and Going Mobile are fantastic tunes as well. The format brings the songs together as nine pieces to form one of rock's most classic albums. <br /> <br />As if this weren't enough, the collection offers several bonus tracks, including alternate takes of Getting In Tune, Love Ain't For Keeping, Behind Blue Eyes and Won't Get Fooled Again, the original version of Pure And Easy, and the Lifehouse track Baby Don't You Do It. These tracks were all from an earlier session at the New York Record Plant Studios. <br /> <br />The booklet is fantastic, and offers an in-depth look at the doomed Lifehouse sessions that would become the successful Who's Next Sessions, with an essay by Pete Townsend himself, and one by John Atkins, all laced with beautifully restored photos. As you read about the stories of the Young Vic Theatre, you can experience the extraordinary show on Disc Two of the set. The booklet then completes by offering track notes for every song on the set. <br /> <br />So, for $30, you get: The classic album, all nine tracks beautifully mastered, New York Record Plant Studios tracks, remixed including two previously unreleased tracks, and The Young Vic Theatre show, straight from the Rolling Stones' Mobile Unit to your ears, all tracks but two previously unreleased, and a highly informative booklet, all packaged in a deluxe digipack and compacted in a slip sleeve. For all that, with a total of over 3 1/2 hours of music, this might be the best $30 I've ever spent. <br /> <br />To conclude: If you haven't already, buy this album. If you have the original or extended jewel cases, scrap them and buy this incredible set: its rare that a classic is born, and double rare that its packaged this beautifully. <br /> <br />5/5

B00005NB0H|5.0|The original The Who- Live At Leeds, as most fans know, was designed with the intention of beating out the bootlegs of live Who that had been travelling around the globe. Packaged as an \\"official bootleg\\" with a cardboard cover and fun Who tidbits inside, the album contained only six songs- Young Man Blues, Substitute, Summertime Blues, Shakin' All Over, My Generation, and Magic Bus. These songs showed The Who at their rawest as the great rock band that they are, and was considered by many to be one of the greatest rock albums ever. <br /> <br />Fast forward to the days of CDs, and you come across the reissued Leeds, with an added seven songs to the total, giving us the first act of that legendary night. That album itself deserves a 5/5, as the songs are all incredible, and stands good on its own. <br /> <br />Now, however, we finally have it- the definitive Live At Leeds. The show has been remastered and extended into its full form, with the complete performance of Tommy as the second set from the show, as well as the second disc of this set. <br /> <br />The music is, needless to say, spectacular. Disc One is an amazing representation of The Who's sheer live energy, with songs like Heaven And Hell, I Can't Explain, Tattoo, Young Man Blues, Substitute, The 15-Minute framework that is My Generation, and the live-favorite A Quick One, While He's Away. Those are only some of the highlights from the perfect disc one, with the rest all adding up to a wonderful experience. <br /> <br />Disc Two's Tommy, while not as accessible as Disc One, is truly something to behold. With singles staples like Pinball Wizard, Sally Simpson, I'm Free and We're Not Gonna Take It interweaved with the insanity that is Tommy, we the listeners are treated to the delightful insanity of The Who as they crank out the best performance of Tommy ever, according to fans all over and this booklet. <br /> <br />The packaging only adds to the experience, with an informative booklet packed with liner notes, essays, and crammed with photos. Pictured on the inside of the deluxe package are all the assorted goodies that game with the original record of Leeds, including photos and funny little lists and tidbits. The package itself is a deluxe digipack that comes in a little plastic slipsleeve. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd say the amazing music, totalling almost 2 1/2 hours, as well as the beautiful layout of the package, makes this classic live rock album, one of the best, even better, as we are presented with the show that made The Who legendary.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This is partly a response to a one star review that I recently read.  On this review, it says \\"One knows already who the culprit is.\\"  Is this a negative aspect to the movie?  The point of movies like this (see also Syriana) is not to hide the identity of the culprit until the end, whereupon the story takes a rediculous twist and we find out something shocking.  Of course we already know who the culprit is, just like we know who the culprit is in Syriana.  The questions these movies ask are: What are you going to do about it?  What can we do about it?  Can we do anything?  Are you willing to stick your neck out to save innocent people?  These movies are confusing at times, but so is life, and that is the mood these films try to achieve.  That being said, this is one of the most well put together films this year.  And, honestly, is Ralph Fiennes ever bad in any film?  Even in the Avengers, Fiennes gives it his all.  No matter what film it is, whether it be the Best Picture winner The English Patient, or the wonderful Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Fiennes is always acting at 110%.  Weisz, after the disappointing Constantine, gives the best performance of her career (aparently the Academy thought so as well) and she far outshines any other supporting actress, with the exception of the rivaled Amy Adams in Junebug.  The film also shows great supporting roles such as Danny Huston and Bill Nighy.  Fernando Meirelles directs superbly and does a wonderful adaptation of the John Le Carre novel.
B000002GY9|5.0|I believe that this may be his best album period, but that all depends on the mood. This album has (like most of his old stuff) an emphasis on piano, but also has some of the best lyrics in his career. The album shifts from heartbroken to silly to vulgar to drunk, but it all blends perfectly. I also love his early work for the jazzy stand up bass he uses and i'm practically in love with his voice. I love that someone with such a rough sounding bar voice can truely capture a love song and all the while sound as though he is on his last breath. Basically i cannot find a single flaw with this album and i see not only this album, but Tom Waits in general as incredibly undercredited by all standards. For the amount of material he has released, and the extent of his talent, i am literally amazed that so few people listen to his music. So go and buy Tom Waits Small Change, and you wont regret it.
B000AP04FG|1.0|The recent hype about Brad and Angelina started partly because of their sexy roles in this film, but I saw absolutely no chemistry between the two of them in this movie.  Some stars just don't work well together.  They seem to be in this movie for themselves rather than to make it a good film.  The constant, and really stupid, bickering between the two spouses gets old real fast and has been used in dozens of movies before.  In this movie, I don't understand how they don't find out each other's actual profession.  The action sequences are somewhat impressive, but are pulled down with the rest of the film because of the stupid marital jokes that occur in every scene and ruin the excitement.  My mother told me after watching this, \\"You just don't know what it's like to be married.\\"  Maybe I don't, but there are other movies that pull the bickering spouses routine off.  This movie kept trying to be funny, then action packed, then funny, then action packed while trying to be funny.  Please pick one.  The only reason this movie gets a star is for Vince Vaughn.  Vince Vaughn is becoming a promising actor, and his scenes, while short, are really funny.  The rest of the movie is just an overly hyped, unfunny, terribly acted piece of garbage that only made money because of the stirred up controversy between the two leads.  It would be Spy vs. Spy if they were married.

B000001YOW|3.0|I'd say this is really more deserving of 3.5 stars.  My Porcupine Tree listening started with Deadwing and since, I've worked my way backwards through their stuff.  Better tracks on this are Signify, Sever, Waiting Phase I, and Dark Matter.  Bottom line is that Steven Wilson is a great songwriter and it's really hard to go wrong with a Porcupine Tree album.
020530902X|5.0|I discovered The Elements of Style as an undergraduate student. By the time I entered university my writing style was already clear: the guidance provided by this book made it clearer. I credit my application of the directions contained in The Elements of Style with a consistent half to a full grade improvement in my university course results (that's about 5 to 10 marks). Now that I work as a lecturer, I recommend it to all my students.<br /><br />The Elements of Style is succinct - fewer than 150 pages. Yet, in its limited space it manages to provide a wealth of good advice, and examples to illustrate how that advice, when taken, improves writing.<br /><br />Do not feel that you have to read this book cover to cover. Instead, start with the section on Words and Expressions Commonly Misused. Even some very good writers make the mistakes illustrated in that section. After this, try Chapter 2 on principles of composition, which lays out clear and simple rules that anyone can follow to improve their writing. Make sure you read Chapter 1 as well: the other chapters you can take or leave as you choose.<br /><br />One strategy I find very helpful is to use the Find function in Microsoft Word to search drafts of my writing for aspects that the Elements highlights as troublesome. From there, I try to eliminate or rework the problem areas. Try this for yourself, it is a good way to get the most from the book.

Just waiting for her to put something new out!

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I, too, was pretty p'd over the constant delays of this DVD, once again trotting out my fuzzy VHS tape to hold me over just a few weeks ago. Then I got my new copy of Guitar World magazine in the mail with David Gilmour on the cover. In the interview, he states that the delay initially had to do with the amount of time it was taking to make a high-quality DVD out of an old video tape recording. When the delay began pushing the release into early '06, it was Dave himself who decided to push it up to September so as to stay out of the way of his new solo album and tour. So.....as much as we all wanted to blame (and get mad at) everybody from PF management to EMI records, it was the Chief himself who put this one on hold for awhile longer. Still, an awesome show, and well worth waiting for. Again.
B00006I53S|5.0|I took this lens on a trip to S.America and Antarctica. The stock lens just felt a little inadequate for what I hoped to accomplish, and I did not want to carry a photo bag everywhere. The shots I took allowed for substantial leeway using RAW image to essentially crop and blow up most images as if I were carrying a 200mm lens; and with no manipulation, the photos were exqusitely sharp. On one photo of a landfall with moon overhead, shot at f/3.5 with a 1/30 shutter, I got details of the moon's surface. So the IS system really capable of doing what publicity says.

1400062071|5.0|Five Stars!! Spinning off of the theme of life in small town northern New England, Elizabeth Strout conjures up another winner of a novel detailing the inner most feellngs of the human condition and inter-personal relationships, buffeted by duty, change, and tragedy. Much like the preceding novel, \\"Amy and Isabelle\\", set in a different fictional New England town, this is MESMERIZING writing.     We already know from the editorial reviews that this novel is heading towards some sort of a surprise near the end, but in getting there Ms Strout's prose makes us want this journey to continue much longer! Considering the prosaic subject matter, the life of small town preacher Tyler Caskey, and his family, friends, parishioners, and gossipy townsfolk, she conjures up one heck of a fictional ride. Tyler, whose center of gravity balances between God's word and layman philosophers. Ms Strout effectively draws us in and keeps us beguiled with her rich cast of characters, her 'attention to detail' (Connie's hair, for instance; the minister's old shirt; or the effects of fall weather) and her elegant, stark prose, peppered with down-home phrases like \\"skitter-skatter\\". By the time Connie Hatch steps into the forefront, this novel is riveting in it's intensity and beauty. The church congregation scene is flat out wonderful writing, as are the final scenes between Tyler and George.     I guessed at a different ending, but Ms Strout is firmly in control and takes us where her compass wants us to be and it's a wonderful ending. This is a great fictional study in small town complexities and humanity. And she leaves us wanting more! Highly Recommended. Five Wonderful Stars!!    (Note: I found the Fournier typeface to be very elegant and readable. This review is based on an unabridged digital download, which makes digital disc a great new home storage alternative for novels. Thank you, Random House!)
B000002MUQ|4.0|Balance...according to me the best post-David Lee Roth Van Halen effort. I would even go to say that this is their best record on 3 days out of a week, the other competitior being their self-titled debut album. <br /> <br />Edie Van Halen as usual, is the linchpin in this enormous effort from a band that became extremely popular in the late 70's and early 80's. Edie Van Halen is proabably every new guitarist's idol and every semi-seasoned guitarists worst nightmare! Pioneering a different kind of sound, with his blazing fast solos and trademark two-handed finger tapping, Edie Van Halen undoubetdly is one of the most talented guitarists around, still rocking hard as ever; a lot of guitarists nevertheless having tried (and some shamelessly succeeding to a certain extent) to copy his style and endorsing it as their own. Rumour has it that Edie was so bothered by this, that whenever he had to play a lead, he would turn his back to the crowd, lest anyone see how he was playing! <br /> <br />Van Halen as a band, has over the years transformed from a fun-loving college-girl-boy pleasing outfit to a more serious and mature band. Although 'For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge' still showed slight strains of happy-go-lucky (still superb rock) endorsements, 'Balance' comes across as a more serious effort...and the resulting sound is a clear cut above contemporary hard rock...a lot of it courtesy Edie's guitar playing sklls. <br /> <br />Balance contains some of the finest riffs Edie has ever come up with, although songs like 'Ain't talkin' 'bout love', 'Panama', 'Jump' and the famous and path-breaking 'Eruption' have memorable leads and patches, that are still considered second to none. <br /> <br />The first track, 'The Seventh Seal' has a riff almost like a sonic boomerang. A sound and tone effect never heard before, Edie sets agenda for a different kind of guitaring, one that is quite different from his accomplished style of pelting out riffs.  <br />Similar gargantuan riff sections follow in 'Don't tell me what love can do' and 'Aftershock', all powerful numbers that can easily rock an entire stadium. <br />The piece de resistance of Edie's guitaring is unearthed in the absolutely amazing 'Feelin', which features a blazing fast solo and some sizzling finger tapping combined with beating riffs. <br />A taste of the broken style riff of 'Ain't talkin' 'bout love' can be heard on 'Amsterdam', another super riff-based track, which towards the end, is as much as a sonic kaleidoscope. The heaviest, or rather fastest Van Halen song ever, would have to undeniably be 'Big Fat Money'. And what a way to start the song, absolutely head banging stuff with definitive Edie riffing. Super rocking song. <br /> <br />A couple of love and soft rock songs come in the form of 'Can't stop loving you', 'Not Enough' and 'Take me back(deja vu), the latter having some beautiful acoustic accompaniment. <br />Instrumental manifestations appear in the form of the stringy 'Strung Out', which is a lot of fretwork I think, the royal 'Baluchitherium' (almost sounds like a Satch creation) and the percussion oriented 'Doin' Time'. <br /> <br />Die hard David Lee Roth fans might have to get used to the harsh vocals of Sammy Hagar, which is a far cry from the ways of Roth. Still, Sammy does a decent enough job, maybe sounding a bit too harsh sometimes, but nevertheless nothing incongruent to the music of the band as a whole. Anyways it won't take long to realise why this album rocks big time...and you'll have to thank Edie for that. Nothign Erupts like 'Ain't talkin' 'bout love, but there's pretty a punch to leave you with a feelin' of after shock. <br /> <br />Top Picks: (In case you're making a best of collection) <br />Seventh Seal, Aftershock, Amsterdam, Don't tell me, Baluchitherium, Big Fat Money, Deja Vu and Feelin'.

B00003CXRM|5.0|no matter what you think of the cohen brothers' movies ( FARGO,BLOOD SIMPLE,RAISING ARIZONA,BARTON FINK, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY)  you have to admit theire originality and genius, not to mention theire uniqueness. OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU is loosley based on one of the oldest stories ever recorded by man THE ODDYSSY BY HOMER. instead of odysseus trying his best to return to his wife in ithica greece, george clooney plays ulysses everret mcgill, an escapee from a chain gang in 1930,s misissippi who with 2 friends is doing his best to get to his wife who has divorced him to try and get back together again. clooney is witty ,fuuny and just about as great as youll ever see him. listen to his dialogue as he wisecracks his way through the film and youll just find yourself laughing out loud. the photography is outstanding and has a sureal quality to it. the soundtrack is early american folk gospel and country and its just great to listen to. john turturo and john goodman are the usual cohen regulars. john goodman is outstanding as a parable to the cylops in the original oddyssy. just as in the original oddyssy there are sirens, strange caracters and a mysterious blind man who predicts theire future. great music,great photography and an oddbeat funny film with outstanding acting and dialogue. the cohen brothers are if anything always unique

B000002LUB|5.0|Welcome to riff-land. <br /> <br />Dehumanizer...what an album! <br />Tony Iommi is probably at his best (post-Ozzy era of course). Ronnie James Dio (vocals) has sung with tremendous power and foreboding zest in ominous tracks such as 'Letters From Earth', 'Buried Alive' and 'Too Late'. <br /> <br />The album opens with a classic (the video is cool too- difficult catching it now considering the consistent airplay the likes of 'Vengaboys' and 'Maca-re-na' get on MTV and Channel V) number, 'TV crimes'- Fast, hitting, with Iommi and Ronnie on the warpath and their tirade against the effect of television on youth and preachers that are soaking up satellite waves. There's a bit of 'technology leading a life of its own and reigning supreme over the human soul' too somewhere. <br /> <br />Computer God- <br />\\"... <br />Waiting for the revolution <br />New clear vision - genocide <br />Computerize god - it's the new religion <br />Program the brain - not the heartbeat <br /> <br />Onward all you crystal soldiers <br />Touch tomorrow - energize <br />Digital dreams <br />And you're the next correction <br />Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeah <br />...\\" <br /> <br />TV Crimes- <br />\\"... <br />Holy father, holy ghost <br />Who's the one who pays the most <br />Rock the cradle don't you cry <br />Buy another lullaby <br /> <br />Jack is nimble, Jack is quick <br />Pick your pocket, turn a trick <br />Slow and steady, he's got time <br />To commit another TV crime <br />TV crime <br />...\\" <br /> <br />Brilliant! <br /> <br />Their fixation with the ill effect of machines and technology is so evident in the numbers 'Computer God' and 'Time Machine', another classic post-Ozzy Sabbath offering. Computer God has a cool riff to start with- Very innovative with slight changes followed by a delicate run.  <br />'Master of Insanity' is like sealing side-A with duct tape...thin, binding and refining the edges. <br /> <br />'Sins of the Father' has some cool chord progressions and riffs. Iommi steals the spotlight again in yet another crazy, demonic lead that binds the song tight. <br /> <br />'Too Late' is a pretty slow number, but showcases Ronnie's range to sing ballad-like numbers with the same sincerity and then build up to a mesmerizing crescendo, with the power chords marching in one step at a time, hand in hand with resonating tremolos and pungent accentuations in the lead. <br /> <br />'I' is a bit of a stretched number, but fits in perfectly as part of the ensemble. Power chord guitar enthusiasts sure can find a lot of progressions in this track, that are worth exploring. Don't blame me if you burn the tips of your fingers though! <br />'Buried Alive' is direct assault to your tympana, but then that makes it even better... <br /> <br />I like this album more than 'Cross Purposes' or 'Sabbath Stones'. Geezer Butler again proves that he is one of the finest bass players in heavy metal, along with Bob Daisy and Mike Inez who have lent their talent to Ozzy Osbourne more than once. <br /> <br />If you're a metal fan and truly appreciate pungent leads, thundering drums (check out Vinny Appice) and ominous intros, go for this...dehumanize yourself. <br />Even die-hard Ozzy fans (like me) will accept the wizardry of this album.
B000E5N62U|2.0|<br /> <br />Dear Donald, .......we waited SO long for the follow-up to \\"Kamikiriad\\", and after 2 excellently craftes solo albums, we had no reason to think you wuold run uot of steam--you did!!!What a strange affair this \\"Morph\\" is!!Where , oh where are the catchy songs & tunes that have delighted us ALL so much , ever since hearing \\"Can't buy a Thrill\\" so long ago!!? <br />             I listened expectantly , to all these NEW songs,too..... however only  track 2 excited me!!!The guitar, what there is of it on this 3rd. solo album, is truly inspired!!!But that insipid/insistent back-beat of Bass has now become tiresome!!! <br />One LONGS for the kind of instrumentation/real musicians , that the original Steely Dan were so famous for!!!!!The songwriting material of \\"Nightfly\\" & \\"Kami\\" was undeniably stronger than the songs exposed here, also Fagen's vocals really don't cut thru' the mixing desk like the old days, either!! <br />I hate to say this, but a lot of this new album i found genuinely boring, and that is from a true life-time devotee of the fabulous DAN, and all things Fagen!!! <br />Yes, it's not a bad album, but put righr next to the previous 2 gems, to me this album  is something of a turkey!! \\"H Gang\\" , track 2 , is definitely a CLASSIC, also \\"What i do\\" was  good, too.....the rest just didn't move me that much , it's kinda old-ground re-covered!!Donald , i LOVE you & your music , but this time around, think i'll take a rain-check!!!Here's truly hoping you continue to write greaat songs the next time around!!!! <br />This album's STILL better than most of the cannon-fodder that passes for 'music' , these days....but for you, Donald, ..you need to re-focus & bring back that Boston Rag!!!!!
B000E33VWW|4.0|I went to see this movie not knowing the story of Truman Capote, I found it to be very interesting the character was so original and likable. Of course the acting was brilliant, I've see a lot of  Philip Seymour Hoffman movies, as I wondered when he would get the chance to show how good his acting skills is. Some of his other great work would have to be Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. If you haven't seen them trust me their impressive.   <br /> <br />Truman Capote (Hoffman), during his research for his book In Cold Blood, an account of the murder of a Kansas family, the writer develops a close relationship with Perry Smith, one of the killers. <br /> <br />This is a very Dramatic movie if you like these types of films that show you the truth in style Example Schindlers List you will love this.  <br />

B000002N2N|5.0|The one Ramones album you'll ever need if you can have only one. Everything is played faster, louder and more intense than it's studio counterpart and the song selection acts as a best of compilation from the first three albums. It's a rare band indeed that can be credited with acutally changing music and the Ramones are one of those bands. With a nod to Iggy, Richard Hell and Johnny Thunders, punk rock starts here folks. Headbanging punk rock played as only the Ramones could play it: Dee Dee, Johnny, Joey and Tommy, the only living member of the original band. The best Ramones album, period.

0307276902|4.0|A Million Little Pieces by James Frey <br />Alex Stine <br />        One must ask themself why James Frey wrote a book about his expirerences in a drug rehabilitation center with crude and to some of us unreal detail. I have concluded that he wanted to give some hope and proof to the unsure and unwilling people who feel that they are walking in his shoes.                             <br />            James wakes up and is on a plane to Chicago. He has no belongings, money,  or idea where he is at.\\" I have a hole in my cheek, my nose is broken and my eyes are swollen nearly shut.\\"(1)This is how he describes himself when he becomes conscience. His caring parents pick him up at the airport. They take him to a rehabilitation center, where he hopes to recover and stop his addictions. This Rehab Center has strict rules and regulations which to James mean nothing. <br />Proving this, James disobeys the rule that there shall be no interacting with a female patient by meeting a girl named Lilly who he eventually falls on love with. Lilly brings James so much joy by her comfort. Lilly was addicted to crack and her mother force her to be a prostitute. They were comfortable with each other .I believe that the relationship they have helped them succeed in the program even though it forbids any kind of interaction, because what they both needed was love.\\" I deserve this hurt for not being brave enough to look at himself. I deserve this hurt and I will stand and I will take it because I am not brave enough to look into my own eyes\\"(79) He believes that he should be punished for all the tings that he put his friends, parents, and brother through. <br />     What makes this book so interesting is that it fits into many categories of a genres. Romance? Fiction? Horror? Suspense? It could be any of them.  The romance between James and Lilly. The Horror of the life James lived. These are all directly connected to the way James Frey wrote A Million Little Pieces, by the people he meets at the facility and the stories of his past experiences. The thing that drew me to this book is how realistically he speaks of himself. He says things like \\"I am an Alcoholic and I am a drug Addict and I am a Criminal\\"'(94) over and over in his mind so that he doesn't pity or forgive himself for any of the things that he has done throughout his life of trouble and addictions. What I really like about his writing is all the emotion, reality and feeling that comes from the words he uses to describe his pain, discomfort and agony throughout his life.
0792164903|4.0|Tim Burton breathes new life to the macabre tale of the tormented Ichabod Crane. I have not read the original story but I am a big fan of the classic Disney version and noticed that Burton changed several aspects of the story. The wimpy, laughable, big-nosed school teacher of the original is turned into a sophisticated, charming New York City constable who is called upon by the townspeople of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the mysterious, gruesome be-headings of it's residents. Besides countless severed heads, there is a lot Tim Burton throws at the audience and it's all done with the Burton style that his fans find irresistible. Very few can deny the fact that this film looks great from every angle. It's dark, dreamlike atmosphere inspires awe and dread. From the sinister, mutated trees to the lurking fog that envelopes the dreary landscapes. Visually - it is spellbinding. The cast is also first-rate. Johnny Depp is in sharp contrast physically to the quirky character depicted in the Disney version or the Jeff Goldblum 1980 film but he is very believable in the role and Christina Ricci's pale, angelic features shines even amidst all of the bloodshed. But one of the best characters in the film is the incomprehensible, vicious headless horseman portrayed by the always compelling Christopher Walken.<br /><br />Parents should take note that despite the fantastic fantasy elements depicted in this film and the quirkiness of the main characters, \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is definitely not for kids. The film leaves nothing to the imagination and the violence and imagery is graphic. But for those old enough and who are fans of the original story and/or of Burton, Depp and Ricci, need to check this out. It's an incredibly violent excursion into a Gothic world of witches, black magic and the walking dead. And thanks to the creative genius of Tim Burton, it's never dull.<br /><br />**** 1/25 out of 5. Highly recommended.
B00005LQ04|5.0|I think it's fair to begin with saying \\"Suspiria\\" usually counts as the best work of Dario Argento. I wouldn't agree actually, not because I don't like it but because I have other personal best. But anyway whatever other Argento's film is your favourite, you'll have to admit \\"Suspiria\\" is a tremendous achievement on all levels.<br /><br />As Argento says himself many directors use their dreams for their story-lines and for the visual expression of their movies. And Dario admits he uses his nightmares for this purpose. I never had a chance to get into Argento's head and see what nightmares he's having, but they are definately very morbid and at the same time extremely picturesque. Although his films have obvious plots which are quite realistic, Argento manages to wind some surreal and dreamy details into them. And it makes his works truly an unforgetable experience. I won't concentrate on \\"Suspiria\\" plot-line, because everyone who wanted already knows what it's about. But as in most of Argento's movies here it's \\"how\\" that's more important, not \\"what\\".<br /><br />The whole ballet-school in \\"Suspiria\\" looks so surreal though pretty realistic. The setting reminds of old German expressionist features like \\"Cabinet of Doctor Caligari\\", only in color. All those colorful and twisted interiors look improbable yet still realistic. If you look close enough you'll notice the door knobs are placed rather high giving an impression that school-girls, who look about 18-19 y.o. in reality, are ten years younger. This antinomy invokes strange feelings, and in a documentary dedicated to the film Argento reveals couple of other secrets about creating his atmosphere of unease and irreality. Acting and music add a lot to it, I think Goblin's mesmerizing soundtrack for \\"Suspiria\\" is one of the most memorable in movie history. Even if you are not a horror-film aficionado, you're going to like \\"Suspiria\\" because it's a real piece of art, taking any aspect of cinematography. And if you are a fan of horror and Dario Argento in particular, I'd like to say \\"Suspiria\\" Anchor Bay 3-disc limited edition is your best choice. It has explicit \\"Suspiria 25th anniversary\\" documentary, trailers, posters and still gallery, cast and crew filmographies and biographies, 32-page color booklet, and what's important - CD containing Goblin's OST for \\"Suspiria\\". This edition is now OOP, but I'm sure you'll find a way to get it if you really need it.f horror and Dario Argento in particular, I'd like to say \\"Suspiria\\" Anchor Bay 3-disc limited edition is your best choice.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|I heard Ms. Fiona perform on a morning news show and was quite taken with her performance.  I proceded to purchase her newest cd, and loved it, so I decided to see what other cd's she had out there and this was one of them so I bought this as well.  I was definitely also pleased with this one.  I like her voice, sort of raspy and the words she sings are very distinguishable, the music does not drown her out but joins with her voice as one. <br />
B0000AMRJC|1.0|I really don't see what people like about this so much.  Not only is it based on crude stereotypes of the Latin American underworld, but it is ridiculously unrealistic.  I mean, when all the shooting starts - let alone whether Pacino and his minions could operate with such blatant impunity - where were the cops?<br /><br />So what the story boils down to is:  bad guys rise and then fall.

Throughout the book it shows Charlie going from being not very smart, or unable to learn like \\"normal\\" people do, to him becoming very smart and able to learn above what is considered \\"normal.\\"  <br /> At first Charlie is told to keep a diary in order to document his progress. (It is sort of like a diary.) At first, he cannot spell correctly. He spells things how they sound. (\\"I had a test today. I think I faled it and I think mabye now they wont use me.\\" page 1) This was frustrating to me because at first, I could not understand what he was saying. However, after his operation, he started to learn new things (such as spelling and grammar), which made it much easier to read.  <br /> Once Charlie had the operation, he also began to notice that people weren't always very nice to him. He had a job at a bakery where he thought that everyone was being nice to him and he thought his co-workers were his real friends. It wasn't until after the operation and his knowledge began to grow did he realize that the people he worked with enjoyed making fun of his disability. (\\"Give him something bright and shiny.\\" Frank, who has let Gimpy take over the experiment, leans forward excitedly. \\"Maybe if he wants that piece of junk bad enough and you tell him he'll get it if he learns to shape the dough into rolls- maybe it'll work.\\" page 62) When Charlie addressed this in the book, it was my least favorite part. I didn't like knowing that the people he thought were his friends actually weren't. I felt very bad for him. <br /> Charlie also focuses on his childhood a lot. He spends a lotof his entries writing about how mean his mother was to him and how she was ashamed that he  \\"wasn't like other children.\\" (\\"It's disgusting. I don't know what to do, Dr. Guarino. Even at home he forgets- and sometimes when we have people in the house. I'm so ashamed when he does that.\\" page 142) I don't like reading these parts either because I cannot imagine how someone could be so mean and ashamed of their own child.  It makes me feel really bad for Charlie.  <br /> The major suspenseful thing in the book is finding out if the operation is permanent or temporary. This is one very good reason to read the book and find out! I loved the book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who asks!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Not just blues or rock and roll, an eclectic blend of musicians, all playing the instrument they love. Good sound and cinematography.  <br /> <br />Not long enough. Needs to be a 4 or 5 volume collection. <br /> <br />Forget ZZ Top.

I ALSO LISTEN TO OTHER PUNK ROCK LIKE DEAD KENNEDYS, SOCIAL DISTORTION, PENNYWISE, OPERATION IVY, and ETC. IN THE 90'S, THERE WAS ONLY ONE TRUE PUNK BAND, AND THAT WAS GREEN DAY. DON'T LISTEN TO THOSE SO CALLED PUNK REVIEWERS WHO KNOW IT ALL CAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW CRAP ABOUT PUNK. I'M LISTENING TO THE SEX PISTOLS AND GREEN DAY RIGHT NOW AND YOU REVIWERS CAN'T SAY CRAP ABOUT THAT CAN'T YOU. THATS WHAT I THOUGHT YOU SO CALLED PUNK REVIEWERS.

B000DZIGE4|4.0|i really enjoyed this movie. im not one to watch war movies nor have i ever seen one, until now. jarhead went into the mind and souls of military men during war. the acting was exceptional. if a movie is good, ill think about it for a few days because it had such an impact on me. this was one of those movies, it gave me a better understanding of what my enlisted husband went through during bootcamp. this movie should be watched especially with the times we are living in.

006056251X|2.0|My biggest disappointmet was the un-met potential. I was hoping for a great story like \\"worth any price\\". I so love the flawed hero and this had all the makings.  <br /> <br />I agree 100% with the other reviewers who felt the character development fell short. It seems like overnight - wham - they were in love and St. Vincent became a man of honor.  <br /> <br />I LITERALLY thought I missed a chapter!  <br /> <br />I would have liked the transition to have felt more gradual,  more played out...Evie's stutter disappears WAY too quickly, and St. Vincent virually changes his complete lifestyle and a lifetime of wicked ways (like kidnap wicked) on a night's sleep. Come on - I know this is a romance novel and we have to suspend reality a bit but ... this was borderline absurd. It was almost although at some point Lisa looked up and said \\"oh my, look at the time - gotta go\\" and put a rush ending on the story.  <br /> <br />I have read EVERY one of Lisa's book and she is my favorite HRA - maybe if my expectation weren't so high I wouldn't have felt as let down.  I await Daisy's story - please Lisa make it worth it.
0553582445|5.0|Fitz is back as a adventure-weary hero.  The authors style is gripping yet fun.  I've enjoyed the series and recommend the trilogy prior to these three as well.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|This movie has EVERYTHING anyone ever could hope to find in a movie: romance, action, adventure, mystery, emotion, beautiful musical score, flawless special effects, sheer horror, breathtaking cinematography, good acting, comic relief, etc...  They have pushed the limits of computer aided special effects accomplishing feats that were not previously possible.  Putting the irregularity of real life back into special effects is not easy.  The result is a genuinely believeable presentation.  The aminated Kong was believeable as a real ape.  On the big screen I-at times-felt like I was IN the scene.  Just amazing!  The giant theme is well complemented with a colorful mix of characters.  The movie flows very well.  It was a long movie, but you won't notice.  The credits will flash and you won't believe that it's over already.  Nothing done before comes close to this movie, so you really have to see it for yourself.  It leaves a very distinct impression.  If you liked the original King Kong, you will like this movie.  If you are into special effects, action, adventure, monster, or epic movies, you will love this movie.  If you liked Lord of the Rings, you will WORSHIP this movie.

B0000033OZ|4.0|I think ELP is the most fascinating and most extraordinary rock band of the classical rock era and especially the 70's and 80's. In this debut album they made a very strong entrance to rock world as a trio. Apart from their success in their previous bands, these three man prove that they were born for each other to make beatiful music. In this album you can find classical songs like The Barbarian, Knife Edge and Take A Pebble. If you keep on listening ELP you'll see that it is not by chance these men are still making music together. So I highly recommend this album to classical rock fans and those that have not listened ELP before. It is a very good beginning for the band and the fans I think.

B000088E6D|2.0|I am glad I purchased the Michael Buble - It's Time CD before this one, because if I had not, I never would have bothered.  The difference between the self titled and It's Time is striking.  In a word, this CD is tired.  The song selections, while classic, have been over covered. Michael's delivery was flat. No, that understates it. It is like a zombie recorded this CD- a total absence of passion. Do yourself a favor and skip this one and go right for It's Time.  While it too has some over covered songs, they are far less than on this CD and no one can say the delivery on It's Time is anything but passionate.
B000E5N62U|4.0|Fagen's previous solo albums were \\"concept\\" albums: each had a definite theme that followed through each of the tracks.  MORPH is also something of a concept album, although in a looser way.  The title track sets the stage for what could have easily been called \\"New York City Stories,\\" with various character dealing with their dreams and fears of post-9/11 America.<br /><br />Musically, the album actually sounds more like Steely Dan than Donald Fagen...although this certainly isn't a bad thing.  Fagen's trademark keyboards and bass abound throughout, but one immediately notices the prominent role of electric guitars on the disc.  There's \\"real\\" brass (vs. electronically reproduced instruments) on several tracks, giving songs like \\"Brite Nightgown\\" and \\"The Night Belongs to Mona\\" extra punch.  And my favorite new touch has to be the use of an organ and real piano on a few tracks.  The music is uniformly tight, occasionally surprising (as in the trippy marimba flourish leading into the 3rd verse of \\"Brite Nightgown\\"), and NEVER dull.<br /><br />As a longtime fan, my ongoing gripe is the brief amount of material covered here.  Although MORPH has one more track than each of the previous Fagen albums, it still feels too short.  And I love a good jazzy instrumental break, but a few of the tunes go on a little too long.  In the final analysis: It's not as good as THE NIGHTFLY (nothing...ever...will be), but it's a slight improvement over KAMIKIRIAD.<br /><br />Finally, a plea to Mr. Fagen himself...please don't make us wait another 13 years for more!
B00000583F|5.0|Sleep are a band of somewhat cult status now, and it's mostly thanks to this monstrously heavy riff onslaught and their 60+ minute journey aptly named 'Dopesmoker'. For those High on Fire fans, you probably already know this, but if not, Matt Pike was the lead guitarist for Sleep, and he certainly laid down a few smacking riffs in their short discography. Along with makeshift vocalist/bassist Al Cisneros, Sleep made a brutal, raw form of stoner rock/metal with next to no production qualities, and next to no signs of intellectual lyrics. But that simply adds to the no-messing attitude.<br /><br />The album starts off with a bang, 'Dragonaut' is a Sleep classic, starting with a lovely Sabbathy riff, the band spiral in and out of more huge riffs, psychedelic lyrics (riding dragons to crimson eyes and the likes) and some lovely tempo changes. This song pretty much sums up what Sleep are all about, it's unapologetic, heavy and above all great fun. The fundamental thing that must be pointed out is that this is definitely not for people looking for 'fancy' and 'flowery' guitar work, intellectual lyrics and intricate drum playing. This is cock-out, heavy, stoned metal.<br /><br />'The Druid' and 'Evil Gypsy/Solomon's Theme' are more of the same: riffs-a-plenty, silly lyrics sung with not much care, and above all they get my head and toes tapping. 'Solomon's Theme' it should be noted has a fantastic tempo change and a lovely climatic onslaught.<br /><br />'Some Grass' is a little break, a nice guitar only piece that leads us into 'Aquarium', one of my highlights of the album. The main riff here is simply stunning, and once again the band, while they would seem 'sludgy' at times, are actually very tight, and above all very patient. Never at any point do they get a good riff, and rush it, everything is taken with a sophisticated, relaxed feeling.<br /><br />The last half of the album is simply relentless, far heavier and slower than the first part, containing two epics in the title track which bludgeons its 8 minutes away with an especially brutal middle section, and the simply huge sounding crescendos of 'From Beyond'. I've read some reviewers disliking the second half of the album, I did initially but now I enjoy it equally for its slower, heavier aspects.<br /><br />Overall this album is great fun, its not intellectual, pretentious, fancy...its just no-messing, heavy stoner metal to sit back to and enjoy.<br /><br />For fans of High on Fire, Orange Goblin, Electric Wizard, Black Sabbath, Kyuss etc8 minutes away with an especially brutal middle section, and the simply huge sounding crescendos of 'From Beyond'.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is every bit as great as \\"the division bell\\"! David's guitar sweeps, churns, whines and soars at precisely the right moments. The lyrics aren't as depressing as most of floyd's were; a welcome change because I like to sing songs that put positive images in my head. If you're into guitar in this mellow style definitly check out \\"colma\\",\\"electric tears\\", or \\"octave of the holy innocents\\" by the astounding talent buckethead.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I ordered this CD after seeing the taped concert on our local PBS station.  I have admired Meav for quite some time, especially her version of Aillen Diun (Dark Alan) from Robb Roy and she really shines on this CD as does 15 year old Chloe who sings a haunting version of \\"Walking in the Air\\".  Mairead's fiddle playing is nice, though I have heard more impressive fiddling.<br /><br />That being said, for those who are lovers of traditional Irish folk music and Irish instrumentation, this music will possibly disappoint; the selections are not strictly Irish, but by and large very pop with quite a bit of synthesizers.  Viewing the PBS program, looking at the CD jacket, and the website, it is clear that the group is heavily marketing glitz and glamour, what with the beautiful film of the women wearing stunning gowns with blue lights behind them.  (I thought the PBS program, while compelling, was too staged and scripted with almost every glance by the women and David Downes seeming planned and contrived. It lacked the genuineness of a true \\"live\\" concert where anything can happen.)<br /><br />Considering all that, why 4 stars?  I love their voices.  They are so clear and beautiful.  While it is very pop in nature and has a sort of mass appeal, the music is soothing and haunting, especially \\"Walking in the Air\\"  which has an almost magical quality to it.  Also, The Isle of Inisfree (from the old movie \\"The Quiet Man\\" with Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne)as performed by Orla is absoulutely gorgeous.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|I was lucky enough to VHS-record the \\"long\\" version off of cable over 10 years ago - 2 years in a row - didn't capture the whole thing either time! The VHS tape, being organic, is losing quality. I have been waiting and watching for the long version to become available in ANY form - DVD - YEA! I am SO on board and don't know how I missed it the day it came out.<br /><br />I have read all five DUNE books (and the prequels). Between this long version of DUNE with Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides, and the newer release with William Hurt as Duke Leto Atreides, the actual first book of the quintology is well-covered. Either movie alone is still missing parts, and the shorter Kyle MacLachlan version was so confusing to me, that is what compelled me to read the book, to see what was missing!<br /><br />The newer William Hurt release has a totally different mood than the older release. I enjoyed it and appreciated it, but more like it was a movie of its own, not a remake or another DUNE.<br /><br />Francesca Annis is absolutely breathtaking as Jessica. When I read the book, I could see why she was chosen for the part. Same with Shaddout Mapes (good casting) and certainly the Baron and his brother! Sting is fantastic as Harkonnen (prounounced in this movie as \\"har-KO-nen\\" not \\"HAR-kennen\\" as in the newer movie) Feyd Rautha.<br /><br />To adequately convert the book's true revelation of \\"plans within plans,\\" into a movie, would result in nothing less than a six-hour movie. By itself, the extended version of DUNE with Kyle MacLachlan is my favorite out of any other DUNE movie. I don't want to spoil it by telling what scenes are added, if you haven't seen the extended version yet, but I will say, like I was, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B000006TRV|5.0|I do not know that my favorite Floyd songs/pieces are on this CD.  I love WYWH (the album) and Meddle, equally.  But, in my opinion, this CD outshines DSOTM easily.<br /><br />Taken as a complete work, as it ought to be, this is clearly a work for the ages.  This will NOT be forgotten.  Every few years new kids discover the experience of listening to The Wall... and, this will surely continue for the rest of time.<br /><br />The point is NOT that this  chararacter's alienation is oh so special or outside of the realm of ordinary human experience.  The point is that it is very much INSIDE the realm of ordinary human experience.  A cheery outlook on life?  No, but I think that most of us have been 'there' at one time or another.  That this alienation was committed to tape is the beauty.  The lyrics, the music and the scope of the message to the world is what will set this CD apart for all time.<br /><br />BTW, if someone has a serious critique of a piece of art/music, it would serve their purpose to try to NOT sound like a total moron...

The price is more than reasonable, and I couldnt find it for better anywhere else. <br /> <br />I have always been a fan, but I have never purchased any of the dvds, waiting very patiently for a substantial box set of the films. Well my wait is over, and so should yours! Buy this Now!!
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I figured it out.  This movie is a chick flick.  I saw it with two people, my boyfriend and my best friend (girl).  My boyfriend fell asleep and my best friend and I loved it.  We wanted to see the animated show afterwards.  My boyfriend still claims its the worst movie he's ever seen ever in a movie theater, while my friend and I are probably going to buy the dvd.   <br /> <br />The movie boils down to very beautiful love story.  I was familiar with the cartoon from mtv, but i hadn't seen it since it was on the air, like, what was that, ten years ago?  and I was familiar with the love/hate relationship of Aeon and Trevor.  This movie was a tribute to not only the show, but to their unblossomed relationship in the show.  For fans of the cartoon, it was heartwrenching.  They both wanted, practically loved each other, but they couldn't seem to be together.  The way they saw the world was too different. <br /> <br />As promised, I bought the cartoon on dvd the second I saw the movie, wanting to freshen up my memory.  To my surprise, I saw many of the scenes and extra characters in the movie were directly from the show, the woman cassandra with the hands for feet, running across the field of automated guns, even scenes and concepts from the mtv liquid shorts that even less people are probably familiar with from before they decided to make it a full  show. <br /> <br />The movie takes the relationship between Trevor and Aeon and gives the fans of the show exactly what they wanted to see all along.  The two of them together.  The show was a teasing twisting tale of their jealousy and affections and quiet longings for the other, while the movie goes in depth to create a reason and conclusion for their story.  I can only hope they take all this Aeon Flux's rebirth into making more episodes of the cartoon, which was shockingly short, only ten episodes with an unsatisfying ending.  I'd love to see more of their story.

B000001F95|5.0|In 1983, Mark Knopfler, singer/songwriter of Dire Straits, released the superb soundtrack to \\"Local Hero\\", which remains a favorite of mine still, and one of the best soundtracks ever. The next year, he followed with another movie soundtrack, \\"Cal\\", which brings the story of an Northern-Irish family tormented by the struggles with the British \\"occupancy\\".<br /><br />\\"Cal\\" (12 tracks, 35 min.) evokes the atmosphere of Irish life, with superb result. Check out the opener \\"Irish Boy\\", with gentle guitar and flute. The conflict in the movie is born out in \\"Fear and Hatred\\", which is the only \\"harsh\\" track on the album, all the other tunes are mood pieces. There are 2 center pieces on the album that are beautiful beyond belief: the 6+ min. \\"Father and Son\\" which evoke all the ache that is in the movie, and the closer \\"The Long Road\\", which is uplifting in sound (and sight onto the screen). Knopler's excellent guitar work is never overbearing, but enhances the mood throughout.<br /><br />Mark Knopfler would go on to score many other movies, but he never reached the peaks of the 1-2 punch of \\"Local Hero\\" and \\"Cal\\". \\"Cal\\" may only last 35 min., but it is a superb soundtrack, and highly recommended. I bought it on vinyl and again on CD and it remains a favorite of mine.

The reason is clear one of Jane Austen's best works, Pride and Prejudice has proven to contain the finest of elements which only contibutes to it's immortal relation of what happened during her days. Finally we have found a woman Shakespeare!!!<br /><br />A must read, for every literate.
0066620996|4.0|Excellent book and down to earth information
B00005JNX0|1.0|This was supposed to be a comedy and it was so bad that I couldn't even find humor in how pathetic it was.  The writing was horrible!!  There was only one laugh for me in the entire film which had something to do with wiping...that always makes you feel good to get one low brow laugh in. haha  Ben Stiller in particular was a stand out for his poor voice performance.  This guy's career has officially crashed and it's time for him to go away.  Everyone involved here was horrible, though.  Jada Pinkett, David Schwimmer, Chris Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, the list goes on and everyone deserves to be mentioned for their pathetic decisions to be a part of this mess.  I rank every film I see by year and this is the worst film I've seen in at least three years!!!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I found Firefly quite by accident, and when it was cancelled without even completing a season, I had to wonder what was going through the head of whatever studio executive made the decision. <br /> <br />After its post-shutdown popularity, and the release of the film, I hope that head has rolled. <br /> <br />The film \\"Serenity\\" is excellent. Being a movie, it loses a little of the feel of the series, but stands alone very well. <br />Be prepared for shocks and surprises, more so if you're a fan of the series, and be prepared for a quirky \\"not your usual run of the mill sci-fi\\" feel if you've not come across Firefly before. <br /> <br />The budget, while not as high as you might think, was used with exceptional effect, with the special effects putting some of the huge-budget blockbusters to shame. <br /> <br />I'm sure it's been said before, but you do NOT need to have seen the Firefly series to enjoy this film. (It helps, but it's not necessary.) <br /> <br />Well worth adding to just about anyones collection.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I don't normally listen to wailing, hard-edged bands anymore, but Soundgarden's \\"Superunknown\\" is a stellar album and for an album with such a hard edge, the songs were damn catchy and moving. This album, however, had very little that stayed with me. \\"Like a Stone,\\" the main single from this album, ended up being the only song I liked. Most of the other songs were just hard guitar wailing combined with screaming vocals with few melody hooks to speak of. If you normally like this sort of music then that might be OK, but for the rest of us... sorry. So for those of you who are NOT ashamed to admit that you mostly stick to \\"mainstream\\" music, like myself, I doubt that you'd like this album. But try it for yourself I guess.  I'm done with Chris Cornell, hardcore, metal, and punkbands myself.  Call me getting older, but I don't care, there's just too much good music out there to waste on this sort of stuff.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Some dialogue is corny, but over all, an excellent and a too short lived series.
6305291446|5.0|This was a great movie. Jamie Lee Curtis hasn't lost her touch with movie rolls like these. Her performance was execllent and the storyline was indeed top notch. Although, without the presence of actor Donald Pleasence and his character Dr. Loomis. The film sort of lacks in ways. But, still this is one of Jamie Lee's best films.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|After having watched this movie many times, I read the book twice in the last month. I have to say honestly I enjoyed both immensely! This movie adaptation captured my imagination and secured my love of the characters and the book.  The music in the BBC version doesn't compare with the exceptional musical score in this movie which combined with the scenery is so moving, and absolutely outstanding!
B00005JO1R|4.0|First of all, let me say that Walk the Line is the good movie, with great acting.  Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar, and I believe Joaquin Phoenix, should have won an Oscar. <br />  <br />I have one problem with the movie.  I don't believe it was linear enough.  It felt choppy, like they were rushing to get all their topics in, and they never stayed with one topic long enough to go into any depth. <br /> <br />Now, I believe that this movie should've won best picture.  However, I believe that this movie could have been even better, if they had spent more than the standard two minutes per topic.  And then cut the scene, this resulted in a choppy picture. <br /> <br />I purchased the collector's edition of Walk the Line.  It includes slip case, five black-and-white postcards, the featurettes on disc two are almost better than the movie, and provide more continuity.  There are also several songs by Reese and Joaquin.  These are full songs, and not the cut up versions. <br /> <br />The director's commentary on disc one, and the deleted scenes give you a sense of where the director was trying to go, but didn't quite achieve.  However, I still think that this movie was good enough to win best picture.  It should have at least been nominated.
0140185232|5.0|There are alot of things in this book that make it a recommended reading.  Maugham plays the puppet master narrator in this post WWI novel.  He introduces us to some unforgettable characters.  There is Elliott Templeton the social climbing admirer of anything of the European aristocracy. Larry Darrell the walking wounded who after the war finds solace in Indian mysticism.  Isabel a girl ripe with the health and happiness of youth looking forward to a life with Larry.  Sophie Macdonald a bitter sweet girl who slips into abusive behaviors and tragedy.  Finally there is Suzanne Rouvier the prostitute painter dealing with what life will give her.<br /><br />This novel is full of the intertwinining relationships of all these characters as they face the vicissitudes of life. Each one of these characters is like the ripple in the pond spreading out to touch and change lives..for good, for bad. There are so many core elements at work in this novel that make it such a great read. To me the most interesting character, and quite possibly one of Maugham's best written one, was Elliott Templeton.  He presented a fascinating study in contradiction even more so than does the detached Larry Darrell, the story's main character...I mean you have to admire anyone that would build a church even if it was mainly for personal glory.  Elliott stands in direct opposition to Larry's saintly value system.<br /><br />Maugham keeps the veil covering and detached distance between him and his characters.  He doesn't let down his guard and allow us as readers to view him like he did in his fictional autobiography 'Of Human Bondage'. This is the kind of novel where the players will stay with you long after the reading.  Well worth repeated readings.
0062502182|5.0|This book really helps you in finding yourself.  While reading, you learn to use the skills that Santigo learns on his odsey in your own personal life.

B00005AUBA|3.0|This is their album I feel that is both a gift and a curse..A gift in being some of their most focused, sincere, well produced songwriting and a curse to not hear nearly enough of it..If this was an ep, it should get a freakn prize, but it simply leaves me wanting more as a full length..Is it right to put out a few lush, gut bustingly beautiful songs coupled with other tracks of ambient and instrumental minimalism? Only if you have enough tracks to somehow justify it to the listener...It would have been great if instead of several nice ep's, the band could have tried harder for such an important transitional release..I say that with the utmost respect for the band and for at least half of this album's tracks, but to come off of the brilliant effort Come on Die Young, and announce a huge stylistic change with electronics taking much of the foreground as well as guest vocalists helping to \\"clean up\\" mogwai's sound, should have garnerd more attention to a total product..Thankfully it did not; in retrospect one can see the band was merely trying on different outfits and knew deep down that what got them to that point was an unflinching attention to fluctuations in repetition
B00097A5I6|5.0|Ok, Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory are classics, Be Here Now was overproduced but not bad, Standing on the Shoulder of Giants tried way to hard, Heathen Chemistry was forced and inconsistent, and Don't Believe the Truth is the best British album since Morning Glory.  No joke.  I was not going to buy this album.  I felt that 'Lyla' was catchy but typical of recent Oasis- easy to sing along to but not something you end up thinking about much later, unlike their earlier recordings- but then in late September I saw them perform live, and the song 'The Importance of Being Idle' blew me away.  I am now convinced that this is one of their top five songs ever, along with such greats as 'the Masterplan' and 'Don't Look Back in Anger'.  This song is more than just catchy, it is truly a modern classic which is something Oasis haven't produced in years, so I decided to buy the entire album. <br />Every song on this is good, there is no weak point.  Turn Up The Sun in psychedelic without being cliche or overdone like most of their past two efforts.  Mucky Fingers is the worst track on the album, and it would have been one of the best on their last two, Lyla is very single-esque, and then from that point on the album goes into overdrive. <br />If you are a fan of Oasis's b-sides, which are odd because they were often better than their A-sides, you will love this album.  The overproduction is scrapped, a more acoustic, older (maybe more mature?  I'm too young to understand what a more mature life would produce) sound is incorporated and damn near every song is catchy beyond all reason.  Oasis are back, and if only they were marketed properly in America this album would have been huge. <br />I didn't experience Oasis's glory days, so I feel I have a more objective outlook on this album.  I find myself playing it as often as Morning Glory and Definitely Maybe, and it is showing no signs of wearing on me.  Liam and Noel have never sounded better, and 'Let There Be Love' might bethe most heartfelt song they have ever written, and- suprise! -the lyrics are actually top notch. <br />Give this album a try.  You'll love it simply because it's outstanding.
B00009ATKS|3.0|3 1/2 stars <br /> <br />This is like a more solid, more experienced version of what Rock Action sought to be..It is unfortunate that the success of a mogwai album is almost always deterred by it's insistence on breaking up the amazingly gorgeous or menacingly powerfull songs with ambient filler tracks, but it would be safe to say this album pulls it off classier then in the past. While still feeling like a bunch of tracks rather then a flowing album (Come on die Young is the only one that I feel attains the latter so far), Happy Songs for Happy People dazzles us with it's eclectic beauty, showcasing all of mogwai's sides we have come to love..A downside to this bands increased experience with recording studio albums does come with a bit of instrumental and compositional detatchment however, as the tracks do soar as brilliantly and boldly as ever, but with a more guided mechanic...A small complaint for one of rock's most introspective acts.
0930289528|3.0|Based on plot and artistry, \\"V for Vendetta\\" deserves five stars.  Alan Moore's alternate history throws the reader into a chilling fascist England where the champion of liberty is the poetic, deranged vigilante, V. <br /> <br />England has somehow survived the consequences of humanity's self-destructive myopia, but it has not survived intact.  Facism rules the day, and England has been generally \\"purified\\" of minorities, homosexuals, and other officially-targeted degenerates. <br /> <br />But plenty of officially-sanctioned degenerates abound, and they form both the upper and lower echelons of this new England.  That is, until V strikes a blow for chaos, for liberty, and for freedom.  V, a scarred survivor of the worst of the internment camps formed by the fascists, is undeniably insane, but he has the spirit of a poet and the mind of a genius hidden behind his Guy Fawkes mask.  He singlehandedly leads a campaign of terrorism against the corrupt powers-that-be, and there are several dazzling passages as \\"V\\" explores both V's perspective on life and his history as well as the more sordid characters who comprise England's new corrupt power structure. <br /> <br />Many of these scenes are captured by Moore with startling visuals and poetic images.  This is a dark-yet-colorful graphic novel -- nothing like Frank Miller's zebra-esque \\"Sin City\\" stories.  Lurid colors combined with creepy darkness evoke the corruption that is the brave new world. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this review is of the paperback edition of the story, not the story itself.  The paperback edition of \\"V for Vendetta\\" is, quite frankly, too darn small.  Several panels feel crimped and crammed in, and I felt a lot of eye strain as I tried to explore the details of some of the more intricate panels.  This is particulary important for a very \\"talky\\" graphic novel, where often much of the panel is given over to dialogue boxes, even further reducing the artist's available space for the artistic elements. <br /> <br />While I would strongly recommend reading \\"V for Vendetta,\\" particularly in advance of the blockbuster movie, I strongly recommend avoiding the paperback edition and hunting down a larger hardback copy.
6305433909|5.0|I had the first one and absolutly loved it.  And then I saw Sister Act 2 on tv one day and loved it.  I actually like the second one better than the first.  This is one movie that I can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.
0307276902|4.0|Thrilling is a word for James Frey's memoir A Million Little Pieces. With itemizing details and a story to keep you going, the book is a winner. Voyage with James, an alcoholic, drug addicted, substance abuser, through his three week journey of rehab. Because of the anger and rage experienced as a child James Frey started using substances at a young age. As he grew, his anger grew with him.Over his three week time in rehab he meets many interesting, touching people and has many experience even I could relate to.  <br />There were times when the book wasn't all it could have been. At times I found it hard to believe, and Frey did repeat himself often. I thought the book was a bit long, it was interesting at times and the detail was useful but sometimes it was repetative. The book was captivating and I thought the ending was entertaining, though predictable. Overall I'm glad I read the book and I would recommend it.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was watching the movie Serenity. The movie was very fast pace and to the point. However, I was confused because I didn't know any of the charactors. The movie didn't even introduce any of them.  Toward the end of the movie, I felt like I was watching a TV episode. So, I did some research. It turned out that Serenity was a movie made from the TV show Firefly. Being confused and there wasn't much good Sci-Fi nowaday, I ordered this Firefly complete series.  $20 bucks on sale in Amazon was a great price. <br /> <br />The TV series had a much slower pace than the movie. The introduction of the charactors were very good and smooth. Each charactors had their unique personality. Unliked other shows that everybody was everybody, each charactor in Firefly had his/her unique place in this show. <br /> <br />I was still watching the first DVD. So, I couldn't comment on the story yet. So far, it was pretty good. Other reviewers said that this was some sort of western in space. I believed that Firefly might be something smiliar to Space Pirate Captain Herlock instead. <br /> <br />The music was very good but I thought it had only 2 or 3 scores. Visual was not bad either. The box set itself was very simple. There was no nothing except the 4 slim DVD cases for 4 DVDs. I was expecting a poster of the casts. But no, no poster for $20 bucks. <br /> <br />The only bad thing so far about this DVD sets was that they didn't put the sexy female casts on the DVD covers.
B000002JK4|2.0|The one song \\"Big Log\\" which should be called \\"On the Road\\" is excellent.  The other songs in this collection are all second rate.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|This second album by Elvis Costello is far better than My Aim is True, in my opinion. The tunes are more immediate with much more of a pop flavour whilst the music is also more rhythmically varied and compelling. It marks the transition to his wonderfully accessible Armed Forces masterpiece.<br /><br />There is even a reggae beat in (I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea and a ballad with lovely piano - Little Triggers. My favourites on the original disc are the up-tempo Pump It Up, You Belong To Me and the poignant This Year's Girl, plus of course the pulsating Radio Radio with its subversive lyrics. Night Rally is somewhat dark and disturbing.<br /><br />The second disc includes a wealth of previously unreleased tracks, demo tracks, live and alternative versions. Not all of these alternate takes are as gripping as the familiar versions but they are certainly interesting and worthwhile, demonstrating various facets of his extraordinary musicianship.

0553801503|5.0|It's hard to critique the fourth book of a series.  By this time, all us readers are either fired up for the next installment, or have long since iced the notion of listening to George R.R. Martin's monumental song.  I, for one, have been hooked on ASoIaF since page one; A Feast for Crows hasn't dampened my ardor in any way shape or form.    Disappointments:  I'm letting you prospective readers know right now; AFFC doesn't end in a satisfactory way.  I know George R.R. Martin told the stories' of only half the characters, but AFFC still ends the way a story hacked off at the middle might end.  I'm irritated to know that the characters we read about in AFFC, for the most part, won't be written about in ADWD.  This book heightens the tension, complicates the story, and brings the suspense to a crescendo, and then ends.  And, unlike what some have been lead to believe, Mr. Martin chose to chop his own story.  There are several quotes you can read on his website that attest to this fact.  He basically says that after he kept writing and writing, he realized he had a little too much story for one book, but, instead of cutting the book in half, he took half the characters and told all their stories in full-leaving the other half for ADWD.  Most of the fans were aware of this fact months before the release of AFFC.  This verity, however, doesn't rectify the reality that AFFC feels incomplete.    Here's George Martin's official website.    [...]    Also, The prose is flawed.  Some descriptions and sayings are recycled over the course of the story.  I don't know how many times I read, \\"Words are wind,\\" or how many times I was treated to a second, barely altered, description of Cersei's beauty or Brienne's ugliness or Samwell's black garb.  I didn't mark down all the reused prose, but I'm sure someone has.  I don't really blame Mr. Martin for repeating himself; I blame his editors.    Contentments:  I was happy to finally get Cersei's PoV.  Sometimes it surprises me how disparate George R.R. Martin's characters are.  Sometimes, I can almost believe the PoVs are all written by different authors.  As in other PoVs, Cersei's character doesn't change once you get into her head.  For that matter, actually knowing what Cersei is thinking makes you realize just how disturbed she truly is.  Although I liked reading Cersei's parts, I felt like they took up altogether too much of the story.    Brienne   also gets a lot of pages of AFFC.  I enjoy this character so much.  She's one of the only characters Mr. Martin doesn't give you something to hate about.  She's brave, tough, and pure in a way none of the other adult characters are.  She's such an unlikely hero, one can't help loving her.    Other notable PoVs include Sansa, Jaime, Arya, Samwell, Arianne Martell, Arwyn Oakheart, Asha Greyjoy, Aeron Greyjoy, and Victarion Greyjoy.  If you are a little confused, I found the Wikipedia article on ASoIaF invaluable.    [...]    Conclusion and Summary:  All Mr. Martin's PoVs are rich, unique, and compelling.  In fact, Mr. Martin's ability to make me so invested in what will happen next is what makes me so disappointed about the time I'll have to wait for a PoV from the AFFC characters.    This book has several small, and several large, surprises.  Beware of some of the reviews prior to mine.  I made the mistake of reading them, and wound up having a surprise or two ruined for me.  Though a lot of new and exciting things happen in AFFC, a lot about the past is also unraveled.  A solid portion of AFFC is actually the characters flashing back to previous years.  I can see how some fans might be annoyed by that, but I've always liked learning about what happened during the first rebellion.  Why did they go against the mad King?  What did people do to one another that makes their relationships what they are in the current timeline?  The past and present of ASoIaF are both mysteries, and I love reading all of it.    I give this book a 4.5.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I came across this title when I was housebound for a couple of weeks and looking for ways to pass the time. I had read the book years ago and was so excited to find out it had been made into a mini-series. The comparisons to Pride & Prejudice convinced me I had to see it. I was a little skeptical at first, but by the time Mr. Thornton (Richard Armitage) is confessing his feelings for Margaret to his mother, looking stricken and overwhelmed by them (\\"I know she does not care for me\\")--well, it was impossible not to get drawn in.  I love love stories and this is one you totally believe in.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Strange that so many reviewers are reduced to calling this film ambiguous. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a study in a particular feature of the American psyche -- denial. \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" -- the title encapsulates the theme. As revealed in the final line of dialog from Kidman, these two charcters have chosen to learn nothing from their harrowing experiences and prefer their yuppie light-drug haze attitude. If the neg-utopic theme of Tom Wolf's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" was \\"insulate, insulate, insulate\\" -- meaning that the upper class people should insulate themselves from all contact with the rough-and-tumble world beneath their penthouse ballestrades; then the theme for these upper class New York characters must be \\"drift, dream, deny\\".  <br /> <br /> <br />As always, Kubric exerts complete control over every frame -- a stiffer form of film making than many are used to -- and in Kubric's hands he uses it again to dissect the sterility of moderns. The sick, dwarfed, pathetically trimmed, and pastel-lighted Christmas Trees that appear in many of the interiors. The whats-going-on-here? out-of-the-corner-of-your-eye setup at the costume rental shop. The sex in this film is ghostly, otherworldly, and deadly, as it was amongst the masked guests at the Overlook Hotel in \\"The Shining\\". And, oh yes, the dreadful piano notes, as if a bored corpse watching the entire proceedings (the audience) was drumming his fingers impatiently, and accidentally, on a keyboard. I think Kubric went out with a grand gesture, a scathing characature of America as strong as was \\"Clockwork Orange\\" in its attack on British moderns. Not \\"fun\\" to watch, but great, great cinema.
B000003TAR|4.0|This album probibly desreves 4.5 stars. If you read my review for Nevermind I still justify that it is horribly overrated but this album is pretty good. I have everything Nirvana ever did and this is the only one I would go as far as to say I really like. I personally think Soungarden and Alice In Chains are better but 1993 was Nirvana's year to shine. If you are getting into Nirvana download Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come as you Are and just forget about Nevermind. Make this your first, and only Nirvana purchase. my favorite songs off this album are Serve the Servents, Pennyroyal Tea, Heart Shaped Box, and All Apologies. If you are a 90's or Grunge fan pick this album up. You will be satisfied.
1400079276|2.0|Read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle instead.  Murakami's latest novel is certainly readable, in the sense that a very cheap wine is \\"drinkable\\", but it is also bottomlessly self-indulgent.  Murakami writes very well, but he is not writing about much of anything in Kafka on the Shore.  Empty and dull.
B000002B2X|3.0|I am a huge Alice In Chains fan and i got this album near 3 days ago, that means i have everything except the box set which i am fixing to order. I have to admit if it were possible i would give this album like 2.5 stars instead. Sadly though Sap is probibly the weakest from the AIC collection. I mean don't get me wrong anything released by AIC deserves praise, but most magazines and people don't even acknowledge this as an AIC studio album. here is a review for each song. <br /> <br />1.) Brother 6.9/10 This song doesn't really grab from when you first hear it but there is no dening how it is well written out. <br /> <br />2.) Got Me Wrong 9/10 The only really good song on this album. You have probibly herd it before. this song revolves around Jerry's guitar riff. <br /> <br />3.) Right Turn 6.8/10 this song is actually preformed by a band named Alice Mudgarden. It is a singing trio of Layne Staley, Chris Cornell from Soundgarden, and Mark Arm of Mudhoney. And im pretty sure AIC does the the music. this was the only song by Alice Mudgarden, and that could have been a good thing. It sounds as if Arm, Cornell, and Staley are battaling for whos voice can be herd the best. But it's all right i guess it's not filler. <br /> <br />4.) Am I Inside 5.2/10 I can't really think of a way to describe this song, it's not filler but it's not nessicarly really good niether. <br /> <br />5.) Love Song 0.8/10 some people think the name of this song is Dream Sequence but i herd it was called Love Song. This song is unlisted from the cd booklet but it's on thier don't worry. And boy is it God Awful. This is the only song AIC has ever done that i hated. It is 100% filler. It is impossible to like it sounds like toddlers playing all the instruments. This is most of the reason why I give this album 2.5 stars. The only AIC song EVER that i hate. and i have everything by them folks. But in a sense I think they intended for this song to suck. <br /> <br />In short if you want to get into AIC this is not the album to get first. instead pick up Dirt, or Nothing Safe. But if you are a true AIC fan you may like it. I'ts not expensive and it's a must to complete your AIC collection but let the buyer beware.

0930289234|3.0|WATCHMEN, a comic book limited run written by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons, takes place in the world of 1985 much like our own was, but with striking differences. Here, superheros, or \\"masked adventurers\\" are real, Nixon has been elected to a fourth term (after winning the war in Vietnam), cars run on electric power, and the US and the USSR come within a hair's breadth of nuclear war. Its basic plot is a detective story, when various superheroes, retired after a 1977 act made their work illegal, band together to face a threat, while looking back to their days of glory.<br /><br />The superheros of WATCHMEN are ordinary men skilled in brawling or able to come up with clever technological solutions. The only character with true super-human powers is one Dr Manhattan, a former physicist who after a research accident has become nearly omnipotent and omniscient. Exploring the consequences of a human being elevated to knowing the future and able to do anything he desires is one of the truly original concepts in WATCHMEN, and Moore deserves praise.<br /><br />With all the entertaining aspects of the storytelling, it's a pity that the writing has several serious failings. Moore's plot wraps up far too quickly. I suppose that in order to hit with maximum impact, Moore wanted it all explained within one issue instead of leaving the reader to wait another month. Furthermore, the ending involves the trope of the super-villian explaining his whole scheme to the heroes before doing them in. And while one can expect some amount of psedoscience with a character like Dr Manhattan, there are some shoddy mistakes here, such as claiming Mars' surface is made of \\"silicone\\", and unrealistically mild weather in Antarctica. While WATCHMEN has been lauded for elevating the comic format to legitimate literature, writing like this shows that regrettably it still has some way to go.<br /><br />I felt that WATCHMEN was entertaining, and the character of Dr Manhattan quite interesting, but the work is nowhere near the perfection that many fans claim it to be.ut the work is nowhere near the perfection that many fans claim it to be.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|Rihanna's Sophomore CD, A Girl Like Me, proves her as more of a talented Artist than we thought she was with her first CD, Music of the Sun. On this new set Rihanna showcases more mellow vocals, reminiscent of her Idol Beyonce Knowles, but miles away from her vocally, but still very impressive, Overal this album gets a 9/10 from me, so heres a review of all the songs. <br /> <br />1. SOS (10/10)- First single from the abum, nice pop beat and flavor to it. This song is doing very god on the charts, one of the outstanding songs on the album. <br /> <br />2. Kisses Don't Lie (7/10)- This song has great vocals, but the Rock type feel just doesnt grab my attention, like the other ones, so this is not a favorite of mine. <br /> <br />3. Unfaithful (8.5/10)- Her 2nd single written by Ne-Yo, has a nice pop ballad feel to it. Not Outstanding, but it does have great lyrics and delivers a good vocal performance, not my favorite on the album though. <br /> <br />4. We Ride (10/10)- THIS IS IT!!!!!1 ONE OF THE BEST SONGS ON THE ALBUM...COMPLETELY OUTSTANDING!!!!!! IT SOUNDS LIKE A BRIAN MICHAEL COX PRODUCTION, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HER NEXT SINGLE, IT HAS A STRAIGHT RADIO FRIENDLY R&B/POP MIXTURE. DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITES. <br /> <br />5. Dem Haters (9/10)- I like this song alot! it has a great reggae beat to it, and she delivers good lyrics in it about her haters and people who said she wasnt gon make it. <br /> <br />6. Final Goodbye (8/10)- Nice mellow ballad...very deep lyrics, didnt grab my attention at first, but as I begin to listen, it grew on me. <br /> <br />7. Break It Off (9/10)- Nice reggae club song, could be a great dance track for those who like to reggae dance.....Rihanna's vocals on here are sooooooo good also. I love this girls voice for some reason <br /> <br />8. Crazy Thing Called Love (6/10)- I dont really like this song. Its nice to listen to cause of the vocals, but it seem like it has the same beat as \\"Dem Haters\\", but slowed down a little bit. <br /> <br />9. Selfish Girl (5/10)- I like Reggae and all, but this has another one of those same beats like \\"Dem Haters\\" and \\"Crazy thing called Love\\", she could have switched up the beats..this has to be my least favorite song..never the less still good vocals though, the reggae beat im just not feeling. <br /> <br />10. P.S. (Im still not over you) (100/10)- THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!!!!!! MY FAVORITE OF THEM ALL! GREAT LYRICS! VERY CATCHY! THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY BE A SINGLE! IT IS GREAT PURE R&B! I LOVEEEEEEEE THIS SONG! VERY EMOTIONAL IF U LISTEN CLOSELY TO THE LYRICS. <br /> <br />11. A Girl Like Me (9/10)- This is a cool nice laid back song, i can listen to this alot. nothin much to say about it, cause of the title, and im a guy, but never the less a cool mellow r&B song with great lyrics. <br /> <br />12. Million Miles Away (6/10)- Another one of my least favorites from the album, it sounds too much like \\"Now I Know\\" from her last album, and thats what makes it not catch my attention, seems like it outta be a remix to that song or somethin. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall This CD Gets a: <br /> <br />95- For Vocals <br /> <br />80- For Beats <br /> <br />90- For Production and Arrangement <br /> <br /> <br />This CD Provides Alot of Different Genre Flavor, Its a mixture between Pop/Rock/R&B, with mostly R&B, ill say give it a try....you wont be dissapointed at ALL! <br />

B00005JOWF|2.0|Kurt Wimmer first burst on to the scene with the stylish, dystopic Equilibrium. This little-seen film when it was first released in the theaters soon garnered a cult following once on DVD. What was not to like about Wimmer's directorial debut. It had stylish action, a plot seemningly taken out from an Orwellian playbook and a cast of good to great performances. This sophomore effort from Wimmer got my interest the moment I read about it in the trades. It seemed like a continuation of his take on future dystopia but with a medical twist. I expected alot, though not too much that I overhyped the film to even myself, but what I finally saw once the film hit the theater was something that was a total mess.<br /><br />Ultraviolet takes place in another future dystopia where the world became ruled by a medical establishment that's become religiously fanatical in its quest to protect the world from a plague that genetically-resequenced humans into vampire-like beings called Hemophages. The main character Violet, as played by genre favorite Milla Jovovich, is such a being who is now a member of a dying and hunted species. Violet would've been a cool character if she was abit more fleshed out, so to speak. The character in the film was pretty much indestructible despite the growing odds she had to go up against. I understood from the intro sequence that Ultraviolet was playing on the comic-book style of storytelling and characterization, but Wimmer went overboard in making Violet too Ultra. The story itself doesn't even rise to the level of basic barebones. The ideas presented in the film were still interesting, but it seemed that the audience entered the film sometime during the middle part of the story. So many ideas were being forcefed to the audience through medical mumbo-jumbo that after awhile I just tuned it out. The story pretty much rushed from one talky scene to the next with techno-soundtracked action sequences filling out the gaps.<br /><br />The action looks to have been rehashed from the gunkata of Equilibrium. As much as it would've looked cool in Ultraviolet, the PG-13 rating meant no blood and all the kills done so cleanly or offscreen that one almost thought they were watching something made-for-tv. Kurt Wimmer does know how to create action scenes. One in particular involves Violet on a motorcycle against several helicopter gunships. This was the only scene in the film where I actually enjoyed what I was watching. The soft, dreamlike look of the film even gave the sequence a very surrealistic feel to it. But in the end it wasn't enough to save the film. The rest of the action scenes look to be too choreographed and again the bloodless look to them didn't exactly make them better. Milla Jovovich did look good as Violet and earning a reputation as the premiere female action star, but she could've done and chosen a better project to showcase her talents.<br /><br />Wimmer really regressed alot with this second film, but rumors abound that it might not be all his fault. I don't doubt that talks of the studio getting overly involved in the editing and writing process of the film could've led to the mess that was the fiished product. It's just hard to see how a talented, up-and-coming action director like Wimmer could go from Equilibrium to Ultraviolet in such a short time. Ultraviolet looked like a film that had great intentions when it first began but ended up looking lost and deflated by the time the credits rolled. Here's to hoping that Kurt Wimmer learns from this debacle and goes back to doing what made Equilibrium a cult-fave instead of the stuff he did that made Ultraviolet awful.s to have been rehashed from the gunkata of Equilibrium.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I was slightly disappointed with the new Pride and Prejudice.  I thought it was a good movie, but definitely does not compare to the A&E version.  I guess it's hard to squeeze all those details into a 2 hour movie.  It's definitely a good movie to watch if you have never seen the older versions of Pride and Prejudice.  The one thing I really liked was the ending.  That was very sweet and romantic.  I rewinded that part several times!  SIGH!!
B00004U2GH|5.0|I have been playing Johnny Cash cd's almost non-stop since I saw the movie, but I play this one the most. I hear different things in it at different times, and enjoy the talking and energy of the live audience.
B000089CKH|5.0|I just like Nada Surf,maybe that's why some people would say I'm not rating realistic but this CD is really good.Ok some songs are not so great but most of them are.And when I listen to it I just feel a little happier for the rest of the day.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|A number of reviewers have commented on the quality and extras of this set. I merely add a few interesting trivia bits related to the smash '80s comedy hit.<br /><br />Trivia bit one: Two cartoons are included in this set from \\"The Real Ghostbusters.\\" Why wasn't the animated series just called Ghostbusters? Because there was a great live action kids show called Ghostbusters which starred Larry Storch and Forrest Tucker from F Troop.<br /><br />When the movie of Ghostbusters came out, I wondered how it could have the same name as that kids' SatAm show. Well, it went OK for the movie, but when the animated spin off came out, trouble started. Filmation made a not very good cartoon version of the kids show called Ghostbusters, so the cartoon based on the movie (which is/ was a lot better) changed its name to The Real Ghostbusters. Later that series went downhill and also changed its name to Slimer and the Real Ghostbusters. The excellent live action kids' show has not yet made it to DVD, but a few episodes appeared on VHS as The Original Ghostbusters.<br /><br />Trivia bit two: Everyone knows the line from Ray Parker Jr.'s catchy theme song, \\"Who Ya Gonna Call?\\" But the spoken bit, \\"I ain't scared of no ghost\\" is taken from a 1937/38 Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy cartoon entitled \\"Lonesome Ghosts\\", where it's spoken by Goofy (This excellent cartoon is included in the Disney Treasures set Mickey Mouse in Color Volume One).<br /><br />Trivia bit three: The success of the Ghostbusters movie prompted Daffy Duck's return to the big screen in a quite good featurette called Daffy Duck's Quackbusters. His continued popularity eventually resulted in the Duck Dodgers series on Cartoon Network.<br /><br />Although Ghostbusters was one of the most popular comedy films of the '80s, I haven't seen and can't speak for the sequel, Ghostbusters II. Ghostbusters is also available in a triple pack along with two more Bill Murray comedies, Stripes and Groundhog Day.
B000E1YW04|5.0|I am still not yet to the point where I have grown tired of watching my favorite parts of this musical (or listening to them when I am driving in my car and away from my DVD players).  Ironically the touring company was next door in Wisconsin when the movie came out on DVD, but it will be back in a couple of weeks and I have tickets to go see it, even though it means driving from the shores of one Great Lake to another, because I really want to see what the show is like on stage.  What I do know at this point is that I like the music more than the characters, and the soundtrack more than the original cast album, although the legion of Rentheads out there may be horrified by such sentiments.  But then I never really related to the original Bohemian characters in Puccini's opera either.  I swear that Roger (Adam Pascal) looks like Moebius the Living-Vampire from Marvel comics and I cannot get past that idea. I should be able to identify with would-be filmmaker Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), but I like his ability to tango more than the cinematic style of his work.  Mimi (Rosario Dawson) is sexy, but dying, and Joanee (Tracie Thoms) and Maureen (Idina Menzel) cannot wholly commit to the idea that opposites attract. As for Benjamin (Taye Diggs), the dude is definitely slumming.<br /><br />The characters that I really care about are Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) and Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) because I think they best represent love amongst this group of friends.  I know that Mimi and Roger are supposed to be the main couple (\\"Light My Candle\\"), and that Maureen and Joanne are a truly combustible couple (\\"Take Me or Leave Me\\"), but the real love story is Angel and Collins and when I reduce the dynamic of \\"Rent\\" to a pair of songs I point to \\"I'll Cover You\\" and its reprise.  So even when logic dictates that this movie should be rated at 4.5 at best, I think of that final shot in the film of Angel and I have to round up become of its poignancy (the alternative ending, the smile on Tom's face when Angel walks by and holds his hand for a minute is almost as transcendent).<br /><br />Turning some of the songs into dialogue so it is not wall-to-wall singing was not necessary from my perspective. I am perfectly willing to listen to musicals or operas that are music and all singing from start to finish. Still, I appreciate the attempt to give the story a bit more dramatic weight by doing so.  Ultimately, what is so appealing about the music in \\"Rent\\" are the harmonies, as amply demonstrated by \\"Seasons of Love.\\"  Ultimately, the emotions matter more than the words. Is \\"La Boheme\\" any less effective because most of us do not know precisely what they are singing? After all, one of the most famous arias in the opera is Colline saying goodbye to his coat. When \\"Life Support,\\" \\"Will I\\" and \\"Another Day\\" combine at the end to make up \\"Finale B,\\" the lyrics are simplistic, but the emotional effect is (here comes the word again) transcendent, even compared to something like the sextet from \\"Lucia di Lammermoor.\\" In other words, the sound and fury signify a lot in \\"Rent,\\" and if in the end it all comes down to love that is not exactly a bad thing. Plus, with the six voices at the end (eight if you do the alternative version), I think most of us can find a vocal part to sing along with well within our comfort range, not that it stops us from switching parts and trying to be more ambitious. Larson also provides so many different types of songs that every couple of songs something in a style you really like comes along.<br /><br />I really like the soundtrack more than the original cast recording. Of course, six of the original cast are here, so I should point out that not only do I think that those six have brought a decade's worth of experiencing singing these songs to their performances but that the two newbies add something to the mix. Martin's \\"Santa Fe\\" and reprise of \\"I'll Cover You\\" evidence a great deal more depth as he puts his younger self to shame.  One my favorite vocal moments is in \\"Goodbye Love\\" when the voices of the two newcomers, Dawson and Thoms, blend and power through, \\"I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had, someone to live for, unafraid to say I love you.\\" The biggest heresy would be that I like the way \\"Finale B\\" is played straight for the emotional impact of Mimi's revival instead of the mock deus ex machina of the original (off) Broadway production.<br /><br />Again, I realize that those who have seen the musical can hold the exact opposite position and I fully appreciate that seeing the show live, especially songs like \\"Over the Moon,\\" is something different from this film. Beyond that, producer Rob Cavallo, known for his work with Green Day, did a great job of updating the sound for the 21st century. As for director Chris Columbus, it taking this particular musical to the streets he did not make it to the sacred heights of \\"West Side Story,\\" but I think \\"Rent\\" works a lot better than the likes of \\"Hair\\" and \\"Godspell\\" on the big scream.  Several of his montages, most notably for \\"Without You,\\" are quite effective, but I understand that some fans will not be able to get beyond the fact \\"Goodbye Love\\" is relegated to the deleted scenes.  The bottom line is that my affection for this movie is based more on the ear connected to the heart than the eye linked to the brain, and I will just leave it at that.  I certainly understand why so many people find \\"Rent\\" so profoundly moving.unger self to shame.

B00000DQWT|5.0|It was years ago that I first listened to this album, and it still sounds great today.  Metheny does a wonderful job of creating atmosphere by pulling together multiple influences. His choral setting of Psalm 121 is really amazing (I know of a number of choir directors who wish he had released the sheet music for it!) <br /> <br />Even today, Metheny allows himself to be influenced by his collaborations with other composers.  For example, he worked with Steve Reich on \\"Electric Counterpoint\\", then pulled together some of the same types of echoing repetition but with his own jazz stylings in the album \\"The Way Up\\". (BTW, both of these albums are also great!) <br /> <br />Regarding his collaboration with David Bowie: While I've always liked Bowie's music, I sincerely think that this work shows off Metheny's ability to write for and play off of a specific singer, rather than Bowie's ability to sing to a particular style. <br /> <br />Anyway, just my $0.02.
0743201140|3.0|Ok and quick read that has gallop poll backing for its personality profiling.  The premise is valid in that it focuses on identifying and improving your strengths and manageing or making your weaknesses competent.  Most seek to work on the weaknesses throughout their life instead of continuing to further develop those inherent strengths.  Love the website link with a personalized test to discover my strengths.
0060763280|5.0|This is a great how-to book on retooling your thinking for wealth building.  Mr. Eker drives the point home very well that wealth is more of a mind set than a skill set.  He does an excellent job of presenting his point and does not pull any punches.  For this reason, it is not a book for the faint harted in the game of making money.  He is quite pointed in showing you how to change your thinking to build and keep wealth, but emphasizes that you must change your thinking in order to achieve long term wealth.
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|Riding the heels of the smash hit \\"Basic Instinct\\" comes this cheesy film. I recall the marketing for this film--which was flat out false--making it seem like Sharon was back to manipulating and exuding sex. Wrong. <br /> <br />First off, the script is horrible and the actors struggle through it like it's their first time reading it. Next, you have Sharon's character: A weak, powerless victim of sorts. Once again, we were promised something different, the opposite if you will. And, many of the costars are just annoying and uninteresting at best. <br /> <br />Finally, there's the ending which they changed because some test audience didn't like it. The real ending has Tom Berenger as the killer/voyeur, and Stone in-turn kills him in defense. The new ending is really silly as Baldwin is discovered as the killer/voyeur and Stone tells him to \\"Get a life.\\" What a let down. <br /> <br />Why 4 stars you ask? As a guilty pleasure, it satisfies quite well. The music is good and Stone is fun to watch. But, if you take this film too seriously, you'll be let down with all the cheese. Get out the crackers!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This young singer is fabulous!  He sings renditions of many old and newer songs. His own song \\"Home\\" is outstanding and my favorite on the album.  To me he is a cross between Frank Sinatra and Van Morrison.  Saw him recently in performance in Chicago and WOW!  He puts on an incredible performance, is VERY crowd friendly.  I will be buying all his albums and seeing him in concert whenever in reasonable travel distance.
0060825219|5.0|As a fan of Paulo Coelho I have 9 of his books.  This book is as good, if not better than The Alchemist.  I literally can't put it down.
B000088E6D|5.0|I enjoyed this album immensely and now especially after seeing him in concert, I am a hooked fan.  He does indeed, as another reviewed mentioned, enjoy and put life into his music.  I place him as a cross between Frank Sinatra with a slight touch of Van Morrison in talent and style.  I am anxious for him to continue to develop his own material.  I loved his version of \\"Put Your Head on My Shoulder\\" on this album.

B000002G7G|4.0|This is an excellent effort by the Velvet Underground.  It is definitely my favorite album of theirs.  with such classics as Beginning to see the light, and Pale Blue eyes, it is really a good listen.  The poetry on Murder Mystery is powerful and thoughtful.  i would recomend this CD to anyone that likes the velvet underground.
B000088E6D|5.0|I don't like this album, I freaking love, love it. Why not, beautiful voice, beautiful songs. For a moment, I can truly believe this world is beautiful. A talented young man is enjoying singing these timeless songs, breathing new life into these songs and I'm having the time of my life enjoying listening to it. Life IS beautiful.
0393327655|5.0|Harris presents an intelligent analysis of the most critical issue facing humanity today.  That being, how can we continue to tolerate and even aplogize for dogmatic, fanatic, religious orthodoxy when these people can access weapons, perhaps nuclear, that destroy the entirety of humanity?  Harris clearly and calmly lays out the case that tolerance can no longer be the operative phrase as it pertains to our dealing with religious fundamentalism.  The fundamentalist, primarily from Islam, will all too gladly use any tool at their disposal to establish the earthly will of their God.
B00004XONN|4.0|If you are a casual listener to Radiohead \\"Kid A\\" will probably sound like a bunch of high-pitched gibberish over electronica, causing you to ask yourself, \\"is this music?\\".  To the Radiohead diehard, this album is pure genius;  an innovative string of songs that seem to flow into one another yet each have their own individual melody.   <br /> <br />The truth is if you like Radiohead, liking \\"Kid A\\" is a matter of preference - no matter what their fans may tell you.   <br /> <br />\\"Kid A\\"'s greatness lies in its circumstance.  It followed up one of the most acclaimed rock albums of all time in \\"OK Computer\\" and never once tried to repeat its success in the same fashion.  The common sequel to such an album would be always disappointing, however, Radiohead's follow up would only be more different than its predecessor. <br /> <br />The music on \\"Kid A\\" is a creative electronic blend of sounds that range from guitar to a trombone.  Thom Yorke's haunting vocals entrance the listener to a different universe.  The whole album acts as a soundtrack to something intangible giving it an almost surreal feel. <br /> <br />Personally I really like this album.  Some of my other friends who equally like Radiohead don't like it as much.  The album can be simply described as hit or miss.  Don't think you're not a faithful Radiohead fan if \\"Kid A\\" isn't your type. Its importance, however, is something that is not overlooked.    <br /> <br />All in all it's probably my second favorite Radiohead album, only to OK Computer and/or Amnesiac.  All three of them are up there for me.

B0000025P9|5.0|Once in a while, in the careers of certain bands, an album is produced that rides on a certain, unstoppable creative momentum. TOTO were one of the few bands to experience a wave of this sort in '81-2 when they recorded what is, without a doubt, their most accomplished and accessable album - \\"TOTO IV\\".<br /><br />The industry and record buying public acknowledged them further with a surge of 5 Grammy awards, including Best Album, Record of the Year (Rosanna) and Best Producer (Toto).<br /><br />It is no surprise to any reader or reviewer here that there are two songs on this LP that far outweigh the others in quality. \\"Rosanna\\" and \\"Africa\\" are absolute career-peak compositions by David Paich (the latter co-composed with Jeff Porcaro), indeed they are a peak for the eighties pop music canon and would both certainly feature in any serious pop/rock all time top 100 list.<br /><br />It's also no mystery to pop culture fanatics that \\"Rosanna\\" was named, after the song was finished for the beautiful actress Rosanna Arquette who, at the time, was dating Toto's keyboardist/vocalist Steve Porcaro. The song however, was not written specifically for her. Either way, Arquette must have gone very weak at the knees when she first heard this song - it is an astonishing tour-de-force by the band whose musicianship effectively shatters most of the opposition. You have to remember that all of the players in TOTO have 'to die for' studio credits on literally hundreds of recordings including albums like \\"Thriller\\" and works from artists like George Benson, Steely Dan, Rickie Lee Jones, Lionel Richie, Boz Scaggs, Melissa Manchester, Randy Crawford, Carly Simon, James Taylor - the list is literally endless. Just the drum track played effortlessly by Jeff Porcaro in \\"Rosanna\\", a complex take on the half-time shuffle, has been discussed by drum teachers and included in music text books ever since.<br /><br />The other track, \\"Africa\\" is one of the finest pop performances ever committed to vinyl. Another fantastic groove from the rhythm section, the finest vocal yet from David Paich (I doubt he will surpass it) and a sky high belted out chorus with Bobby Kimball soaring on backing vocals. The scope and grandeur of \\"Africa\\" is nothing short of cinematic and the solo keyboard from Steve Porcaro is astoundingly proficient and graceful - you wouldn't expect anything less from any player in the band. Listen carefully for David Hungate's ascending bass riffs at the end of the song. He has been dearly missed by me on all subsequent TOTO releases, and is still one of the most sought after session bass players in the business.<br /><br />When compared to \\"Rosanna\\" and \\"Africa\\", the remainder of songs on the album fall short but so does 99% of western popular music. In actual fact, the remaining tracks are superb support tracks and most of them near career high recordings for the band. There is a feeling of 'triumph' about the album which is irresistable.<br /><br />The horns and strings make every track feel like an anthem and even the lesser tunes are treated to such clever and imaginative arrangements they are a pleasure to listen to. My favourites: \\"Make Believe\\", \\"Good for You\\", \\"We Made It\\" and \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" with Steve Porcaro's \\"It's a feeling\\" providing an experimental, uplifting diversion. It's surprisingly tuneful and the variety added by Steve P's voice adds yet another dimension to the album.<br /><br />Despite a prolific number of vocalists in the band, it's really Bobby Kimball's specialised vocals that let the band soar and lend an organic R&B credibility to the sometimes overly technical arrangements of TOTO. He too was sorely missed after being asked to leave following this album.<br /><br />If you are familiar with the rest of TOTO's catalogue, then you will know that this is the album where their strengths are most to the fore and their weaknesses are held back. In short, they are at their most inspired here and for artists of thiscalibre, that means an album that will always be regarded as an iconic classic of it's time.n iconic classic of it's time.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" did what \\"Ray\\" did with regards to bringing forth music, that not of my generation and the trials and tribulations of life while bringing that music to its fans.  I am not a big Ray Charles fan, I like his unique voice and some of his ballads were very sentimental and the movie \\"Ray\\" was a good adaptation of his life, as I have known it through reading and such.  However, this review is about \\"Walk the Line.\\"  I particularly did not want to see it.  It was about country music singer which I am not a fan of and starred Mrs. Witherspoon who I thought would not be able to pull off the role.  However, I am a fan of Mr. Phoenix's work, therefore, I picked up a rental and watched it.  What I did not know is Mr. Phoenix did pretty much all the singing in the film and to even resemble Johnny Cash's voice with any kind of accuracy, like he did, is well spooky.  I mean, how many men can sing that low, in that characteristic Johnny Cash voice?  Well Phoenix nailed it, which proved again, that this actor is going to have a long career.  Not only was his singing phenomenal, but his acting as well.  Now, for Mrs. Witherspoon, the quirky blond with no real serious, dramatic roles, nailed her performance.  Now, I am wondering why \\"Walk the Line\\" was not nominated for best picture.  I can understand why Mr. Phoenix did not win best actor, because there were a lot of great actors there and I know that he will get his some day.  However, not nominating \\"Walk the Line\\" when you have movies such as \\"Capote,\\" \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" and \\"Good Night and Good luck (why was this film even nominated)\\" and then \\"Crash\\" which won!  Which I thought was good, but not as good as \\"Walk the Line.\\"  If you are not a Cash fan, like I am not, or care about the period of time that this takes place, like I wasn't particularly caring about, or a country music fan, like I definitely am not, I suggest that you see it anyway.  The acting was superb, the chemistry, the script, everything.  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Drama driven films, though there was some levity from Mrs. Witherspoon, anyone who are fans of the two lead actors and anyone who can appreciate a true work of art or anyone who likes country music and Johnny Cash-Of course.  I went from regretting and wanting to get over with this movie to regretting not seeing it on the big screen.  It is a keeper, buy it.ld recommend this film to anyone who likes Drama driven films, though there was some levity from Mrs. Witherspoon, anyone who are fans of the two lead actors and anyone who can appreciate a true work of art or anyone who likes country music and Johnny Cash-Of course.

B000001G7O|5.0|I've heard about twenty recordings of this piece and several live performances by some of today's most highly regarded violinists.

B000E5N62U|5.0|I have found with the last couple of Steely Dan albums that the music and words take time to reveal themselves and this is no different. My initial take was that I had heard it all before (13 years ago anyway) but after a few times through I found myself really getting into the songs. It's true that he seems to have a more direct way with the melody when he plays with Steely Dan, the melodies here are much more complex, but it works more often than it doesn't. On a track like 'The Great Pagoda Of Funn' the vocal harmonies float over his distinctive horn arrangements to achieve lift-off into something quite beautiful. Same for the title track where he turns the chorus on it's head just as you start to tire of it.    I am speculating wildly here but anyone who's ever read T.S Eliots 'The Love Song Of J Alfred Prufrock' might recognise the fog at the start of the poem as the erstwhile 'Morph' and what about Prufrocks angst at growing old? Just a thought.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|This is incredible. What a different form. What voice and music. This was a great find. Bartoli just works her voice . The music here is incredible. Once again another star who is keeping the younger ones enthralled and bringing new life to old. What she does on this cd is amazing and exciting. Would love to see her perform this recital. I have been exploring all this  and buying all kinds of opera and loving it. Of course the ones that brought me to it were Freni and Pavarotti. It bagan with their Butterfly, it was love. Now I continue to seek from the newer performers for new visions.
6300214028|5.0|Russophiles, lovers of romance, politics,the lost generation, and sweeping epics...do NOT miss this film. Those who love none of these things should ALSO see it. It is brilliant. I saw it first when it was released, and I was 19 years old.  I left the theatre sobbing (ok, I was such a drama queen in those days), and when I saw it again last year I *still* cried.  Moving, amazing, beautiful. I could hold forth on the specifics of the brilliance and accuracy (I've a background in the subject matter and am married to a Russian), but what really is the point.  The only important thing is to SEE THIS FILM!!

0393307050|5.0|The Aubrey/Maturin series is often described as the best <br />naval fiction or the best historical fiction ever written. <br />I'd certainly agree, and go further, awarding them the title <br />of the best series of novels ever written. <br /> <br />No other author I've read has constructed novel after novel <br />as detailed and inventive as these.

0812975219|4.0|From my blog:<br /><br />I read a great book last night (although it won't be for everyone) called \\"Fooled by Randomness - The Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and in Life\\" by Nassim Taleb. He is a mathematician who studies randomness (but the book is not a boring math book - not that math is boring)<br /><br />In simple terms it talks about luck and the problems it causes if we start to think it is skill or knowledge and not luck.<br /><br />Much of the book is about stock markets and I am not really a stock market guy (too focused on running SYNNEX to spend much time on the markets).<br /><br />He talks a lot about learning from mistakes and the fact that people are not very good at it.. True wisdom is being able to learn from other people's mistakes. I am still trying to learn true wisdom.<br /><br />One interesting story he told was of a person who lost $15,000,000 but was still worth a million dollars and how devastated he was. To quote: \\"There is a difference between wealth level reached from above and wealth reached from below.\\"<br /><br />Still, all this said, I am a great believer in the following quote which is attributed to Thomas Jefferson (and also Stephen Leacock (1869-1944) but since Jefferson came first (1743-1826), I accept him at the originator)<br /><br />\\"I am a great believer in luck and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it\\"<br /><br />At the same time, I know I am a very lucky person. There are few that have been able to live the experiences that I have.
B00065GX64|5.0|Released in 1931 by independent production company Nero Films, at the height of director Fritz Lang's career in Germany, \\"M\\" was Lang's first sound film and is second in renown only to his 1927 film \\"Metropolis\\". A serial child-killer who may have abducted and murdered as many as 8 little girls is on the loose in a German city. Citizens have become cautious, paranoid, wary of innocent conversations, suspicious of strangers, and quick to accuse anyone at the slightest provocation. The police have looked under every rock, combed through every blade of grass, arrested every miscreant with no consequence except an exhausted and overworked police force. The criminal underworld, frustrated by the constant police raids and resulting loss of income, decide that the only solution is to find the killer themselves. So two simultaneous manhunts ensue, one by the police and one by the criminals.<br /><br />Because this was his first \\"talkie\\", \\"M\\" was also the first film that Fritz Lang did not edit himself. Editor Paul Falkenberg does a great job of cross-cutting between the police and underworld strategy meetings and of letting Hans Beckett's pathetic speech before the kangaroo court run. The editing really makes those scenes memorable. Comparing this edit of \\"M\\" to some of the other, choppier versions that were released over the years highlights Falkenberg's good judgment. The criminals' \\"kangaroo court\\" is a powerful sight, and it gives actor Peter Lorre the opportunity to define Hans Beckett late in the film. Lang used real members of the Berlin underworld as extras and was forced to get his footage in time for them to elude the cops, who had been tipped off.  The tune that Hans Beckett whistles was actually whistled by scriptwriter Thea von Harbou, Fritz Lang's wife at the time, by the way. To Lang's irritation, Peter Lorre could not whistle.<br /><br />\\"M\\" is often cited as the first film in which a monstrous criminal was portrayed in a sympathetic light, as a feeling person compelled by an almost irrestible compulsion. But what Fritz Lang was trying to say in \\"M\\", if anything, has long been the subject of debate. The debate took on political significance in Nazi Germany. Nazi Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels admired \\"M\\" because it advocated the death penalty, but \\"M\\" was later used in an anti-Jewish propaganda film accusing Peter Lorre of trying to create sympathy for child-murders with his portrayal of Hans Beckman. Fritz Lang did advocate the death penalty and, in interviews, didn't seem to agree that Beckman was depicted sympathetically, so I don't think \\"M\\" was intended in the way it is often taken today. It may be unlikely that a film would be received in the spirit it was made 75 years later and several cultures apart. But today's viewers either find Hans Beckman sympathetic or they do not, just like audiences in 1931.<br /><br />The DVDs (Criterion Collection 2004 2-disc set): There have been many different edits of \\"M\\" over the years, initially on account of language difficulties in distributing the film outside of Germany. This 111-minute version of the film is as close to Fritz Lang's original as we will ever get, barring the discovery of earlier prints, which editor Paul Falkenberg says contained a few more scenes. This transfer retains the film's original aspect ratio, the short-lived 1.19:1, so it is pillarboxed, meaning that there are thin black bars on the sides of the screen (the opposite of letterboxing). The print has been restored, with major flaws removed, but there are still white specks and lines in a few scenes. Sound is good. The film is in German with optional English subtitles.<br /><br />All bonus features are on Disc 2: \\"Conversation with Fritz Lang\\" (48 min) is a 1975 interview filmed by director William Friedkin.

B00005V9HH|5.0|Sometimes what happens with a film is that one thing tends to define it without acknowledgeing the rest of it. Many people remember Usual Suspects but most of them will usually just go \\"yeah that ending rocked!\\" without saying anything about the rest of them movie. Well before the X-Men and upcoming Superman, Bryan Singer made this film, a film that is better than that one little scene at the end by itself.<br /><br />Verbal Kint is telling a story about how a boat got attacked and near 30 people were dead. In his story we meet 5 criminals who are called in about a robbery. There in lock up they meet, and decide to team up and take on some jobs. Verbal, McManus, Finster, Keaton and Hockney do some small jobs until a lawyer comes up to them and mentions a difficult job and the one wanting it done is Keyzer Soze, a legendary killer if there ever was one. So the question is who is it and does he even exist.<br /><br />Usual Suspects was one of those kind of slow burner films where it didn't make much money but it did garner 2 Oscars, one for Kevin Spacey and one for Screenplay. Then the greatness kicked in where everyone saw how good it was and it became one of the 90's best films. Most of that was probably due to word of mouth about the twist ending which is as shocking as it is familiar so it's actually been parodied a number of times, including Scary Movie and even Dr Doolittle.<br /><br />What makes the film work is not only the direction, score and the acting but it's a very sharply written story. Extra attention needs to be paid and in many scenes required repeated viewing to make sense of it. While the ending to some might cheapen the film, it works given the context. It's also very fascinating to watch the film; even though the film might have a leisurely pace, it never gets boring or makes you getting antsy.<br /><br />Currently #16 on IMDB's list, it's one of those films where people will outright hate it because they didn't get it or praise it for its complex narrative. I'm the latter and it's a film that definately deserves a buy.s complex narrative. I'm the latter and it's a film that definately deserves a buy.

B00007GZR5|4.0|How far would you be willing to go for your loved one(s)? It's always odd to see couples who fight about going to the movies or not wanting to visit your in-laws(which I won't argue with), here's a film where you're literally willing to go to Hell and back for the one you love. It's the very idea of true love that's for once on screen and the hope of what happens when death literally does you part. <br /> <br />Chris meets Annie one day and the 2 become inseperable and get married. Years later they have 2 kids, which unfortunately are taken away from them in one day. Years later, celebrating an anniversary, Chris is also taken away. In the afterlife, he experiences everything spectacular your eyes can see, except one problem: due to grief and her suicide, Annie has to go to Hell. So Chris decides to go to Hell and bring her back. <br /> <br />Beating Mighty Joe Young and Armageddon in the Visual Effects Oscar race, the film definately looks beautiful and colorful, especially in the afterlife where it resembles freshly painted canvas. For me personally where it gets lost is when we go to Hell when there's several funky shots that look a bit too CG but for the most part it's a very lush looking film. <br /> <br />Acting wise it's very solid with Robin Williams finally showing he can be charming and likable without being manic and hyperactive(Robots, Aladdin anyone?) and Annabella Sciorra is great as the doomed wife. Oddly enough they don't have much chemistry which is odd, both are good performances but not enough chemistry. Everybody else is great including Cuba Gooding Jr as a kind of afterlife helper. <br /> <br />It's the kind of film where it's depressing and hopeful at the same time. The idea of killing off an entire family and one of them goes to Hell is quite sad but everything else gives us hope about where we'll end up when we \\"shuffle off this mortal coil\\". It's a rare film where there's enough religious and spiritual imagery and concepts without being kindof \\"doesn't our way of life rule\\" which I always hated about those kind of films. You can be thought provoking without being evangelists in disguise. <br /> <br />It's a leisurely paced film and its not very action-y but it gets to us through imagery and thought which is just fine with me.

015603252X|5.0|Reading this book was for me like looking at a family album while my host (whose album this is) tells me about the photographs quietly, gently, his sad eyes fixed on the back of my head.  And as I looked I realized that the photographs (the still lives captured on this page and that) are photos of photos of photos; that behind them simmer reflections of things not in the image itself; that they are photos of the same scene but taken with many cameras, seen with many eyes; and slowly, gradually I realize that I am in the photographs also-a kind of ghost guided inside by my host-and I step in and look around.<br /><br />Until finally, I come to the last photograph in the album (not the last photograph; just the last photograph in that particular album) and I look at it, at its grey rain, at its sadness and I don't close the album.<br /><br />That is what reading this incredible book is like-and that is why I heartily recommend it to anyone who ever hesitated to speak of himself, his family, his heart.
1932100385|1.0|This book proves the point that science is often heavily biased towards a particular viewpoint. The author wishes to prove the value of a vegetarian diet and does so using mere associations that are not scientific. There is little true science in this book, and I was very disenchanted with it.

055380457X|5.0|A valuable invention is one that quickly makes itself indispensable to a lot of users.  There are few that have been so obviously and immediately shown as valuable as Google, which has found a niche that hardly existed ten years ago, and has made itself the best and most useful search engine on the Internet.  Type in a few key words and you get pages and pages of information back regarding the topic you sought.  It is a little miracle how wonderfully it works; cartoonist Gary Trudeau calls Google \\"the Swiss Army knife of information retrieval\\".  Enormously successful as an Internet tool and as a business, Google is worth learning about, and in _The Google Story: Inside the Hottest Business, Media, and Technology Success of Our Time_ (Delacorte Press), David A. Vise and Mark Malseed have reported a unique and fascinating story of the company whose name has become a key word in the way we learn stuff.  \\"Google\\" has even become a verb; you can Google a topic, or even your own name, and find out all sorts of interesting stuff.  Of course, that's if you are in an English speaking country; otherwise, you would want to _Googelte_, _Googlata_, or  _Guguru_ if you are in Germany, Finland, or Japan, respectively; Google is changing the way the world talks and works.<br /><br />Google is the brainchild of two remarkable eggheads who met in 1995 in graduate computer studies at Stanford University, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.  They were on their way to get their doctorates and become professors, but a good idea got in the way.  They developed a search algorithm based on analyzing links to pages; the most relevant sites would tend to be the ones that were referenced (linked) by the most other sites (just as the most important scientific papers are the ones most referenced in other papers).  The second great innovation by the pair was to run the algorithm on what are essentially ordinary PCs, thousands of them in racks, custom-wired to work together in processing search inquiries.  The resulting search engine was vastly better than any other.  One collaborator after another has been delighted to find that Brin and Page are honest and like working hard, and that even though they may talk with dead seriousness about hardware and software, they are funny, genuinely nice people who were not so geeky that they knew nothing but computers.  They had bunches of humane, novel, and sensible ideas about how to run a company.  Google's product is so good that it simply does not need to advertise.  In a few short years, it was worth more than General Motors.<br /><br />Page and Brin have made mistakes.  The announcement of Google's Gmail system, which would put advertising announcements beside your e-mail based on what the e-mail contents revealed about your interests, raised privacy concerns.  Digitizing old books from libraries is all right, but publishers sued when copyrighted books were to be available on Google.  In 2004 Google brought its news service to China and agreed to omit links that the Chinese government didn't want the Chinese people to see.  Google has the tongue-in-cheek motto \\"Don't be evil\\", and some observers have thought that in bowing to the wishes of the Chinese rulers it had violated the motto.  Nonetheless, Google has forever changed how we gather information, and its young inventors have had fun and been helpful (goals they would rate higher than getting rich).  _The Google Story_ is a business text, a history of a company and how it became successful, but the company is so extraordinary that the book is full of delightful surprises in every chapter.s.

0006547745|4.0|This book is depressing, consicence-alerting, yet great fun at the same time. Travelling from Mount Athos, via Istanbul to Turkish Kurdistan, then to Syria, Lebanon, Israel/Palestine and finally Egypt, Dalrymple surveys the condition of Near Eastern Christianity on the verge of the third Christian millennium. For the most part, this is a depressing story of a community in terminal decline, facing pressure from extremists and economic chaos. While there is no doubt that his sympathies lie with the Christians, he can be deeply critical of them where he feels it is deserved - for example there is no doubt that the holds the Maronites of Lebanon almost entirely responsible for the Lebanese Civil War. <br /> <br />As a travelogue, it generally makes good reading, with an excellent balance between keeping the pace moving and covering people and places in enough depth. His ability to conjure images of places is remarkable - really feel like I'm on the plains of the Tr Abdin, or winding down the mountain road from Damascus to Beirut with him. Sometimes, it has to be said, he lays on the 'gee-whiz I'm an Englishman abroad in scary countries with bombs and tanks and things' attitude a bit too much. While he occasionally has a factual lapse or three, he more than makes up for it in atmosphere. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most interesting and amusing sections deal with the various wacky heretical Christian sects which inhabited the shatterzone between the Greek and Persian worlds before the arrival of Islam. <br /> <br />This book annoyed a lot of extreme American fundamentalists (of both the Christian and the Jewish varieties) for being rather critical of Israel's decades-long campaign of cultural and economic pressure on the Palestinian Christians. What better recommendation to buy the book to you need! <br /> <br />One minor gripe, I never do trust fellow Celts who think of themselves as merely North- or West-Britons. Dalrymple regards English football hooligans rampaging through Istanbul as his 'fellow countrymen' stuck me as bizarre. Are you really a Scot, William? <br /> <br />And I have one big question if Dalrymple ever reads this... he seems not to speak a word of Turkish or Kurdish yet he seems to have these interesting conversations with Kurdish builders about the Armenians... Are all these guys fluent in English or something? 'Coz that's a part of the world I know very well, and in my experience, they don't English any more than your average Dunfermline brickie speaks Kurdish. If you can really do that without the lingo, William, could you give me a masterclass in sign language? <br /> <br />It also seems to fair to point out that the situation for Christians in some parts of the Middle East, notably Turkey and Egypt, has improved considerably in the 10 years since this book was researched.  <br />
B0001L3MI0|4.0|No doubt Independence Day is a pretty entertaining film.  The acting is a bit of a stretch at times (the best performances seem to be given by the supporting actors/actresses instead of the mainstay people, save for Will Smith's comedic role as Captain Hiller).  Vivica A. Fox provides a touching, well-acted and believable role in the movie, as does Mary McDonnell as the First Lady; environmentalist and scientific genius David Levinson is a bumbling and comedic, though unbelievable especially during his \\"drunk\\" rants and raves about blowing up the earth, when really someone that wasted wouldn't be able to talk that fast or in such detail (interestingly, the actor who plays him is the same as Jurassic Park--and his characters speak under their breaths as well).  Thoroughly entertaining in many ways.  Of course, the aliens have two legs and two eyes, making them more human--which is something they wouldn't be scientifically because they'd be somewhat related to the human race if they were so; they also look quite familiar to last year's War of the Worlds.  Overall, Independence Day is brilliant save for some acting.
6305313687|4.0|The message of American History X is pretty simple: racism is bad, and joining a neo-Nazi gang is not going to solve any of your problems - becoming an English Literature teacher or a film actor would be much more constructive. You may have thought this would be fairly self-evident but Holywood obviously thinks we need yet another lecture on this subject - and by rights this film should have become yet another clumsily preachy morality play. <br /> <br />Edward Norton's astounding performance saved it from this fate. His acting is at its best when his character Derek is at his worst. Derek is a troubled teen who turns to neo-Nazism when his fireman father is murdered by black gang members, Derek's powerful oration, lightning sharp mind and leadership skills help propel a group of Hitler-worshipping beach bums into one of the most dangerous gangs in Los Angeles. Delivering his poisonous orations, whether against his mother's Jewish boyfriend or to whip up his followers before assaulting a group of innocent Latino shop workers, Norton imbues Derek's vitriolic rhetoric with power and just enough truth to make any white liberal squirm. However inside prison Derek finds that truth is no more black and white than skin colour and when he crosses white gang leaders he must depend on a black fellow-inmate to save his life. Derek plays his transformation as well as he is allowed by a clumsy script, with sensititvity and tact. <br /> <br />There are some other strong performances in the film, notably from Edward Furlong of Terminator II fame playing Derek's wannabe Nazi younger brother, Fairuza Balk as Derek's wonderfully nasty and unrepentant girlfriend and Guy Torry as the witty, trash-talkin', black petty criminal who saves Derek's life. These are sadly balanced by dreadful overacting by Avery Brooks (Cisco of Deep Space Nine) and Beverly d'Angelo (Ellen Griswold of National Lampoon) as Derek's headmaster and mother respectively. <br /> <br />What really lets the film downis the weakness of the 'bad guys' - other than Balk, Norton's fellow gang members are cardboard-cutout stereotypes of rednecks and overweight white trash, and the black gang members they fight are equally two-dimensional villains, as are most of Norton's fellow inmates in prison. You can always tell the bad guys - they're fat, obsessed with tattoos and they smoke. This says more about the prejudices of the Holywood wealthy than it does about anything else. Anyone disagreeing with any part of American liberal orthodoxy is also turned into a carboard racist - noticeably Derek's father; obviously not being a committed supporter of affirmative action is just one step away from joining a neo-Nazi gang and murdering innocent people... oh, and all the good guys are English teachers, or want to become English teachers, or are reading serious English literature to transform themselves from evil gang members into good guys. <br /> <br />All in all though, there is much more good than bad in this film, and it is well worth watching; by the end I cared enough about the main characters to find the finale genuinely upsetting; it just isn't quite as good as they hype implies. <br /> <br />Oh, the cinematography, especially for a relatively low budget film, is beautifully done.

0743442539|5.0|After 40 years this still remains Le Carre's finest work. This is a lean, taut and gripping book. It, like so much of Le Carre, paints an essentially bleak portrait of the human condition but leaves room for individuals to act nobly and courageously. <br /> <br />The book was published in 1962 when the cold war was at its coldest. Alec Leamas, a worldweary but experienced agent on his way down is asked to take on a final mission. In the course of this he discovers the love which has so obviously been missing so far in his life.  <br /> <br />Of course the characterisations are antiseptic, anaemic even. That helps give the book it's gorgeously bleak feel, and of course Le Carre wants to make the point that the morally relativistic world of espionage is inherently desensitising and dehumanising. The book poses the question \\"Are there any good guys left or have all sunk to the lowest common denominator?\\" <br /> <br />To say more about the plot would be to spoil too much. Let's just say as well as the deeper questions it posits, it has a fast-paced, thrilling storyline which may even appeal to lovers of lower grade spy fiction. Buy it! You won't regret it.  <br />

B000BBYMA2|5.0|Battle Royale.... Wow, what a movie viewing experience. First off I have to commend the director, Kinji Fukasaku (who directed over 50+ films in Japan) for actually having the nerve to direct such a movie. I personally could not classify what genre this film is, but it is definitely in the realm of \\"horror\\" and here is why...<br /><br />The Synopsis:  The turn of the century.  Japan is on the brink of collapse.  Fearing rising indiscipline and rebellion amongst the youth of the nation, authorities pass the Millennium Educational Reform Act, allowing the implementation of the `Battle Royale' programme: classes of 14 and 15 year-olds are chosen at random and sent to a remote island where they are given weapons and three days to kill one another, until the sole survivor emerges as the winner.<br /><br />As I viewed this film (and I have seen a LOT of Japanese films) I felt very sad for what these kids, or should I say \\"children\\" had to experience, but here I was, experiencing this tragic roller-coaster ride right there with them. From the opening SECONDS of Battle Royale, I was caught up in the mayhem and it did not let go until the credits started rolling.<br /><br />You have to understand that the majority of these kids don't want to kill their classmates, some unfortunately do, but for the most part, most don't want too. They are chosen to carry the burden of what society deems as the \\"rebellious youth\\". They are the ones that are to be made the example of what happens when you disregard \\"authority\\". What makes this all the more tragic is that this particular group of students are not the ones that should be battling; they are not the indiscipline youth, they are not the rebellious youth, they are not disregarding authority. What they are though, are just regular children who have dreams and aspirations, and who just wanted to lead a normal school life...until they are thrust in to the \\"Millennium Educational Reform Act aka BATLLE ROYALE PROGRAM\\".<br /><br />As for technical side of the movie; I would have to say the Kinji Fukasaku directed what I considered one of his best movies. The movie is tightly paced and never let's up; Kinji let's you breathe for perhaps a moment but then he hits you unexpectedly. Great direction.<br /><br />As you probably have heard before, this movie is extremely violent, but it is certainly not senseless. It is not the violence that is shocking in B.R., it is the realization of who is performing the violent acts that are truly haunting. The children are forced to kill or be killed, nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />As for the music, it contains well-known classical pieces as well as having it's own classical pieces that plays throughout the movie. It presents the movie with a sense of a being a sort of tragic stage play.<br /><br />The acting was very believable for the most part, each character displaying emotions such as fear, shyness, deception, love, jealousy, humiliation and helplessness with convincing potrayals. What is great about each character is that it hurts you when every one of them dies, because they are that REAL. I particularly enjoyed Takeshi Kitano's performance of the school teacher, I truly believe he wasn't acting at all, it was just him playing himself.<br /><br />So is Battle Royale a masterpiece? I would have to say \\"YES\\" simply for the fact that after viewing the film, you will never forget it. It is a beautifully haunting piece of cinema that will thoroughly exhaust you by the end of the movie but also invite you into the deeper interpretation that the film provides. Definitely check BATTLE ROYALE out.>As for technical side of the movie; I would have to say the Kinji Fukasaku directed what I considered one of his best movies.

B000B7HZXM|5.0|I have always liked Mr. Stewart, but since he has recorded the last 4 songbooks, I have really appreciated his singing.  Every song is so special but here are my favorites: <br /> <br />On It Had to Be You.........These Foolish Things <br />   As Time Goes By..........Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered <br />   Stardust.................Baby, It's Cold Outside <br />   Thanks For the Memory....Long Ago and Far Away <br /> <br />Listening to him makes me happy!
B000DZIGDU|1.0|JARHEAD makes Marines look like a bunch of purposeless, immature, undisciplined, hyper-emotional, m[censored]ing, crybaby, clowns who can't even take a step on their own without their `daddy' staff-sergeant telling them to keep their eyes open or to stay in formation as if they learned nothing from boot-camp or in their advanced MOS (Military Occupational Skills) schools before being deployed.  At least the haircuts were authentic as well as a few trademark terms such as \\"ooh-rah,\\" \\"s[censored]-birds,\\" \\"the big green [censored],\\" and \\"the suck.\\"  Although during my active duty (1981-1985), I never heard anyone say \\"welcome to the suck\\" as I recall hearing twice in the movie.  It was always \\"f[censored] the suck,\\" which was a phrase only used by the s[censored]-birds.  I also remember during my enlistment that every single bullet had to be accounted for, which made the Jihadist scene (firing all the weapons into the air in celebration) near the end even more ironic, considering that one of the scout snipers had just previously been crying and throwing a tantrum for not even being allowed to shoot one single bullet.  The portrayal of esprit de corps consisted of forcibly branding \\"USMC\\" onto one Marine's leg in one scene while allowing another Marine to run through a hail of mortar fire only to be intentionally handed a dead battery for communications vital to the entire unit in another scene.  Yes, I'm sure the Marine Corps has always had its share of \\"[censored]-birds,\\" but I suspect this movie tells us much more about the narrator himself than it does about the Marine Corps of 1991.  So if you're looking for an authentic Marine Corps movie, skip _Jarhead_ and stick with _Full Metal Jacket_.
B0000214F0|3.0|This movie is a must see for any fan of Ancient History - or more particularly - Ancient Rome.  Caligula is sure to shock, arouse and make your stomach turn.. but will keep you captivated till the very end.  Be warned, if you are offended by graphic sex and violence then this movie is not for you.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I have to say that this is one of their best albums. And that's saying something considering how much I love Dream Theater. A truly great band can change while remaining themselves, and Dream Theater does that with the best of them. While I truly loved their last album: Train of Thought, I have to rank Octavarium above it as one of the top 3 albums by DT. Along with it up there are Awake (the bands signature album) and Images and Words (their first good album). <br /> <br />Each song on this CD is carefully crafted and perfectly arranged. Using a small orchestra to add flare to their Prog-rock style, they have created a masterpiece. I loved almost every song on this album from the very first listen. While a lot softer then Train of Thought, it's really a follow up piece to it with the first track on Octavarium even sharing several lyrics from it. If there's any weakness to this album it's that you really should hear the previous one before this one. However, it's not essential and so can be overlooked. <br /> <br />Overall, probably one of the best albums released by anyone since Awake. Can be enjoyed by fans of DT, newcomers to DT, fans of Prog Rock, fans of Metal and fans of artfully crafted music reminiscent of Pink Floyd.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|This was a great CD.  If you enjoyed the prior 3 CDs you will <br />love this one.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|One of the best new movies in quite a while. This film takes a new angle on the world of vampires and werewolves. It's refreshingly different from both all other modern films and from the classic horror style vampire movies. <br /> <br />I wont give away any of the plot here but there are several twists and it can be a little confusing on the first viewing. But stick with it and watch it a second time if you must. It's worth the effort. While it's an action film at its heart, there is enough thought put into this to be intelligent. Don't expect every second to be explosions but expect enough gun battles and special effects to keep that crowd interested. <br /> <br />Really worth the time to see it at least once. My wife and I both loved it and enjoyed the sequel (which features one of the hottest love scenes ever).
B00005JOFO|5.0|One of the best real life drama adaptations I've so far seen. A great movie it was to my point of view.<br /><br />I am a very tough to please and satify expectator and even when I wasn't completely thrilled by the speed in which the film states out it's objective, I got to see Very good acting and a very well sought out script. A really cruel story it turns out to be, such as reality sometimes is.<br /><br /> I'm giving this one straight out 5 stars... to go along with the other very little movies which have the honor of becoming (to my intellegence) masterpieces or very well pointed out dares to society's volition (i.e. Schindle's list).<br /><br />This movie roughly portrays a cinical sexual reality some of us just wont even try to understand. Nevertheless, wisefuly or stupidly, the one and only universal language spoken by all human beings is Love.. in wich ever manner it comes... ¨Hatred stirs up dissension but Love will cover up multitude of sins¨. Proverbs 10:12.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|If you worship David Gilmour from the Floyd days you will no doubt find a way to like and praise this CD.   <br /> <br />If you don't, well, I'd be very surprised if you find it to be much better than background music that you don't have to or want to pay attention to.  The many glowing reviews simply baffle me. <br /> <br />I say this as a big Gilmour fan.  The second star is no doubt my bias coming through.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|And by the way, no matter how much attachment Naomi Watts had to the ape - it's still a 25-foot-ape. She's not going to be THAT emotionally attached to him.  <br /> <br />Not unless she had a death wish. <br /> <br />There's a very good two-hour movie locked deep within this overly long, overly serious movie.
B00005A0ZH|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece. Period. Bad reviews generally come from critics that fail to get the movies' intention: there is no intention different from telling the story from Christopher Colombus' perspective of the events that he unfolded. From the film maker there is no desire to have a blockbuster movie or to win audiences, this movie has no compromise other than to make a beautiful work of art that depicts and celebrates a extraordinary event. And it is an extraordinary event indeed. Some try to minimaze the powerful clash of cultures and sense of discovery that happened in the year 1492: the world was changed, long way more that the man getting to the moon (I remember a critic complaining that the director showed the arrival of Colombus as more spectacular than the Apollo 11 landing; well, it was!). Perhaps you might fail to catch on this idea and others the movie represents if you are not from  Latin America. Perhaps. In the movie without any effort Riddley Scott shows how Spain's politics of that time corrupted  the new world even using Colombus as a mere instrument and moreover, Columbus also contributed to make everything a mess due to personal interests. This type of government is something that has repercussions today in Central and South American countries, more than 500 years later.  And this movie is historically correct, contrary to what another reviewer said. Obviosly, there is a voluntary lack of accuracy to help story telling and visual representation: the first sighting of land was around 2 AM, not during the day; the movie shows Columbus in two voyages, when he did 3 in the period the movie represents. Another criticism is for Grard Depardieu casting and accent, well, the real Colombus was a foreigner in Spain, so he must have spoke with an accent. Depardieu's cast was an asset.  The score from Vangelis is impressive and has become a world music contemporary classic and all the acting is more than competent. See this movie for what it is, a cinematic experience that describes what happened in 1492, a year the old world changed when a new world was discovered. Do not expect a Hollywood absent minded super production with lots of action and scripted drama. If that's all you like, you might not like this masterpiece.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Diplomat Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) receives news that his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) has been killed in Kenya. Justin's British reserve goes so deep that he hardly blinks, and apologizes to the man who had to bear the news. Despite the calm formality, his eyes flicker with pain. <br /> <br />The Constant Gardener is a decidedly British film, a political thriller that displays low-key intelligence and yet crackles with intrigue. There are no shootouts or heroics, nor are there dramatic clues left behind at every location. Instead we are given a complicated, intersecting web of seedy diplomats, greedy corporations, battered third-world war zones, and merciless contract killers. Beneath all this, a touching human story punctuates every frame. <br /> <br />Before her death, Tessa was a leftist activist who traveled throughout Africa. Treading through Kenya alone would be dangerous for anyone, much less a pregnant British woman, but she does so with nave zeal, desperate to help anyone she can. Although Justin found these qualities attractive in the first place, they are getting tiresome. Tessa rarely comes home, and spends a startling amount of time with an African doctor, a sore point that generates no shortage of rumor. At the time of her suspicious death, Tessa was a key component of an investigation into the habits of a parsimonious pharmaceutical company, and Justin finds himself quickly sucked into his wife's work. Obsessively diving into the Africa his wife knew, Justin begins to acquire the same qualities that made Tessa a great person, and got her killed. <br /> <br />The Constant Gardener pays great respect to the intelligence of the audience, all but unheard of for a left-leaning political thriller. Tessa's death comes right away, but almost immediately the film cuts to flashbacks, correctly assuming that attentive audience members don't need it spelled out. The British nature of the story works very well; characters rarely say exactly what runs through their minds, but use subtle wording and veiled threats to convey the plot. Instead of long-winded monologues of The Contender or Good Night, and Good Luck, we simply watch events play out, free to make up our own minds. <br /> <br />Yet, most interesting is the story of Justin and Tessa's marriage. Justin had a deep but almost bemused love for his wife, who never seemed to forget about her humanitarian work for a minute. At the time of her death, the marriage appeared to be crumbling, Justin nearing the end of his rope with her secrecy and absences.  <br /> <br />Through the course of his investigation, he discovers things about Tessa that he never knew, peeling back the layers until he sees what sort of person she really was at the core. Her generosity was infectious, and changes him profoundly. Many of us wish for a few more minutes with someone that we lost; Justin's longing for Tessa builds in his eyes until looking at him is like peering into the sun. <br /> <br />The Constant Gardener works splendidly on every level it exists. Simultaneously suspenseful, touching, and thought provoking, the film can justly take a seat with the other great issue pieces of 2005, though it will not be remembered solely for its views on drug companies. Any film maker who wants to touch on politics should take a note; lectures are boring, great stories are not. <br />
B000088E6D|5.0|I FIND IT INSPIRATIONAL TO SEE AN INCREDIBLY TALENTED YOUNG SINGER SING SONGS THAT ELEVATE ONE'S SPIRITS AND REKINDLE THE FLAME OF LIFE IN THIS MANNER. <br />TRULY INSPIRATIONAL AND SO NEEDED IN THE WORLD WE FIND OURSELVES IN. <br />AFTER DISCOVERING MICHAEL BUBLE ON THE EXCELLENT CD IT'S TIME, I HAVE ADDED THIS GREAT ONE TO MY COLLECTION AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.
B000002A3T|4.0|All the Pink Floyd stylings are evident in this release, perhaps self-consciously lifted from their classic 70's albums Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here & Animals, so it's not really a progressive album in the true sense of the genre, but the songs and performances are so strong that doesn't really matter. Although this LP is a memorable and perhaps fitting end to the Pink Floyd oeuvre, it would be great to hear Roger Waters's lyrical bite back on a reunionified line-up and, after The Live8 concert and reading Nick Masons recent book, perhaps the millions of fans can dream on with high hopes.
B000E6UK32|3.0|Most of the songs are the shortened/edited single versions.  Not the album versions.  Too bad.  However, within the CD/DVD packaging, there is advertising for all the albums (even Hunter) stating there are bonus tracs.  I guess this CD is a come-on to buy all the original albums.  Almost no liner notes--no who's who or timeline history or anything.  Again, too bad.  Sounds good.
0525948023|2.0|The views stated in the book are no more, no less similar to those of Krishnamurti and Osho, to name a few. You'd be better off reading those individuals.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is the kind of real music Ive been looking forward to for a long time now.  Something you can just kick back to and thoroughly enjoy.  Tracks 1,2, 3, 10 are my favorites.  Several others are at least nice songs, and maybe 1 or 2 are throw-aways.  Its not perfect.  Few achieve perfection, and even fewer do it twice in a lifetime (Dark Side).  You know you want to get this.  If its not your cup of tea, you're out of 10 f'ing bucks.  But who knows....maybe it will grow on you and be something special.  Its worth it.
B00008J4P5|4.0|The White Stripes,are a solid rock band even though thier songs are mostly simple arrangements. The Stripes give us a great Flashback into 1970's rock and roll. Even though sometimes I think they might be a bit over-rated, I love the fact that they really dont try to do anything flashy, and just play some good straight up stoner rock and roll. This is one of the better pop rock bands out there, and I suggest that if you looking for some good rock from this era, and like the sound of 70's rock, then this will be right up your alley.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Every song on this CD is GREAT; I cannot quit listening!  Although I'm a huge Bob Marley fan, I was not terribly excited when my husband brought this CD home but became a quick fan!  I love that the songs are all quite different so no need to skip thru any of them.  I've highly recommended this CD to all my friends & family.  It's becoming one of my favs of all time!!!  Respect to Jr Gong!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead is a treat for those that still like progressive rock, if you want to call them that, but I really wouldnt know what other label you could call them. FOr those that are not familar with the band, be prepared to take a great journey of musical madness, with music that changes so much are so often, you wonder how they put it all together and make it work. Of course, Radiohead isnt exactly going to light you up with blazing speed and agression, but their format is perfect for what type of music they write, and they are the best rock band (second to the Foo Fighters) for this ERA. I highly reccomend this CD for anyone looking for something different, because it is THAT different, and it is that good, which makes it an easy 5 star effort.
0385486804|4.0|I picked up this book at random, and was pleasantly surprised and engaged. I thought the author's point was made over and over and rather forcefully, which was fine, I suppose. I am, however, still unconvinced.<br /><br />Further than enjoying the book for its own sake, however, I was absolutely captivated by the bibliography it contained. I thought it drew on a surprisingly wide -- for its size -- array of very interesting-sounding books. Some references (e.g. Thoreau, London) were completely expected, but there were some which I thought made delightful connections that I'm looking forward to chasing down.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a story about a stupid kid, his stereotypical mexican friend Pedro, and a slightly more smart girl. If your wandering what the movie is about, it's about nothing. No plot or anything. It's very stupid. I heard everyone saying it's the greatest movie on earth. I saw it and there were about 50 scenes that tried to make you laugh, and I only laughed at 3 (Napoleon get a steak thrown at his face; his uncle says \\"Get some pampers for you and your brother\\":the scene with Pedros cousins). Other than that, you might get a smirk at all the other scenes. <br />If you truly love movies, don't watch this. If you truly like comedies, you might like this. If you are currently reading this review while on illegal drugs, this movie was made for you.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Heat has it all, 2 fine actors in Pacino and Deniro, great action scenes and a great screenplay. With Pacino and Deniro in this you would think that would be enough but the screenplay allows for other fine actors to shine through and make it a truly exceptional film. With lesser directors than Micheal Mann these other characters would have been undeveloped or glossed over. The well written script takes the time to flesh out these other characters.<br /><br />like Jon Voight's character. He plays Nate, an Adviser or Agent for the bad guys who is behind the scenes brokering future deals or fencing stolen goods. We learn that there are ethics in this profession. And he displays them in an understated and reassuring manner. Val Kilmer plays Deniro's friend Chris. He has gambling problems and a good share of marital strife. He tells his friend that despite his troubles, he is madly in love with his wife (Ashley Judd)and would never leave her. Deniro's chracter is a counterpoint to that, insisting that he is more disciplined and is prepared to walk out on his life, his friends in 30 seconds flat if the &#34;heat comes around the corner.&#34; And Amy Brennerman plays Eady, the woman who innocently enters Deniro's life only to learn, too late, what his real profession is. Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump) plays Sgt. Drucker, Pacino's capable right hand man, Diane Venora is Pacino's troubled wife and Dennis Haysbert (24, The Unit) plays Breedan, an ex con and former acquaintance who, quite by accident, hooks up with the bad guys only minutes before a major heist.<br /><br />Of course Pacino and Deniro give great performances in Heat. Pacino plays the intense A-type cop prone to histrionics. Deniro is the quiet, deliberate and thoughtful criminal with a complicated set of ethics. But again do not overlook the  performances of the actors in these secondary roles. This is what made it an extra special and truly enjoyable film for me.
B000001DYY|2.0|The only remotely inspired thing on this morose album is Fish Out Of Water, not that I have nothing against Curt. (He took it in his stride - calling himself a happy fish! A welcome riposte to what was then the pompous Orzabal - probably his defense mechanism of a lack of his former brilliance as a songsmith).    Come on guys, like most great bands they had their 3 brilliant first albums (this 4th not being one of them), and it's time to let go.    Nothing they ever did individually or together after Seeds could touch their first 3.    Even the initially catching Break It Down Again exposes big holes in the songwriting after repeated listens - unlike anything in their first 3 this sounds just dated.    Tears For Fears, like the Beatles, is gone. Get over it. Every few years dust off The Hurting, Big Chair and Seeds, and prepared to be amazed like yore. And that's more than enough.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|A discovery of one of those rare recodings that we all knew were out there.  Superb sets that capture the feeling of live jazz over the airwaves.  Sad that recordings were confined to the set timeframe of the radio broadcast but nonetheless a treasure.  Oh, to have more of this.

B000683VI4|5.0|I read the book first and thought, \\"There's no way the movie could make me feel like that.\\"  I was wrong.  This movie is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.  The portrayal of Allie and Noah's love by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling could not have been played better.  The love, passion, and beauty of the book are passed to this movie like no other book-to-movie adaptation I've ever witnessed.  Absolutely excellent!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a romantic at heart.  Truly heartwarming!
B000063COX|5.0|Truly, the first Iron Maiden album, \\"Iron Maiden\\", is an excellent piece of work. Although some credit must be given to the fact that these songs were already being played, and henceforth the band were able to make changes here and there. But, from the opening guitar of \\"Prowler\\", to the end of \\"Iron Maiden\\", this album is truly a masterpiece. Also, this album contains many Iron Maiden classics that deserve to be heard.    Their first studio recording went really well, considering that the only other experience Maiden had was making 4 tracks for the legendary Soundhouse Tapes. Although Steve complains about it being too unprofessional, raw, and unclear at times, in my opinion that was the way the album must have come out. The \\"unprofessional\\" sound it has was able to give the raw power that made Maiden, well, Maiden. For this reason alone it must be why it went to such a high spot on the charts, number 4. If you have not heard this album, do so now! That being said, on to the songs:    1. Prowler- Like I said this song is truly amazing. After hearing this song, it is no wonder why the Maiden spirit was able to catch on in the late '70s/early '80s. Although it does have a rather punky beat, Paul DiAnno is able to make it heavy thanks to his rather aggressive singing. 4/5    2. Sanctuary- Here, another song that really explains why Maiden were getting so over from other bands. This song delivers so much emotions, it is no wonder why it is still played today. From Dave Murray's guitar (and \\"siren wailing\\") playing, to Steve's bass playing, to Clive's magnificent drumming, add in DiAnno's aggressive style, this truly is a wonderful song. But of course, let's not forget Stratton's backup vocals and fine rhythm guitar playing. 5/5    3. Remember Tomorrow- Here, the album takes a more darker turn. This in is very noticeable in DiAnno's voice. The lyrics themselves are dark indeed, one may wonder if this song is truly about the appearance of Satan and The False Prophet as it is said in the Bible. \\"Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher, I shall return from out of the fire\\". Religion aside, this song is amazing. The instrumental passage in the middle only makes it better. 4/5    4. Running Free- Certainly my favorite song in the whole album. Written by Paul DiAnno, this is yet another song that catches that early Maiden spirit. From its whole theme of being free and causing trouble, this song really gets you in the mood to do anything. Seriously, you feel powerful after hearing this song. Plus, Steve's bass and Clive's drumming have never heard so beautifully together. 5/5    5. Phantom of the Opera- Truly, the first of the many epics of Steve Harris is a classic. Like Bruce said at Rock AM Ring, \\"You are not an Iron Maiden fan if you do not like this song.\\" This may contain some of DiAnno's best work, and it also has some of Steve's best bass playing. If there is one song to listen to in this whole album, its this one. Stratton on backup vocals does not hurt either, as it make the atmospere of the song much better. 5/5    6. Transylvania- The song that \\"...never had a singer and probably never will...\\" Transylvania is simply amazing as it shows us the complex style of writing that Steve Harris has. His bass playing is awesome, and that is only added on to the twin guitarist and the always magnificent drumming. A true classic. 4/5    7. Strange World- Certainly the most overlooked song on the album. However, it should not be. This is a truy magnificent song. From the beginning musical interlude, to the depressing (yet at the same time peaceful) state of mind that it brings, it is a beautiful song that deserves more credit than it is given. 4/5    8. Charlotte the Harlot- HAH! Who said that a song about prostitution cannot be good? The first part in the \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\" series, here we are introduced to Charlot, who is a harlot (prostitute). Her true lover acts as her Conscience. Telling her about the relationship they once had, how she now has no feelings, and that frankly she has no more pride in herself. Truly, another classic. 4/5    9. Iron Maiden- The ending of an album has never sounded so great. From the opening riff, to the introduction of the second guitar, to DiAnno's squeals at the end, this song is all about entertainment. Although its theme, the Iron Maiden, is very dark, this song stil has the punky groove that Maiden had in their early days. And believe me, that is not a bad thing. Not only is this a classic song, it is also an anthem. Maiden have used this song to end their live shows with and to also bring out Eddie. But, just like anyone else will tell you, Bruce is the only one to give the song the metal edge that it needed. 5/5    Songs to listen: All of them  Songs to avoid: None  Closing Comments: Must have for any Iron Maiden fan and anyone getting into Maiden.
B0000214F0|4.0|A little harsh in some area's and not for the squemish. Showing real life at that time, funny our lord choose that time to come and die for our sins. The movie is shot right outside of Rome, the sound could be better, but it isn' a music video and it does get it's point across. For a look into Roman life 2000 years ago, this film will give it to you. It was a must see in my college film course. Last it is not a porno, so don't think that is what you will be getting, there is sex, but isn't there some in R rated films today. For even more of an inside look into the Roman like, watch \\"I Claudious\\", thirteen hours long, but you will find yourself watching it over and over again.
B00005JL1C|5.0|A wonderful story.  The characters were perfect and I am in love with Watts...sigh...
B0007P3582|1.0|This is just a bunch of rambling with some clueless lyrics. \\"Fiddy Cent\\" is a sad excuse for rap and should not be listened too. He treats women like sexual objects, you can't understand what the hell he's saying half the time, and he's friends with other losers like Tony Yayo and The Game. If you want real rap check out Cypress Hill or Public Enemy instead. If you want awesome lyrics check out bands like Type O Negative or My Dying Bride.

B0007N1AI6|5.0|This album is 7 stars. Sorry, the 2 are not available in this site. Hellrider itsel makes 1 star. Lockness deserves another.  The rest counts as 5.  <br /> <br />Devoted to Judas Priest
B00003CXA4|5.0|It is an excellent movie of an universal leader. No much technology but much light to guide one's own life through a solid example. I used it as a reference for values that we need to share and communicate in our daily life to our friends close to us.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Just a little too laid back. I got to listen to the whole CD on AOL's \\"Full CD Listening Party\\". Good thing. I would have bought this CD without hearing a note. I love David Gilmour, but there's very little here that isn't strictly light weight fluff. Very nice light weight fluff, but fluff just the same. I'll just go to iTunes and spend 99 to buy track #4, \\"Take a Breath\\". It's the only track that remotely resembles Pink Floyd or features the meaty guitar work that I love so much about David Gilmour. I would recommend his first solo album, but I just didn't find enough on \\"On An Island\\" to warrant a purchase.
B00000DR5D|5.0|Ricochet may be a short and edited version of TD's many live concerts but still it was so excellently crafted that gives you an impression \\"how did they do it\\". I had this album on vinyl and the sound was already crispier when the remastered version came out even better. Td is trully ahead of their time and this early live concert is a living testament to that. Richocet stands out as one of TDs best live release. Though with the TD tree this live album may be obsolete but at its release it was a phenomenal achievement.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I am writing really in response to a current review by bix lang \\"pastafagiole\\". His statements are not so much a critique of Jimi's music, but more of an indictment of an entire generation which he feels was more interested in drugs, sex, and rock and roll than education, social changes or \\"good\\" music for that matter. However, from his comments it appears that he is also not very happy with the the social changes of the 60s, such as civil rights, protesting against violence/war, and also protesting against a governement which history now confirms as one of the most corrupt in modern times. It is also obvious by his \\"review\\" that he is not a great fan of Jimi's or of any one else who a part of the \\"morally bankrupt\\" 60s. This is what he says about Jimi: \\"he was a product of the drug infested, dumbed down culture of the civil rights era of the late 60s\\". Apparently, mr. bix lang feels that the civil rights movement was not needed and did not result in some much needed changes in our country and in the treatment of minorities. The guitarists which he identifies were also very great guitarists, and you don't have to be a fan of classical or jazz guitar to believe that. But I guess I am a product of that \\"drug infested and dumbed down culture\\", because I prefer Jimi. To me, Jimi and his music are the perfect example of the freedom and strength which personifies the 60s. Let's face it, you could not be dumb or weak to bring about the sort of changes which occured in the 60s. Jimi was simply the greatest guitarist ever. He had imagination, a great ear, and an enthusiasm and love for music and sound. He may not have been the best guitarist technically, but no one could emote like Jimi. But he was so much more than just a guitarist. He is often underated as a musician. He wrote some great songs, many of which are instantly recognizable and he was a fantastic live performer. As for Jimi being an alcoholic and drug addict, who truly knows exactly how much he drank or how manydrugs he used. Also as for how he died, yes it is unfortunate that Jimi died such an ignoble death, but there it is. But I don't believe that his death should in any way overshadow the great music he left us. It is unfortunate that there is not more. <br /> <br />From mr bix lang's comments it appears that my generation disrespected everything his generation stood for and accomplished. Not so. But time marches on and society changes. He does not like our music or our world, perhaps in the same way my generation criticizes the next generation and their taste in clothes, music, etc.  <br /> <br />mr bix lang, I am not a drug addict or sexually promiscuous. I have a college education and hold a responsible position. I pay my bills and my taxes. Yet how can that be possible, being a product of the 60s. It just shows you than an entire generation cannot be indicted simply because you don't like our politics or music. <br /> <br />In closing, if you love Jimi, buy this CD and every other Hendrix CD you can find. Don't listen to mr bix lang, because he is clueless and deaf when it comes to Jimi and his music. As Jimi would probably say, peace brother!!
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I've been reading a lot of the reviews for this record and it seems that David Gilmour is up against his own history as a solo artist and as a member of Pink Floyd.  As fans who haven't heard any new material since Rick Wright's excellent Broken China (10 years ago!), we've probably all imagined what a new record from Pink Floyd or one of its members would sound like based on what we liked best about their past music.  I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.  For me this record captures many of the elements that first attracted me to Pink Floyd over 30 years ago and kept me coming back for more.  I've always enjoyed the mellow, pastoral side of the band that we heard in songs like Granchester Meadows, Fat Old Sun and Wots... Uh, the Deal.  I've also enjoyed the repetitious, hypnotic sound beds in songs like Breathe, Welcome to the Machine, and Careful with that Axe, Eugene.  And of course the guitar work.  Though there are many guitar players who may be technically better, no one has ever been able to capture feeling and express emotion through their playing the way that David Gilmour has. Other musicians may be able to copy and play his guitar solos, but none of them could ever originate them.  I find all these elements to my liking on this new album. And I like the lyrics. I'm sure there was a night on the Greek Island of Kastellorizon for David Gilmour and Polly Samson that inspired all of this.  That gives it an authentic and original feel that gives this record its own place in the Floyd/Floyd member catalog. I also love the Crosby and Nash vocal harmonies on the title track.  It's too bad they couldn't stick around to sing on a few more songs.
B000BT97AO|3.0|I love the Henson company's past productions. I basically bought this movie simply based on my childhood affinity for Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal. <br /> <br />I am a more recent fan of Gaiman's works and was excited to see the two get together. Gaiman is (usually) a fantastic story teller with a good, clear vision. <br /> <br />This movie was visually stunning. I was awed from the opening credits to the ending ones just by the sheer novelty of it all. It was exquisite. <br /> <br />However, the story was very one dimensional. I'm sure it's very entertaining for a PG aged audience, but I was disappointed at the lack of layering to the storyline. Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal, even The Muppet Show all held significant story based entertainment for audiences of all ages. Children would enjoy one, very superficial layer to the story, while adults could dig deeper and get the subtle jokes, irony, etc. <br /> <br />MirrorMask failed miserably in this aspect providing visual stimulation to all, but mental stimulation to only the very lowest denominator. <br /> <br />5 stars for visual effects and novelty. <br /> <br />1 star for story & character development.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|I have not read the book, although my wife has and she said that the movie followed it quite well.  I wanted to say that first because it's such a hollywood tradition to drastically change a novel when creating a film adaptation that they rape it of everything that made it special in the beginning.  I'm glad to hear that Eastwood did not do that to Dennis Lehane's masterpiece (or so I hear that it is a wonderfull novel)  That said, I was surprised at how well this movie was done.  I mean, when a film is that glorified it better be perfect, and I really was expecting to be let down, but to my shock I was not, not at all.  The acting I must admitt was amazing, especially on the part of Tim Robbins who plays Dave Boyle, the grown man still trapped in the mind of the child he once was.  The story revolves around three friends years after one of them was molested.  That one was Dave.  Now they are all grown and have moved on.  Jimmy Markham (Penn) is a one time crook (or is it one time) who is now married and has a beautiful daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum from Phantom of the Opera).  Dave is also married to Marcia Gay Harden's charactor and Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) is now a police detective.  All three of these men have rarly kept in touch (especially Kevin Bacon's charactor) but are all forced to interact after Jimmy's daughter is brutally murdered, Dave becomes the prime suspect and Sean has to investigate.  The story itself is gripping and the whole charactor study was wonderfully exicuted.  Both Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden did wonderful jobs as supporting and yet greiving wives, one as she deals with the loss of a daughter and the other while she struggles with the idea that her husband is a killer.  I was in tears by the end of the film (for more than one reason) for this is one of the most moving films I've ever seen.  I will say this.  Sean Penn was great, but I felt his performance in 21 Grams was better.  Tim Robbins is the reason this film works so well...just watching his charactor move you can see all that he is and you know that Tim became Dave Boyle...and that is a good thing, a very good thing...How Lord of the Rings beat this as best film of the year I'll never understand...
B00006CXXU|5.0|The most shocking thing about 'Stripped' is not the cover art but the fact that Christina Aguilera proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is a brilliant artist.  She has the pipes, she has the look and she has the talent to back it all up.  This girl can blow and then she can sing, soft and delicate like an angel.  I hated to admitt it but this is probably one of the best albums I own.  Christina hits powerful subjects like her hit single 'CAN'T HOLD US DOWN' which fights against stereotype, bashing society for critisizing a woman for doing the same thing that 90% of every man does as well, and getting Lil' Kim to add her vocals was a great addition.  She uncovers her abusive childhood in the tearjerking 'I'M OK' and she puts in her two-cents about self appreciation and impowerment in the moving single 'BEAUTIFUL'.  Christina shows she's more than a one trick pony by pulling out not only dance numbers like the aformentioned 'CAN'T HOLD US DOWN' as well as 'DIRRTY' and 'INFATUATION', and then covers her ballads in 'THE VOICE WITHIN', the Alicia Keys fueled jazz number 'IMPOSSIBLE' and the most amazing track here 'WALK AWAY', but then, when you think that's all she breaks out a rockers soul on her third single 'FIGHTER' featering Dave Navaro as well as 'MAKE OVER'.  Songs like 'GET MINE, GET YOURS' show that Christina doesn't shy away from contriversal subjects, and whats more contriversal than casual sex, but after hearing 'CAN'T HOLD US DOWN' you'll be slow to call her a wh*re.  Christina is a powerhouse and can only go up from here, for with 'Stripped' she bears all and proves that she is here to give us what we want, and what we want is more!
B000AYEI5Y|4.0|I have not been able to put this cd down!! Although I do not agree with certain lyrics (such as Wiseman) I truly have been loving this cd. James Blunt has a catchy thing with his voice and I love the piano and guitar in the songs. Songs 1,2 & 4 are the best. I bought the \\"clean\\" version and that is what I recomend. I like this cd and I recomend it! A TRUE STAR IN THE MAKING!

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna and she's super Star! I been a great fan of Madonna but lately missed out listening to her but suddenly she's back with a bang especially with her ultimate number 'Sorry' - It's got a perfect beat, continuous flow and rythm and her voice so soothing n fresh as ever. You'll want to hear this song again and again endlessly! Tina Turner at the age of 50 plus had entertained the audience but Madonna - she's super reigning and age don't seem to touch anywhere. Back to her roots, I Love New York and Forbidden Love are two numbers that I like very much too. Forbidden Love is a slow dance track that would make you sway with joy sealing destiny forever. A Pop n trance - thats Madonna and she sure sells!
B000DZIGDU|2.0|I disliked this movie and resent the manner in which it portrayed U.S. Marines. Watching this film, you'd get the notion that our nation's best are whiney little cry babies with emotional issues more befitting spoiled societal gadflies who have a real desire to simply kill people. The manner in which our finest are depicted is, in my opinion, insulting and contrary to the actual Marines who defend our nation. I felt it was degrading of the Marines and resent the belittlement of those noble souls who stand the gap for us all.<br /><br />As for \\"leftist\\" as someone implied earlier on, that is simply a nonsensical statement. There was no moral issues involved, or whether the war is right or wrong, nor whether we ought to have sent troops to Iraq in defense of Kuwait. Instead, it seemed to depict the Marines as demeaning of women, sociopathic in their desire to attack something, and seemed to abdicate any notion of duty and honor among these men.<br /><br />Turning to the production itself, it was dull. Not your average, run-of-the-mill dull, but astoundingly and mindbogglingly dull.<br /><br />I like good dramatic films, and better if a message is conveyed in some way. Okay, so the waiting for something to happen was tedious for the Marines. Great. Peachy. It seems very unlikely that Marines would come unglued over it! The strain of waiting the Marines endured is matched by the strain of waiting for this movie to get interesting, which it really didn't.<br /><br />My standards are pretty light. I appreciate all manner of movies, so long as they prove entertaining. This one did not provide entertainment so much as an opportunity to wallow in tedium.<br /><br />Thus, I only give it two stars here. My only praise is the desert scenes were quite convincing and nicely done. The oil fires were particularly well illustrated, and quite believable.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This film was a long time coming. For fans of FFVII-the game, this wraps up the story very nicely. Battle scenes and cg are nothing short of incredible. Most importantly, it's everything that \\"FF:The Spirits Within\\" wanted to be, but wasn't. It's also a shame that because of the American general public's difficulty accepting anime and video games as anything but children's playthings, this film was not released in theatres in America. Again, it's a shame. Frankly, I believe that DVD sales in America will suprise the filmmakers. I hope they do this for other FF games as well, like FFVI, which had an awesome storyline and characters. Anyway, BUY IT!
0440241588|2.0|There is nothing thrilling about this book. Tour of bolonga streets for most part of the book. The story started off well but then got really boring from middle to end. I wish i head read reviews before buying this one.
B000BGH22W|5.0|This is the wonderful soundtrack.  It is all filled with different emotions with all the different scenes as the real movie.  Some are tense and some are exciting.  Some tracks have some dark feeling.  Some have relaxed feeling.  Overall, after I listened it, it was like a mix feeling.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Funny, clean, makes the imagination flow.  All the singing is wonderful.  The Sound of Music and Chitty Chitty BAng Bang are all equally as good.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This review is going to be short and so sweet! This is \\"The Deal\\". If you are a Springsteen fan like I've been for 33 years, if you aren't Born To Run down whatever Thunderoad you have to take to get this, send your tickets to me for Bruce's upcoming tour! Your Bruce collection is not complete without it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw the stage performance of \\"Phamtom of the Opera\\" when it came through our city and I was spellbound. Nothing could ever compare to the delight and thrill I felt from that performance, or so I thought. I was very, very wrong. Enter \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", the movie. <br />I am not sure what I expected to see, but it was not the pure thrill as I watched the stunning visuals, the outstanding performances (singing, dance and acting) nor the nuances of the script and score that defied one viewing to take in completely. What passed before me was a feast for the senses in a wasteland of musicals transformed for the movies since the likes of \\"Oliver!\\" and \\"My Fair Lady\\"  If I could give this moe more than 5 stars, I would without hesitation.
0385470819|5.0|This is my all-time favorite book.  In one word - POWERFUL.  Grisham does an excellent job at bringing the characters alive and making you care about them.  There is a lot of description to help you understand the south at a time when blacks were begining to be people, not things.  Wonderful.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Bought the 3 DVD Special Edition for $21.99. It is fantastic! The amount of work and detail that James Cameron & Co. went to in order to make this movie is mind boggling.  <br /> <br />It's no wonder that this movie has grossed $3.4 Billion in inflation adjusted revenue since it's release in Dec 1997.
B000E5N684|3.0|I will dispense with the standard plot synopsis and, for the most part, a review of this movie.  14 years later, most of us looking at a special edition \\"Basic Instinct\\" DVD already like it enough to at least show interest in possibly buying this.  My question was, is it worth it to replace my old \\"Basic Instinct\\" DVD with a new one?      By my count this is the 4th DVD transfer of this film (there was a bare-bones DVD of the theatrical release, then a special edition with extras, then the unrated directors cut special edition with the same extras (that one had the dumb \\"ice pick box,\\" but was eventually, and is now, available in a standard box whose cover art looks just like all the other releases (including the original VHS release):  All white box, torso-and-up shot of Stone and Douglas whith her clawing his back), and now this one that still retains that same image of the stars, but now it is inside the lettering of the title).    I mention this for two reasons.      The first may not matter much to amazon and other on-line shoppers, but here's what happened to me while walking around Best Buy today:  I already owned the \\"bare-bones\\" version (I picked it up for 5 bucks brand new at least 5 years ago, so this has never been a movie one needed to drop a lot on to own), but I wanted the unrated director's cut I saw advertised in the Best Buy weekend circular.  I picked it up off the shelf and saw there was the older '02 special edition release right next to it for $5.99.  I was not crazy about spending $15 (not that that is a terrible price, mind you) on a movie I already owned so I decided to go with the '02 version (I'll get to the comparison between the two in a moment - that is reason #2).  I got home and found out it was the special edition alright, but it was the original theatrical version.  It had extras and such, but the point of replacing the thing in the first place was to get the director's cut.  So I went back to Best Buy and, sure enough, because theboxes look the same except for a tiny-worded \\"director's cut\\" in the bottom corner, I grabbed the wrong one.  The director's cut was there and it to was also only $5.99 (and because of some additional sale I was unaware of it rang up as something like $4.40).  So BE CAREFULl WHEN SELECTING A VERSION OF THE FILM. The ice-pick box, dumb as it looked on the DVD shelf, seems to be gone so there is no easy way to tell all these apart.  You gotta do a little reading.  \\"Special Edition\\" doesn't automaticly mean \\"director's cut.\\" (Especially for a DVD that has had as many similar - and similar looking - releases as this one.)    That's my first point.  The second is to inform you that, in comparing this new version \\"special edition director's cut\\" with the $5 version I got, the only difference, besides the newly arranged cover art, is that there is an interview and an introduction by Sharon Stone.  That's it.  Other than that, it has the same bonuses, commentaries, etc.  And that is said if that even matters to you in the first place.  If you just want the movie, there is no reason to opt for this new, more expensice release; or if you already have the director's cut, replace it with this one - unless you really want to hear from Sharon Stone (that's her now, mind you, not 1992 - I'm just sayin'...)    So why was this made then?  \\"Basic Instinct 2\\" hits theatres in a few weeks. I'll reserve judgment on that move until I see it, but I can judge this as a cash grab.  I'm not angry though.  \\"Basic Instinct\\" is hardly the first film to pull this stunt and I almost wish that some of the movies I really loved had just one \\"special edition\\" or update from its first DVD incarnation, not to mention 4 or more.  I would just hope there would be something that sets them apart from the previous version.    That's not the case here.    * One quick observation I could not resisit mentioning:  It is ironic that a movie as notorious for its graphic sex and violence as \\"Basic Instinct\\" thatthe Amazon info lists its rating as simply \\"Unrated for drug use and laguage.\\"  :)
B00005JNEW|5.0|Living in Texas it's almost a right of passage to watch this film.  A true story it's sure a touching one when you see what these young men with subject themselves to for a trophy because it's so much more than that.  I watched this film with a good friend who was brought to tears.  This is a film, not about football but about comrodery, about devotion and dreams and acheiving those dreams through devotion and yes, comrodery.  What's starts off somewhat like a documentary on 'making the team' or 'meeting the team' turns into a heart tugging event as you watch these young men go through quite a bit in order to realize their dreams.  The QB and his devotion, not only to the sport but to his ailing mother.  The running back who lives under the shadow of a former famous father (played BRILLIANTLY by Tim McGraw) who is now quite the drunk and abusive to boot.  And then there's Booby Miles...the star of the team, but with a hurt knee he because a loose link in the chain.  You can really see how these kids rely on each other to pull through.  The scene where they are all crying on each other in the locker room is especially touching.  What stood out to me was the end, the 'where they are now' type part and you see that only one member of the team is doing anything football related now...it shows that these kids are just normal kids, and now they are normal men, but it was the dream that was so real it made them almost superhuman.  This is a great film to watch over and over with brillant acting by most of the cast.  Billy Bob Thorton is fine, but outshined by Derek Luke (brilliant kid) and Tim McGraw (I was floored...but he STOLE every scene he was in) as well as Lucas Black, a relative newcomer who played the QB and real heart of the team.  Wonderful movie that will tug at the heartstrings and by the end will make you feel proud to be a Texan...err...well, you fill in the blank _______________.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The show is fantastic and so is the CD - I bought two just in case because EVERYONE wants to borrow it and listen to it.
B000002B7O|5.0|Every metal fan would surely know of a phenomenon called Ozzy Osbourne...previously which was better known as Black Sabbath...the hotbed for later metal acts! After branching out (sometimes read as thrown out) of the aura that was Black Sabbath, Ozzy was rescued from the Slough of Despond by his future wife and producer's daughter, Sharon Osbourne, who resurrected his life for him and gave him enough support to come out with two solid solo albums, 'Blizzard of Ozz' and 'Diary of a madman'. Ozzy kind of towered tall over other members of the Black Sabbath team, and just slightly above Toni Iommi, but his solo career didn't carry forward the individual element of him that was present in Black Sabbath. He was no longer the Black Sabbath frontman, he was Ozzy...and the world would soon recognize that...whether they liked it or not. He became more famous for his antics on and off stage and weird and supposedly satanic acts, which got him into lots of trouble. Amidst all this chaos and public outcry, musically he established his presence one album at a time. Always lucky to have talented guitarists to help him churn out some really exquisite numbers, under his musical supervision. <br /> <br />'Diary of a madman' is Ozzy's second solo effort. Featuring the talented Rhandy Rhoads on guitar, Ozzy sang and composed most of the 8 songs for the album. The opening track 'Over the mountain' is one hell'va track to start with. Check out Rhandy Rhoads (formerly in Quiet Riot) throughout the track. What a great guitarist he was. Amazing virtuosity handling both melodious tunes and tearing leads with the same panache, grace and smoothness. The title track says it all. Catch the middle riff and lead...as sinuous as they come and as haunting as they get. Brilliant guitarist...too bad he died much, much too soon...in an unfortunate plane crash. Another artist who was to repeat this feat was Stevie Ray Vaughan...who ended up burning in a helicopter. <br />There's a generous dose of slowtracks in 'You can't kill rock'n'rolll' and 'Tonight' which is a pretty good ballad. I especially love the extended lead in the end...God Rhandy was too good! <br />'Flying high again' is another great track...with cool lyrics too. <br />Other tracks like 'Little Dolls', 'Believer' and 'S.A.T.O.' are pretty good too...and have ample guitaring and pretty good drumming (Tommy Alridge) and Rudy Sarzo on bass [who co-worked on a 1988 album 'project-driver'-heavy metal stuff...a bit punkish and thrash too, and also with Steve Vai on the whitesnake album, 'Slip of the tongue']. <br />'You can't kill rock'n'roll' has a lilting arpeggio start...and Ozzy has rendered his voice very effectively too, which adds to the overall effect. Nice lyrics too. Something like coming clean about the invincibility of rock'n'roll, no matter what...and also a dig at detractors of rock and specially those that condemned Ozzy I think. Apparently a young lad commited suicide listening to 'Suicide Solution' from the BLizzard album and the parents filed a case against Ozzy, which eventually was dismissed by the court of law...so a message in there somewhere too :) <br />\\"... <br />How many times can they fill me with lies and I listen, again <br />Twisting the truth and they're playin' around with my head O.K. <br />The things that they will do and the things they will say <br />When they don't really understand. <br />Tears fill my eyes when I hear all the cries <br />For the reason today. <br />And they don't really know even what they're talkin' about <br />And I can't imagine what empty heads can achieve. <br />Leave me alone don't want your promises no more <br />Cause rock'n'roll is my religion and my law <br />Won't ever change, may think its's strange <br />You can't kill rock'n'roll, it's here to stay. <br />...\\" <br /> <br />Killer tracks are the first and title track...melodious and powerful guitaring throughout the album nevertheless. <br /> <br />Buy the CD and you'll get to see a lot of gory artwork! Another thing that Ozzy is famous for, besides his once upon a time crazy stage antics and the now immensley popular Ozzfest (yearly metal festival) that features the cream of the who's-who of metal. <br />Among his later releases, 'The Ultimate Sin' is a lyrically powerful album and some amazing speed-metal guitaring by Jake E. Lee, another extremely talented guitarist. 'No rest for the Wicked' set the field for the way Ozzy creates music today. Guitarist Zakk Wylde (now spearheading a bloddy hell great kicking hard rock/metal band called 'Black Label Society', previously Pride & Glory) was the key factor in developing more intense twists, turns and power chorded song structure to Ozzy's compositions. 'No rest for the wicked' is a great album...just go get it...or eait for my review on that one ;) <br />The wizard rules! Just say Ozzy!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I got this set for my last birthday and loved it. It's very cool that the original theatrical verion and the director's cut of the 1st Alien movie are included. I prefer the director's cut just because... well... IT'S THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!!!! I think my favorite Aline movies are the 1st because it's the scariest and Aliens because it introduces the Queen  Alien. It bugs me that they couldn't record the 3rd Alien movie right and had to add subtitles whnever you couldn't hear the character's talking; it's also my least favorite Alien movie(even though it's the movie where we get to see the most aliens). Alien Ressurection is okay. It's definately seeing the Alien- that Ripley had in her- all grown up and unlike any other alien. It was pretty funny seeing Ripley's alien rip the head off the queen alien after it didn't recognize the scent of her. In this movie the queen doesn't have both a full body and an egg sack. It's just half a body and the rest is a big egg sack. I personaly like the 5-foot unfolding box set. The hlographic discs are also cool, and the DVD menus of each movie is also pretty cool, too.<br /><br /> I own a lot of box sets of DVDs(all the seasons of the Simpsons, the Friday 13th collection, the Nightmare on Elm Street collection), and this would have to honestly be my favorite. I reccomend the Alien Quadrilogy to any Alein fan. Every second is just Alien madness!!!!!
B00000K44W|5.0|Jethro Tull, one of the most eclectic of rocks bands till date, still remains a personal favourite for me. Probably more so because they were primarily a blues band (with a lot of folk music indulgence), and the fact that they have undergone upheavals during very well documented classic rock eras. (Bands with history are the ones who usually write it!) <br /> <br />Ian Anderson, a genius himself... (if you can form a group like Jethro Tull, you have to be a genius, no doubts about that one!)- and frontman of Jethro Tull is one of the most intelligent musicians to have been born. Excuse yourself for being mesmerised even if you hear him in one of his interviews. But then obviously you also need to be passionate about the English language, esp. coining of phrases, puns and quips, something that Ian Anderson is very good at. <br />It's been quite a good few years since I have been collecting Tull lyrics and I must say, there are all a delectable read. <br /> <br />Heavy Horses is a briliant album. Musically it is too accomplished, way ahead of its 1978 year of production. Drawing very much from the excellence of band member David Palmer who was responsible for the string and orchestral arrangements, this album also features the musical talents of bandmates John Evan (Piano...great work on the title track), Barriemore Barlow (drums), John Glascock (bass) and the inimitable and extremely talented Martin Barre. Yeah, most newly formed guitar enthusiasts might not even know who he is, but then for the record, Toni Iommmi (of Black Sabbath fame) couldn't do for Jethro Tull what Martin did. It is rumoured that Tony Iommi was able to stick with the band for just a week (or that he failed to meet expectations at the audition). Martin Barre has been with Jethro Tull ever since, notwithstanding the band's amazing and notorious fame for having a million line-up changes since inception. Although he tried his hand at a solo album ('Trick of Memory'), I personally feel, its best when you hear him in Jethro Tull. <br />Ian Anderson, apart from his ability to write profound lyricls, is very much known for his prowess with the flute and the way he fuses it into rock rhythms.  <br /> <br />Heavy Horses has abundant enchanting doses of flute woven into classic rock rhythms, enough to get one introduced to the Jethro Tull style of making rock music or making music rock! <br />A total of 9 songs, that range from the serious (in Heavy Horses) to the cheerful, happy-go-lucky (Rover) and openly admitting to the passion for making love(Acres Wild), make this one geat album. It's a notch below my other favourite Tull albums, 'Stand Up', 'Benefit', 'Songs From The Woods', 'Aqualung', 'Minstrel in the Gallery' and 'Night Cap'. <br /> <br />Extremely meloudious tracks include 'Moths' and Acres Wild, which has a very folk like treatment, with flirting mandolins breaking out between lines that express love making in the open! <br />\\"... <br />I'll make love to you  <br />in all good places  <br />under black mountains  <br />in open spaces.  <br />By deep brown rivers  <br />that slither darkly  <br />through far marches  <br />where the blue hare races. <br />...\\" <br />Other melodious offerings - 'Moths'(very lilting), 'Rover'(extremely melodious and soothing flute interludes), 'One Brown Mouse' and 'Weathercock'. <br /> <br />The title track talks about the increasing modernisation that was responsible in triggering off a decline in numbers (and the respect for them) of old England shires, a horse breed from the 18th century. Very touching and beautifully worded, Heavy Horses is according to me, one of the best lyrical attempts from Ian. The entire song is a treat to read, but I'm just mentioning 5 lines here. <br /> <br />\\"... <br />Heavy Horses, move the land under me <br />Behind the plough gliding --- slipping and sliding free <br />Now you're down to the few <br />And there's no work to do <br />The tractor's on its way. <br />...\\" <br /> <br />Sheer poetry and a way with words is also evident in the track 'Weathercock'. <br /> <br />\\"... <br />Good morning Weathercock: How did you fare last night? <br />Did the cold wind bite you, did you face up to the fright <br />When the leaves spin from October   and whip around your tail? <br />Did you shake from the blast, did you shiver through the gale? <br />------- <br />Do you simply reflect changes in the patterns of the sky, <br />Or is it true to say the weather heeds the twinkle in your eye? <br />Do you fight the rush of winter; do you hold snowflakes at bay? <br />Do you lift the dawn sun from the fields and help him on his way? <br />...\\" <br /> <br />The remaining tracks, 'The Mouse Police Never Sleeps' (which has a crazy chant to the end) and 'Journeyman' are charming in their own way and make for great listening. <br /> <br />His voice may not be strictly melodious, but its as good as an instrument and moreover the ability to accentuate in deference to the carefully worded song sttructure, makes it quite a treat to hear. (It eventually should grow on you) <br />Martin Barre does not showcase his guitaring as pompously as a lead guitarist would normally do, but he binds almost every track with his excellent classic guitaring and distinguishable style. <br /> <br />With generous doses of mandolin, classical rock guitar, pipe, organ, piano and delectable orchestral manoeuvres, Heavy Horses comes across as one of the better albums from Jethro Tull. <br />If you are a first-time listener, this is a nice way to get introduced to the music of Jethro Tull. Although in my opinion, either 'Living in the past' or 'Songs from the woods' will give you the larger picture that is Jethro Tull.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Imagine if David Lynch was asked to direct a live action Beavis and Butthead with a plot written by John Hughes.  That's not a great way to describe Napolean Dynamite, but it's the best I can come up with. <br /> <br />This is actually a very good movie.  It tells the story of dimwitted but kindhearted Napolean and his quirky group of family and friends as he navigates things like the school dance and class elections.  His new found buddy Pedro and he compete, to some extent anyway, for the affection of the same girl.  Napolean's uncle babysits while his grandma's hurt from an ATV accident and buys a time machine.  You get the idea.  There is great depth of character and Uncle Rico is just funny as hell. <br /> <br />I think everyone will enjoy this on some level.  It's how movies should be done.
6305428050|4.0|A classic! and I was glad that I was able to continue it because the VHS version was running thin. The movie was delivered nicely and plays great. It is just like I remember seeing it long ago.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This is a fantastic buy! I thoroughly enjoyed this fresh show. Veronica Mars is funny and clever and, most importantly, original. Many great new talented actors and also quite a few familiar faces including Alyson Hannigan, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, make guest appearances. Kristen Bell as our heroine is brilliant and so very likeable and Jason Dohring as bad boy Logan, who you can't help but fall in love with, is just stellar! <br /> <br />Worth every cent!!
B000002KIC|5.0|I loved the movie, The Last Waltz, and had to get the CD that goes with it. Of course, it's wonderful, just like the movie! So much talent in one place! I skated through the 70s listening to other types of music, so I missed out on a lot of what was going on with these artists. But it's never too late, in my opinion. I'm very happy to have this historic concert in my collection!

B00005RRG9|5.0|I never tire of watching \\"The Parent Trap,\\" starring Hayley Mills, Maureen O'Hara, and Brian Keith.  This is one movie that keeps you entertained from start to finish.  The story consists of twin sisters, seperated at an early age when their parents divorce.  Mother goes home to Boston, and father stays at house in California.  The two meet during summer camp and conspire to reunite their parents once again.  Hayley Mills does a great job playing both of the sisters parts.  Beautiful Maureen O'Hara and charming Brian Keith as the parents are perfectly cast and add to the film's appeal.  The Vault Disney 2 disc edition plays great with a clean transfer and great audio sound.  I highly recommend \\"The Parent Trap\\" as an essential part of any serious Disney dvd collection. It's superb!<br /><br />**UPDATE!**  \\"The Parent Trap\\" (1961) is now available, along with it's updated sequel, \\"The Parent Trap II\\" (1986) in Disney's \\"The Parent Trap 2 Movie Collection\\" DVD set. Each movie is on it's own DVD disc, and at a great price, too! Disney, Haley Mills, and especially \\"The Parent Trap\\" movie fans will want to have the previous \\"Vault Disney Collection 2-Disc\\" version, as well as this updated \\"2 Movie Collection\\" version, to enjoy again and again!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Okay, I admit it:  I went into watching Joe Wright's 2005 adaptation of PRIDE & PREJUDICE with some trepidation, for a couple of reasons. 1.) Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of my favorite novels, and I didn't want to see Austen's story metamorphose into something it wasn't on the big screen.  And 2.) I am a huge fan of the BBC version, so I felt I had a lot to compare this new adaptation of the film to--and could it measure up to the high standards set by Austen and the BBC film (and Colin Firth's performance, in particular)?  The answer to that question, I discovered after seeing it, is, as Jane Bennet would say, \\"Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!\\" <br /> <br />PRIDE & PREJUDICE tells the story of the Bennet family in rural England during the late 1700s.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five daughters of the marrying age and, with no son to carry on the family name, the anxious Mrs. Bennet (played brilliantly by Brenda Blethyn) is desperate to get her daughters married off to the richest, most eligible young suitors.  Enter Mr. Bingley, who has just bought a large property near the Bennet home, and who at once becomes entranced with the eldest Miss Bennet, Jane.  He brings Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden), his haughty and even richer friend, with him to the country.  Darcy immediately clashes with the next eldest Bennet sister, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley).  Elizabeth is strong-willed, opinionated, and prideful, and she resents Darcy's condescending air and haughty attitude. Darcy resents Elizabeth's low rank in society and lewd family.  A series of chance encounters, however, gradually begin to change their opinions of one another--but both Darcy and Elizabeth have too much \\"pride and prejudice\\" to admit to their attraction and give in to the love of their lives. <br /> <br />Austen-ite purists beware:  Wright (and screenwriter Deborah Moggach) have taken liberties with the film.  The Elizabeth and Darcy we see on screen are younger than Austen's version of the characters.  The story takes place in the more rural England of the 1790's, rather than in the early 19th century of Austen's novel.  The roles of many characters are reduced for the purpose of moving the story along; some are left out altogether.  But an adaptation is supposed to take liberties, right?  We know the story of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE; we've read the book, we've seen the BBC adaptation (which was very faithful to the novel); in my opinion, it's about time we got a fresh take on Austen's timeless classic.  <br /> <br />And Wright does a brilliant job with this adaptation.  This version lacks the romanticized costuming and setting of the BBC film, which felt and looked like a period piece.  The presentation of this version is much more gritty, much more natural; the gowns are plain, the country is muddy and rainy.  The love between Elizabeth and Darcy is innocent, vibrant, making them even more unbalanced, and they are even more powerless to resist each other.  The music is understated and simple, the perfect compliment to a story of overwhelming, irresistable love. <br /> <br />And the acting is absolutely superb.  Keira Knightley is a natural actress, surprisingly powerful in her portrayal of strong-willed Elizabeth Bennet.  I was a little bit concerned she'd be too young for the role (and too beautiful to play Elizabeth)--but she blew me away with her forceful performance.  It's no wonder she was nominated for an Oscar for this role!  And Matthew Macfayden--although Colin Firth he is not, but who is?--is brilliant as the haughty, decorous, discreet Mr. Darcy.  And the two have tons of chemistry.  Dame Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland are welcome additions to the cast in small but memorable roles. <br /> <br />There are two scenes, in particular, that I thought were particularly well done.  The scene in which Elizabeth visits Pemberley and wanders around Darcy's home, touching his sculptures and admiring his beautiful belongings, is particularly telling.  You can feel Elizabeth's feelings evolving at that moment, and the score is particularly well-utilized in this scene.  The other scene is the one in the moor, early in the morning, when Darcy comes to Elizabeth out of the mist.  Sounds corny, but it's simply beautiful:  The two young actors convey so much, without really saying anything at all.  The fabricated ending is sweet and lovely, too. <br /> <br />One thing Wright doesn't change about Austen's story is the main message her long-ago novel contained, a message that is still pertinent today:  True love transcends all boundaries of class and pride.  So I have to say my trepidation was groundless.  All in all, this version of PRIDE & PREJUDICE is a worthy update to Austen's timeless romance.  The only thing I really missed was Colin Firth in the wet white shirt--but we can't always have it all, can we?
0451169514|5.0|This story revolves around a group of kids that have developed a very strong bond as they navigate childhood fears and threats.  They win due to their childhood innocence and deep commitment to one another.  They come back together later in live (like the big chill) when the evil they confronted and defeated as kids comes back to their town.  Now they are jaded by life and have to try to get back to the committment to each other that they had shared as children.  A great story of relationships and the human condition.  Well told and scary as Hell.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|David Gilmour's new CD On An Island came as a surprise to me. Having not heard that it was being even made until 3 days before its release date made a nice change of pace from my usual wait of several weeks. I had no idea what to expect other than listening to a few samples I could find on the internet. <br /> <br />So what do we have here? The Wall 2? Divison Bell 2? No. Actually if anything this album is much more along the lines of what Pink Floyd's music used to sound like before Roger Waters became the driving lyrical force behind their 70's concept albums. To some listeners the music of On An Island may come as a surprise, but to those fans who listen to and enjoy ALL of Pink Floyd's back catalog its a refreshing visit to the music of the \\"song sides\\" of Atom Heart Mother, Meddle, and all of Obscured by Clouds. A song like the classic Fat Old Sun would sound completely at home on this album.  <br /> <br />One gets the feeling that as Gilmour enjoys what must be a fairly comfortable life as one of rock's living legends that most of these songs came about during leisurely evenings playing acoustic guitar. Sure, there are moments of rock and blues and Dave's trademark guitar solos, but in general gone are the days of aggression and darkness as from the Wall era. <br /> <br />For me when I listen to an album like this and also Richard Wright's solo album Broken China, it makes me wish that Pink Floyd could escape some of the bombast of their later albums, both with and without Roger Waters. When or probably IF there were another Pink Floyd album (hopefully with Roger Waters!) one would wish that music like this could be included. Perhaps a CD where there's one long track ala Meddle for Waters to conceptualise upon with the remainder of the album filled with individual songs like these would open up the writing to ALL the members like on their most classic albums. <br /> <br />But part of what stands in the way of such a future is the expectations of the \\"fans\\". There's so much more to Pink Floyd than Comfortable Numb, Money, and Wish You Were Here. All great songs but Pink Floyd's own history probably stands in the way of there being new Floyd material. At this point I'd personally love to see the original 4 members of the 70's band playing together like one sees on Live at Pompei, stripped down and raw. Live 8 showed just how good of a band they were and still could be. <br /> <br />But I'm not holding my breath! I am just thankful that such a well thought out, beautifully recorded album as On An Island exists.
B000002AHC|4.0|There's some amazing stuff on this album.  Nothing can match the glory of the first time I heard \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" but \\"Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" gives us a glimpse of what might have been, if they'd been able to stay together.  Except for a few near-misses, this was probably the last consistently good Byrds studio album. <br />\\"Artificial Energy\\" captures the drug-fueled craziness of the times in a way that few other songs did -- fun and scary at the same time -- and then \\"Goin' Back\\" offsers a sort of way to cool down again. <br />The smooth surface of \\"Draft Morning,\\" broken by distant dreamlike gunfire, still gives me chills, long past the time when I needed to worry about the draft. <br />\\"Change Is Now,\\" which I expected would sound terribly dated, has held up fairly well, especially if you're willing to forgive such lyrics as \\"that which is not real does not exist.\\"  The break from the hypnotic drone of Hillman's bass to the steel guitar, and then back again, is sublime even in an un-altered state of consciousness. <br />The only clinker in the whole set (speaking now of the original album) was \\"Space Odyssey.\\"  A friend at the time described the blub-blub rhythm as an \\"electric water cooler\\" and I've yet to get someone to contradict him. <br />The whole album was too short, but then that was true of a lot of albums at the time. <br />I wouldn't recommend buying the CD just for the bonus tracks.  Unlike on some of the other Byrds re-issues, there's not much there.  They're of historical interest, but sometimes outtakes are outtakes for a reason. <br /> <br />It is worth it, just for the sound.  Some re-issues don't sound better than the original LPs. More than a few sound worse.  All of the Byrds re-issues that I've acquired so far have been more clear than the originals.  A fine job.  Speaking as the last person on my block to trade his turntable for a CD player, I can't praise the people involved enough.  If you loved the Byrds 40 years ago (ouch!) or have just recently heard of them, this CD, and the others, represent money well spent. <br /> <br />One more thing to mention; why are so many reviewers saying that David Crosby's picture was replaced by a horse's rear end?  I'm not unsympathetic to the notion -- in spite of his huge contributions he could undoubtedly be one at times -- but if you look at the cover carefully it is beyond doubt a horse's head in the window, not the other end!  Look carefully, people!
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This series of DVDs contains mega entertainment for all ages. It has memories for some, history for others and enjoyment for all. Young people will hardly believe the spectacle and talent they see on the screen. Stars were stars then; earning the title by using their abilities to an outstanding degree. We all know things were not what they seem but who cares? Watch these over and over when the weather is dull or there's no one to keep you company. Obtain this collection and keep it near by to lift your spirits and make you sing out loud any day or night. I love it!!
0440419514|5.0|It has been years now since I've read this wonderful trilogy. I recentally noticed them on my little brothers bookshelf and picked them up. <br /> <br />I am just starting to read again and remember. I can probably say without a doubt that His Dark Materials has influenced me more heavily than any other story since. After finishing The Amber Spyglass, I cried. It was too good to be over. I distinctly remember telling my mother I would never read another book again--that it was too painful. <br /> <br />Regardless of how popular this book is in the future, I will keep it around to give to my children. <br /> <br />I recommend this to everyone.
0385474547|5.0|A big claim to make perhaps, but the rich, deceptively simple prose  of 'Things Fall Apart' packs an incredible punch, particularly with the devastating final chapter.  For the first 100 pages, Achebe has given his people (he was born in Nigeria with an Ibo background) back their history, reclaiming the Nigerian identity: far from Joseph Conrad's Africans in 'Heart Of Darkness' (quaint, godless, ignorant black people with long limbs and scary, rolling eyes) Achebe presents a culture of depth, traditions and parables that rival any Christian's in complexity, and people with unique personalities and (sometimes unpredictable) reactions. I almost screamed in disbelief when someone complained Achebe was being \\"biased\\" against white people: when you're describing the subjugation of a race, you don't qualify yourself with an \\"Oh well, I'm sure the white man thought he knew what was best for us,\\" or a \\"Really, we black folks had it coming anyway.\\" <br /> <br />And the final chapter: if such a thing as genius exists, it is here. Throughout Achebe has claimed the English language for himself, infusing it with an African-ness that sets it completely aside from an Englishman's prose. Yet the style of the last chapter is unmistakably English, could even have been lifted from 'Heart of Darkness'. Achebe shows WITHIN THE TEXT how the voice of the white colonisers silences, represses, and denies the voice of the colonised. The greatest evil done to Africa, Achebe argues, is that it was not allowed to tell its own story; that robbing people of their voice is the absolute oppression, and absolute enslavment.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|THis was a great series, though it was obviously cut short from what it was intended to be.  The movie is a rushed atempt to close up the story line.  If you liked the movie you will probably enjoy this.  The episodes flow together, but are not so intertwined that you can't put it down when you have to get up in the morning.
B000002GQE|5.0|This was the first vinyl album I ever bought back in the day.  It is still my favorite of the Moody Blues.  The lyrics are superb and the music melodious.  The blending of r&r with orchestration was ground breaking when this album was produced.

B000DN5W4I|5.0|Incredible 3 piece band. Eric Czar is the most versitle <br />bassist alive and Bonamassa must be from another planet. <br />No guitarist has garnered my attention this much since Jimi <br />Hendrix. With solid bluesy vocals and and a drummer that keeps it all together it doesn't get any better than this. I've about worn the 1st DVD out, time to order another one.
B00027JYLC|4.0|Due to my slow descent into not caring for human life in films, I found myself able to watch Freaks as a drama and wasn't shocked at all that the actors were mostly sideshow freaks.  I found the film to be a touching tale in the life of circus actors and how cruel some peeople can be to others that are differeent then themeselves.  Freaks has a great story that rivals many films of today (like thats tough to do).  Overall highly recommended and if you haven't been desensitized like myself you might be slightly shocked by the film as well.
B0002UOK04|4.0|Wintersun was a pleasant suprise, a melodic viking/death metal project with tremendous ability and dizzying technicality. The mixes are very dense with instrumentation and rarely take a break. As such, the lack of dynamics reduces the enjoyability of the disc as a whole, but the songs individually are very solid. Also avoids the dorkocity of some of these types of bands, if you care (your non-metal friends may think this less weird than others). Blast beats and arpeggios abound. Solos are well harmonized with the rhythm parts. The solo of Winter Madness must be heard by all metalheads. I am really starting to like guitar solos again.
B00005OWEG|5.0|This has to be my favorite war movie ever.  Ten times better then Saving Private Ryan, and slipping past Full Metal Jacket, Apocolypse Now is viscious.  yes, it is long, but even the long drawn out parts are very well done, and draw the viewer in.  You become very attached to Sheen's character.  I loved Brando in this movie.  he is creepy yet truthful.  He is one of the better \\"villains\\" in the millions of war movies that have been dumped on the public.  This is an amazing film and highly recommended.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|This movie is about the fight for justice (AIDS discrimination in the workplace). Antonio's character is seen running to a hospital because Tom's character is not well and he stays by his side through the whole ordeal. His love is unconditional. It is one of my favourite movies. I highly recommend it to all of age to watch it.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|They are both here at last, folks!  Have you been waiting eagerly for years?    Lynch's original theatrical cut suffered from too many trims in order to reduce the running time.  It features an intelligent script faithful to the Herbert novels (though the business about the Weirding Modules using the sound equivalent of Killing Thoughts is a pure and silly invention of Lynch himself.)  The performances are (mostly) fantastic, the sets, costumes and camera work are suberb, the music by Toto and Brian Eno is breathtaking, and the special effects are pretty bad.  Reviews back in 1984 stated, rightly, that it would probably be incomprehensible to anyone who had not read the book.    Then there's the ghastly, embarassing, dumbed-down version prepared by Universal TV.  It includes quite a bit of extra footage that Lynch wasn't able to include in the theatrical version, longer versions of some scenes and others (like the drowning of a sand trout and the fight with Jamus) which appear only in this version.  However, the chalk-drawing prologue is trash, the new narration is pure garbage (the guy sounds like he stepped out of an ADR session for a granola commercial,) the re-edit on Shaddam's dialogue with the Guild Navigator is a joke (did Universal really think that no one in America would understand the term \\"House Atreides?\\") and the Dune Muzak which plays underneath every scene (without any relation to what is happening on the screen) is also a shame.  No, Lynch did not record the narration for the TV version.  He does appear in both versions as the radio operator aboard the spice harvester (and has several lines, both onscreen and off.)  Lynch rightfully removed his name from this complete mess.  Did Universal think that \\"A Alan Smithee Film\\" is a representation of correct grammar?  Did they really need to use the same shot of a flying Harkonnen ship about 6 times to represent anyone in the film travelling anywhere by ship?    One thing about Lynch is his amazing use ofsound - LISTEN to his films, sometime.  Amazing.  The TV version sounds like two radios tuned to different stations.    Those of you with nice movie software might want to spend an afternoon doing a re-edit of both versions.  The theatrical cut plays much better if you plug in the extra footage from the TV version and the new collection of deleted scenes.    Nice documentaries, and the further collection of deleted scenes includes the death of Thufir Hawat.  No participation by Lynch, alas.

B000ASATZ8|5.0|This collection is an absolute must for anyone who enjoys high quality, oscar calibur films.  From its humble beginnings to its finally of ass blasters and westerns, these four movies truly show what is capable when the planets align and geniuses collaborate on a single project.

B00005T30L|4.0|Two girls are at their high school graduation.  They are joined as friends mainly by sharing contempt for everyone else.  One receives her diploma and moves on to a conventional life; the other, Enid (Thora Birch), doesn't receive her diploma and can't quite move on to a life where she needs to get a job and move out of her father's house.  She's the main focus of the film.<br /><br />Ghost World is recognized for its treatment of young alienation.  It presents a world that closely resembles this one, but with an extra edge of absurdity and lack of any happy, substantial people or fulfilling options, all of which reflects and gives reason to Enid's alienated view of life.  The film does a good job of presenting some attractive and unattractive aspects of her view.  She has a sharp wit and a sharp eye for things that are cool among the ironic kitsch/retro crowd, the mood of which drenches the film.  She finds she can also appreciate good traditional music, with no irony, as long as it's from another time than her own--she needs to stand apart.  At the same time, she is vulnerable to criticism, especially from those who might be more cool than she.  She's too insecure to pursue a normal boy she likes.  The film shows how her attitudes and choices hurt others and herself, but because she has a heart Enid remains a basically attractive character.  Her relationships with her high school friend and with an unhappy older eccentric, Seymour, whom she admires, are shown with subtlety and sharpness.  Much of what Enid does, says and sees is fun and funny, which is for some viewers what defines the mood of the film.<br /><br />Enid's final decision, whatever we're supposed to imagine it was, can be contrasted with her friend Seymour's talk about getting back to his old life, which Enid pretty well destroyed, and which seems a pretty unattractive option.  Indeed, this film shows no interest in making any option look all that attractive.  It's more a look at the alienation and lack of direction, leavened with irony and humor.<br /><br />A note on the ending.  *Spoiler Alert!*  If the filmmakers intended to make the ending ambiguous, they could have done better.  A retro completely unmarked bus in a city with modern busses (as shown early in the last scene) that requires no money or ticket on a route that there is no bus on with no other riders and no other traffic driving over a bridge into the night, all to quiet sweetly melancholic music ending with a drawn out cello note and a fade to black.  Ambiguous?  (What did Enid say she would do if her father started dating Maxine again?)  Enid does have what looks like a small piece of baggage, for what it's worth., leavened with irony and humor.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge is not a film for everyone. Some my be put off by its editing others by its overly theatrical setting but on a careful viewing the movie comes off quite well and maybe a classic of musical moviemaking. Enough has been said on this site about the plot of the film so this review will look at some of the special features that make this a worthwhile purchase. <br /> <br />The disc's high point comes in two separate commentaries: the first featuring Luhrmann, production designer Catherine Martin and director of photography Donald McAlpine. This commentary while technical gives a glimpse into the design of the film and the skill that went into mounting such a huge production. The second commentary features Luhrmann and his writing partner of 20 plus years Craig Pearce. This commentary is lighter and goes into the details of the writing process. <br /> <br />The true genius of this DVD comes on the special feature loaded second disc. This material carefully put together by Luhrmann covers virtually every aspect of the filmmaking process. We have features on writing, design, marketing, the music and many other topics along with brief interviews with the involved artists. <br /> <br />As said this is not a film for everyone but it is a unique film in that the director got to express his creative vision with essentially no holds barred. This disc is a memorable and fun look at the movie making process which I would recommend enthusiastically.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna has always had diehard fans and equally stubborn critics. There will always be \\"music lovers\\" who claim to hate Madonna because of her vocal inability, her gimmicks, or her overt sexuality. Perhaps Madonna dug her own grave a little by never balancing the focus of her artistic intentions. Should we love/hate Madonna because of her, or for the music? Should we take any artist that writes such awful lyrics seriously?? If you've read about her, you would know that this conundrum is always in the back of her mind. Her genius is more than the music (which infuriates the purists). If you love her, you love the total package, and if you hate her, you have no reason to enjoy the music.  <br /> <br />This album is the answer. I assert that it is Madonna at her absolute best. It is the Madonna album for anyone that likes dance, pop, techno, or trance. It is the album that will win back her old fans and begin a new generation of fans. Ray of Light, Music, and American Life were merely warm-ups for the future and in this album the various styles of each come together in a perfect synergy. `Confessions' doesn't feature any cosmic propaganda, country western riffs, or angry political jargon. It is pop at the core; free, danceable, and fun. Madonna seems to be enjoying the ride and taking herself a little less seriously - which is soo refreshing. <br /> <br />To enjoy this album, insert the disc into the CD player in your car, turn up the volume, forget about Madonna and her past, and stop thinking about it all so much. And a sidebar, the lyrics on this album aren't all that bad - definitely not her worst. The funniest thing ever is reading the reviews in which people slam Madonna's lyrical skills and then say they hate the songs that have the most cohesive and poetic lyrics (Isaac, Jump). Some people can't be pleased. <br />

B00005JM0B|1.0|As a fan of the Terminator series, words cannot describe how disappointing this movie is. At its worst, its a pathetic parody of the previous Terminators which ignores almost every aspect of what made T1 & T2 so enthralling. They might as well make a sequel to Aliens in which the bio-mechanical horrors are transformed into cute little munchkins who spread rainbows and sunshine all over the world. <br />At it's best, its a chance to see Kristanna Loken in tight-fitting clothes. In fact, Lokens beauty seems to be the only redeeming aspect of T3, and I'm guessing they cast her as the nemesis to try and overlay the fact that the rest of the movie is a terrible travesty of mammoth proportions. Yes, she is very attractive, but you can stick a rare and beautiful flower on a steaming pile of crap and call it exquisite french nouveau cuisine, but nothing will take away from the fact that that it's still a steaming pile of crap with a pretty looking flower on top. <br /> <br />I could write pages upon pages of text on the topic of why every copy of this movie should be destroyed immediately, but I'll sum up the salient points instead : <br /> <br />1) The dialog is atrocious, e.g : \\"John Conner\\" appearing to be turned on by the fact that Brewster reminds him of his mother. Brewster telling off Conner \\"What are you, some kind of GANG MEMBER? How do you live with yourself?!\\" There's far more, but I'm afraid I've blocked most of it out. It's too terrible to attempt to comprehend it all at once. <br /> <br />2) The attempts at humor that were not in the least bit funny. <br />Some of the one-liners from the previous Terminators are recycled in T3, but this time around they fail to retain the cool and wry humor of the originals. What I found most disturbing was the \\"Talk to the hand\\" scene at the gas station with the stupid Funky Man song afterwards. What were they thinking?! <br /> <br />And the rest : The action-over-substance quality that dominates the entire movie. The fact that many aspects of the Terminator movies that preceded this one were ignored. The fact that a coherent plot is almost non existent. The fact that there is absolutely no originality to the movie. The fact that they actually spent $160 million on this trash.  <br /> <br />I simply cannot proceed with writing anything else about this movie. I'm at a loss for words. If you will excuse me, I must now depart on a journey to bury my copy of T3 at a crossroad in the desert at midnight in the hopes that, by some miracle, Hollywood will Terminate-with-extreme-prejudice the scheduled 2008 release of Terminator 4.  <br />My advice to you would be to ignore this trash and look back with fond memories on the previous Terminator movies, click your heels, and say 3 times \\"There was no Terminator 3!\\"
B000002IZ4|3.0|The album has a couple of classic tunes. \\"vasaline\\" and \\"Interstate love song\\", which i will admit are two of the best STP songs ever. Unfortunately, they are the only two songs worth listening to on this blah album.  Album is still a must for any STP fan, but a little disappointing.
038073186X|5.0|I won't rehash too much what others have pointed out. This guy can't miss. He did an about turn with this one and in doing so he keeps finding new approaches to literary commercial fiction. While we often read reviews of writers considered masters of a certain form, few are like Lehane, who finds new ways to say old things (because face it, little has been new since Greek drama or the early Biblical stories). And not a little credit has to be given to his first two breakaways from Kenzie and Gennaro. Readers like their comfort zones, but with writing like this there's no need to worry--whatever he writes, it seems, will satisfy.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|At least one of the earlier reviews recommends novice listeners start with this cd before going to the greatest hits package.  I would say that the novice would do well to buy this package and Legend (the original single disc is recommended here because I do not own the new expanded version and cannot comment on its contents).<br />I still recommend this cd if you are looking to move beyond the novice level.<br />So, anyone with any interest in Bob Marley should own Babylon by Bus.<br />These songs were taken from numerous stops on his 1977/78 tour of Europe but the sequence sounds like one big show.  This is not the intimate show that you get on something like Live at the Roxy - it's music festival big.  The overall feeling reminds me of reggae festivals we used to have at the beach when I was growing up on the coast of NC.<br />The atmosphere is big but Marley and the band never seem overwhelmed as they rise to the occasion on each song.  The audience is taken along on a fantastic reggae trip.<br />Don't let any more time pass without these great performances in your collection.

B0000DG00B|5.0|I love this 2 cd set.  The Allmans opened and closed the Atlanta International Pop Festival in 1970.  What a music festival this must have been.  Hendrix even played one of the days.<br />These 2 shows must have been special for the brothers because they were still trying to create a buzz about their music and this festival was right in their backyard.  According to the notes the crowd grew to over half a million during the weekend.  The brothers certainly played like they had something to prove.  One reviewer complained that Duane's guitar was out of tune.  Not to me.  True, Duane's playing was all over the place - some licks worked and some didn't.  The entire band seemed to be reaching as far as they could on every song.  The results are a show not nearly as smooth and even as the Fillmore shows but that only adds to the beauty of this set and makes it a necessary purchase for the collector.  And I am one fan who would have loved to have been able to attend this show.<br />Stand outs:<br />Duane first slide licks on Elizabeth Reed don't really seem  like their on the mark but once he and Dickey lock into the guitar lines together (one on slide, the other straight lead) the experience becomes surreal.  Interestingly, Elizabeth Reed is approached the same way during both shows.<br /><br />Stormy Monday (2nd set, disc 2) rivals any other version I've heard by them.  They manage to wring true blues out of every note.<br /><br />Moutain Jam is great as always.  You get the added guitar of Johnny Winter in the 2nd set but I have to agree with the reviewer who says that it's hard to tell he's there.  Still, this is their version of Dark Star and is always amazing to hear.<br /><br />Buy this along with Ludlow and the Fillmore shows and you have a perfect picture of how the brothers played when they were the tightest band in the world.<br />5 stars just for the retro artwork (I believe the cover is how the actual poster art work looked).
0066620996|1.0|Too general and stereotypical of large structures. Does not take into consideration the phase before which is from zero to good.
0393327655|4.0|Thoroughness: 2 stars; Logic: 3 stars; Style and wit: 4 stars; Saying what needs to be said: 5 stars. <br /> <br />Sam Harris gets right to it: We have attained inordinate power; we have maintained incorrigible beliefs. This combination is untenable in an age of WMD. We cannot afford to ignore the destructive nature of nostrums in the name of namaste. We need to think about our thinking. We need to match power with responsibility. We now know enough about how our perceptions work, and how the physical world operates, to live kind and compassionate lives. It is no use dwelling in stories created by people whose knowledge and needs barely resemble our own. This is not hubris. It is the outcome of methodical (and uneven) advances in our knowledge.   <br /> <br />We might expect, then, a discerning dissection of dogma. After all, Harris celebrates that we have needs for solace, he has no argument with transcendent experience, and he actually proffers an innate, reasoned human goodness. His argument is only with the uncritical, dogmatic narratives people attach to these needs and experiences. This is a premise worth pursuing. Instead, Harris drops the ball.  <br /> <br />So soon after 9-11, Harris's polemic and artful evisceration of only two mythologies, Christianity and Islam, becomes a narrow and impassioned slice of zeitgeist. Eastern religions and atheists -- by a contrast of omission -- are untouched. In the process, he insulates these texts from his considerable wit and inventive invective. Moreover, he vacillates. His issue seems to be with destructive ideologies one minute and all ideologies the next. Early in the book, he points out that we do not see any Tibetan suicide bombers. Thus, we should draw the conclusion that Buddhist myths and means are much different from Islam and Christian. Yet, he fails to mention that Shinto Buddhists killed hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people in the last century; that a zero crashing into an aircraft carrier bearsa striking resemblance to a suicide bomber; that Hindus have happily slaughtered Muslims; or that atheists have engaged in barbarisms the Koran and Old Testament would consider commonplace.  <br /> <br />In this way, Harris might have actually avoided the incessant drone of some reviewers who would rather play the `who killed how many people in history' game than think through the author's argument for replacing dogma with reason. He might have made the distinctions we need now between being in command of myriad forms of content - as so many preachers often exhibit - and being in command of contexts -- which requires thinking about our thinking. The author's lack of consistency means he shakes the Garden of Eden's tree, veers off into the weeds of US drug policy reform, and then attempts a soft landing about the rational benefits of secular meditation while conflating it with transcendence and Eastern mythic poetry. Harris would have been better off finishing out his tour of all major isms. <br /> <br />One of the strengths of The End of Faith is when Harris connects the complicit role religious moderates play when calling for the respect of other's beliefs - no matter how insane. Yet, it seems to be only a validation or insight for those ready to hear it. In my conversations with religious moderates who have read his book, these nice people are unmoved. They are certain he doesn't really mean them. They prefer to focus on community, comfort and kindness. They see themselves as benign, even life enhancing -- on an individual basis. And the often are. Yet, they fail to think through how it can also be true that, collectively, their respect for unfounded beliefs without evidence can destroy us. Harris points out that religious moderates compartmentalize their respective religious texts in order to secure solace. Hence, it should be unsurprising to find they apply the same strategy to his information. When you hunger for comfort, identity and immortality, reason has little purchase.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, this passionate work in progress reminds those who are already sprouting through the concrete of recycled belief, that WE determine our stories. WE are responsible for our creation, attachment and dismissal of them, and WE are the locus and responsibility for human meaning and sense making. The future of our planet turns on our willingness to submit our narratives to our evolving ability to extract evidence. We have to reassess the basic questions about life in our times repeatedly if we are to broaden this human enterprise. It does not serve us to remain so smitten with ourselves that we would rather gavotte in our mirror of God than embrace our capacities to reason, to accept our mortality, and to create an intelligent global community.

B00000G3PL|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the Lethal Weapon movies since the original came out. I was 6 going on 7 and I grew up looking up to Danny Glover and Mel Gibson in their roles. Seeing them brought to life on DVD in their roles was just awesome for me. Especially now that I'm old enough to get all of the jokes. If you're a fan of the series, I fully suggest getting this series. There wasn't much in the way of commentary but...it's all good. I don't usually listen to it anyway. It's just good old fashioned fun.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Hearing Fagen's sweet tenor and those familiar chords is like having your best (sardonic, yet wistful) friend right there.  This album sounds very much like some past work (even \\"True Companion,\\" Fagen's offering to the film HEAVY METAL back in '81), yet reveals more complexity with every listening.  If you are a fan it is unthinkable not to own this.
B00004SZWD|5.0|First I'd like to say that, though I love this album, it takes too long for it to really get started. Love's In Need of Love Today is OK but too long, Have a Talk With God and Village Ghetto Land both suffer from bad arrangements, and Contution is just average.<br /><br />But once it gets started, it just keeps gaining momentum and rarely lets up. From the big-band swing of Sir Duke to the funky I Wish to ballad Knocks Me Off My Feet to Eastern-influenced (!) Pastime Paradise, the first disc of this album has a lot going for it.<br /><br />And the second half is even better. Besides containing the hit Isn't She Lovely, we also get a couple fine tracks with Joy Inside My Tears, I Am Singing and If It's Magic, it also features the best fifteen minutes in the man's discography--the lineup of As and Another Star, the former a fine ballad encouraging universal love (one of Wonder's favorite themes) and the latter, arguably the most ambitious tune the man cut, ever. In its eight-and-a-half minutes, it jumps from horn-driven soul to African-ish to jazzy, complete with a tasty flute solo.<br /><br />Thankfully, that ain't all. The bonus EP features four great cuts. Definetly the best, most eclectic album in Stevie's catalogue.

B00006JKON|3.0|Generally, I don't mind progressive rock. It's not my favorite music, but I have always loved Steely Dan and listen to Yes occasionally. However, this is just BOMBAST. The strings are overused, as is the cheap-sounding circuis organ, which is just too bad because Martin Barre's guitar is good as usual. Too bad it's about all that's worth listening to on about half the disc. Though Bungle in the Jungle, Sealion, the title track, Backdoor Angels and Sealion are all good (but not great - too much orchestra), the other half this album is unfortunate, to say the least. I can barely listen to, for instance, Queen and Country or Ladies. And who said that bagpipes on The Third Hurrah were a good idea? Whoever it was, they were dead wrong. The last cut, Two Fingers, also isn't really much. An early version of this tune (known as Lick Your Fingers Clean) appears on the expanded edition of Aqualung and is loads better. In fact, I must say I miss that obscure little Aqualung outtake!<br /><br />This is really one for the collectors. Skip it. Instead, pick up fine releases Stand Up, Benefit, Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, A Passion Play and Minstrel in the Gallery. They'll suit you much better.

B0000013G9|4.0|Let's revisit 1994 ... you had En Vogue, Salt N Pepa, TLC and Mary J. Blige. <br /> <br />This was THE time that black women in music were trumpeting girl power, independence, assertiveness and demanding respect from their men (LOL)!!! <br /> <br />Before Destiny's Child glossy girl power antics and Lil Kim's post-modern feminism, TLC's CrazySexyCool was absolutely trailblazing in girls singing about sex (albeit safe sex), manipulating relationships and using men as play things the way some men had previously used women. <br /> <br />The material sounds dated and indistinctive now because of everything that's changed in music b/c of albums like this one, but TLC still has some great, great stuff that takes me back to my junior year in high school. <br /> <br />Be on the lookout for \\"Creep\\", \\"Red Light Special,\\" \\"Kick Your Game\\" and \\"Waterfalls\\" as the album's timeless jams. <br /> <br />Most importantly, pay special attention to the lyrics ... you'll appreciate it more when you realize that women weren't singing like this 10 years before. <br /> <br />R.I.P.

B000002A3T|5.0|I know it's a little late for a review, but I really love this album, it has to be my favorite. This album has raw and pure emotion.  Anyone that thinks that Pink Floyd died when Waters left is just delusional, and not a true Floyd fan I might add.  This album has a lot of great solos and the lyrics are magical.  It is just my oppinion that a lot of this album is about the struggles during the years leading up to and after Waters' departure.  Like in \\"Poles Apart\\" when he sings \\"HEY YOU, did you ever realize when you'd become?\\" and \\" The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty, I thought of you, and the years of all the sadness fell away from me\\"  In a \\"Great Day for Freedom\\" he sings: \\"On the day the wall came down, they threw the locks onto the ground and with glasses high, we raised a cry for freedom had arrived.\\"  I think of Waters a lot when I hear this album, NOT because I miss him, but because I think deep down a lot of this album is about him. I think it's also about moving forward. Track number 8: \\"Coming Back to Life\\" is my favorite track.  I also really love track 11: \\"High Hopes\\" it's a gripping, intense song that brings tears when I listen to it.   And the solos towards the end are beautiful.  I love this album so much because I can listen to it and relate to a lot of it, it speaks to me. I feel that almost anyone can relate to at least one of the songs on this album.  This album brings sunshine into my life even in the dead of February.

The musicianship and vocals are outstanding, while the songwriting approaches levels near perfection.

Don't like it? Neither did I, but it still left me wanting more. If you don't like the language use or the way he writes, I highly suggest you don't pick up this book.

B00005JMFQ|4.0|This movie is soo amazing!  I even got my boyfriend (who is way against any movie with Love or Dancing in the title) to watch it and he LOVED it too!  It's not just a lovey dovey chick flick-- there is a lot of comedy too!  So it's a good balance for those into romance and those into comedy!
6305949980|4.0|Jack Skellington, the ruler of Halloween Town, is tired of doing the same thing every year for Halloween. One day, he accidentally makes his way into Christmas Town, and loves idea of Christmas so much that he tries to get the residents of Halloween Town to help him put on Christmas instead of Halloween, but unfortunately, things aren't going the way Jack wants them to.<br /><br />What I'd like to know is, when did the goth and emo kids take over this film, and Tim Burton's filmography, in general? Every time a Tim Burton film comes to theatres, emo/goth kids flock to see it and they cite Tim Burton as their god, when really he doesn't even make his films for them. He tends to appeal to the goth, emo, mis-understood type kids with movies like \\"Nightmare\\", \\"Corpse Bride\\", and \\"Edward Scissorhands\\". I wonder if those who worship the characters Jack Skellington or Edward Scissorhands have any idea that Burton made such classics as \\"Ed Wood\\" or \\"Big Fish\\". In my opinion, \\"Big Fish\\" is his best film, but \\"Beetlejuice\\" is my favorite Tim Burton movie, actually one of my favorite movies ever.<br /><br />They may or may not respect his filmmaking, I don't know about that, but it seems that all they care about is the fact that society associates them with him, so obviously they have to wear Jack Skellington memorabilia, and dress up as Edward Scissorhands or Beetlejuice for halloween.<br /><br />Just for the record, kiddies, Burton didn't direct \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\". All of his \\"huge fans\\" seem to be under this misconception that Tim Burton directed the movie. He produced it, approved the songs, co-wrote the script, came up with the idea of making it a musical, and it was based on his characters. That's all. Most people know this, but there are still a lot of people who don't. These people usually are the ones to call themselves \\"huge fans\\" (the ones who buy Jack Skellington clothing at Hot Topic). \\"TNBC\\" is still a Burton film, nevertheless.<br /><br />The guy's not a perfect, \\"god-like\\" director that his emo/goth/misunderstood fans are making him out to be, and \\"TNBC\\" isn't \\"THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!\\", but nevertheless, he's a great director, and \\"TNBC\\" is a great movie. Tim Burton should be thought of as a director, not as a trend.ctor that his emo/goth/misunderstood fans are making him out to be, and \\"TNBC\\" isn't \\"THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!\\", but nevertheless, he's a great director, and \\"TNBC\\" is a great movie.

B000002H97|5.0|This album is possibly the best ever made!!!! The songs are awesome,the guitars are incredable and the solos kick major ass! <br />I have owned this album since its release on cd, cassett, and vinal! Yes Iam a hardcore Metllica fan for years and own everything they have made. This takes the cake. My favorite song is Wherever I May Roam. Anyone who gave this a low rating claiming to be a rael Metallica fan must be a poser and have no musical tase! This is by far the best album Metallica ever made!

0375831002|5.0|Death narrates this future classic by Markus Zusak.  A dark read on the one hand, somthing in the book, perhaps the characters, I don't know, reaches out and touches the reader in a way thats very special.  Set in the 1930's and early 1940's, the second world war is very much a part of the story.<br /><br />Liesel, a small, young girl lives with a foster family that barely manages to get by.  In the process of scrounging for a living, Liesel begins stealing books.  At first she is unable to read, but she steals the books anyway.  Eventually her foster father teaches Liesel to read and she then begins to share the stories with those around her.<br /><br />The Book Thief is full of interesting characters.  Zusak is a master storyteller.  His ability to create a mood using words is truly special.<br /><br />Uplifting, The Book Thief will leave its mark on you.

B000000XB9|4.0|Being the age that I am,I have listened to Creedence and the unique voice of John Fogerty for some 37 or 38 years. This CD offered me all of their most popular songs without the expence and trouble of searching out the individual albums. I am pleased with this CD,yet that doesn't mean that I won't buy another Creedence album in the future. This album gives me what I want,yet allows me the freedom of increasing the list without a great deal of repitition. Having released the amount of music Creedence has,it gives plenty to listen to with a surprise or two still in the box.
0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond has catapulted himself to the status of America's most well-known contemporary popular scientist, and this was the book that is responsible for it. Much has been written and discussed on Diamond's theory/thesis in Guns, Germs, and Steel so I will only briefly recap. <br /> <br />According to Diamond, the nature of global wealth and poverty, inequality, and conquest came about as both direct and indirect result of the geography upon which societies rested. Certain areas of the world, such as the Fertile Crescent and most of Europe, eastern China, and Central America, simply have greater value for crop cultivation than other parts of the world, such as Australia and Siberia. Following the domestication of certain crops in various parts of the world (such as rice in Asia, wheat and barley in the Middle East, and corn and squash in the Americas), humans began domesticating animals - as animals proved extremely useful by providing humans with additional sources of food (meat and milk) as well as useful products such as leather or wool, and (most important of all) a vital source of labor. Beasts of burden such as horses and oxen were used to till the land and as a means of transportation. Animal excrement yielded greater crops by serving as fertilizer.  <br /> <br />The domino effect continues...More food led to a growing population. A growing population led to establishment of larger and larger towns, and eventually cities. Such a massive amount of people living in close proximity to one another and animals led to epidemic disease outbreaks (a la chicken pox, measels, mumps, and the bubonic plague) - although humans gradually built up a resistance to these diseases through the biological principle of natural selection. Larger populations of people led to increased social chaos, hence a need for social control - which brings about the rise of formal governments to keep tabs on the population and to raise armies to protect the society from both internal and external threats. Also, because agriculture became quite intensive, only a portion of the population was now needed as farmers; freed from the burden of growing and harvesting crops, the rest of the people had ample time to explore other avenues and accumulate growing amounts of information about the world (leading to development of science). Science then takes off, enhancing virtually all aspects of human life (military weapons and technology, navigation, calendar, environmental knowledge, etc.) At this time, societies have become full-fledged states, which faced no significant resistance or challenge from the hunting-gathering and chiefdom societies that lacked damn near everthing I have pointed out in this paragraph. <br /> <br />Thus, Diamond accounts for the social/historical/geographical differences that have distinguished the world's haves (Western Europe, China, ancient Egypt, the Azetcs) from the have-nots. Amazingly, Diamond has encountered emotional backlash from both conservatives and liberals for this thesis. Conservatives bemoan the fact that Diamond does not take \\"culture\\" into account (essentially arguing that it was the \\"cultural superiority\\" of Western Europeans that enabled them to conquer the world, not geography). Funny thing is, the last time I checked, food production and cultivation ARE, INDEED, aspects and dimensions of culture. (Right wingers are incorrect to claim that Diamond does not attribute culture enough credit; what they really mean to say is that Diamond doesn't credit certain ASPECTS of culture, like religion or government). Liberals, on the other hand, have blasted Diamond as a simple Eco-determinist who pays no attention to human agency and innovation (at times issuing arguments that parallel those of conservatives). <br /> <br />Many have questioned or dimissed Diamond's idea as simplistic, but I think his central thesis is important and has many more strengths than weaknesses. Critics point out that some of the world's most fertile and productive land today failed to produce great and powerful civilizations in the past (the most often-cited example of this is the Plains Indians of the midwest and the Indians of present-day California). However, this criticism reveals that the readers did not pay attention to detail in what Diamond is arguing.  <br /> <br />Diamond NEVER stated that land is SOLELY responsible for the rise and fall of civilizations. He points out that land is a starting point, but is never an end point (an important designation that the Diamond haters fail to acknowledge). Equally important is the availability of domesticated animals, particularly beasts of burden, and the contributions they give to society. The Plains Indians and the California Indians, for example, had no domesticated beasts of burden to facilitate the intensification of agriculture. The horse was not introduced until European arrival. <br /> <br />This is definitely a must-read book. Take a look at it and judge for yourself. Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the most important and influential books written in the past decade.

I have now been a purchaser for many years. I have seen other types out there but Mom's Is The Tops in my judgment.
