B00479SVBU|3.0|This is one of the most expensive FM transmitters you can buy. Some of these type units sell for $10 and up. The quality and strength of the FM transmission is very good. It still sounds like an FM transmission but the signal output is strong.<br /><br />After getting this and discovering that the remote did not work at all, initially I did not care. However, I listen to long podcasts that I download from my computer and transfer to my USB stick. You can only fast forward with the remote and the unit does not remember where you left off if you turn the car off. So I would be an hour into my podcast recording and turn the car off. I could not fast forward to my previous point without the remote, which was new defective for me. The remote is very fragile and thin and uses expensive watch type batteries.<br /><br />If you just listen to mp3 songs than I could recommend this product.<br /><br />Amazon was great about the return and refunded me the full amount which is why I shop here.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|It is not worth paying extra for, but if it is included in Prime or on Netflix it is worth vegging out with.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Another one of Martin's epic novels. Some parts of it drag - especially the chapters on the Iron born...I'm sure they will eventually be important to the story but for now I found myself slogging through them. Has some especially exciting and pivotal chapters for some of our more loved characters. Left me feeling upset as I finished due to so many open ended questions about characters!  Worried about how long it will be til book 6!!

0345803485|1.0|So, it is a difficult task to write a book. Probably any book. And before giving my thoughts I must compliment Mrs. James on accomplishing something I haven't yet, namely, putting enough words together in structures that technically meet the requirements for English sentences to qualify as having written a book. Because I haven't done that, and may never accomplish it. I have, however, read numerous books, and this is possibly the worst I've encountered in the depth and breadth of my bibliophilia. It bears the distinction of being one of the few books I haven't been able to finish in the span of a month or so, because the poor use of words made my brain hurt and induced the distinct sensation that my eyes were bleeding. It genuinely scares me that this was a publishing phenomena, not because of the subject matter (there is plenty of very well written erotica available, just go check out what Anne Rice was doing as Rampling) but because the writing in this book was so terrible. If people can excuse the genuinely poor work just because they can get their jollies from this, we are in real trouble as a society.<br /><br />Also, to Mrs. James' editor, whoever you are, I hope you got a medal, because I can only imagine how many frustrating conversations surrounded the production of this book prior to publication.

B009AJD5E0|2.0|I haven't been able to properly discuss this with anyone yet, so I'll just make the following remarks to clear my mind. There are quite a few other reviews of this movie already, and whether or not you're an Alien franchise fan I'm sure you can find what you're looking for in one of those. This is just a feminist rant, and if you don't enjoy those, you'd be well advised to move on before reading further.<br /><br />Dear Prometheus creative team (specifically, directors, writers, etc. I'm cool with you, 3D engine person),<br /><br />I would like to ask, not respectfully, if you've actually ever had direct dealings with women who enjoyed professions other than pie-making and baby-having? I thought that possibly Ridley Scott had, as once upon a time he told a story about this chick named Ripley, who, even though she was a chick, wasn't hesitant to strap on a mech suit and fight a face-chomping acid-spitting monster. In fact, at the time, it didn't seem to matter so much that she was a chick because she was just the sort of person who would strap into a mech suit to fight a monster, and that was fun to watch, regardless of genital formation.<br /><br />I'm not so sure, after seeing Prometheus, that you actually have met women who do things like science professionally. Even if you aren't able to meet one of these fabled creatures in the wild, you could easily research them using the internet. Perhaps a video from NASA showing the control room the first time images were received from Saturn or the start of Curiosity's mission. If you'd done this research, you would know that scientists, regardless of gender, tend to jump and scream like 5-year-olds getting surprise pizza when their missions are successful. It is highly unlikely they would, say, react as if confirming that human life did not originate on Earth were not as big a deal as their infertility. \\"Yeah, alien life is cool and all, but my baby machine is busted *tear*\\" is just not a probable reaction. Please note this for your future work, as I think you'll be able to use it to your advantage.<br /><br />Also, you may not be aware, but in addition to science, women these days also pursue professions such as banking and finance. Shocking, I know. Unless a women in one of these fields was just excessively stupid, her reaction to her old and infirm father leaving control of the company she stood to inherit while he wandered off into space for an undetermined amount of time would probably not be to fight for a spot on said mission. Instead, it is much more likely that she would fight to stay on earth and use the time her father was away to gain the confidence of the company's board while generally crossing her fingers that the aliens or old age would make everything a little easier by disposing of her father while he was away in space. I know this would have made it harder to create the most awkward seduction scene in the history of film, but we can't have everything we want. Excessive stupidity would explain the whole crushed-by-a-space-doughut thing, so I may have to concede my point on that front.<br /><br />I hope that, prior to your next creative endeavor, you will take the time to talk to women in the wild, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that they have interests other than their uteri and poor quality field research.<br /><br />Star Wars forever,<br /><br />A girl, who likes space stories in addition to dollies and pink dresses.is for your future work, as I think you'll be able to use it to your advantage.<br /><br />Also, you may not be aware, but in addition to science, women these days also pursue professions such as banking and finance.

B007EE4XKI|4.0|Star Trek is so much a part of our culture that it's hard to remember when it wasn't &#34;there.&#34; This three book series reconnects us with some favorite characters. Just enjoy!
193700788X|3.0|Ok, for everyone who was surprised that she picked Sam and not Eric, how did you not see that coming from book 1? Sookie enjoys the simpler things in life - making cheese straws for baby showers and serving onion rings professionally. No way she was going to give that up, and good for Harris for sticking to the traits (even though they can be a little tedious to read) that made Sookie endearing. I mostly just read these to alleviate homesickness (I'm a southerner living far, far away from the south), and while I do agree that this one was rushed, the writing wasn't as horrifically awful as either Twilight or 50 Shades. It was never meant to be the Mrs. Dalloway of the Southern Gothic. Please calm down, check it out from a library, and enjoy!
0307454568|5.0|The final book in the series doesn't disappoint. It does tie up all the story lines but it is vital that you read the three in the proper order. What a shame that Mr. Larsson left us too soon and didn't write more gripping novels for us to read.
0785153942|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find out about this graphic prequel to the upcoming movie, Pacific Rim. I really liked the TED teasers for Prometheus, and I like the teaser/extended universe trend going on outside of more and more movies. I'm only in my 30's but I've come to consider myself to be more interested in \\"old school\\" sci fi (Heinlen, Asimov, Cherryh, McCaffery, Banks) than anything written in the past 15 years. I was actually a little worried the genere was dying, as any thoughtful and possibly optimistic writing about how human culture and social behavior might change with the introduction of new technology seems to have been superseded by monsters on spaceships and zombies. How are scientists going to be inspired to invent the next tricorder or replicator if someone doesn't dream it up in a book first?<br /><br />I picked up this graphic novel with fingers crossed and was not disappointed. It is a very tightly written story - there are no wasted scenes, no weirdly choppy dialogue. I'm an avid reader of Fables, American Vampire, and Red Sonja, and this fits right in with those series in both the quality of the artwork and the narrative (actually, the narrative quality was probably better than Red Sonja. Sorry She-wolf). I recommend reading twice, because after the first time you'll be able to go back and pick out characters that show up later in the story in the early panels and learn where they were on K Day. I thought this was an impressive detail, but fair warning, reading this is only going to make you more hyper about seeing the movie, which isn't out for another couple of weeks. If you can pick it up and read it a couple of days before the movie, DO IT!<br /><br />Also, not sure what the other reviewer was talking about as far as the partial nudity, I was actually pretty relieved that no one was naked in this, I didn't think there was any more nudity than what you'd see at an American beach, and the context was much more appropriate than what you'll find in many other books.find in many other books.

0345536886|2.0|Wow, I am surprised to see all the positive reviews of this book. The story had a nice opening chapter, with Mr. Zinc quitting his giant corporate law firm in spectacular fashion and running out to get extremely drunk. After that section, however, I found the rest of this book to be super boring. I literally kept falling asleep through it, and kept thinking I should just quit reading it. We are given too many excruciating details, such as every statement (no matter how minor) that was said in court, every outfit that the attractive female attorney wore each day, and so on. Wayyyy too many dull details. Moved along at a snail's pace. The plot is unbelievable (Mr. Zink wins a huge amount of money in a court case and decides to split the proceeds with his two good-for-nothing partners. Ummm, I don't think so.<br /><br />The ending is super predictable. Everything works out all nice and pretty. Forgettable.

B005HP2JAM|5.0|Herzog, with all of his eccentricities and bold willingness to go where no one has ever gone before brings together the sensibilities of ourselves 30,000 years ago with the fact that with all of our technical powers today we're really essentially the same humans driven by the same needs but he also reveals that we are probably a bit too alienated now from the world we loved and lived in so long ago.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|This movie puts Tom cruise in a comfortable role for him.  It's a thrill ride of a movie, but reaches in some places
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I like the way this author describes the Afganistan that once was, the devastation the Talaban caused the country and its people in later years, and they way he weaves the life story of people within his story.

B0068FYZSE|3.0|The acting is not the greatest in this movie but it has a positive story line with good messages and nice dance moves
B0000029D1|5.0|This CD in about 70 minutes long and has fairly good sound quality.  The audience noise is kept to a minimum and is just about perfect.  There is enough to let you know that this is a live album but none during the playing that could spoil the sound.  I could invision a hack engineer ruining this CD by pumping up the audience volume during some of the solos as has been done on many recent live albums.<br /><br />This group consists of three jazz/fusion superstars, a popular lite jazz musician and a sessions keyboardist who has played with a bazillion different people starting with Paul Abdul and Miles Davis.  So, you get a mixture of music that doesn't always work but other times is great.<br /><br />Sometimes the band sounds like a band and sometimes they seem like individual players just doing their own thing.<br /><br />The album starts out poorly with a soft jazz rendition of the Doobie Brothers' Moment by Moment.  Fortunately, it is only 3 minutes long.  The other weak moment is Najee's Buenos Aires, but it isn't horrible.<br /><br />There is a good extended version of Cobham's Stratus.  The Larry Carlton medley is very nice.  Their version of Miles Davis's All Blues is good in parts and drags in other.  There is a very nice Good Bye Pork Pie Hat.<br /><br />The real showcase is the 20 minute School Days that is mostly a duet between Clarke and Cobham (the other join in for only a few seconds here and there).  The play off of each other is fantastic.  This alone makes the CD worth buying.  If you like Cobham and Clarke at fusion jamming best you will probably love this.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am thoroughly hooked on the series. The book is an excellent continuation... I can't wait to see the second movie and read the third book.

B0041T52S6|5.0|This movie is awesome ,everything from the video game fight sequences ,snappy dialogue, and head-banging punk rock tunes. Which reminds me me I still have to get the soundtrack to this movie.Anyway this movie is about a 20-something male slacker. From Toronto, Canada, who's dating a high school girl named Knives Chau. And he's also in a garage band named Sex-Bob-Omb, while dating Knives one day he meets an American girl named Ramona Flowers. And decides to go out with her, behind Knives back.Until one night at a gig for his band, he is attacked. By the first of the League of Evil Exes. From there he find out from Ramona ,he has to defeat six more of them. If he is to date her, This is a must see film, you definitely won't regret watching this film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game. My only complaint is that many of the clues require an individual to see the difference between red and green. Tough to do as a colorblind person. I guess if I ever truly got trapped in the home of a borderline genius psycho who left awesome clues on how to escape lying around, he probably wouldn't care about this particular handicap either. So 5 stars for realism.

B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Tour de force performance by Tatiana Maslany. Seriously worthy of an Emmy. Also contains the best opening sequence of any show ever.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie... Being a huge fan of the original as well as Wicked... But this movie just fell short. The kids loved it. They loved the characters, specifically the china doll and Glinda. The special effects were gorgeous but that wasn't enough to make the acting worth watching.

0545101425|5.0|Few people survive The Hunger Games, let alone twice.  On her second trip through the arena, however, Katniss had a little help.  As the 75th annual hunger games were winding down, full-scale revolution erupted throughout the impoverished districts and Katniss was rescued from the arena.  Her simple act of defiance in the games spoke to people and inspired them in a way she could never have imagined.  Now, like it or not, she has become the figurehead of the revolution; her mockingjay a symbol of hope and freedom for the downtrodden.<br /><br />Katniss quickly learns that the rebellion is being headquartered in District 13, long thought to be uninhabitable after being bombed to cinders by the Capital during the first rebellion decades before.  Little did anyone know that District 13 was still alive, quietly training recruits and stockpiling supplies for the next rebellion, whenever that time came.  Thanks to Katnis Everdeen, that time is now.<br /><br />The rebels slowly push onward, forcing the Capital City peacekeepers out of the districts but it doesn't take long for Katniss to grow weary of her role as the face of the revolution.  Encouraging the troops and visiting the wounded are just not her style; she wants to fight.<br /><br />When the time comes to mount an attack on the Capital City itself, Katniss finally sees her chance.  Her publicity team decides to create an army squad out of former Hunger Games survivors and send them into the Capital, well behind the front lines of course.  Things don't exactly go as planned, however, when Katniss and her squad walk right into a trap.  This is just the opportunity Katniss has been waiting for, the chance to go after President Snow, the man who has been pulling the strings of her life and the lives of her loved ones for far too long.  It's time for some payback!<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has proven herself to be a very talented writer.

She is amazingly adept at covering the range of emotions her characters feel in various situations.  Suzanne Collins began her career in 1991 as a writer for children's television shows, including the Nickelodeon series Clarissa Explains It All.

B008J34466|5.0|I haven't really listened to this CD, however my wife really enjoys playing it in her car or whilst at work.
B007NZDES0|5.0|first seen on t.v.-hand to have added to colection,as this LADY is sooo past just a preformer,she is what you hear and takes you with her on a journey!!
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|I read the book and loved it so much,I had to have the DVD. After telling my neighbors and friends about it I had to loan it to them...now if I could just figure out who borrowed it last....:)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I would really recommend this game because it's really fun and it keeps you busy. It also bulids your reflex skills and speeds skills a bit. :-)
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|Those of us who attended The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Tour will most certainly enjoy this CD.  It includes over two hours of live music and is a fairly good representation of the set list from the tour.  The surviving original members of The Beach Boys sing the lead vocals, with a group of backup musicians/singers doing the harmonies for which The Beach Boys are so well known.  Buyers of this CD who did not attend the 50th Anniversary Tour should be aware of that.  If you want to hear the high harmonies sung by The Beach Boys themselves, you should consider buying earlier Beach Boys recordings rather than this CD.  Having attended their Hollywood Bowl concert on June 2, 2012, this CD is a joy to listen to and brings back wonderful memories of that show.
B0028R765A|5.0|I loved this movie . It was so just wow . It was just like the comic book . If you like a bit of mystery and some kick but action , you'll probably like this movie
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I am a historical novel fan so this show caught my eye. I found it very well done! I will definitely keep watching!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is AWSOME ! I've always wanted a horse but have never been able to get one . This game makes me feel like I have a horse . I would definitely recommend this to any one who likes horses :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I played this game non stop through the 10 rooms. Very challenging for the mind. I just played today for the first time and have completed all rooms. Each room more challenging than the first. Need more levels quickly.
1616550414|5.0|My boyfriend and I have been LoZ fans for as long as we could remember. I bought this for him as a (christmas, graduation, birthday??) present as an alternative for the Japanese limited edition book I couldn't snag for him since they sold out too quick. It's a nice alternative, mind you. Everything went smoothly during the buying/shipping process, so I'm definitely considering that for the next time I buy from them (since I might get my own copy soon!)
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|The information is very well laid out and explained. The figures and examples are very appropriate and revealing. Worth every cent!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book had a profound impact on me. It changed the way I think about those who show signs of genius, creativity, and brilliance and those who don't. He presented these talents/gifts in a different light. I think the biggest \\"aha\\" I got from it is that he seems to make \\"creativity\\" attainable to everyone. That is exciting.<br /><br />Yes, I did learn more about Tesla's fascinating life and what the author did was leverage his life to inspire the reader, especially this one. It left me wanting to read his other books.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I couldn't put my kindle down. This game was amazing and the story was so in depth and exciting. Loved it!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I just wanted to quickly print something from the kindle. This is far too complicated. There were so many preparatory steps I couldn't even be bothered to get started.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Kept me turning the pages.  Real life gritty drama.  The hopelessness of parts of society and the failure of those supposedly in charge trying to change things for the better is neatly described.  Definitely no fantasy here.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As usual Sparks came through with a beautiful love story..  I want to read more but can't afford to do too many at one time.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|I never thought I would enjoy Jeffrey Archer books.  Then I read one.  I can't help it, I find them a really gripping read.  This saga keeps me fascinated.  On the edge of your seat stuff.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I have really read the whole series and this one had the most excitement, emotion, and action by far. I totally recommend this series. Trust me, READ THE SERIES!!!!
B000OLROWC|5.0|Amazon Prime should carry more 80s gold classics like this one. I have been under impressed with the selection of \\"thousands of free instant watch\\" titles, and The Karate Kid was definitely a diamond in the rough.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Came exactly as shown, brand new and still in the cellophane, packaged well, and even arrived before the delivery date by a couple days! Was extremely easy~ could not find this movie in stores in this area, so this was great! Thank you!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I guess he set the bar so high that it is hard to continue<br />what we have come to expect.  Lots of characters and<br />jumping from different time periods.  Still a good story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's trash. If you take out all of the graphic sex scenes, what's left?  School girls gossiping and giggling!  My time could have been much better spent watching flies eat.  So, I did skip a LOT of it to watch the flies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|need more rooms had fun playing it crazy fun and exciting hope to see more in the future please send more
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Holy crap I just played this and I'm so impressed I just had to write a review. Once I had a couple pages I had gone into a building and when I turned he was WALKING outside of the building I was in. In pc slender he just stands there while in this one he literally comes for you. I got so panicked that I got lost and couldn't find my way out. I took a breath every corner I turned because he could be there.. or be turning the corner as well. I watched him through the windows walk into the building..... and when I finally ran into him I screamed. I didn't even have the sound on so I figure it will be allot scarier with it on considering slender pc isn't scary without volume. This game is well worth the money and way better than PC!!!!! Get the game and don't even hesitate!!!!!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|If J Cole keeps this up he could be the next greatest rapper ever! Nas set the standard for me and the fact that Cole looks up to Nas makes things even better. I think that alone might make him notorious in the REAL hip hop community. Great CD though...
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Track #1, St. James Infirmary, is one of my favorite tunes and Laurie's piano is one of the best versions I've ever heard.  Combined with his throaty & exuberant song styling I have to give this my top rating on the CD.  He provides a brief, but informative, education on Jazz & Blues in the 'Liner Notes&#34; and his tongue and &#34;cheeky&#34; comments are a welcome change to the usual notes provided on many CD's. All of the musicians were perfectly selected for this 'outing' and bring nothing but pure entertainment. and you can't get enough of the guest vocalists.  I enjoyed them all but especially thought Dr. John, on &#34;After You've Gone&#34;, nailed it.  As Laurie puts it, he's a &#34;middle-class Englishman, openly trespassing on the music and myth of the American south&#34;.  Let's hope he stops by again, and often!<br />Indy Rose
B00138J14Y|5.0|This album is pure perfection...real hip hop at its finest...cant go wrong with this one here trust me on this.
0316069884|5.0|This book changed my life. Since reading it one year ago I no longer eat factory farm raised meat. I feel better. I am 12 pounds lighter and my cholesterol is 60 mg lower. My wife is beginning to do the same:)
B003VS0CX8|5.0|We actually purchased this DVD as a gift.  We were confident that it would be well received (it was).  It is one of our all-time favorites.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|A fascinating insight into the North Korean mindset. While a fictitious story, in the light of today's world, it is evident that there is truth in the underlying theme of the book.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A great read with lots of meaning and a great story. Well written! The author really brings the characters alive and it's hard to put down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game. Makes you stop and think. Could be longer. Perhaps it could be a little more challenging. Interesting and kept my attention.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is super fun for the whole family and keeps the kids busy for hours at a time..great game!
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|If this soundtrack were a novel, I feel like it would read like the same two or three sentences are repeated over and over. Drums. Drums. More drums. It's like I took a generic digital drum loop on my Cakewalk program and cut and pasted it 38 times and thought I created something.<br /><br />The one lovely patient piano melody here is so delicate it gets squashed.<br /><br />A big fan of the GLADIATOR score (and others Zimmer has done), I listened to this score nine times before finally admitting the truth as I heard it...there's very little creativity here, and even less joy. I felt this way before I saw the movie, which turned out to be equally joyless.<br /><br />One big problem I had with the movie is that Superman never connects with the people or even the military, really. It's all people and things getting thrown into (and through) buildings. Zimmer needed to add some emotion to the screen to compensate and in my opinion didn't pull it off this time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love Hosseini's books and this one did not disappoint.  I like his writing style and found that the book gripped me from the first page.  It is not only an interesting interwoven story but it teaches you also.  I would definitely recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr. Hosseini is a great story teller.  In my opinion, he is the best writer in today's market.  This book is many stories within one story.  He avoids the obvious and the cliche and transports the reader to another time and place.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Well written each episode a cliff hanger.Some nudity and lots of bad language. Then there are the the murders. blood and stabbing  so you might save this one until the kids are in bed. Otherwise it great entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My five year old does way better than me. Keeps her busy for a long time. This is a favorite. Even my three yr old likes to try, but it's too hard for him yet. Good variety and graphics. Not as violent as other similar games.
B005UG542S|4.0|I liked the way it brought everything together and even gave you a life after type ending.Very nice way to end the series
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|and then some!  Bruce is great as usual, I would like to have seen a little bit of the John McClain who was not sure, but he is all but gone now.....erased by the bevy of bad guys in the 4 previous Die Hard movies.  John is now simply expecting the worst, all the time and he gets it.  This is a atomic sleigh ride from the first action scene to the end.....
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|Jane Austen novels all in one place! Happy to have on my Kindle! Ms. Austen never fails to tell a wonderful story & now I have her complete set all in one book.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love this app. I ride in my friends car a lot and when a song comes on that I really like and want to download, I just use this app and it tells me what it is I'm listening to. When I get home, I can easily find and download the song I heard.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well of course I was riveted from page one, it's an instant hook.  Pretty girl, starving family, all the goodies.  And I continued to be hooked until the end, then grumbled because it didn't end the way I would have liked it to.<br />I would, however, liked to have seen a few flaws in the main characters.  The good are so good and the bad are so bad.<br />But I loved it.  As soon as I finish this review I<br /> will be ordering the next in the series.  Oh, my husband said I can't order it until after I have cooked dinner.  Seems I've been preoccupied with THE HUNGER GAMES and he is just hungry.<br />Now, what can I cook in a hurry?
B00AECGQF2|1.0|We purchased the app and it will not open. It says user not entitled to the content. When you click on read more it pops up quit.  Don't purchase this app.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I love how Robert Downey Jr. just takes on the persona of the Iron Man. I think that he was made for the part not the part made for him. Jeff Bridges Is also brilliant. What ever the role is he always nails it. This is just a great movie. I must admit that I also wanted to see my younger cousin in a small cameo role as the driver of the vehicle that was killed when he was taken prisoner. She is all grown up now. Great to see you Eileen. Great job to all of the actors.
B0017SWSCW|4.0|Completely different book from what I expected.  Not an easy book to put down.  Archer was  new author for me.  I plan to read more of his books.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|what's not to like about this movie, a guy gets suckered into a job he thought was helping his Government that he's already sworn to protect and then they try to take him out, HA! wrong move on their part
B005HSL626|4.0|My son is extremely happy with it! I would recommend this game! The pop up ads are a little bit annoying but you get used to it!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Good story about OZ before Dorothy. Liked the special effects and the story line. Would have like to see the sequence of events prior to the wizards arrival a little more.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|This is a truly entertaining program series.  Kevin Spacey is at his best.  During his wheeling and dealing, Spacey will will turn to the camera and talk in character to the viewer as if you're in the scene with him.  West Wing fans should like this series.
B006QF61VA|5.0|I've loved this movie for years and I hadn't watched it in a while and it was still amazing and made me laugh so much!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|How can I wait another 6 months for the next season? I watched all 3 seasons in just a few days. I couldn't stop. Love it.
B00111YM5G|3.0|Had to get a copy of this, since I discovered Andy on Spartacus: Blood and Sand. Not a bad movie. Like the plot and the twist on it.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I am still reading, but I can't wait to continue reading everyday.  Ive really learned alot about the Indian culture
B0034G4ORC|2.0|I often wonder what made producers going through all the troubles making films.<br />Directors, actors and film crews I can understand.<br />Like everyone else, it's work.<br />Nowadays we have technologies to make any fantasies with computers.<br />For a movie of this type, the key is \\"the alien\\".<br />Technically speaking, this film is adequate.<br />Los Angeles is under attack by an alien force and the spread of destructions starts from the<br />long stretch of beach front.<br />A team of marine is ordered to stop the incoming mega force.<br />So what are the aliens?<br />Just a bunch of updated flying saucers, metallic soldiers and a metallic(again) command center.<br />All these for 116 mins of mayhem.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Great game! Not only does my 7 year old love it but I do as well. I would have gave it 5 stars but it takes a while to collect coins unless you buy them.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|It funny how life can go just along fine and then one day it changes in a snap.  You think something or somebody would stand up for you but doesn't. This is a great ploted movie on system that seems to be broke. The asspect of fixing the problem is so different that you will have to watch this movie more than one time. This movie is very well written and the cast does an outstand job of acting.
076421120X|5.0|I love this devotional! It makes you think about the love of God everyday in a different way. I love listening to Darlene Zschech's music so when I seen this was available to review I jumped on it! To do a sufficient review I made sure to read at least 30 days of this devotional so that I could get a good grasp on the material. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I will continue reading this devotional throughout the years even though she believes somewhat different than me.<br /><br />I received this book in exchange for my honest opinion from Bethany House Publishing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|being able to change the level (1, 2, 3 suits) keeps the challenge going. A more interesting version of solitaire.
B0037UUZQY|5.0|I got this for my 4 year old girl, she is a fan of Rapunzel. She is really happy with it and I'm getting the prince too!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun I play it all the time and I love how there is different paths you might say or ways you can take and you can walk on top of the trains when they are stoped or moving. This game is the best I love it!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I've seen several versions of this and this one was creative and fully of energy.  Of course it was the anniversary and the ending was like Royal icing on top. Outstanding.<br />Wildwave
031620157X|5.0|The story really pulls you into the world, I literally could not put it down, I thought it was brilliant!
0385341008|4.0|Peek into life during WWII from common Islanders by England. Touching and worth the read.Pick it when you are traveling.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it! IT reminded me of fifty shades he was broken and she was broken in different ways.. it was a great read!
B004X2M9VY|4.0|Kind of lagged in parts.  Some episodes are lame.  More into the inter-personal relationships rather the having more action and thought provoking shows.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was a great read! The characters well thought out and so much more. The love store in this was great makes you wish it was your own.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Read his other books and found this book enjoyable.  Not as heart wrenching as his others.  Which is nice.  Not so much details in the abuse of humanity.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|When I obtain this application I assumed that it would have more edit options; however, it works its purpose. Does not give great edit but they are okay.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Unusually written in a 'diary style' but enjoyed this book, found it difficult to understand the authors' persistence in hindering Jonathon Harker's ability to figure out how to help protect Mina from Dracula. Her misery was VERY prolonged. Recommended reading. I've seen several versions of Dracula movies, which have been quite poor (including the one with Keanu Reeves, Wynona Ryder and Gary Oldman)
B001OB7F98|4.0|I won this book in a first-reads giveaway, thank you! I really enjoyed this book. I love novels, but I also like short stories occasionally.I love stories with a twist, War Hero was really good. Another one I really enjoyed was Vestigial Girl. Holy Days was very original. My favorite story was Dreameater by Andrea Stewart. It is the story of a little girl, Alexis, and her mother Linda. I would like for Ms. Stewart to continue this story in a novel. This story leaves you wondering what happens to Alexis in the future, will she become like her mother, who is a dreameater, like her father who is a dreamcatcher, or neither one?
B00A8ECU24|5.0|So far so good and still free.most games like this end up costing money but so far have not ha d to pay
B00AB7HESI|5.0|everyone loves it, including all three of my sons who range from age 9 to 15, and I have even found myself playing this game (for hours). It is easy enough for the kids but occasionally makes them think...which they need to do once in a while especially over the summer.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The author gives us an inside look at the relationships between the men who have held the highest office in this country.  I have only begun with a view of Eisenhower, Truman and Kennedy.  Already I have a very different view of Eisenhower, who was not the semi-god that he was thought to b e by many.  His experience as career army did not always carry over well into the civilian role of president.  I am eagerly looking forward to the forthcoming chapters.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Emotionally charged and intellectually deep, this film not only shows the stress and rigor of submarine warfare but also its ultimate futility. There is no need to have it translated from German to English. It is better seen and heard in the original German dialect, with English subtitles. The Kaptainleutnant is a classic hero defeated in honor. The need to affiliate the whole crew with Nazi Germany is superfluous. Their bonding is within their sub, their loyalty to one another, there devotion their Herr Kaleut. This is a profound film, best viewed in pensive isolation. It is of the highest quality.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Help me keep organized with everything. The fact that you can add pictures makes it even better. If I see a recipe in the magazine or online I can easily snapshot it and file it away from later.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a good book for anyone looking to start a program. One of the things that I really liked is that the author provides references to solid research to back up the statements made for both the nutrition and for the lifting/fitness parts of the program.<br /><br />This doesn't go into some extreme end of the diet spectrum just sound long term advice on how to structure your intake.<br /><br />I started the lifting program and found myself able to do more weight than I thought in the beginning and looking forward to tracking the improvements over the length of the program.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to both beginners and anyone that has lifted for a while but not seeing results.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app I just wish I didn't have pay for the upgrade to get the other alarm tones. Other than that it's great
B0060AY6FO|5.0|I love Jane Austen's writing so this is the first time I have ventured away from her original works.  But, James is a great writer so I decided to take a chance.  I'm not much of a mystery fan so I was surprised how quickly I got caught up in this story.  I'm sure you will love it too.  I don't want to give anything away, but I really enjoyed how charchaters from her other  novels were woven into this tale
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This is a chance for me to practice my DJ skills if you guys don't like it  then don't rate it
B00079FUI6|4.0|For me, character development makes a good series and this delivered.  I liked all of the principal characters, warts and all.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The story and writing style keeps you engaged, just as The Kite Runner and a Thousand Splendid Suns did. I love Khaled Hosseini's inspiring novels.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Tied the series together nicely.  It really was the only way to end this fine series.  Interesting special features as well.
B0027MJU00|2.0|Dark Places keeps you wondering  &#34;who done it?&#34;... To the point of frustration... You start screaming &#34;JUST TELL ME WHO DONE IT ALREADY!&#34; It stalls in places and gets a bit redundant, no new revelations - hence the frustration at times. Gone Girl is much more satisfying. As is Sharp Objects.
B001BOXJZW|5.0|What a wonderful and unique singer. I first became aware of her in the movie Across the Universe. I quit buying CD's last year when I discovered Rdio.com, but this was a must have.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|This bat man toy was much bigger than what i had expected, a big yay! to that. What a great gift to my son.
B005QBBCMI|1.0|This movie is extremely slow, hard to watch, and the ending just makes you want to cut your wrists and bleed out in a bathtub.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I found that this book was not as well written, or gripping, as Fall of Giants. It could be because the story followed on from Fall of Giants, and it became too repetitive.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Lots of fun with om nom. A different challenge and an intriguing game but I'm still waiting for new levels in the original game. Still, this was free with those silly coins Amazon is trying to popularize.<br />With the time spent playing, sure beats starting out the window.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is clever and well thought out.  Feel confident to download.  Very relaxing to find the puzzles solution.  Ai found each room challenging but logical.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|This app is cool but you need up servers  on it so we can play online like seriously who agrees with me.Like this needs a little minecraft pocket addition needs in it like come on .
B008GXHOFW|5.0|want it so bad but parents wont let me It looks so cool with the free roam the missions lizard fighting definetly a 5 star app
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Love the series, but this book was really sloooowwww... And dealt with characters i really didnt care all that much about. Maybe i should have just skipped right ahead to A Dance with Dragons...
B0002XMF5I|5.0|Heavy , dark and demonic. The way sabbath should sound like. Too bad this classic album does not get the attention it deserve.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  I can't wait for the next season.  It is so refreshing to watch a series that is not full of sex, violence and cussing.  Please hurry and bring on the next season.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My granddaughter loves this cat. We play together, wish there was more free stuff that you don't have to buy in order to get things for Tom cat.... :(
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|It wasn't quite what I thought it was gonna be but I was sure what I was expecting. It was a zombie movie with a Romeo and Juliet storyline. It was entertaining and we enjoyed it. The makeup was good and the effects were good too. I gave it 3 stars just because its the not greatest movie but I didn't want the 2 hours of my life back :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really love this game! I cannot wait for the next chapter. Please hurry with the next chapter because I am hooked!
1476733953|5.0|This will be a classic.  Great story and just plain fun to read!  Brings us to a place that is unforgettable.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|fun for me and my kids. we all work together on it. once you get to a certain level there aren't as many difficult challenges but we are hoping for more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked this game, I just wish there were more than 10 levels.  It was easy yet challenging.  it took a little while to figure out what to do and I wish there were a little more direction, but overall, it is a good game.  Can't wait until they release more levels.
1442359315|5.0|Coincidently (?), I was slowly working my way through the writings of St John of the Cross when this book was suggest to me.  I have not read of other NDE's, but had some inkling of it through the death of my sister-in-law.  St John addresses 'union with God' from a monastic setting in the 15th century.  While a far more complex approach, what he describes matches very closely with many of the things related in this book.  Taking the book on its face, I doubt there is any direct connection to be made between the two, as far as the first being used to produce the second - although each sheds light on the other.<br /><br />I suspect the true disbelievers will remain so, but it may reach those (probably most of us) who haven't completely closed our minds to the possibilities.  It addresses the question as to whether we are human beings (occasionally) having spiritual experiences, or whether we  are spiritual beings having a human experience.<br /><br />On the less positive side, I wish he had said more about his seemingly quick recovery from coma.  As serious as his situation was in coma, and the quick deterioration going into it, which he explains in great detail, he has relatively little to say about coming out of it from the pure medical perspective.  He does talk about the slow return of brain and other functionality, but does not say anything about what happened to the bacterial infection that was at the root of it all.  Did the antibiotics finally kick in, or was there something else (miracle?) involved.  After expounding on the seriousness and the dire statistics for any kind of recovery - it would be interesting to hear what happened in his body to return him to full functionality.<br /><br />I have listened to the audio version twice, so far, and will hear it again as my wife listens to it.  From the credibility standpoint, I think there is much value in hearing it read in the author's voice.
B001HBWY8M|3.0|The perfect movie for a night of just lounging. I love Colin Firth and he makes this movie watchable. Amanda Bynes is okay in it as well.
B0093LFXIG|5.0|Seriously a great book!<br />Helped me to fall in love with the boys over and over again!<br />Recommended to every Mcfly lover!!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I love this man's rich mellow voice . This cd really shows it off. Corrina, Corrina, and A Rainy night in Georgia, what couldbe better.  I haven't had one of Scaggs' newer cd's and I plan to order more.  He's a wonder!
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|As always the older series don't ever disappoint.  I watched the entire series a long time ago and it was refreshing to see them again
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Vampire weekend is Staying true to their music style and good music making.  This album was not a disappointment and maintains the whimsical arrangement with solid lyrics.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Should be read by everyone and taught in college and even high school courses, easy and entertaining to read, enlightening.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book speaks like no other how one courageous young girl survived a horrific ordeal. How she kept her wits together so she and her children would stay alive. My heart goes out to Jaycee.
0743289692|5.0|Fascinating autobiography of a courageous woman who grew up in Somalia, enlightening for understanding how an Islamic society operates, every American should read this book.
B00BSO2U1Y|1.0|This is perversity in extremis. (I wished to give it negative 5 stars, but amazon makes no allowance for this.) Why does not some living composer write something for Ms Bartoli's peculiar \\"gifts\\" so that she can desist in raiding the works of dead composers unable to defend themselves?  On the other hand, long after this performance is relegated to the cutouts dustbin of history, Bellini's masterwork will still be there, awaiting worthy proponents.
B0013V3GN8|5.0|Absolutely well worth the money! Great movie/<br />THE KING LIVES! The concert coverage was incredibly clear and great sound. BUY IT
B004JN1D2I|4.0|IT's a good price for all 4 books.  I just don't understand how Martin can possible wrap this story up.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|A different direction from their earlier records, but it is the best. I listen to this album at least once a day.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|No matter what I did, the connection just didn't feel secure - I could tug at the wire (16AWG) and pull it out of either opening.  I wanted to use the center opening but the side opening was slightly more tight.  Amazon definitely needs to include instructions with these little guys.  But, they work, they're boatloads easier than trying to wire directly into the receiver, and my speakers sound great!  EDIT 04 December 2015: I found that if I remove the colored plastic ring (red or black denoting positive or negative conductor) from between the screw and plug portion that I can get my 16AWG wire tight and secure.  So I just slip the plastic ring onto the end of the speaker wire, then the screw portion of the plug over the wire, and twist it down.  Not perfect, but it works for me.
B002Q63JEU|5.0|I have always liked Paramore, but this album definitely shows their softer side. I like this album so much that I use The Only Exception as my alarm sound.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was really great. I'm glad I could read it. I wish that Rick Riordan makes Percy Jackson & the Olympians, Book 6. I would really recommend this awesome and amazing book to boys & girls the age of 7 and up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an amazing program. Take the time to watch this phenomenal show, you won't regret it! It deserves 5 stars.
B0037EPYLG|5.0|Cream of Clapton shows the wide range of Eric Clapton's music.  And, I like like his music.  Just a fantastic album.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|I buy the game and its downloading but it gets stuck at 78 percent. Anyone help with this I really need the help.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I've been a big fan of The Black Keys for a few years now. This is a little more full sounding than some of their earlier albums, but still fantastic and gritty.
0307341577|5.0|If you buy one Gillian Flynn novel, you'll rush to Amazon to buy the other two.  Yes, there are only three so far.  I've always liked strong male authors who do legal thrillers, but I've found Flynn, female author, who's just as super doing psychological ones.  I like to say (forgive me) she &#34;writes like a man.&#34;  In Dark Places, I often found myself suddenly gasping in shock as Libby and her cohorts moved through the novel searching for the killer.  The actual murders were always unexpected and carried out in the goriest fashion.  For example, Libby is talking to a suspect when...&#34;I caught a flash of metal to my right, just as Crystal slammed an ancient clothes iron into my temple, her mouth stretched wide in a frozen scream.&#34;<br />For me, Gillian Flynn's novels may not be legal thrillers, but they are just as gripping.  And by the way, I learned a movie is nearly finished.  Can't wait!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|a lot of fun to play just to kill time. oddly addictive. the variance between the vehicles and tracks keep it varied enough not to get boring quickly.
B009QA3VY2|2.0|I'm completely captivated by the romantic musings of this novel. If you'd like a little pre-WW I/pre-suffrage glimpse into the lives of some intellectual ladies of independent means, you must certainly add this book to your reading list but not this version of it. This one is poorly edited or transcribed into electronic format and leaves out words and paragraphs--and possibly full pages for all I know. There aren't enough omissions that you will lose the story but you will find yourself puzzled at points. It's just as annoying as listening to a scratched record or cd that skips.<br /><br />There are enough editions/iterations/outputs (what are they called?) of Howard's End that you should skip this one and get one that includes all the words.
1591845556|5.0|I found this book very usefull to start understanding how to learn somthing fast. It goes straight to the point, and then it gives you clear examples on how to use the fast learning principles on specific skills. That helped me design new fast learning courses I will launch soon.
B008PZYZH6|5.0|Lots of action with humor to boot!  Would love to see another Dirk Pitt movie.  Cussler stories are a treat!
B002RXHW6S|4.0|this bouncer has great value for the money. my little boy really loves it. probably it would be better if it comes with a pump but, come on, for less than 60 dollars what would you expect.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|As always, 24 has great non stop action with great action. Jack Bauer never gives up. The ending leaves it open that Jack will be back!
159463176X|5.0|My book came rapidly and in perfect shape. I am anxious to begin reading it, I certainly enjoyed his previous publications.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|this isnt your average gory zombie movie. Its actually a cute love story btween a zombie and a girl he rescues
B006LSZECO|4.0|Without giving away too much, this story was pretty good--as you learn more about the 2 main characters, you realize they really deserve each other.  It is written in an interesting &#34;he said-she said&#34; style but still has surprises throughout the course of the story.  My only issue with the story is its increasingly cynical tone which is kind of a bummer after a while.  But it's a pretty good read.
B001R1PZ9M|3.0|But painful for parents to join in on.  The same TMNT fun for the kids.  They want to watch it again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched season 1 because of the reviews and immediately became addicted to it.  I can't wait to start watching Season 3 which just became available.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|I'd heard of Rosebud and knew it was from the movie. I'd heard about William Randolph Hurst trying to use his muscle to block the film. I remember Orson Welles from when I was a kid but he was already old, very large in girth, and doing wine commercials.<br />Watching this film caused me to appreciate Welles genius. If you plan to watch it, research everything that was going on in the world when he made it. Check out the actual biography of Hurst first. Dig a little into why Welles made this movie.. .then take it all in. I think you'll appreciate it and enjoy it when viewing it from the perspective of the world that existed around it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun and exciting but being forced to stop because i &quot;run out of energy&quot; just kills it for me. Great graphics too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Timely. Entertaining and impressive. It was a welcomed and relaxing change to watch a silent and well done film. Family friendly w incredible acting!
B00CH87HF4|1.0|don't download unless you want your time wasted bugs are rampant gameloft customer service a joke still waiting for problems with my games to be fixed for over a month keep saying they are working on it even tried deleting and restarting now frozen on load screen gameloft email they would reinstate gold and gems ive spent in game appearantly another gameloft lie still waiting
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Wonderfully written, Martin has truly created a world strikingly fresh and magnificent. Brimming with political intrigue and quick action this book will leave you begging for more.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Awesome book of faith in God and courage! You will not be disappointed!  You will not want to put this book down.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I didn't think it possible but Martin has outdone himself. Once boring stories become interesting. The intrigue, espionage, and action are thrust to a staggering speed. Well done and amazingly fun. Better than the first
B007N8RULO|4.0|Addicted to this game.  I love to play one hour before bed. The only annoyance is the ads that pop up.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|after suffering with my father's hearing loss yet for another Father's Day, i thought i would look online for hearing amplifying devices that might help improve our gatherings...we are always having to yell and he doesn't hear....don't ask why he won't use a hearing aid. i've been asking him that since he was 90!<br />but this works. he can watch tv and he can actually hear it. i don't have to scream to be heard. it is NOT a hearing aid...but it makes sounds audible to someone with limited hearing...all for about $20? too good to be true...but it is true!
B009R659L8|5.0|Fast paced and thought provoking.  The plot was believable and thrilling at the same time. Hard to put down each night.
B0087URXZU|5.0|This by far has to be Joe's best recording to date. His experience as a musician and songwriter has shown many that he is still on top of his game.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|This app overall does an amazing job at recording the videos, I just wish that you did not have to win champions to make a video,but overall the app does what it should
B004YXE438|4.0|This is a nice game and I like it that there are different levels of difficulty. Also like that you can add more pictures for added entertainment.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb is awesome. You get to buy vehicles and places. You also get to upgrade vehicles. I &lt;3 hill climb.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|This game has the makings of being quite good. If you like to figure things out. Don't play it much as I prefer games that will allow me to just chill and not think
B000FC2NGM|4.0|It's a good &#34;first&#34; book to start with if you're a first time reader of Agatha Christie.  I couldn't put it down.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|It has potential but I found the clues to be to vague and not enough information as to what the goal of the game is.
B009Y6231U|5.0|Lots of action and great acting. Kurt Russel was perfect for the part.  The ending was great. Try it  you will like it.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|This game is ok for the type of game it is, but I think there are ways it could be improved.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|My granddaughter loves this.  I don't get the fascination that she does.  Since it is free, I can't complain. OK
B001NA6096|4.0|I  Watched this Thursday night---need to watch the next one (probably tonight) to see what happens with them-interesting plot. Will they meet again?
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I spect that it is difficult to know exactly what is going to happen and when.  Our condition is not always the same as the airport
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Reminds me of Mario which I grew up on. I love this game. It's lots of fun and addictive.  Perfect little game to kill some time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has done it again. Woven lives together, apart and back together again through generations to make your heart almost burst!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the way Gideon took Eva way and married her. Do not like that Eva can not own up to them being married. So what if the family is hurt they can have another wedding to let them see what they missed.  I want to know what the 4th book is going to be called and when it will be out.  Had to wait to long for this one.
B003U53GK8|5.0|I loved this series.  I became addicted to it.  At first I thought it was like a soap, but it sucked me in and I want more like it.  I have very firm beliefs about the ending, that don't agree with the other addicts I know.  That's okay.  Lost was for everyone and I just loved it.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Still trying to get into the flow of it but overall pretty good.<br /><br />Will try the next season to see if that helps.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|More, More, More series like this.  I love all the characters.  I love the extended and intricate plot lines and it entertained me for weeks.  What more can I ask.
B00821OX98|5.0|It is a very good character driven show with a wonderful cast and great story line.  Will definitely keep watching!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Yup, never really grown out of my Fall Out Boy stage, so this is beyond great to listen to. It's been in my car CD player for a while now.
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|This is an excellent example of Andre Rieu and his orchestra. He brings in great singers and the music is wonderful! If you have to choose one of his DVD's, I would go with this one, or the 'Radio City Music Hall'.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|As a fan of books battling good vs evil this one is up there.  An easy read with great plots twists and turns. I'm already on the last book.
B005X5XIL0|4.0|This is a great show, but it has a little too much opera for us. If you like opera, you'll love this;  His best stuff for most Americans would be 'Live in Tuscany' or 'Under the Desert Sky' out by Lake Las Vegas. Those two I think are his best, but this one is right up there with them if you like opera.
B002XXPNXG|5.0|I love all three of these movies. They're just real, natural and timeless. While watching, you often feel like you're listening in on a conversation between some of your best friends. Talking about nothing but talking about everything all at the same time.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was interested in a new series.  After seeing the Jack Reacher movie I started Lee Childs first Reacher Book.  Enjoyable easy reading.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a wonderful,captivating app with hidden objects sprinkled around!  I could not put it down until it was completed and what an ending!  Recommend this app to anyone over 13yrs old.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|It has all the 7th season and then some. Interesting information added on the last disc. And the price was right compared to Showtime. Amazon is the best I have found, so far.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!  it is so addictive and challenging....even my kids love it!<br />I cant wait for more levels.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I liked this book.  It was exciting and I couldn't put it down.  Anyone who enjoys thrillers and a mysteries would like it.
B005LAII80|5.0|It was a shame that the movie did not get the proper attention when it was in the theaters but now is your opportunity! Karl Urban is Dredd!!! This re-imagining is far superior to the Stallone yawner from the 90s. It is darker, grittier and plays true to the ideals brought by the comic creaors. Action packed, simple yet compelling story and great acting. At this price from Amazon, its a must buy!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice app its very fun and addicting, hope to see more levels soon. Not sure what else can be said about this ohter than that it is very fun and addicting!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I wish we could have longer seasons . Loved the show but not happy about the ending. I will miss some characters next year.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was really impressed by this book... It made me laugh, cry, it surprised me. It has everything... Not the end you would expect. Everything has a reason to happen. Amazing...
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|We enjoyed this movie!  It is a very different movie.  Definitely not one to buy, but an enjoyable one to watch non-the-less.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This is not a book for young girls. The plot is driven by its sex scenes, if this were a movie it would be rated &#34;X.&#34; While I enjoyed the character development and the premise of the book, I didn't like the sex. This should be considered porn for girls/women: the sex is too perfect and creates a false expectation for girls, much like porn creates for guys.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A moving story with phenomenal direction and acting.  Love it.  Great for war film fans, horse fans, award winning film fans.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|If you like Shinedown, you will like this album. I have listened to it several time and continue to like it.
1594488886|5.0|Finding a book that is able to appease to all of your senses is very difficult, but Khaled Hosseini is able to accomplish this very feat with his novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Hosseini followed up his first best seller The Kite Runner with another captivating read that hooks you from the very first page. Similar to his first book he tells the story of oppression in modern day Afghanistan. The book, A Thousand Splendid Suns, teaches you about the culture of a foreign world and the struggle of inequalities while still painting a continued vivid image in your mind, which makes it an excellent read.<br /> A Thousand Splendid Suns is able to keep the reader interested throughout the entire book because of the author's vibrant writing style.  Hosseini uses colorful descriptions to make the reader feel as if they are in the scene.  He also explains the features of each person he writes about as if you are staring at them.  A Thousand Splendid Suns continuously paints a picture of each scene in your mind with its remarkable attention to detail.<br /> Khaled Hosseini not only tells you a story in his novel but teaches you about another culture most are unfamiliar with.  Hosseini portrays daily life in the Afghani culture, which is more relatable to readers after recent events in the Middle East.  Also, at a time when people should be enriching their lives with outside cultures Hosseini is able to accomplish this throughout the pages of his book.<br /> A Thousand Splendid Suns is a novel of overcoming obstacles and triumph.  Hosseini is able to use the theme of the book and the constant turmoil throughout to inspire his readers.  Hosseini is also able to still portray the message of hope even in the darkest of times.  A Thousand Splendid Suns motivates its readers to want to make change themselves after seeing the adversity the main character must overcome.<br /> This novel makes you realize that change is a constant and helps you realize what changes you need to make yourself.  It is a novel that gives you hope and makes you reflect on your own life.  The author uses beautiful imagery and a culture we are not familiar with to drive across his message to the readers.  A Thousand Splendid Suns is an easy read for readers of all levels and one that is very enjoyable.  It will keep you at the edge of your seat till the very end and keep you wanting more.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its a fun game. I just wish you could earn things faster and didn't have to depend on others having to gift you things. I am not very patient. lol
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun.  Sometimes you get it right away other times it takes a little.  Not too hard or frustrating though.  Keeps you thinking.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Can't play LV type solitare on it. I play for a lo g time and the Battery won't last  that long.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|I only downloaded this so I could give it a 1 star review for needing so much fine grained detail about the user. Shuck it, developer. Shuck it long, and shuck it hard.
0142000671|5.0|another great Steinbeck book!  recommended for all US citizens new to the US or born here, to read it.....highly, highly recommended.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I have enjoyed watching all of the shows during the fourth season again. The video and audio quality of the DVDs in this boxed set are outstanding.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It is relaxing; has variations to do. Makes the games more interesting.  I just wish you could change backgrounds, even characters.
B000059MEL|1.0|Upon opening the vinyl straight from the plastic wrap, it was scratched in several places.<br />Three or four of the songs are hardly listenable.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works well. Very organized. All info in one place. Better than other weather apps. Updates fast and constant. And it's free!
B0013ND36G|5.0|one of my favorite movies i also ordered TERMINATOR SALVATION also great ,cant wait for the next installment in the franchise!
B003WTE886|1.0|This is Taylor Swifts least creative piece of music. Her self-titled debut and some of Fearless is alright, but THIS is \\"diary hidden\\" nonsense.  I found none of these songs good. \\"Mean\\" is the most atrocious garbage on this CD. Like Pumped Up Kicks, it talks about getting revenge on a bully, and that song should be burned in a fiery inferno where all good rock fans gather in a circle and watch this song burn in the most violent fashion ever. \\"Mine\\" is also atrocious, but not worse than \\"Mean\\". Also, Taylor Swift sings about being in love in most of the songs. This is advice to NEVER buy this record.
B007REV4YI|5.0|im loving Daniel Craig as young 007 he does a great job in my eyes my collection is almost complete keep em coming!
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|Every time I see this movie in the cable schedule, I watch it over other choices I have to watch. Not only are the actors top notch, (I love Sandra Bullock) but the story is so warm and touching. I love &#34;underdog makes good&#34; movies!!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|great movie, one of my favorite movies i also  ,cant wait for the next installment in the franchise if theres more coming that it!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After many years, and many 1000 page books we finally get the ending to this saga. I don't know how he did it but the action was non stop and I really liked the ending.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Lost 20 lbs on the who,e 30! Recommend to college students especially. It's all about discipline and how you prepare in advance!
B005LHOKFS|3.0|I use it, but the reviews are probably not consistent with or relevant to my personal tastes. Still it's the best out there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app was very fun it is just like the app temple run but it is more fun and in a different. environment. kiloo is a great app making company. this is a really fun app and I am really enjoying the features this app has to offer!!!!!!
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|After reading some of the initial reviews, I felt like this EP was getting an unfair shake. The reviews suggested that the CD is all over the place, not truly committing to a theme, or following a formula. To those reviewers, I ask, does it have to follow a theme? Is this an opus, or just merely a collection of good songs? I choose the latter.<br /><br />Highlights for me are the 80s rooted &#34;Ain't It Fun,&#34; and the call to action of &#34;Grow Up,&#34; both with soaring, infectious hooks that really put the magic that Ms. Williams vocals are known for on display. The interludes are fun and playful, and the rest of the tracks are all hits in their own right. Solid effort!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I loved this game from when I first saw it.event though it is $6.99 it rocks. I regimens this game for all people.
B00B5AP7NY|3.0|Though not a gamer, I found this \\"movie\\" entertaining once I got past the initial feeling as if I were just watching someone play the game at the beginning. As a longtime DC fan, you can't help getting into the storyline and cute characters in the film which some reviewers have said is just bonus content from the game, which is no concern to me. The voice acting and script are sufficient for both kids and adults. I enjoyed Batman and Robin's interactions. Superman was funny too. An even greater part was the discovery of the included three bonus cartoons \\"Triumvirate of Terror\\" and \\"Scorn of the Star Sapphires\\"(from Batman:The Brave & the Bold and starring the Justice League and Green Lantern respectively) and \\"Overdrive\\" (from Teen Titans). So the dvd also serves as a sampler for those series in addition to the main feature, which is always a plus.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Guilty pleasure, hilariously ridiculous at times, but surprisingly poignant. Pulls at your heart strings when you'd never expect it to. Classic British TV.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I've enjoyed reading this series of books very much and would recommend it to friends and family.<br />Thank you David
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies is well written with a fantastic production value. The actors are committed to the story and that helps the watcher become invested as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had fun looking for all the items to open the door to the next level. Can't wait for more rooms to escape. Thanks! Make more rooms!
055380684X|5.0|Easy read and so much information.  Definitely on my must-read list!  Love the variety of examples and stories.  Good for so many different applications.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Seems like an honest account without a pre-agenda. Interestingly written. Good analysis at the end of some possible scientific counter explanations to the &#34;heaven&#34; experience.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|This is a wonderfully put together concept album. Like I say in my title if you are a progressive rock fan (Spock's Beard, Yes, Kansas, Genesis, Gentle Giant, etc...), then you will love this album.<br /><br />Sound of Contact is fronted by Simon Collins (who's father is Phil Collins of Genesis), and he sounds just like his father, but allowing his own twist to make his sound unique all the same. To me, this albums sounds like how \\"Genesis\\" would sound today if they were still making music today. It has that much maturity, impressive for a first album from the band.<br /><br />But ok, the album how is it? Well, it is Masterly put together, a concept album telling the story of a man between dimensions. They tell the story through the songs, leaving much to the imagination, and not forcing the listener through a specific storyline. They leave it vague enough to the listener to understand the story, but expand upon it at the same time on their own.<br /><br />Songs to get (besides the whole album): Not Coming Down, Beyond Illumination, Only Breathing Out
B00B10CT7A|4.0|HD is very detailled and the picture is stunning. I will look forward to watching this movie over and over agin
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Good special effects and a decent story.  I like the difference in cinematography at the beginning of the movie versus when &#34;Oz&#34; gets to The Land of Oz and everything becomes brighter and colorful as well as the change in aspect ratio.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have wanted  to read this book ever since I saw the beautiful movie so long ago. Glad I finally  did. IT brought back so many memories and now I want to go garden.
B00AK57N00|3.0|Kind of like pit fall... Not really that bad but nothing great or addicting... Gets boring really fast. Repetitive and pointless after about 5 game plays.
B00BM1AJIO|1.0|I bought this game last year for 4.99. And I just bought it again for 4.99 yesterday because it said there were extra locations and extra mini games. well there was nothing extra about it except for &quot;Full&quot; at the end of the Lost Soul title. Yeah their  &quot;Full&quot;, full of s*it. I wish I would have had heads up about this so that's why I sendind this out. G5 and big fish use to be THE greatest sites to go to, but lately I feel like there draining our pockets dry with more and more crapper games for more money. if anyone else has experienced anything like this send a shout out maybe they'll start to listen.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this for myself and my 2 year old son. It's great! Very relaxing and great variety of sounds.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Love this series. There is a huge shock I did not expect. The books are so different from the series
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Even without Bill Ward on the drums its still the classic Black Sabbath sound. Brad Wilk from Rage Against the machine does a fine job on percussion even though it's a bit different style for him. He has always been a powerful drummer. All in all a great album.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|If you are a Whovian or just a Doctor Who fan, You wil enjoy the Sixth season of Doctor Who,
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|typical English style but each episode turns your head and<br />grabs you into another episode and before you know it another season<br />Love the palace they are filming this in, incredible wealth
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The story was very unique and a little creepy but enjoyable. I wonder if people have actually been in these positions before.
B008MM9630|4.0|The game is cute, it has acheivable goals and the graphics are nice and animelike... it passes time and is entertaining.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Really loved the book until the end.  Well written until about the last 50 pages, then it became predictable and not real believable.  Loved the part of the story that went into the past and talked about the &#34;orphan train&#34; but wasn't as wild about the present story of foster care.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I recently went to one of their concerts so i wanted to continue with the music at home and on the road.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Couldn't make it through the first half of the book.  Seemed to drag on just to fill pages.  I put it down and won't pick it back up.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I was a young adult in 1987 when this film was set.  My personal taste ran more toward New Wave than the MOR anthem and balladry that's paraded here.  Regardless, I loved this flick.  I think the reasoning is that the makers of the film recognized the irony in the songs without treating them like parodies.  This film reminded me of classic rock films like \\"Rock 'N' Roll High School\\" and \\"Get Crazy\\" movies that celebrated rock but also had a chaotic charm to them.  The actors are uniformly terrific from wholesome Julianne Hough to disheveled Alec Baldwin.  The best work is delivered by Tom Cruise as a burned out rock legend.  Cruise probably channeled Jim Morrison and any number of hedonistic rock stars and he seems to be having a lot of fun.  This movie had lukewarm box office probably because it couldn't expand beyond its post Boomer core audience.  Even if you're not familiar with the music you'll be thoroughly entertained by \\"Rock of Ages\\".
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I am a huge sudoku fan and this game has more than enough games to keep me busy with multiple levels of challenges. You can save a game and come back into it later or start a different game and save that one also. Great app a definite keeper for me.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Each episode leaves me anxious to see the next.  I'm so happy to be able to view on my Kindle.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This app is not the classic mahjong titans game where if you run out of matching options the game ends, but nevertheless I enjoy playing it. As other reviews state the app ask you to reshuffle but that occurs if you play for time instead of score. If you play for score you can have the competitiveness as you try to score higher thas other players; this can also occur with play on time however with request to shuffle.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging at the same time.  Once you think you are getting the idea on how to play the game gets more challenging.<br />Clues are right in front of you and you don't even see them.  My daughter is 11 and really enjoys this app.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I am going to delete this I was looking for more games as I have become addicted...help me help me!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Fascinating and, as a parent, tough to read. Still, I couldn't put it down!  Great writing and interesting characters. Worthwhile read.
B00340ESIS|5.0|How refreshing it is to get insight from a seasoned screenwriter. I've learned a lot on the art of story telling and little things involved. It is those little things that makes the difference of getting your script sold or not. The road to Hollywood is already set. We have to follow the rules and join that club. This is what I got from this book. The lessons are amazing and I am super motivated to keep writing.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved the depiction of an autistic person struggling to fit in. He was lucky to find someone who was prepared to make allowances for his personality whilst gently leading him down the path of change. I have recommended it to my book group who are all ex teachers who have all had experience in teaching Dons.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Didn't like this Mahjong Deluxe HD game. The text was so small on my Android Samsung device that I could not read the directions. The game showed four forms on the screen instead of one and they were also too small. I deleted it from my phone.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I Loved this novel. I wanted to read it, because bipolar disorder touches my family. It was an enlightening book. I will be suggesting it to many of my friends and family. Now, I'm excited to watch the movie. (Hope it stays true to the book.) Warning: it has a lot of football talk... I enjoy football, so this was not a big deal for me... others might be annoyed... But, it is a big part of the amazing storyline.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've Been Using This App For A Long Time Now, And I Highly Recommend It! It's A Simple Yet Dependable Alarm clock And timer With Plenty Of Features!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|still reading -but so far a beautiful ,heartfelt & intriguing plotline. feels different than Albom's other novels- but still as great
B004X6PRO6|2.0|i suppose it is a realistic (maybe) view into North Korean life, however I found it tedious to read and could not finish it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo Blitz would easily be one of the best available if it did not freeze and glitch, (like not giving you coins or chips or collection items earned because it shuts down on you, then you only get credits back). Which happens more than on occasion....better yet, if the game gave you some time after last number is called to call your bingos!!!! If I didn't love this game so much, (yes, I am hooked), I would send it to my cloud and let it \\"rot\\" there for eternity. If Buffalo Studios will get on it, this would be the best game ever!!!
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Rod has been one of the best.  I don't know if there is a super hit in this album, but I like to listen to anything Rod Stewart sings.  What a wonderful, great voice.  I would recommend this album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game! Downfall is that it needs more levels :( Hopefully they will get some soon!!!!!!!!!!!! I will definitely buy the next one that comes out :)
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm no audiophile, but I sat for an hour with my previous Bose Triports and these headphones are a world of difference.<br /><br />The Bose, while having a warmer sound with more bass, were clearly muddier, while the 7506's were sharp and crystal clear. You can literally hear EVERYTHING, which is what I love to do with music - go deep into the track to find all the subtle tones and harmonies and extra riffs and things that are put in when the songs are recorded but rarely get noticed.<br /><br />I do field monitoring with DSLR's and a Zoom H4n, which is another reason I bought these wonderful monitoring headphones. Knowing what audio you're getting is pretty dang important. The music is just gravy.<br /><br />Comfy, and I also like the foldable sides and the ability to fold up as well to compact the shape. They are far more durable and well built than my Triports. I got the coiled cable because straight cables inevitably tangle on me. Works well.<br /><br />Not much else to say about these.<br /><br />Do buy if you like an extremely balanced set of cans that really pull every little bit out of each track, and are perfect for monitoring.<br /><br />Do not buy if you like a richer or warmer sound, heavier bass at the expense of some clarity and sharpness (I assume there are headphones that do it all, but can you find some for $88, which is what I bought the 7506's for on sale?). There are probably bigger, heavier, and more immersive cans for studio or home use, but for travel and field work, not much can beat these suckers.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|An absolutely delightful new take on the old fairy tale that every childs been read!!! There are parts that are a little too gory for children under age 10 or so and so I can't recommend for very young children, but for the older child, and the inner child in every adult, this movie is definitely a must see!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|great way to keep your mind entertained.  keep trying to get a lower score and work on recognition skills. awesome. highly addicting.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|If you're a Doctor Who fan, how can you not like it.  It's everything thing you'd expect of the Doctor. That's all I have to say.
B00008KDHQ|1.0|I purchased a DVD here and it was for a different system and did not play on my DVD in the USA. No disclaimer, they shipped it to me and then, they did not exchange it for me, they gave me a reimbursement but I still had to pay for shipping twice!
0425263924|4.0|I liked it very much since its the continuation of the story, I was put on hold here. I need the rest of the story in order to know what will happen with this complicated love story, it is very frustrating. Waiting for the other part to be published and I hope it's soon. The reason I didn't give a 5 star because it's suppose to be a trilogy.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is amazing. It puts a real life twist on the old Atari missile defender game. Plus you get 50 repair points for just writing a review.  Defend your cities for as many rounds as you can!
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|Some may find this show entertaining, but it was nothing special as far as we were concerned. Acting was just so-so storyline just so-so
B00144VBBS|5.0|Great collection of Toby Keith, best of the best!  Very enjoyable to have them all on the same album for easy listening.
B003MXEUYO|3.0|the promise was fine and the action was okay however the close captioning titles were way too small in terms of font size which means reading them difficult.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|I thought that the pack of five books would either be divided into the 5 books or have better chapters and navigation tools. It's actually quite irritating to navigate through as I had already read the first book in hardcopy and it took a lot of scrolling to get to the second book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love bingo blitz! I have been playing for a few months now and still find that I get excited when they introduce a new room. I find it challenging to finish each room.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was fiction, but as I read it, I know many of these events truly occurred for many people in this time setting.  Loved this book.
0767903862|5.0|Love the way Bill Bryson uses humor in his writing. Nakes for entertaining reading of what could be otherwise tedious reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story is addictive! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Wool is such a creepy concept because it's so possible. These stories are about the delicate balance it takes to keep a people confined underground sane under insane grounds. I feel so lucky that I stumbled upon Hugh Howey's work and can't wait to read more!
0451232852|5.0|Can not wait for the third in the series, Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors of historical novels.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|I'm my wife's personal amazon employee when she wants a dvd or cd.  I haven't watched the move but my wife really liked it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|by that it could show up at the top, so you don't have to press the app to see how much time you have before it shuts off.
B008220D5K|4.0|I liked this movie.  I would recommend this movie for parents or anyone that doesn't get to offended by making jokes about serious &#34;not so funny when it happens to you&#34; life issues.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|you love one, what's not to love about the other angry birds. just relax and have fun with them all.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is a very good book covering an extended period in families and extended families. Hard to put down! Unpredictable from beginning till end!

B004K8WPUQ|4.0|Way better than on-camera mic. Has a little fuzziness, but barely. I'm an amateur and am using it for small projects.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|even it have a little commercials.....still a great app. love this and you will love all the rest of them.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this novel very much more for its analysis of family dynamics than for its courtroom drama.  It brings up the question, \\"who are our children, what do we really know about them?\\"  Other questions come to mind and would make very interesting book club discussions.  What is normal teen age behavior and what is abnormal?  I think the author wrote about the stress on a family of going through indictment of their child, the costs both social and financial of defending him, in a very well presented fashion.  These things do happen to ordinary people and that is what makes the book so fascinating.  I recommend the book to any thinking person but especially to parents and followers of the latest legal defenses.  It is a thinking person's murder mystery.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|allows me to get to my mail, see my facebook notifications and see what is going on in my craft group.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|I bought 2 of these~one for my 2 year old nephew and another for a friend's 1 year old.  My 2 year old nephew LOVES his &#34;guy&#34; and rocket ship!  He can manipulate the pieces on his own and to get the &#34;guy&#34; in and out of the ship, and quickly learned to countdown to blastoff from his older bro.  He had a birthday party the day after I gave this to him, and after the party, this was tied for his favorite with 1 other toy (something he had asked for).  Another great Playmobil toy.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|what can you say...keeps me in touch with them everywhere. great when you want to know what it going on.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I had high hopes for this book, and I was not disappointed. The interlacing stories are intricate and rich but easy to follow. I think I like this one even better than The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|first time I played it, I was hooked. and I download it on all my devices. Want to get hook.....play this.
B00296A4F4|5.0|I love this show! It has great renditions of music while following Cinderella story plot. It is a new age drama.
B004D1AIZ4|5.0|If you're a fan of Toshiro Mifune then this is a Must have Movie! I would go as far as to claim it as the Greatest Story ever Told, so move over Bible! :)
B007EECSFA|1.0|Good reading. Haven't yet finished it but so far I love reading it. Fast reading as well. I would recommend it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|So like any other team lava app, you need to spend money on digital items. But the animation is decent. Its girl AND boy friendly. And  who doesn't love dragons?! You also need Internet to play, but so what? Team Lava actually took their time on this app. I just got it so I dunno if u have 2 abandon baby dragons. But I LOVE IT!!!!!
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|This album grows on you. I wish there were more Blues. Beth's voice is as dynamic as ever. Looking foward to her next project.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The pictures were very nice, and the choices within the categories were ample. The puzzles were not very challenging, but still it was fun.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Another awesome release by Chickenfoot Joe!  I bought the CD through Amazon and was able to download immediately Via Amazon mp3.<br /> Thanks for another great set of tunes  Joe!
B008J05EL8|5.0|I like the variety provided. The fonts are fun, and the package is a good one. This is a good complement to Office.

B0089EHWQE|4.0|Will and Clark will stay with me for a very long time.  I liked them both.  Their relationship was honest and thought provoking.....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. This is the only free app I have downloaded that I actually spent money on the extra levels. I hope they come out with more soon.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Another wonderful CD. I have the other Piano Guys CD so when this one came out I couldn't wait to get. Loved the new original songs on this CD. Already looking forward to the next one they make.
0345505387|2.0|It was an interesting change for Gabaldon but I am not a fan of comic books nor of anime', of which the illustrations very much  reminded me.  Sorry, Diana.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|is very fun and challenging.  you find yourself excited that you made it thru another door. not recommended for a slow thinker.
1476734941|4.0|My and my wife both used this book and the concept is good. It helps you with the tools but you have to do it for yourself.
B004EAQNO4|5.0|A well crafted story.  Spooky without all the excess gore.  Several startle moments.  The movie even has a moral center.
B00BCV3HGU|3.0|I'm not going to call it garbage.... But I DID expect more from this CD. I heard the song 'I got that power' on a radio station here in Atlanta before I even knew he was making an album. That song not only captured my attention, it had me dancing in my car! I was truly blown away by that song. I wrote the name down and later found out a CD was in the making. I figured, if Will used beats and sounds like that throughout his album (and unfortunately he DIDN'T), then the album would be phenomenal! Honestly, I was a little disappointed... But life goes on. There are about three tracks on the CD that I can listen to over and over again. Not bad for the $7 I spent. I've spent more for less. I hope this review helps you out.
B0030MM68O|4.0|The Hurt Locker is likely the film that defines Kathryn Bigelow's style. The opening shot with it's low angle close-up sets the tone for the rest of the movie, she's going to show you a range of emotions mixed with the stark backdrop of war torn Iraq. I can't give this film all five stars because several times in the movie the director allows the on-screen action to overpower the dialog. Overall it's a good drama with a legitimate plot. Bigelow is a talented director and the actors do fairly good job of conveying the rush of emotions of combat in a foreign land. Everybody wants to go home except the lead character Will, played by Jeremy Renner. Renner's character seems to be addicted to the excitement. Although Will is skillful he is seen as reckless by Sgt. Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie. A great deal of the movie addresses the tension between these two characters. Hurt Locker is worth seeing but it didn't live up to it's reputation.
B000002GXX|5.0|I love all the Eagles' albums ever made.  I didn't have this one for some reason, so I got it and I was very pleased the find the music used for &#34;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.&#34;  I love it!
B008JEJO9M|4.0|I saw this color and it was for men, I dont know about anyone out there but this color is awesome and why it was not made for a women I have no idea, so I ordered them for my, they are a little roomy but they work when you like to walk around the yard and pool.  Nice color and sturdy shoe
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I seriously loved this book. I'm 12 and I have a kindle and this book got to me. As a huge fan of Jane Austen, Dickens, and the Bronte Sisters i had to have this. This was truly amazing and I really loved it. Hugo at his best he is a magnificent writer and will always be praised for this work. In short, I loved this book, so get it, plus its free.
B00BN0BZVY|4.0|The emphasis of this book is Pat's personal experiences.  Very, very, different than movie.  It is still a good read. It was interesting to learn more about being bipolar.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I Just love the movie , I saw the movie several times,and I wanted my friend to see it. Good movie
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is exsilant this it still has a few flaws. one of them ishaving to buy supllys for so many gems. I wold still reckimendit to others.
B008602KQI|5.0|Had some free time and decided to use my Prime account to watch the movie...Great choice of a movie, Great Quality from Amazon.....and the price was right with my Prime account.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|i think that people should get this app i got it for my granddaughter who is turning 3 she loves this app but i was disappointed that u had to buy extras to make him do only 4 things are free to make him do things
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Great story but do wished they would have had more graphics but over all a good story concept. Im sure there will be a sequel.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took me quite a while to figure out that this book was going to eventually show both sides of the affected marriage.  Interesting concept in that it shows how differently men look at the same things that are viewed by their female partner.  Didn't much care for the ending of the story as I thought it impossible after what the parties to the marriage had been through.
096798467X|5.0|Awesome variety of designs, beautiful photos and instructions make this book one of my favorite go to earth oven books.
B008JFUOWM|5.0|This movie is badass. The fast and furious just get better and better. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
0307341577|4.0|I just finished reading gone girl and was excited to read another book by Flynn. While Dark Places was fairly good, it was disappointing.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I'm not usually a huge fan of fantasy literature, but this was the perfect mix.  I'd love to see them try to make this into a movie, though they couldn't possible capture what your imagination can create.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this game!! It is realistic.  The horses move like aeal horses would.  You get to care for your hose by brushing and feeding it.  It's fun to pick your riding gear and ride in competitions.  Very fun. Can't stop playing it!!!!
B000E1155O|5.0|Update- June 7, 2015  You probably know the story- this music was actually released in the early 70's back when folk rock was significantly more devastating and sincere than it is now, much like all genres.  Now it's all a great big commercial mess of unsatisfaction.  Back then though, back in the 70's... now *that's* what I'm talking about!  Sibylle Baier released a bunch of songs not meant to be released to the general public but... it HAS been released, over 35 years later.  Hey who did that!  Was it you?  No, it was her son of all people.  Her own flesh and blood is the one who'd wise up and prevail.  It was certainly a wonderful idea since now we *all* get to hear what a wonderful piece of music Colour Green is, and trust me, it's more amazing than most folk/rock out there.  First of all, believe it or not, I detect a fairly original style here.  I guess you can say Sibylle's style is somewhere in between Joni Mitchell's more thought provoking lyrical content and Nick Drake's dark-themed sincerity.  While Colour Green probably isn't quite as good as either artist, it darn sure comes remarkably close.  &#34;I Lost Something In the Hills&#34; is the best song here, and the longest at 3:30 minutes (which is amazingly short- hey this is no Fairport Convention after all).  The guitar is tuned down pretty far making the song sadder than a defenseless chicken upon seeing a fox has entered the barn.  Okay, wrong type of comparison on my part perhaps but it *is* really sad.  I think these lyrics can be taken to a deeper meaning- we *all* lose something eventually, and when you take a few minutes to lay down in a field and daydream on top of a cliff, you'll look out into the sky and realize this.  A sad fact of life I'm afraid.  Way WAY ahead of its time too.  Nobody sung like this in the early 70's except maybe Nick Drake.  Elsewhere you have the SUPER melodic &#34;Forgett&#34; (not sure what's up with the extra &#34;t&#34;).  This is my second favorite sing-along song.You know the way Sibylle sings softly combined with her deep voice makes this so unbelievably different from the stuff I normally associate with 70's folk rock.  And I LOVE the way the tempo alternatives haunting sadness with upbeat.  By &#34;upbeat&#34; I mean the melody feels like it's trying to find happiness in a dark place.  I'd probably like &#34;Softly&#34; more if it didn't keep repeating the darn chorus so many times.  Come on Sibylle!  Then again the song has a way of creeping me into it.  &#34;The End&#34; is more haunting material illustrating... well, I picture the end of my life when I hear these vocals but the lyrics are probably pertaining to another subject.  Not really sure.  &#34;Tonight&#34; has a folk style so natural the way the vocals speed up.  Very original singer/songwriter and guitar player.  The lyrics illustrate the feeling of a changing mood, but Sibylle has this way of making it sound so personal and deep.  &#34;Says Elliott&#34; features lots of depressing soul.  The kind of soul only a deep thinker would be able to create when secluded and can bring out these true feelings.  The horizons look bleak when thoughts of growing old enter the mind.  &#34;Give Me a Smile&#34; is a slower moving song with orchestration... the vocal melody relying on simplicity to present its beauty this time.  &#34;Remember the Day&#34; is sort of like &#34;Forgett&#34; with the tempo changes- leaving to get some food never hit my emotions so hard!  Dreary enough to make the oceans ahead look gray.  The title song has rushed Joni Mitchell-like vocals in the verse melody. Sort of messy but imagery is still there.  &#34;Wim&#34; has many tempo changes occurring while questioning love.  The way Sibylle literally asks questions about love is unusual but naturally pleasant.  &#34;William has similar emotional shifts as &#34;Wim&#34;.  Hey Sibylle, I WOULD like to talk to you!  I'd like to discuss why it was wrong for you to not pursue your career when it was obvious you had talent based on the many musicians out there who named you as a major influence along with the giant online fan base... okay okay, maybe we don't have to go there, lol.  &#34;Girl&#34; has lots of pure feeling.  The message behind the lyrics isn't clear but I'm sure someone knows what this song is about.  &#34;Driving&#34; has a steady-paced relatively peaceful vocal melody.  I can imagine myself taking an evening drive through fields and dirt roads and arriving to that secluded happy spot that belongs to me and nobody else.  Only the butterflies and myself hang out here.  Doesn't this song give you the same image?  &#34;Forget About&#34; is the softest song on the album.  The vocals are so soft you can almost squeeze them!  The lyrics seem to point towards forgetting about the bad things that happen from time to time and focus on the precious moments.  Hey why not.  Lyrically Colour Green is a genius effort and I highly recommend it.  Musically it's quite fantastic as well, regardless which musician it might remind you of.  You can remember how these songs go and will surely fall in love with them.  Love the way Sibylle has a firm grasp on the guitar.  Her talents stretch far and deep.  You need this album!
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game was a complete takeoff of dragonvale, and was not as good as it. if you're going to get a dragon game, dargonvale is the way go go.
B000QE9ERK|1.0|I admit I'm not knowledgable in religion or devil-worshipping or anything of that nature so I didn't really understand any of the plot that took place throughout the movie.  It all went completely over my head.  Every single bit of it.  I went in assuming the Ninth Gate would be like the Exorcist- you know, taking horror elements and combining them with suspense- but more modernized, and of course, taken from a different angle so any comparisons to the Exorcist be kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Instead it's a slow-moving storyline that revolves around Johnny Depp's character exploring dark dingy areas and libraries, reading book after book... and *more* books.  The only suspense a viewer can possibly comprehend are those experienced in religion and know a thing or two concerning the religious-themed lines being spoken.  These unsuspenseful book reading segments last for over an hour and 20 minutes.  It's mental torture for those who've been confused since the beginning of the film.  By the ending I was completely lost and unassure what really occurred.  I see fire in the background so I assume they're in hell.<br /><br />The suspense never really delivers because the actual plot that builds to these segments never made any sense to me.  This movie was destined to be a letdown for me due to an inability to understand what's even going on (and understand religion for that matter- *all* religions) and I wish I'd known this little fact before going into it.  I think the old man lying dead in the fountain was the lucky one since he realized that only a devil would come up with such a confusing and boring movie, so he knew suicide (or being killed) was the only way to escape.  The other moment of suspense was really oddly executed too- an old lady in a wheelchair going into another room that soon results in an apartment fire.  Strange.  Oh and the old man hanging himself in the beginning?  A devious attempt at luring in viewers, making them assume the rest of the film willbe loaded with similar segments.<br /><br />Another problem is that basically everything Johnny Depp stars in doesn't appeal to me in the least.  The Pirates of the Carribean series is the biggest offender.  Sword swinging and... more swinging.  Puts me to sleep.  Everything he stars in feels overblown to the point of being unwatchable, in both the presentation and storyline.<br /><br />I'm not used to movies like the Ninth Gate at all, and if someone would kindly make a list of other similar types of films, I'll be sure to write them down and memorize them so I can avoid them like the plague.  Rosemary's Baby is one.  I assume Jacob's Ladder and the Silence of the Lambs are others.  Anymore?  Oh wait, it's mandatory to avoid the Davinci Code too.  Note to Hollywood- make movies easier to understand.  Not all of us are deeply religious.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was a pretty good movie worth the rent.<br />Had some pretty funny scenes in the movie but I'm glad I waited for it to be released for rent did not waste the money on the movie ticket
B00499QUK2|5.0|I watch a lot of TV but truly struggle to find shows that engaging. Sherlock does just that. I hav always been a fan of BBC shows mainly because of Luther and Doctor Who.y friends had said good things about the show;but, I was skeptical becuse I have grown tired of Sherlock with a \\"twist\\" and other crime dramas. Sure enough two years ago, I finally had a summer break with nothing to watch and this was on Netflix. It was bliss from their on. Engaging, witty and cinematic I find very few shows that are as captivating. I just wish they would stop shooting films so I can see season 3 already!
B0035WTE2U|5.0|Very good collection of AC/DC Songs, check out the track listing for yourself. I am very pleased with the CD. I don't have a lot of use for the DVD though.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Good game, I play frequently. Nice graphic  and surprisingly entertaining.  Holds my attention for at least 10 to fifteen minutes at a time and probably play twice a day.
B009NX409M|2.0|Also, we don't like movies about unfaithfulness to spouses.  I know that's the norm now but not the thing that brings happiness.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is the second book of the series and flows so easily from the first book.  I would recommend this whole series to anyone.  You can't just stop at the first book, you have to have more.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|WE love this movie and we are the grandparents.  Are so glad there is a new one coming out next month.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|great book! I had memorized it as a child and now reading it to my granddaughter.<br />Great pictures very fun story.
1400069289|2.0|Just finished this very well thought out, well written book and nearly got swept away by the very logical and compelling presentation until I realized that it has one terrible fault: it does not present the research or argument on how new habits develop when one practices a form of intentional meditation.<br /><br />We live in this overwhelmingly \\"cognitive\\" world and all too often, as in the case of Power of Habit, the power of a discipline of meditation to change a person more deeply is often overlooked. Many studies have shown a daily practice of meditation often leads to healthier eating habits, more patience, a kinder and more compassionate person, among a multitude of other benefits. Duhigg almost had it in his discussions of the power of the 12 steps. But he failed to discuss that most people who practice the 12 steps may only transfer their addiction, rather than heal it, unless they dedicate significant time to the 11th step of \\"prayer and meditation\\".
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Every book gets better and better. I lived that he wrote two books that are concurrent and separated by geography. It makes for greater anticipation of the sixth book.
0061124958|4.0|The size of this book is perfect for a child's hand, and the font is easy on the eye. The illustrations are vivid and well done as pencil drawings and capture the essence of the story as it moves along. Since the hands of children are small, the weight and texture of the stock makes for easing turning of the pages.
B00821OX98|5.0|I found the program by accident &#34;on demand&#34;.  The characters are well thought out and the story line is fantastic.  I enjoy syfi.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|When trying to collect music the Immersion Box Sets are the way to go.  Get it all in one set.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Enjoy looking on all the items. Can save some money and going to stores and fighting the traffic . Still new using<br />this app.
B008RTE066|5.0|Oh how much this music brings back the good ol days and when music was fun and not dirty. Awesome
B00AFEXRME|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE!  CHECK IT OUT!<br />THIS MOVIE ARRIVED EARLY AND IN GREAT CONDITION.<br />I SAW THE FILM AT THEATER AND HAD TO OWN IT.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is another good book for Gillian Flynn. It keeps you interested with twists and turns that make you not want to put the book down.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This film arrived before time and in decent playing condition.<br /><br />thanks again. great movie brings back memories of when I owned it previously
B0027MJU00|5.0|This novel was very intriguing and I couldn't put it down. It was suspensful and not predictable. I would recommend!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Once again, Khalid Hosseini has given us an accurate picture of life in Afghanistan. With the simple joys and heart wrenching difficulties the natives experienced in their daily lives. I enjoyed this book but thought it did not come up to my favorite The Kite<br />Runner..
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This CD has  a lot of great songs, and I would say that it is the best album of Demi's. Would definitely recommend to others.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|it is so epic its so awesome I feel like strangling something like a stress ball or maybe something similar
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This novel kept you on your toes and made you want to keep reading. It was suspenseful and interesting. I would definitely recommend this book!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like the game but there aren't any monsters in it that is what makes me mad is the monsters
B00866JL96|4.0|This movie is very cute. It is somewhat preidictable and similiar to the other Nicholas Sparks adaptations, but isn't that what we love about them?
B0037VIBGY|5.0|After reading Bronsons book the movie has given me a idea on how his mind set really was. A very well done film.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Show intrigued me so much that I paid to watch a couple of episodes on here. You will get hooked!
B008JFUMDS|4.0|The fantastic cast is reason enough to see this movie. Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine and Woody Harrelson: you can´t go wrong with that. Fortunately, the plot is also fun and exciting, and the movie takes you on a wild and entertaining ride.<br /><br />As a New Yorker, I also appreciated that the movie is actually shot in the city, with none of that ridiculous fake NYC you so often see in films (5 Pointz, my favorite spot in Queens, shines). I wasn´t crazy about the end, which is the only reason I give this movie four instead of five stars, but it´s definitely worth seeing.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|it was disappointing.  The McClain sarcasm was no longer sharp and witty, the bad 'guy' wasn't all that convincing, and the showdown at Chernobyl was just too far-fetched for my liking.  The father - son drama didn't really add much to the story, either.  Honestly, a CIA operative who, at his age, has that much angst for his father who was never home when he was a kid?  Seemed better reserved for a son ten years younger.  I love the Die Hard franchise as much as anyone, but I'm hoping, at least for John McClain's sake, this isn't the final tale.  This left too much to be desired.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun aggravating mind boggling. Hours of mind numbing fun. Would definitely recommend this game for all of your friends and family.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I understand that, by their nature, short stories don't allow for the kind of intricate plot  and character development that you find on a novel. All the same, this one left me wanting more.
B00151HZME|2.0|the album not so great.  ah well. Thanks for the easy ordering! Shipment was prompt as well. I will consider searching for other albums through you again!
B007US9NA8|5.0|This book has everything you could posssibly think of about bodybuilding and then some. It covers the history of bodybuilding, the work outs, nutrition, and even hairstyles.  The pictures and illustrations are great and very motivating.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Bought for son, who is a country music fan. He was not disappointed! Would recommend to anyone who is a fan.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think that all kids that like guns will fall IN LOVE with this game becuase it is so cool
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I had to read this book for one of my classes and once I started it I couldn't put it down! A great read with a touching story!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Nice story with good lesson on how to live.  The end proved that good prevails, and that there is good in everyone.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Excellent film noir, quite enjoyed. All who I've shared with enjoyed. A chill kind of film. Wish I could find the soundtrack.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I downloaded this quite a while ago and now kindle is saying i have to download it again does anyone know what is wrong.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this game because I love popping bloons  and you should get the best game<br />In the ever it is whorth the money
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My grandson thought these were the best!!!! The were above my expectations.  Easy to use and fun for the kids.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Addicting. Kind of like Space Invaders&reg; but upgraded so that u. An have fun and not be bored with it. I like it and recommend it to anyone who likes arcade games
B00AK57N00|3.0|Cell phone games are taking a long time to mature, it seems.  These types of games were being programed in the 80's on apple II's and, while still amusing, are short lived in today's plethora of entertainment choices.  Mr. Aahh is a throwback to the classic trial and error parabolic trajectory games we used to program in computer class in 1984, but with a constant urgency of survival as your running cannon ball is mr aahh himself.  It's amusing, yes, but only for a few play throughs.  It's novelty lasted about a half hour wait at the doctor's office for both my daughter and me.  Now it's gone to make room for something else.
0765363836|5.0|I read this book for two reasons:  I thoroughly enjoyed Sawyer's book Calculating God (which I also reviewed), and I was a big fan of the ill-fated ABC show, and I'd love to know where they intended to go with it.  Other reviewers are right--the book gives the concept but does not parallel the series; but unlike them, I don't see that as a bad thing.  Mosaic was about collecting thousands of stories; so in that regard, Sawyer could've written a series of Flashforward books.  I like what he has done with such an original SF idea, and as in Calculating God, this is SF heavy with science.  Weighty ideas are raised, such as whether we have free-will, whether all time (past/present/future) is fixed; whether the future is unalterable.  Can what has been seen be changed?  And what about those people who are unhappy with what they see, and those who had no vision?  All this, along with the proposal for a planned flashforward are fascinating.  The best SF makes one think, and this book is perfect for small groups to mull over.  FF is well-written, with small doses of humor, and much to ponder.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Works as intended, battery is great. Only annoyance is that sometimes it will not turn on if it's plugged in to the charging cord, so I have to unplug it, turn it on, and plug it back in. Small annoyance, but generally awesome. Sound quality is superb, sound controls are fantastic.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I rarely read a book where I am forced to stay up through the night to read it.  I rarely read a book that is funny, sad, hopeful, and causes every emotion in between. Rarely have I read a book that causes me to think about it well after finishing it. Me Before You is one of those books that is a gem. It was a wonderful read and very moving. It felt truthful through the end, and although I had wanted it to end in another way, it ended it the only way that was possible. I highly recommend reading this.<br /><br />(I won this book through a publisher giveaway, with no expectation or requirement that I provide a review.)
B004XWLN20|2.0|DON'T BUY THIS BOX SET. BUY EACH SEASON INDIVIDUALLY, you'll save yourself a lot of frustration. The packaging doesn't have snap in dvd spots. Each page has a little folder for the disc instead. The disc folders are made of stiff, laminated paper, and they are extremely tight. To take a disc out you have to pinch it with your fingers and pull hard, which quite obviously scratched them badly. After being removed once, 30 of the 62 discs had visible damage. Keep in mind the fact that I tore the packaging to loosen them before trying to remove any of them.<br />The extra star is for the absolutely beautiful box it came in. While not practical at all, it's nice to look at not going to lie
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|I think it could have been WAY better. I think that even if it's a classic, it can still be imperfect. The Wizard of Oz is a perfect example, as a lot of things tend to contradict other things. At the end, Dorothy GRIMLY says,\\"From the land of Oz.\\" I thought she liked it there!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Someone needs to count the different words for zombie that have been used in this show. Also, who is mowing the grass? I like this show.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|This was a very bad movie. i felt that the producers were hoping to cash in on the other Bourne movies, which were excellent, and didn't put any effort into this one. I'm not sure how this did at the theaters but I hope this is the last one. And I didn't hate it because it didn't have Matt Damon, I think it would have been just as bad with him. The only good thing I can say about it is I rented it on Amazon Prime for $3.99 so I only wasted that amount and not the approximately 8 or 9 dollars I would have wasted at a theater.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|As a Christian I believe in the hereafter.  As a person that is also wondering if there are 'spirits' around I found Dr. Alexander's book interesting.  As a neurosurgeon that once gave pat answers to afterlife, the out of body experiences, the 'bright white light' being all nonsense then going through all of that himself and admitting that there is an Afterlife and even that there are spirits around, I applaud him.  I just wish he hadn't been so over the top on trying to convince people--I just couldn't hack all the &#34;explaining himself&#34; and finally stopped reading the book--it was too laborious.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game!  Gets more challenging as you go. Please add more levels consistently. Would give 5 stars if I didn't have to wait.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Wonderful series beautifully photographed. Attenborough's narration is fantastic as well.  Buy this for your BluRay collection.  You will not be sorry.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for the young horse lovers. Awesome game great pass time<br />Great game reminds me of the nano pets
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so fun if you love animals or not. Definitely a great pass time as well as addicting!!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I already had this movie on dvd, but I am trying to replace the dvd with blu ray and this is one of my favorite movie's so this was on the top of my list of dvds to upgrade.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|The work out is fun and easy I have my family join in every time we start<br />Even my younger boys get into it
B003UGLCIA|5.0|This film still scares the hell out of me. A truly horror classic. Hope my wife will someday have the guts to watch it with me.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|This may be my favorite book in the Sigma series.  I've always had an interest in both Marco Polo and in the black plague.  Rollins does an excellent job at peaking your interest in human biology in this story along with showing you some things that you never would have guessed. Great plot and storyline as usual.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I honestly thought that Lee Child had sold out Jack Reacher by allowing Cruise to play the title role, but I have to admit after watching this brisk paced flick: Tom Cruise get's the job done!  Reacher style.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Great entertaining. Beautiful and interesting for all in the family. We watched and couldn't take our eyes off. All actors did a great job.
B00DAXXO98|3.0|The main character is so manipulative and self-absorbed you loathe him (good acting and dialogue).  So this rating reflects the cruelty and despicable atmosphere.  If this is what our government's politicians are like we need to start over.
B004J4X32U|5.0|Armed with the information in this book, we as parents, grandparents, and educators can truely prepare children to thrive through life's experiences, turn &#34;negative&#34; into positive, and gift our society with emotionally mature individuals.  So much useful information that you can implement immediately!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I like the way he interacts with his daughter and his mom, show a sweet sign of a schoundral.also with Beckett, cute
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I was momentarily tempted to give this book a 4 instead the usual 5 star rating for Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels. Then it occurred to me that Child's writing is just so good that I was subconsciously holding Child to a standard much high than for other authors.<br />Child takes us on a journey loaded with twists, turns and surprises. Similar to an Agatha Christie whodunit, the keen reader can enjoy separating the \\"red herrings\\" from the viable clues and solve the puzzle along with Reacher.  You'll enjoy this one -- I promise!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|A nice mix of characters, good chemistry betqween Beeker and Castle. I haver like Nathan since he was on One Life to Live, he was a hunk and has only improved.
1600247245|1.0|Do yourself a favour, don't bother about the audiobook of Black Box; just get the ebook or physical copy.<br />I am a long-time fan of Michael Connelly creations and have read or listened to all his novels. I was looking forward to listening to Black Box in audio book format....what a mistake. I have never listened to anything so flat. I had to stop before 5 minutes into it. Now I will wait for the ebook to enjoy Black Box.<br />Michael Connelly, if you are reading this, please do not allow Michael McConnohie to butcher your creations like this.<br />If you want to know what I am talking about...listen to audiobook versions of The Poet or The Narrows and compare it with Black Box.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am late to the party here. Started watching the HBO series, and when this season ended (the third) I picked up the collection. Was a little nervous about reading them ALL at one time, but, no worries. Wonderful writing and a depth to the characters I did not anticipate. Love them!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book's depth has revealed the commitment and sacrifice that some people do for family. And not just blood related family but the human family. I admire those people that care that much.  This book explores this human trait with great clarity the gift of kindness humans are capable of. Thanks to Khaled for his wonderful talent of story telling. I will wait patiently for your next great story.
B003K15INU|2.0|Overly verbose! Repetitive use of ridiculous themes to make his points.<br />And make them and make them again! It's like reading Moby Dick and saying<br />why don't I skip 20 chapters...
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Grandkids enjoyed the movie. Action was OK and the plot was not bad. As long as the kids enjoyed it Grandma is happy. Did not take the younger ones. To violent for little eyes!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Excellent.  I enjoyed the series on television, and expect to enjoy it even more without frequent and irritating commercial interruptions.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|Enjoyable to watch with the entire family.  Only the youngest may find some of the boogie man horses troubling.  Yeah, it is okay ... watch it and most will come away with a good feeling in their belly.  Finer details, its all about how you grew up with the tales on the Guardians, but I did like seeing Jack Frost get a lead role with lots of screen time...been awhile.  Family of 6, scores ranged from 5 to 7 on a scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (stunning awesome).
B009AMANBA|5.0|This film excels in every way: acting, direction, dialogue, authenticity.  It can be watched repeatedly, with new details and insights surfacing each time.
0194799042|5.0|The cd is very useful, and the book is a good help for my english studying. Nearly everything is perfect. Thank you, Oxford!
B003JIPJRE|5.0|UNDER THE RED HOOD is indicative of DC's brave choices in making these features. It is relentlessly violent. The Joker here is no less disturbing than Heath Ledger's performance. Admittedly the creators, writers and voice actor John DiMaggio(Bender of Futurama) were clearly influenced by Ledger's Joker both in look and attitude, but capturing it that well is like trapping lightening in a bottle. Joker's actions are also true to some of his more twisted acts in the comics, particularly his wanton murder of the second Robin, which jarringly opens the film. Also, heavily, but convincingly adapted, is the introduction of the Red Hood as one of Batman's most devastating adversaries. Credit is due Andrea Romano, who serves as voice director for almost all of these films. Perennial character actor Bruce Greenwood is perfectly cast as a seemingly older, emotional conflicted and often fatherly Batman. Jensen Ackles as Red Hood and Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing are solid if sometimes a bit overwrought. The dichotomy and parallels between Nightwing and Red Hood are expertly presented with subtlety both in dialog and actions. This is at once a dark and little known corner of Bat-fiction and yet is is presented devoid of oversimplification or over-explanation. None of which should be surprising from an animation division that knows and respects its subject matter and its fans. Nevertheless, these animated features cannot be dismissed as children's entertainment or cash grabs. They are so much more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it's true it gets hard I'm on the 5th floor and its a lot of fun maybe you are smarter than me!!!!!
B008Y73940|5.0|Excellent movie. Great way to pass a couple of hours. Interesting plot and Matthew McConaughey is as usual very entertaining and gives a great performance. 2 thumbs up!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Couldn't be more enjoyable. Love being able to watch it either at home or on the go with Amazon instant video.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This version of &#34;Gatsby&#34; is far superior to the film that just opened.  As I have seen them both the character played by Robert Redford shows that he is certainly an American movie icon.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read so quickly, that it was a little hard to keep track of all the characters. Their names, from another language, were not easy to pronounce. The story was so compelling that I might read it again, and savor it instead of leaping ahead to find out what was going to happen.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Love the disc it's different then the first one<br />Some people might not like the addition of the<br />Horns I do.<br />Beth sounds awesome her voice was never better and joe's guitar is as good as ever and compliments her voice perfectly.<br />All around a joy to listen to.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Created by Bryan Fuller (of &#34;Pushing Daisies&#34; and &#34;Dead Like Me&#34; fame), &#34;Hannibal&#34; takes his particular obsession with dead and gives it a darker edge than most of his other works, but still manages to maintain glimpses into that peculiar sense of humor so often found in his works, as well as his taste for visuals.<br /><br />The show is a strange combination of a crime-of-the-week cop drama, a psychological thriller, and an art film, yet somehow manages to transcend them all. (There's that word again, next thing you know someone will accuse me of being Francis Dolarhyde).<br /><br />Though Will Graham's thoughts are not always tasty, it is hard not to sink your teeth into this series. Lush visuals during all normal<br />(if anything about this spectacular series can be said to be normal) scenes are transcended to art in two instances: the larger-than-life murder scenes and the delicious (and pernicious) entrees prepared by our own master chef, Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br />The acting is amazing. Hugh Dancy as our dogged protagonist Will Graham completely convinces as a man on the verge of a massive breakdown while still trying to solve crimes with his curious imagination and empathy, while Hannibal (Mads Mikkelsen) quietly pulls the strings to make that breakdown happen. Mads Mikkelsen cannot be praised too highly for the subtlety of his expression and emotion--most unlike the slightly heavy-handed Anthony Hopkins of &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34; (That is not to say I do not adore Hopkins' Hannibal, I just think that Mikkelsen's subtlety is far more effective for the still practicing psychiatrist and cannibal. Hopkins' Hannibal would have been caught in the first couple episodes, not a few seasons down the line if Fuller's seven season plan is to be believed). The show has a brilliant cast including Lawrence Fishburne (you probably remember him from &#34;The Matrix&#34; or any of the other billion things he has been in) as Jack Crawford, thehead of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, and Caroline Dhavernas as Alana Bloom, the only psychiatrist actually trying to do Will some good. The guest stars are particularly interesting, such as having Eddie Izzard appear as Dr. Abel Gideon as surgeon-cum-murderer now convinced he is the Chesapeake Ripper (Hannibal's serial killer handle) by the able work of Dr. Frederick Chilton, played in all his slimy and inept glory by Raul Esparza. Another guest star is Gillian Anderson of &#34;X-Files&#34; fame  who plays Hannibal's psychiatrist Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Have loved all this guys books. Very sensitive and thought-provoking. Being on the best-seller list means lots of others like his writing too.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Small, does what I want (shows my battery power), was free.  Tells me how much time remaining on my battery and, when charging, how much more time for a full charge.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have a close friend who has had a major stock.  This made me see her struggles in a new light.
B000RJO578|5.0|Irreverent british humor that leaves me in stitches every time I watch it. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys british comedy.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|What can be scarier than watching a movie about an alcoholic, drug-using pilot?  I'm not going to give away any plot twists, so I can't tell you much except that he gets into a jam with a national spotlight on him.  This movie really depicts the struggles a addict goes through.  Alcohol can be legally purchased on almost any street corner, so imagine how hard it is to fight that addiction.  It WILL make you worry the next time you have to fly.  Denzel Washington plays \\"Whip\\", the pilot, and John Goodman has a standout performance as his supplier!  Kelly Reilly does an amazing job as an addict who manages to get clean and stay clean while having to decide whether to let Whip go to save herself.  I love the surprises in this movie.  It is not predictable as so many movies are.  Good writing, tight direction and wonderful surprises.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Kids loved it, I watch and rewatch it with them all the time. This is another in the long line of excellent BBC nature series.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much I bought one for each of the young ladies I know who were graduating High School this year.  Great insight into navigating todays business environment at the highest level.
0767903862|5.0|Made me want to hop on a Quantas jet and toodle around Australia for as long as my meager savings would last.
B00AH8FTT2|1.0|When I buy a book I expect a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. Two out of three doesn't cut it and when it's so clearly contrived to force me to buy another book to learn the end of the story I feel aggrieved and more than a little ripped off. Plenty of authors have written trilogies and have been clever enough to provide a full cohesive story in each volume. Archer is not one of them.
B009MSNTC2|5.0|At 6 years of age it took him several days to assemble and he was up to the challenge he loves the lego's and his next project is the Whitehouse
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not exactly sure how much of this series is or has in the past any truth to it at all. However I do enjoy what appears to be a genuiness about the English culture.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|There is a lot of good music on this disc. George was a true artist. Thanks George for the great music.
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|I received my first copy of Martian Chronicles when I was in the sixth grade,  (Some 50+ yrs. ago) from my older brother  who was a Bradbury fan.....It had a profound affect on my development. .....I became obsessed with drawing rocket ships, Werner von Brahn amd anything having to do with space travel.  I was just rereading &#34;Zen in the Art of Writing (1996) a wonderful accompaniment to reading and understanding Ray Bradbury.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Bought this for my kindle fire! The most addictive game I have ever played. Has kept me busy for hours!! Some lighthearted fun especially after finishing my studies! A must have for all. Will be using this when I laze around the pool during my summer holiday :-)

B002JXK5VU|5.0|Fun show every week.  How can you not like the 'Fargonator' and 'Give me your clothes!'  Great characters and fun stories.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Love the case never charge head set only case Protects head set and charges at least 3 times befor I have to recharge the case.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Definitely watch the first episode and see if it hooks you like it did me. One of my new favorite shows!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I wanted to love this movie so much but I just couldn't. Way too much CGI, poorly written script.  Loved the monkey and the little china doll though. Also Rachel Weisz was amazing but wtf happened to Mila, That was the classic witch we have all come to love and fear since our childhood. Like I said, I wanted to love every moment of this movie sooo much, but found myself shaking my head asking why?
B000SX8BXC|5.0|I purchased this album on CD several years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. My personal music library was stolen from a storage unit I rented a couple years ago and much of my beloved music disappeared.<br />The other night I wanted to hear this album and was excited to see it available in MP3 format.<br />Thank you Amazon!!

I went to an affair sometime ago in Philadelphia and was shocked that I was the only African American there besides the two on stage. One gentlemen was an artist musician and the other was a character in his books.  I follow Mitch because he has writes with a awesome imagination while (for lack of better words KEEPING IT REAL!!!

B00B5JBZGS|5.0|I had the single and now I have the whole album and definitely think that the return of the &#34;original&#34; singer turned out better than I thought. Clean vocals are very sharp and melodic and fit the style. Howard Jones will be missed but I think I have already forgotten him. Great Album.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is great for my nine year old.  Kept his attention and wasn't<br /> too tricky so that he wanted to quit.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I have only listened to it once and usually when an album doesn't grab my attention right away it make take 2 or 3 more times for it to grow on me. In this case though with the exception of the title track, this is a good record. Has that old school Megadeth thrash tossed in there with a modern twist. Built for War sounds like a copycat song but can't put my finger on it. I really like King Maker and Burn. Good album from a well Traveled Metal Band.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have never read a book with this type of foremat.  It was different, but I did enjoy reading it.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|at 36.89 you have got to be kidding.........is this worth it?..........how about 16.99 for the combo set..........i'm sure its not worth much more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a great game to pass the time! My husband and I loved competing the levels together! We need more!!! Lol...
B000F6IOC0|4.0|well the start of the hybrids  that was amazing and how she came and conquer marcus at the end was really amazing great storetelling
B0038NN3B4|2.0|I thought I'd found a program I could live with but found this diet too restrictive and unrealistic. I quickly tired of the suggested diet and plan.
B009WHD3OW|4.0|it was really great loved how mostly all of the former action heroes come out in these movies and having surprise appearances of chuck Norris and jean claude van damn
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Totally addicting. Challenging but not so difficult that it gets frustrating. I would recommend it to anyone that can afford to spend the time playing it.
B002ZG999U|4.0|this was real good like they all have all of the action movie guys in this flick . jet li and others stone cold steve austin
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the best game that I purchased for the kindle fire and now all of my family members who are younger than me take my kindle and play this game with it. Thank you ZeptoLab!
B0000VAFNQ|3.0|well when I ordered this movie I was thin king it was going too be part 1 and 2 but unfournately not
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is one of those classic books that never gets old and always has as good lesson without being \\"preachy.\\"
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good story, very well written. I would definitely recommend it to people that enjoy Sci Fi and those who just dabble in it. I'm generally not a huge fan of science fiction, but the story line was engrossing, with an intriguing ending. I highly recommend it.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is awesome. It actually puts me in the world war 2 mode.<br />I love it so much it is so addiciting
B00499QUK2|5.0|Very engaging series, lots of twists, great acting! Look forward to series 3 in what could be 2030 according to rumors!!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Just watched this movie , without a doubt this will go down as a classic ! To all those who gave it low stars for marketing stop WHINING , you are suppose to rate the MOVIE not the marketing ! Five stars for the movie , ZERO stars for the WHINERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|Another David Baldacci book well written, and as per usual hard to put down once your into it. Keep it up David
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|It is  Avery good game. I believe it should of been free but that is just my opinion. I loved the concept of the game.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I love this series! It is fascinating, captivating and I can't stop watching it. I am dreading the day I get to the series' end. Although full of conflicts of interest, inaccurate evidential rulings and sometimes incredible factual scenarios, it is so good I can easily ignore them (even though I am a trial lawyer by training). The characters are well-developed and compelling. I am dying for Alicia and Will to get together but Peter is growing on me. As someone who rarely watches TV series, I am thrilled to find one I thoroughly enjoy.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|It is as good as being on the Big Computer and getting weather where I am and where I will be in the next ten days.<br />Every day I find more great apps for my Kindle Fire HD.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Does not disappoint. Sylvia Day has done it again. Now for the continuation of the trilogy. Can't wait for more of the Gideon & Eva show.
0062255657|5.0|By page 10 I knew I didn't want this book to end.  It is a beautifully written tale of a man who comes home to his memories.  I loved every word and every sentence.  Buy it.
B005ZKYXZI|1.0|The movie arrived in a timely fashion, but the movie skips so much in 3 or 4 parts that i had to turn it off then back on and skip ahead quite a bit to avoid the problem.
B0093LINVK|1.0|I was looking at buying this unit, but by the time you factor in everything else you have to buy to finish it, it's the same price or more than the entry level Mac mini.  The Mac mini is then a better computer (i5 vs i3), better USB (3.0 vs 2.0), and more.<br /><br />Just buy a Mac mini.  You'll be much happier, and have more money left in your pocket.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|This is my mother's favorite movie, so we watch it pretty often.  The story is wonderful and well written, and the cast is of course amazing.  If you haven't watched it yet, do it!  It's that good.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|A perfect reminder of taking a moment to appreciate all that we have in life.  Fun, heart warming, serious.  Touches all the right chords.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|I really loved this movie.  And although I love Meg Ryan, I do wish there had been more about the time travel aspect.  It was much more entertaining than she was.  I wish they had at least expanded on that part of it a little more.<br />I kept feeling like the real story was there waiting to blossom, but never got the chance.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Tired of all the &#34;reality junk TV&#34;?  Good stories are few and far between. This series offers many twists and turns. The characters are interesting and naturally flawed.
B0039HV3P2|4.0|As always, I thoroughly enjoyed Harrison Ford.  However, I felt the story could have been better, and her transformation more obvious.  Maybe my opinion is colored by the fact that I love the original version, and I kept comparing the two.  But it is definitely worth the watch and I would watch it again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Haven't quite finished this book, and it is a little harder to keep track of who is who in the beginning, but all becomes clear as you get on through it
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love everything about this show. Gripping and phenomenal acting. Definitely an adult show though....language and some nudity in most episodes.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book wraps it up nicely for Ana & Christian and adds more to the series than just the kinky sex.
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|Great actors and a twisted plot line...keeps you really involved! Rent it if you have the chance, you won't be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game love it! Gets you thinking. Challenges you to think outside the box. Told my friends about it and they like it to.
B001F6ZIXW|3.0|I've heard so much about this series that I was really excited to see it offered to prime members. After watching the first three episodes, still not sure i get it.<br /><br />Biker gang that has a second in command who's not sure if they always do things the 'right way.' Could still be interesting....<br /><br />I'm going to try to make it through the next two episodes and see where it goes....
B00BFTV09K|5.0|Provides a useful inner guide now when I'm watching an advert for a new food product/walking through the supermarket, making me a much more thoughtful consumer.
B003GYEGNO|5.0|I read it in French 20 years ago. I just read it again in English on my Kindle. Great book that still resonates even today. The Masters of the Universe are still among us...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|if the game had more levels it would have been given five stars but besides that its a pretty fun thought provoking game
B00AEBBA9U|5.0|the dialogue story photography are in a class of themselve<br />the additional info makes the film more provacative in this age of high tech
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Good weekend entertainment and well written. I love the personality development and constant humor. Ending was similar to a movie from several years ago.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I both love this show. Great characters. Good story line. Plus you learn a lot about the time during which it was set.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Hey, this is simply a great and fun game. Inventive puzzles and amazing level design. I couldn't be happier with this one
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I very much enjoyed these shows. Gives you a glimpse into World War I and early 1920s. Very well done. Beautiful home and costumes. Good characters.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|In the back of my mind is the crash that prevented me from navigating away from anything but the book I had just finished requiring a complete reload of the Kindle software but given the quirks of the Android OS I can't blame it all on Kindle software. What does chop a star from this review is the fact that there is a 1/4 inch margin on one side and a 3/8 inch margin on the other in my already small screen with 2 inch width. Getting 3 or even 2 large words on one line often makes reading a vertical exercise instead of a horizontal one. Other app makers pride themselves on using the whole screen. It would be nice if Kindle used all the real estate on the screen and eliminate the last vestige of the printed page in this app- the margins.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read it when I was a child. I read it when I was a teenager. I read it when I was in my twenties. I read it when I became a mom. I read it and read it and read it.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Great family movie.  Great prequel for Wizard of Oz.  Both of my teenages and I really enjoyed spending time watching it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The text does not try to paint a nice picture of Jobs, it is as honest as it gets. In some ways brutal, but on the other hand so was Jobs as a person, I believe he would've respected this work of art, as who he was. He was a mastermind, who also had alot of faults and quirks and did not try to hide himself. In this books there are countless numbers of interviews by Steve Jobs closest friends and collegues, enemies and lovers, starting since childhood. If you are interested in the life of this man, this is the definite book to read.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This movie has been around so long and reviewed so many times that there is nothing left to say except - Perfection!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Oh Jillian, I love what I look like, but I hate how I feel during. I have lost 15 pounds using her DVD and now I am off to insanity!
B00004XQ8H|5.0|Before I bought this CD I worried that the mono sound would ruin the pleasure to be had from this music. However, that was not the case, the voice of della Casa is preserved well and the slightly muddy sound of the instruments does not distract. The performances here are all first class. This CD is really worth the money just for the parts from Capriccio (Mondscheinmusik). The recording of Vier Letzte Lieder is better than I expected (although I still prefer Karajan og Janowitz) and the recordings of the arias from Arabella are awesome.<br /><br />So, on the whole, it feels very good to own this CD!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|An awesome app. Just what I needed. Nothing fancy, just a a simple listing.Not a a whole lot to do to work this app.Easy &  simple. PERFECT!
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|This is a good game. This is good for a short distraction. I took two stars for the permissions because they are way beyond what is necessary for an honest app. I didn't take more because I always turn the functionality off on my device so no biggie.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I thought this show would be terrible because I'm only 26 and grew up with special effects 10,000 times better than Star Trek. However, this how is absolutely amazing! You become emotionally invested in the characters in the first episode and I love the dynamics they share! I only wish I discovered this show sooner!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This Was A Fun Adventure. It Was Slow In The Beginning But Was Much Better Once H & G Arrived At The Gingerbread House.<br />Worth The Watch.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I never in my entire life crossed a game where whatever you type in it becomes a play able object. Like I typed in tree then made it on fire. Then I typed in fire extinguisher and I put the fire out. It is so fun and I highly recommend this to anyone to all ages
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this app can't wait for more levels.keeps you searching my daughter put this on my kindle and I couldn't put it down till no more levels
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I really like this game because you get challenged unlike other games where they say it's challenging but it's not the only problem is that in the free version there's ads not a lot though.........but any ways GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|It's A great puzzle game like sudoku. It's one of those games where you can do levels over and over again.
B003BKF6AU|5.0|This is one of my favorites albums in the last time, and the quality of this vinyl is amazing, I really recommend it, Also is a very low price.
B0053KWDES|5.0|Reading many other reviews before purchasing... I purchased the Audio-Technica MTH-A50 head phones and this Fiio E11 amp. Wow my ears have never been so pleasantly pleased!!! Words cannot describe, for anyone wanting clarity, bass, volume, you name it this little amp has it, you must have a descent set of headphones tho. I generally don't leave reviews but was so surprised at how well this amp performs I had too... Buy it!!! You wont be disappointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. Its soooo fun, me and the rest of my family love this game.!! I even got my grandma to play this!!  I recommend this game!!!!  FIVE STARS STRAIGHT UP!!!!!!!
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Terrific stuff! Jeffrey Archer continues to deliver great novels, each of which is so totally different. His characters are great, and I find myself slowing down as I near the end because I don't want to lose the characters he has so thoughtfully created and who have become part of my daily life.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Love this game I use it almost 24-7!!!!! J.K. But it is a delly good app if you love youtube and have your fav videos!!!!
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|Okay. Here's the thing. Hans Zimmer can do so much better than this. Yes rhythmic strings and deep, 'basey' percussion is exciting and, I will admit, fun to listen to, but I know for a fact that Hans Zimmer is capable of a lot more. In recent years, what with his scoring of the Dark Knight trilogy, Zimmer's scores have become this sort of formulaic sound-scape for intense excitement. I understand that it fits the movies quite well, but in terms of musicality, Zimmer could have added a ton more while remaining within the bounds set for him by the director. For those of you who aren't very familiar with Zimmer, he is one of the most skilled film composers out there, composing epic (and extremely musical scores) to 'The Lion King', 'Pirates of the Caribbean', 'Sherlock Holmes' (Number 1. In 'Game of Shadows' he falls back into his repetitively 'intense' style) and Kung Fu Panda (in a collaboration with John Powell). I give it three out of five stars because it is enjoyable to listen to, but I have to be actively engaged in something else. This is good background music. I find it hard to be engaged simply by listening to it by itself. A good score, but Zimmer can do better.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I read 2001: A Apace Odyssey when I was in high school and it had an enormous impact on both my imagination and on the way that I saw my place in the universe.  Only Carl Sagan's Cosmos would affect me more deeply.  This is an odyssey of the mind.  Clarke could put existence in a cosmic perspective as well as Carl Sagan ever could.  I think this should be required reading for youngsters, because this story's multilayered treatment of human evolution sparks the imagination and shows how fragile our existence is.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|There's no reason this movie should have been included in the Bourne saga. It seemed like a cheap ploy to sell more movie tickets.<br /><br />I knew going in it wasn't based on the Jason Bourne character, which is a shame. I've read almost all of the Bourne books, including the Bourne Legacy. The movie was NOTHING like the book at all! Therefore, in my mind they should not have used the title. In the book, it is titled legacy because it features Jason's son from his first marriage. This movie features a random character in one of the super secret government training programs.<br /><br />Reasons I didn't like this movie:<br />Chems-  all of the assets are on pill form drugs that improve their strength and mental faculties. It made it extremely easy and convenient to wipe out the entire program by simply switching their pills to some variant of cyanide.<br />Fighting- Not much to speak of. There are always several more fights in the books than the movies. This was no different, but features almost no fighting at all. From my count: fight with wolf (if you can even count that), fight with agents to save Rachel Weisz (probably one of the best fight sequences in the movie), fight in the factory (lasted about 10 seconds), and fight in the alleyway (again, 5 seconds). Quite the disappointment.<br />Weaving into Bourne storyline- there were a few nods to events from the third film. They seemed very half hearted and could easily be missed, especially with amount of time that passed (in real life) between 3 and legacy. Mostly, they came off as an afterthought like \\"if we have Bourne in the title, we should include this event in the storyline\\". Pathetic, really.<br /><br />The best scene of the movie was arguably the chase sequence at the end. But there was a point where it seemed WAY too unbelievable. Almost like the Peter Griffin fighting the chicken scene. The opposing assassin survives a major car wreck, steals a motorcycle, pounces  from one motorcycle to another, somehowmanages to catch up to Cross and his companion, and then takes 1 or 2 shots and flips into a fruit stand. At that point wouldn't you simply call it a day, realize you've been beaten? Apparently not. He brushes himself off, mounts the bike, and catches up again! Seriously, I need that bike! The guy was determined to finish his contract, by any means necessary it seemed. Not surprisingly he failed, while cross and his biker buddy settle for a nasty bit of road rash.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are absolutely brilliant as Claire and Francis Underwood in a political drama that captures the reality of Washington politics which WEST WING only attempted to do. The darkness of the characters and the political back stabbing that goes on during THE HOUSE OF CARDS keeps you glued to your seat and you never know what might happen next. I am so glad that I bought the DVD to be able replay whenever I have a thirst for great acting and writing. I kept seeing in Francis Underwood the face of &#34;Lester Burnam&#34; from American Beauty and the power of revenge. I can't say enough about HOUSE OF CARDS as I thougt nothing would top MADMEN, but HOUSE OF CARDS surpasses that show and brings you the reality of the political games and evilness of Washington politics. Bravo, HOUSE OF CARDS!
B007THA4FI|2.0|After having read the Harry Potter Books I was expecting something else.<br />This is an R rated book.<br />Character development and writing were great, just not my type of book.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I read all of Baldacci's books they are well thought out exciting in fact I have a hard time putting them down and read well into the night.  This book was riveting and did not dissapoint,
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I wish this had no ending. My whole family can't wait for the next season.<br />We can not get enough of this TV show. I hear Season 4 is being worked on.<br />Let's pray a season 5 and 6 are in the works
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This is a great way to get more items! Ok, lets say i find one diamond in my mine. I can edit my inventory and make it as many diamonds as i want!!!! Its so nice!! The maximum u can add is 200. But just put them in a chest and leave one out. Just go to ur inventory and make that one diamond into 200 again!! in filthy rich!! :D u can do this with all your items. So great app when u getting low on supplys and dont feel like searching. But make sure u have at least one to make it as many as u want! :D
B003XU02QG|4.0|Romans on the defensive from the Picts, trapped and trying to get back home. A lot of battle/fight scenes. Guts, blood, beheading, hacking, squirting blood, etc. Backstabbing, and not just with weapons. A fierce female warrior and a lovestory thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is excellent. Liam Cunningham, not listed anywhere as being in this movie, is a main character and also goes a great job. Overall, the acting is pretty good.<br /><br />Between 3 and 4 stars. Good to watch if you have nothing else to do.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|i have always played on line and now i can play any time any where.  It is different than on the computer using a mouse, but sometimes i can do better and get a higher score on the kindle
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Jack The Giant Slayer.<br /><br />The story of a Kingdom, a beanstalk, Giants, a Princess and a guy named Jack.<br /><br />The Princess: Beautiful and kind. She was looking for an adventure and she got one.<br /><br />Jack: A farm boy with a noble heart. A very likeable hero.<br /><br />Leader of the Giants: Two heads are better than one.<br /><br />Magical beans: Beans, beans, the magical fruit, the more ya eat the more ya.......well, just ask the Giant King.<br /><br />The magical crown: Hmmmm, wonder what that does?<br /><br />The Giants: Big, mean and will eat just about anything.<br /><br />There are others, good guys and bad guys, they all play their parts well. Ewan McGregor does a great job.<br /><br />Graphics: Well done. Love the waterfalls.<br /><br />Although the Giants are very mean, the movie is ok even for older kids. No dirty words, no nekkid people. The battle scenes are graphically violent but no blood and guts. You never really see anyone getting eaten.<br /><br />Action. Adventure. Fun. Romance. Giants. Magical beans. This movie has it all. Total fun for the entire family. 4 stars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. it wasn't to easy where I breezed through the puzzles and it wasn't to hard where I gave up in frustration. I would totally recommend this game I cant wait for more levels!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I've read this book more than any other book...and if they so much as get Bilbo's name right I'll be hooked. Plus I want to see what Smaug looks like.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome. I love it. the graphics are so pretty and it's easy to play. it is super fun
B0000542D2|5.0|If the beatles act half as good as they perform, this is bound to be a blockbuster. Besides it's neat.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Good game and quite addictive for Father&acute;s and daughters.  The social media requirements are however absurd.  This game forces you to share on Facebook in order to complete certain tasks which we as a family Don&acute;t allow.  My daughter loved playing, but can go only so far without soliciting for friends.  To bad, but the game was fun while it lasted.<br />.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|Who doesn't love the beatles? There are really great songs on this album. Wish it had the &#34;What would you do&#34; song but it's great irregardless. I'm sure you've heard most of these songs on the radio. This mastering of the songs is very clean. A joy to listen to.
B002OMZTSK|5.0|Poignant, realistic characters really bring this story to life.<br />I must read for anyone who feels what these kids felt.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|Love the modern retelling of shakespeare. It may not capture the entire nature of his works but I like CG and modern props, so there.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The Sound of Music is an enduring classic and in it's new format is an outstanding collection. Worth every bit of it's price. A true treasure.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is so clever and witty ,  it leaves you wondering ?  Why can't a person of such high knowledge, study the books, take the exams , pass with top rank and be in the same status as a Harvard Law student . Our for that matter any other profession?
B006M9NI48|3.0|I really liked the ideas in this book, just thought it was a bit long winded & took a lot to keep me interested.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I avoided renting this for a while because I thought it was some modern day retelling of the Brother's Grimm tale with a few upgrades to make it appealing to today's audiences. I was wrong. This is far from anything the Grimm lads ever dreamed of. It is well written, well directed, and well acted. The computer graphics and make up are flawless, special effects are dazzling and it is a story you can get into, no matter what your age.<br /><br />It has gore, violence, explosions, humor, gunfire, nudity, adult situations, adult language, magic, witches....I swear, you will feel like you are in school again!  Okay, okay!  Not ever school has magic.<br /><br />Definitely worth renting or owning. This is a top-notch production from MTV Films. The funniest gag was the old English milk bottles with handwritten MISSING KIDS information tied on them.<br /><br />Yes, it is FANTASY, so don't expect to apply logic to this movie. I didn't see anything that stood out as openly ridiculous (within in the context of the fantasy genre)and felt the movie was cohesive from scene to scene. Great soundtrack, too!<br /><br />There are head butts, naked butts, head bursts and ......well, go watch the movie already, will ya!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Great movie to watch it must rent on your kindle .It was  alot better in HD price to rent was con high but worth it
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use to take hours to fall asleep when my mind would buzz.  With the different sounds i can fill any void to help fall asleep in minutes! The timers are great so i can fall asleep and know the the system will turn off. Even helps my husband fall asleep!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|you are able to create many many things all wile in a very fun and sometimes puzzling levels. I dealt enjoy it and I'm sure kids and adutlts will find this a fun and entertaining game!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I really like this movie! I was happy I bought it on here. I'm a prime member so it got here very quickly and I was able to enjoy it even faster than I thought!
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|English teachers will be in heaven using this book for teaching metaphorical meanings.  Students will be amazed at what words can do.
B002VRNR1Y|4.0|casting Shelly Duvall as Wendy was a HUGE mistake. Her quirkiness continually distracts the viewer to the point that Kubrick's brilliant timing and perspective rarely trump in Duvall's scenes. What a shame.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Enjoyable read with powerful storyline and some interesting characters. I found the links between the main story and some of the characters a bit tenuous and needed to reflect back from time to time on where they fitted in to the story. Sometimes struggled with continuity of story.
B009YN2M7S|2.0|I was looking for a wonderfully told love story with twists and turns and intrigue. Instead I read a movie script...to a bad movie. The book was just a small step away from being Sleeping With The Enemy. Not original and not entertaining. It also had an unnecessary addition of a ghost that was absolutely ridiculous.  I wouldn't recommend this.
B002XSP16A|5.0|I only buy items that I really want after careful research.  I am very pleased with the Amazon down loads.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I just love the show....It is the best one on TV, and I do recommend it to all my friends
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is very useful when I'm trying to find something on my tablet. Much easier than trying to find the file program already installed.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|It's hard these days to find movies that the entire family can watch together.  This was a movie we watched growing up and it is still a great movie today.  The special effects are not as realistic as they are today, but really, it's a movie, it's not supposed to be real!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love books that deal with the issues of slaves. This book gives you both sides, when a young Irish girl, orphaned and alone is placed in the Kitchen House. The book follows this small misplaced child from her arrival at the plantation through her adulthood. You see the good Master who cared about his slaves and then you see the ugly side after the Master passes away and his son inherits the plantation.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this puzzle. very challenging and awesome. had to use the help more than once. I also used the hint button often. Can't wait for the next room
B00C0UHGLO|5.0|this game is fun, well made, and beautiful to behold. i highly recommend it without reservations for everyone in the whole wide world
B00009R86L|5.0|I bought this for the Domke 700-02A F-2 Bag (Brown Waxwear Finish) bag.  To be honest, the stock bag has a fantastic strap design that would be good enough on its own.  It's a sturdy but very soft strap with rubber strips inset into the fabric to keep the bag from slipping around on your shoulder and it works very well.  However, after reading some reviews online I decided to give the shoulder pada try since it had rave reviews and was very inexpensive.  I can say that the pad is definitely worth the relatively low cost of entry.  I generally carry about 20 lbs of equipment in the bag, but with the shoulder pad it makes it feel closer to 15lb.  That may not seem like a huge difference but it's pretty huge.  It's the difference between dreading having to carry everything by the third day of a multiday shoot or not really even thinking about it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|simple and diverting game.  Fun to play with my 4 year old son help to figure the simple puzzles out.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This series easily has the best pilot episode of any series I've ever seen.  You're guaranteed to be hooked by the end of that first episode and it's a series that manages to keep to intensity high for the entire with only a couple missteps.  It's easily the best cop drama ever made with only HBO's the wire playing in the same league.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|The movie was action packed the soundtrack carries it on. There is just something about a Star Trek movie even if it's not the old crew.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|my kids and I loved playing this game.  it was fun and kept us busy.  not too hard.  was just the right level. it was short but I am looking forward to additional levels.
161655164X|5.0|Don't get me wrong, the art in this game is massive and detailed, and I love reading (and seeing) production sketches, and whatnot, and for the price listed here, a VERY good deal, and companion with the game (which is incredible.)<br /><br />The only thing is, there ARE spoilers in the book, so either read after the game, or stop when you see something unfamiliar.<br /><br />That's about it. If you're impressed with the game, this is a very good bargain for your money, and enjoyable.<br /><br />Just keep in mind : This book is NOT a strategy guide, but it DOES have spoilers.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|finally got around to seeing this movie. it was cute, and filled with a sense of childhood wonder and awe. I'm still not sure how Harry managed to live with that family for 11 years without turning into a bloodthirsty socialpath
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|saw the movie first,  then devotees to read the books.  first one done and have bought the next 2. I  normally read fantasy/sci fi,  but this worked for me.
B002YDRA22|2.0|This movie was so so. I wouldn't say terrible but not that great either. I did fast forward some parts. It was ok to watch on a rainy morning.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I cannot wait to see what happens next. It lives up to the word of mouth praise. I started watching on Netflicks but had to see the final season on Amazon.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I love Gerard Butler and I thought this was a good movie about the obstacles in life that you can CHOOSE to overcome instead of give in to.
B008NW1M4K|4.0|This is a very funny book, where &#34;der Führer&#34; is put in a lot of situations that comments on our time in general, his ideas, and Germany today. For those reading German, it is recommended, if not for anything else, the author is mimicking Adolf Hitlers language very closely.<br /><br />The problem of reading the book in German for a non-German is that a couple of chapters refer closely to German television and television personalities.<br /><br />The last chapter is the weakest.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I thought this was a pretty intense movie in the beginning a little graphic at times. Amazing that this was based on a true story. I enjoyed the movie and I am glad I watched it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like the 100 Floors game but sometimes the upper levels get too hard. This game was just the right amount of difficult and was really fun to play. Can't wait for an update for more levels.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I loved this movie. I later learned that my friends in NC were extras in it as well.This is one to watch and keep.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|Like the complexity of physics games I played as a kid but with enough simplicity for my kids years younger!<br />Fun on a tablet or phone.
B00787IR2Q|4.0|I can remember watching this movie when I was young so I thought I would let my child experience it also. It was enjoyed by the next generation just as much.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This was  a very good book written with Hosseini's usual elegant phrasing. I didn't  think it was as good as his two previous books and I had to go back several times to keep the players in perspective. Altogether, a good read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|When I read Kite Runner, I had to remind myself it was a novel, not an autobiography. This author writes from the heart, but the emotion he conveys about his culture does not overwhelm his skill at storytelling. Lately I seem to be reading a lot of books that seem rushed to the market, and it was refreshing to read a carefully and artfully written story for a change.  In his first book Hosseni set a very high bar for himself and wrote one of my favorite novels.  This one is not as good but it's still a wonderful book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is wonderful and streaming it through Amazon is usually flawless.  Occasionally there is a hitch in downloading but not very often and usually attributed to my internet connection.  I would definitely recommend watching the series this way.  It is a great way to catch up on what you missed!
B00C0UHGLO|5.0|The game is great...awesome graphics and user interface....its one of the top apps on Google Play with a very very high rating and you're all rating it 1 star for location based services?!?  Have you ever looked at the Facebook App permissions?  Facebook app can take pictures AND video at any time WITHOUT user consent and you're complaining about location services?!  Mind  blowing....it won best app at Cannes electronic festival and its a top rated app by Mensa...comon people there's many many many worse apps than this one just enjoy the game
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I got it to replace my Kindle cable, and in that function, it works great. It seems well constructed and looks like it's not going anywhere anytime soon.
B00BX8PG5M|4.0|\\"There are only 2 reasons for a boat to go rogue. One is to defect and the other is to start a war and I don't think we're defecting.\\" This movie is based on actual evens set during the Cold War between the US and the USSR. After returning home and excited about being on leave the A Russian sub captain (Harris) and crew are stunned when they are chosen to go on another mission right away. The mission is classified and the only one on the sub that knows the details is a KGB agent Duchovny). When certain details emerge the crew starts to rethink the orders they are given. I was looking forward to seeing this for really one reason. I am a huge Ed Harris fan. He did not disappoint in this movie. The movie itself is also really good and the best way to describe it is a mix of Hunt For Red Octber and Crimson Tide. The fact that the movie is true makes it even more interesting to watch. It is a little predictable but that does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie at all. If you are a fan of movies like Red October then this movie is for you. I recommend this. Overall, very tense and exciting. I give it a B+.
B0063M22QO|4.0|nice game, If I had more time I would give you details about the game.  I believe it is a keeper
B005EWDA9M|1.0|This book is an incoherent mish-mash of oriental/occidental  modern/futuristic fantasy with feeble attempts to tie it together with a spattering of cultural themes. It is a comic book(not manga) without pictures.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an amazing game where you become a detective yourself! The goal of the game is to look for clues and try to figure out puzzles to open the doors to the next floor. There are 10 floors right now but more levels are coming!!!!! I had absolutely no technical problems with this game. It wasn't too hard, nor too easy. You REALLY  have think. To give you a hint...one of the levels includes a little basic math. :) Love this game!!!!!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I play this at my friends house but I could never play it here so I can now play it on my kindle and now I'm happy again
B008Y5FNL4|4.0|Hall of fame lines in movie.&#34;I love the smell of napalm in the morning&#34; Robert Duvall at his best ever.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|you know at first I thought that I would not like this game but now I love it! you should really buy it!
B002I8PVQA|4.0|I wondered why with this many stars, really heavy hitters, I had never heard of this movie. I watched and really dug it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I have a whole library of music all thanks to Tubemate. Also downloading videos is fast and the multidownload function makes it even faster =D 5 Stars!!!
B005TQACLC|5.0|Love Britney Spears! She's sexy and entertained. This concert movie is just great! The songs, Britney, dancers... everything on stage it's simply PERFECT! When I was watching it I felt like if I was in the concert and I really enjoyed it.  Good job!  :)
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I don't know how Emma Donoghue tapped into the mind of a 5 year old, but I'm glad she did. This book is an extremely well written account of five yr old Jack. I'm not going to summarize the book for those who want to read it. But secretly I pray it isn't turned into a lifetime film.
B004LUS390|5.0|Enjoy drew look good pretty. Add picture great looking fun one. Change life, my eyes is all right.for all enjoy.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is an amazing game. The storyline is amazing, the graphics and weapons are amazing, and it is am a,ing.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is full of skill and adventure. You need to be Donny or smart to be able to pass through your enemies.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Purchased this for 3 and 7 years olds.  This is their favorite game and they both do well with it.
B006YC74E8|5.0|This app, where do I begin?! It's amazing!!! I can say without a doubt it's THE BEST!!!!! It works so good with color, helps with making photo's into new color art! MY TOTAL FAVE APP!!!<br /><br />  BTW, I almost NEVER give FIVE STARS, THEY DID THE BEST FOR ART! P.s. Everyone's FAVE thing ever, FREE!!!
1475143389|5.0|very helpful and enlightening.  I never new the truth behind the scam of the supplement companies.  The workout is great, and the description of how to do the squat and deadlift are spot on and very highly descriptive.  If you are looking to get bigger, stronger and leaner this book is definitely for you. I highly recommend it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Sometimes a good deed can cause ripples of pain and loss through a family. Also brings to mind the quote &#34;that which does not kill us, makes us stronger.&#34; Just a GREAT STORY.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This one makes you think. I also think it points you to thinking of other alien style movies.  I thought it was well worth watching. Thank you.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This movie was made for all ages (12and up) and draws the audience into the action. The twists and turns were great! thank you.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Loved the music part, but it was for the most part boring. I had high expectations, but could not even finish the movie.
1400069807|4.0|I had the opportunity to listen to a friendʻs audio copy. While being unimpressed with the reader/narrator on this version, I found the topic(s) to be of great interest.  It is at once a discussion of food science, marketing and advertising, a story of how people rationalize and justify their roles in contributing to significant global health issues (diabetes and obesity being two of the big ones) and an indictment of the cozy relationship between corporations and government agencies. While most of us have more than an inkling that heavily processed foods are not healthy for us, many will be unaware of the extent to which the food industry goes to formulate and promote \\"foods\\" that are known to contribute to the poor diets and result in diabetes, obesity, heart disease, clogged arteries and the like. While it should not be a surprise to anybody that it is former tobacco companies that are the parent companies of many of our industrial food giants, it is worthwhile to have a look at how they use the same marketing and advertising approaches to push addictive behaviors in the largely unsuspecting and/or uninformed public.  It should inspire discussions with friends about food quality, personal health choices, the role of government, politics, and corporate greed.
1476733953|5.0|From start to finish couldn't put it down. This started life as an ebook but I can see why it ended up in print. It's a great read, especially if you like Sci Fi and it's surprisingly well written. I highly recommend it.
B00A69JZQU|5.0|Easy to read<br />This book is for person who wants to understand why social media matters and what a business (large or small) should do about it. I didn’t understand the point of twitter or why companies spend time on social media  - now I have a better idea.I have a better understanding of what I want out of social media for my personal life and business.  Some parts of the books are just lists of: Statistics, Important websites, Key People to follow on Twitter<br />Social Media is a revolution in how humans communicate bring change to business, politics/government, and society.  Just look around you!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I was excited to pick up The Elite, and also excited that I enjoyed the second book in this series.<br /><br />I did have 2 pitfalls that kept me from a 5-star review.<br /><br />The first is admittedly rather fickle of me. The characters giggle A LOT. For whatever reason, this drives me crazy. Perhaps I should blame Harry Potter. Every time I read \\"giggle\\", I hear Dolores Umbridge's irritating laugh and I cringe. Beyond that though, it just makes the characters seem too childish, especially with content that's already on the younger side of YA.<br /><br />The second point is due to the fickleness of the main character. America (who I don't necessary love) flip flops on her feelings toward her two suitors many, many times. Some of these instances seem justified, but overall, it's a bit jostling when every other chapter she's changing her mind. Especially because she's adamant and definitive about her feelings on multiple occasions. This just makes it even more jarring.<br /><br />So what about what I liked...<br /><br />Mainly, it's very easy to read and rather light. I stayed up past my bedtime to finish this book.<br /><br />I also like that the stakes are higher in this second installment. The plot goes deeper than just the contest, and I'm eager to see where the next book takes things. If it's a trilogy, I expect very definitive and final decisions to be made. If there's loose ends, I'm going to be quite disappointed. We shall see!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use Pinterest daily; I've learned so much about a variety of topics. It's so easy to search for anything and find interesting connections!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Love him , hate him, don't care.  I seem to to be on the side of still willing to catch his flicks.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|If you you like action, fighting & romance wrapped in one.  This is an entertaining flick has a plot and good action sequences
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Bruce has a lot of cheesy one liners but its still Bruuuuuuuce!  Go see it and never lose interest in watching.
B008MM9630|5.0|It is a great game. My sister loves fairy games and it calms her down from the excitement she has when she plays it.
072325804X|5.0|This is a beautiful edition. I bought it for my greatgrand daughter&#34;s fifth birthday. I would urge anyone with young children in their family to purchase it the art work and the biography of Ms. Potter is a welcome addition for any child's library.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|There were lots  of interesting things I did not know about Washington DC, our founding fathers, and the US Capital building.
B005MMZ63C|1.0|Never could get our interest. story way almost as bad as Woody Allen's Annie Hall.. We gave up after about forty-five minutes, . We saw that in movie theatre it was full at the start and when it was over there were us and two others. Highly rated and lousy Very over rated movie!!!.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The new charger works great and I LOVED that Amazon backed up it's products.  That will make me a loyal customer! THANK you!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Like 6 novels rolled into one, Cloud Atlas is a captivating journey through time and culture, and a poignant study of the two sided coin of civilization, and the power of intelligence to either create or destroy.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|Brad Pitt is one of today's best actors. He always picks movies with a<br />great storyline and lots more than just action. This movie is a classic<br />case of a great movie, terrific acting and a wonderful story line. Plus the<br />fact that there's truth to the story even makes it that much more entertaining.<br />Highly recommend this movie to all sports fans.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Just loved this movie. So beautiful and creative and was really<br />impressed with the special features section. Highly recommend<br />this movie for all ages.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|This movie was pretty cool and very entertaining. Was a lot of<br />fun and do recommend it to everyone. Enjoy.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|For some reason I did'nt care for this movie. Whether it was the<br />hobbits or just the whole scenario I'm not sure. Gave this movie<br />away. Sorry Hobbit fans.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I loved this movie so much I bought the audiobook and also the<br />soundtrack on CD. It's in my collection to view over and over<br />throughout the years. Recommend it to everyone, especially if<br />you're an avid history fan.
1427208476|5.0|This was the compliment to the BluRay movie and the Audiobook, all<br />three of which I purchased because of the great movie and wonderful<br />soundtrack. HIghly recommend this one if you're a movie soundtrack<br />fan.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This was very entertaining with a cool story line. Recommend<br />it to anyone who enjoys this type of fantasy movie. I did.
B00AQKEPMI|3.0|Unlike the Incredibles, this movie could'nt quite keep my attention<br />and lost interest very quickly and consequently gave th movie away.<br />Sorry fans.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Classic movie Classic Cooper. Remember seeing this movie thirty<br />years ago and loved it then and now had to have it in my collection.<br />No matter who you talk to that's seen the movie, the remarks are<br />always the same. &#34;Yeah, just loved that movie.&#34; I highly recommend<br />this movie to everyone.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This was a fun movie and am always impressed with the<br />way the special effects are carried out. More and more<br />believable. Super Hero fans will love this one.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Loved this movie and highly recommend. Everyone will see something<br />different in the story but I found it highly entertaining and one that I<br />will enjoy watching over and over throughout the years.
B005FISBV2|5.0|Like all the Dexter's, it you've gotten to Six, then you're a real fan.<br />Loved this like all the rest and recommend it.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Loved this movie and highly recommend. Everyone will see something<br />different in the story but I found it highly entertaining and one that I<br />will enjoy watching over and over throughout the years.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and even more knowing it was<br />based on a true story. It was well done and very entertaining<br />and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B005CA4SQK|3.0|Some people loved this kind of movie but it's not for me. Only bought<br />the series because of the reviews but was less than satisfied. It was done<br />well and all that but I'm not a zombie fan. Nuff Said!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Loved this movie and even bought one as a gift for a friend.<br />Do recommend this movie and also recommend the other<br />of it's kind...Zero Dark Thirty.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|Liked this series enough to buy both seasons but can't say it's the<br />best i&#34;ve ever seen. Can't compare to Deadwood which I feel is the<br />masterpiece of storytelling. I got into Empire after a while but still found<br />it hard to believe the portrayal of the early hoods. That said, I'll look<br />forward to Season Three.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Surprisingly enough, I really liked this movie. Arnold still has it<br />and the movie was done quite well. Recommend it.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This was a great way to introduce another hero to the Bourne series.<br />JR did a fantastic job and really fits the part well. Of course, will surely<br />miss Matt Damon but do have his series in my collection and watch it<br />it all the time. Highly recommend this movie.
B003L77GRY|5.0|Dexter's unique and continues to amaze me with their ever imaginative<br />story lines. Just love the series and highly recommend to all.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I've enjoyed the mission impossible series from back to it's<br />television day and continue to enjoy the movies with Tom Cruise<br />at the helm. The only thing that bothered me about this movie<br />was the guy who was cast a the comic relief. Did'nt enjoy that part<br />of the movie at all. Otherwise, I like it.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Liked this series enough to buy both seasons but can't say it's the<br />best i&#34;ve ever seen. Can't compare to Deadwood which I feel is the<br />masterpiece of storytelling.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Loved this movie and highly recommend. Everyone will see something<br />different in the story but I found it highly entertaining and one that I<br />will enjoy watching over and over throughout the years.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|As usual, the Men in Black series has scored another hit. Great<br />writers to make a very entertaining experience. Recommend this<br />movie to all ages.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|This was one great movie. Totally enjoyable with every frame. A story<br />told with a wonderful tone and storyline. Enjoyed every second of it<br />and was so please with the complete special features. Highly recommend<br />this movie to everyone and no horses were hurt in this movie.
B00915G6YE|5.0|Dexter is great. If you've not had the chance to view it, you should try it at<br />least once and see if you become a big fan as I have. I'll bet you will.<br />How the writers of Dexter continue to be so creative is a testiment to it's<br />basic premise. Good writing equals good quality everything else. Nuff said!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Love this game! It was way too short. A good game leaves me wanting more, however, this game was a nice challenge for a couple of days.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|As a true Star Trek fan, I enjoyed this novel. It deals with Star Trek's most loved characters, Data and his strange family. It also does a brief history of Star Trek as it relates to this story.<br /><br />My chief complaint was that the audio reader on Kindle was disabled for this book. I enjoy listening to the books being read as I drive down the road. It passes the time away. It's the chief reason that I purchased the Kindle.<br /><br />Well worth reading.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|The whole premise of the movie is terrible, the acting is terrible, and we were highly disappointed with the whole thing!
B002GHIPYI|4.0|The sound is good, they look good, and the cable is sturdy.  The cans get a little uncomfortable after awhile, though--I wish the space for your ears was a little deeper.
B00BC24NT4|2.0|I have tried on three occasions to start and finish Mr. Le Carre's books, but have not yet made it to the end.  That says more about me than it does him and I accept that as self awareness.  There is so much 'conversational' dialog, that often has no character involvement, and it bogs down in the verbiage of an author who is gifted with the language, but demands the reader is willing to plow through sentence after sentence of 'lingo' adjectives that are familiar to Mr. Le Carre, but those 'off the Island' are, perhaps, apt to tire of the language and lose sight of the story line.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Good enough for a rental.  Father and son have a lot to take on.  Good weekend movie to watch. a
B005544V6A|4.0|I love the show, but sometimes the audio did not sync with the visual on a few of the shows.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|its ok but the prices r horrible. I LOVE a lot of of the stuff but $$$$$$$$$$. I put a good review is because I feel bad for them I saw a lot of bad reviews so I said bad stuff but rate them good. U SUCK GAMELOFT.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Some off color, dry, British humor included.  Lovely music, scenery and storyline.  Best for mature audiences.  Nice that these stories are told.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|After reading Cynthia Tobias' book 'How We Are Wired' and viewing this film,my understanding of how very different autistic children are and the difference the people in their lives make.  Great movie and true story!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|The game has very good graphics and seamless movement between scenes.  I haven't finished yet, yet but it seems to promise a complicated path .I am new to victoriana,or steampunk,so will write after I have finished<br />.
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|What a wonderful series.  It will take you back in time.  It is so easy to become involved with the characters and all that goes on in their lives.  Fun stuff!
B0042ESTQW|5.0|This item seem sturdy, but it was the wrong item. I was ordering a case for auto GPS. this item was selected instead.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Enough said!  Some of the most beautiful women were on this show.  In fact even to this day Star Trek babes still place in the top ten most beautiful women who were on TV.  William Shatner became a legend and is still.
B004UID2LC|1.0|There seems to be no reliable you tube apps for the kindle fire hd. This one is full of bugs. If I try viewing a video online, the last video I played will begin. It's only the audio and the video is inaccessible. This forces a restart of the kindle exiting the app does not stop the audio.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Title says it all! Didn't think I'd like the game, but I was wrong! Tons of fun and easy to play! And, it's free!
B00005O3VD|4.0|The quality of the movie appeared to have some periodic skips to it.  Otherwise, the color of the film was okay.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|Anyone who enjoyed the film will enjoy this soundtrack.  Its a beautiful CD and the quality of the music is good too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's real. It's moving. A great read for young adults (high school age). I have teenagers of this age and the author seems to have captured that age's dialogue, angst, and viewpoint. Warning it's a book that once moving cannot be stopped easily.
0812993357|1.0|After all of the hype, I was expecting a fabulous take on the worlds of publishing and modeling.  This book is more of a Sunday chat with a friend who has had some mildly interesting experiences.  It makes me think that her life either wasn't all that interesting, she can't remember it, or she is forbidden from speaking about it.
B003L77G06|4.0|Well, this particular item had a couple skips and stops.  For some strange reason there was something grainy in the actual DVD case.  I was able to blow away the grains, but it still has some skips and stops.  I have no idea where these grains came from or what they were.  The packaging seemed fine.
B000W91RUG|5.0|TBBT is such a funny show.  I knew I would be happy with my purchase.  Everything has been great.  The packaging was fine.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I bought seasons one, two, and three at the same time.  So glad I did.  This show is hysterically funny at times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best game ever I can never get off of my tablet it cool I always wonder who invented this game cause I would love to thank them.
B000HF2NTE|5.0|Sylvester Stallone in this movie was just great. Playing a cop role sometime have it up and down action, and Stallone was just the<br />right person for this role. Lot's of action and beautiful ladies it was just great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'd read some reviews about this app not working on the kindle fire, but it's working great on mine! A screen came up saying it wasn't responding, but i clicked on 'wait' and it started just fine! Levels are fun, challenging. Graphics are well done.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It has always worked great for me.  It keeps all my downloads and my books in order. Thank you kindle...
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I like the Marware Rotating Stand because of the fact that it can stand alone. It is also thicker that other cases and I believe its safer if God forbid it drops
B005NNURES|5.0|What can I say the music speaks for itself if you have never heard a Floyd song listen to some clips from Final Cut, Wish you Where here or animals I would say the wall or dark side but it like playing stairway to heaven in a guitar shop its been done to death.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I've watched this movie 5 + times and it still makes me laugh each time.  A must see if you love romantic comedies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game requires a lot of brain  usage, you have to look very hard for some or all of the clues. This is all in all a fantastic game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is awesome. This game has a great balance of  of hard and easy. It's the kind of game you want to play over and over again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's free and worth your time. One of the best apps I've ever played! GET IT!!!<br />IT IS FREE<br />:)
B0096DZKZC|1.0|I can't even start on my kindle  it really sucks I want to sew really looks cool but sucks it doesn't work
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel kept me guessing almost until the end.  Very surprising book with lots of twists and turns - still find myself thinking about what happened.  Nick and Amy are some messed up people!
1455527475|4.0|The book is very easy to read, and it explain the terms in ways layman/non financial experts can understand. I see there is a lot of critics in the web. But regardless of the degree of truth in the book, Greg has at least succeed in composing a very compelling story in narrative format. It's many years of experience in the company also give him unique perspective of the company from both junior and senior level. For anyone who hope to get a bit of insider view of investment banking, this book is much better than the like of \\"Monkey Business\\", which is much more like a \\"guide-format\\" - therefore, less interesting and less likely to stick.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Excellent and well worth the time for it is delightful, and I think that the word requirement is stupid on here.
B00659N39K|4.0|This is a very cute lunch box. Thougn it's a little smaller than I expected. Consider it's a Japanese product, I think it's a normal size for them. I'm still very happy with it, cuz I'm a big fan of Totoro! Definitely love it!
B00CX1TPF0|4.0|Excellent and well worth the time for it is delightful, and I think that the word requirement is stupid on here.

B00009AHSO|5.0|Great collection to remember the 80s - fun ride music.  CD is good quality and a good collection of the bands music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to play not too hard but still enough to make it interesting. Hope New levels come out soon.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a great game I enjoyed playing on my Kindle Fire. Smooth game play, fun and entertaining, was disappointed there was only ten levels, but I look forward to more soon!
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|This is a good band that you should really look into picking up and adding to your collection, They are currently playing on the radio and got a good sound.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I felt like I had been &#34;beat up&#34; after reading this book, there was no relief from the negativity.  Hard read
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I watched this movie with my Environmental Science AP class. It was a great find and carried so many good messages for the kids.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|This movie is what you expect from Nicholas Sparks.  Needed to turn up the heat a little, but was definately a good movie.
B00B2G4O2G|3.0|Interesting at first, but goes downhill. The ending was just plain stupid. You could say the ending was predictable, but it was so dumb you would hope the script writers wouldn't actually go there.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|If you like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, this series is right up your alley.  Legends and myths given a new twist
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is really fun. I spent hours on this game. some of the levels were really tricky but I finally figured them out.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app. It allowed me to use my not so expensive tablet to read all y favorite books without a bunch of hassle.
B000JML90Y|5.0|I read a little of this and then go back to a fiction book for some variety. I will write a full review later when I have the full view of it. It's a classic and one must think how revolutionary his ideas were at the time they were written. I had read a great historical fiction book about how Darwin sort of cut out his coworker/co-theorist in this endeavor. Sorry, the name escapes me, but it was a great window into all that fascinates those of us that know there's more to the story than just the guy that gets the laurels. Anyways, buy this classic....and see how what he discovered relates to our modern thinking!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun it is like i have my own hores and i can spend time with him. i have a hkdse in real life and it is just the same.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Couldn't put it down, even though you don't get all the details of every operation he was on, he still gives enough detail to make it feel like I was there looking over his shoulder.
8866131105|5.0|Aside from the fact that it lies flat, has aesthetically pleasing page & text colors, etc... I seemed to always get asked in meetings about it. It's just a notebook, and I use it to track my daily schedule/activities, but I do enjoy using it more than any other notebook I've used, and I've always used a book this size as my sort of work log/schedule/diary. Definitely will be purchasing one next year!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Its a great game. I'm addicted sad to say. Wish you had more opportunity to earn credits though. I enjoy playing it. The game does freeze up at times can be frustrating but support will try to help you out. I like it its relaxing.
1616614609|5.0|Having played many board games, and also having grown up HATING Magic the Gathering, I can tell you honestly this is my favorite game right now. The asymmetry, the pace, variety, strategy, everything. Me and my friends haven't even made it past the starter company & hacker decks, but so far we haven't needed to. I can't find one part of the game I DISlike. Right now I'm trying feverishly to get my wife to start playing with me so I don't have to wait for a meetup to play!
0399230033|5.0|My 2.y.o daughter loves to read this book every single night from the moment we got it on the mail.  She enjoys to repeat the name of the animals in each page and how the story ends, especially with the extra character involved in the story.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B007VYAJAE|5.0|It gave me a deeper understanding of Bob Marley, his music and the life he led.  If you like his music, you will love this documentary.
B008Y768XO|4.0|Usually not a fan of dog movies...or any movie where the protagonist is an animal for that matter. It was surprisingly good. Probably the fact that it was somewhat true, enhanced my enjoyment.
B00821OX98|5.0|Like the idea and all the plot twists. I am  just catching up on seasons 1 &2 I watch 2-3 shows a night. Am looking forward to this new season. Great show!
B000N5F6OW|5.0|I had not seen this in a long time. I forgot how much I loved this one. One of my all time favorite lines in this one. Girl: &#34;You have been drinking a little, haven't you?&#34; John Wayne: &#34;No, ma'am. I've been drinking a lot.&#34; Cracks me up to think about.
030799029X|5.0|As a former expat wife in Paris, I could totally relate.  Certainly not on the same level (!) but it made it all that much more fun!<br /><br />Love it!
0375420525|4.0|This book is a little outside of the box, but will hold your attention all the way. I have to admit it is the most unusual book I have ever read. It draws you in until you think you are there.<br /><br />The house is aware of itself as a house, and the book is aware of itself as a book. There is a story of a family moving into a house, trying to sort out its interpersonal demons, and finding that the insides of things (lives, minds, houses) can often be darker, scarier, stranger, and more convoluted than they would appear from the outsides.<br /><br />The main story, the Navidson Record, is about a never ending hallway in the Navidson family's new house in Virginia. One day, after returning from a family funeral, the Navidson's return to their home to find a door that was never there before. The inside of the house is larger than the outside - and the inside is growing<br />This book was extremely scaring and disturbing. It paints a frightening picture of a world just below the surface and beyond the understanding of our own.<br />The book is written in a very interesting way that engages and challenges the reader at the same time. Some pages are upset down - some have boxes within boxes. others are parts of pages. At first I was a little worried by the size of it and the way it was written. It is a fiction book but it's written like a text book with footnotes, indexes and the works. But once I started reading it I found it easy to read and really got into the stories
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Sedaris never disappoints! Super funny book. Great to read small bits at a time or sit for an entire evening.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I enjoyed the game along with my ten year old.  We can not wait for more games like this one
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Ignore those who say this game sucks. They haven't given it enough of a try to see what it's like. As with most racing games, you need to improve your car through game play. You start with the basics and as you progress, you upgrade to better qualities. It's easy to earn the coins and understand where to brake to avoid crashing. Flipping your car over successfully also gives you more coins to spend. It's part of the game!
1476733953|3.0|My first read by Hugh Howey.  I'm not really a scifi fan, but found this book had good reviews.  I thought it was very interesting, but not great.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I've downloaded this a couple of times on my Kindle Fire HD. OfficeSuite Pro 7 keeps telling me that I need to download the archives for this app. OfficeSuite then states that it is downloading the files. After that the download quits while showing that they still need to be downloaded.<br /><br />At this point, I think that this is a waste of time and money.
B008NMT684|1.0|If you downloaded the free version, watch out that your son/girl knows how to purchase the full version from the free version app.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this heroic account of a young woman's grueling journey through unimaginable circumstances. Her story is gripping and heartwrenching. Very well written!
0345529057|5.0|I've borrowed them from the local library, but I've always wanted to own a copy. About twenty dollars for four books means about five dollars books. I know you can get them from a used book store, but four NEW books for about five dollars each.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read his first two books and this one was the best yet.  Very sad in the end though.  It would have been better if the brother and sister had reunited earlier in their life.
0811821846|5.0|I bought this book for my husband as a &#34;gift&#34; from our dog for Father's Day.  I try to give him a gift from each of our kids both human and fur. Our cat, Chewbacca, is a Wookiee and our dog is always trying to run after her.  So, this was a gag gift to my husband asking him to make Wookiee cookies so that our dog can eat the &#34;Wookiee&#34;-cookie...We haven't actually tried any of the recipes yet.  So, I can't review these but they do look good or I wouldn't have bought the book.  I will add an additional review once we start trying the recipes.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Entertaining in a Forest Gump kind of way, showing just how easy one can have a great life without really knowing it
145210655X|5.0|This is such a fun little book to read!  It will make a great Father's Day gift for Star Wars Dads!  Great for all Star Wars fans with kids!
B001N3GUIE|4.0|My background is physics.  Today's science fiction is tomorow's fact.  The movie was well done and has very good production values.  There is one technical glitch with regard to continuit.  Future buyers will enjoy trying to find it!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|First off when dealing with such an iconic character a director has no chance at making everyone happy...stay too true to the source material (especially when it's been done before) and the director has simply made another unnecessary reboot; stray too far from the material or change things radically and the director is a hack, a savage who doesn't understand the character or what he's doing.  In many ways Snyder, with hopes riding so high, was a damned man the moment he sat in the director's seat.  Some fans will drool and many more will say, \\"Not cool.\\"<br /><br />My wife and I, people who enjoy action/ fantasy movies (and superhero movies in particular), were somewhere in the middle.  The trailer for this feature film got us excited and the movie delivered overall, it was enjoyable and had action spread throughout (mind you not all of the action was the beat-'em-up type).  We would easily recommend it for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />Perhaps first and foremost, for me at least, is that this movie portrays ideas that the characters live out; in many ways it's about metaphysics and philosophy, beliefs and attachments that come to define a person.  The movie doesn't shy away from embracing this either.  Superman the icon in this film is an embodiment of a man's ability to choose who he will be and how he will define himself over and above a deterministic, naturalistic path of evolution; he is the man who is able to value integrity, goodness, and be a respector of life as inherently valuable (something we are fast losing in our culture--and something that causes him emotional anguish when he is forced to take life to save life); he is the man who can rise above it all, take a leap of faith, because he can see and has been taught that there is a spark of divinity in all of us.  It comes as no surprise that Superman is regarded as savior and in one scene he is in a church talking to a priest with two stained-glass windows behind him, one depicting Jesus Christ sacrificing himself and another showing Jesus as the good shepherd caring for his sheep; and in another scene he adopts the iconic arms outstretched pose of the cricified savior of mankind.  All of this is very deliberate and so is the drawing links of these beliefs to what has been considered distinctly American ideology in past decades.  Supes also wrestles with his interpersonal connections; he is a man of two worlds, but he is encouraged to embrace the best wisdom of both.  He receives and values guidance both from his heavenly...er, Kryptonian father as well as his earthly father.  He yearns for connection, and he's given the chance to be connected to the human race but is also given the opportunity to reconnect and align himself with his Kryptonian heritage; but he has to make a bitter choice (the film doesn't really dwell on this though) as to whom he will ultimately align with and he makes his decision based on belief, on ideology...some might even say on love (but not of an erotic or romantic sort).<br /><br />This film invites discussion and even reflection.  It's more than standard superhero fare for those who have ears to hear.  But many people will miss this and they will see it more than hear it.  The film isn't a visual powerhouse though it is visually stimulating.  It actually goes more for an emotional tone visually; one of nostalgic memory, lingering and longing and at other times resolution, strength, and power.  The tone is about what has happened before and how that is affecting Superman's \\"now\\".  Visually the film is slightly and intentionally grainy, or filtered to increase shadow.  One thing that I didn't like about the film is that it could have used a lot more steadicam.  Sometimes I want to see my money shots crisply and clearly, not as if I'm standing near ground zero with my vision having to adjust to all of the shaking movement.  The fight scenes aren't really anything sci-fi and fantasy fans haven't seen before and, this is important, thereal reason that they work is because they are usually given the emotional weight of Supes caring about the outcomes of the fight, and the participants of the fight.  But there are some things that we thought didn't work that well.<br /><br />Amy Adams as Lois Lane.  No.  Nothing against her, she's a fine actress, but Lane simply needs to be a strong-willed, raven-haired woman with not just feisty determination as portrayed by Adams but someone with more grit and sass.  And there was virtually no chemistry between her and Cavill!  Personally I also had problems with Michael Shannon.  There was something about him that just, for me at least, didn't seem to be able to carry or convey the weight of this brutal and determined Kryptonian.  Shannon seemed like he was trying to play General Zod in an imperialist fashion but it just didn't quite convincingly carry.  Many of the other secondary characters were also a bit flat.<br /><br />Countering this, though, is Henry Cavill.  Great, great job.  Great bit of casting.  He nailed it.  We didn't get to see him as the Clark Kent of the Daily Planet (except for a snippet) so we didn't get to see him trying on a nebbishy affect; I don't know how he'll do with that and we shall see in the sequel.  But as the young man finding his way, as the young man quietly taking in the sun's rays and recalling his fathers' talks, as Superman in tights and cape, he nailed it.  He possessed a strong, assured, and determined presence that still managed to exude concern and humility.  Did I say great job, Henry Cavill?  Yes?  Well, I mean it.  Major reason to see the movie.<br /><br />Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Kal-El's Kryptonian father, also gave an understated but clear performance that felt like it was spot on.<br /><br />But in summing up (watch out for that Lex-Corp truck Superman!) director Zak Snyder gives audiences a Superman origin story that is fleshed out with a sense of history, introduces a variety of important characters within the Superman mythology, and (most importantly) presents us with a Superman we can and will care about in a story that slowly builds its excitement but develops plenty of heart and throws at us some important thoughts.<br /><br />Oh, and isn't it refreshing that we don't have any Lex Luthor or kryptonite to throw at Superman in this film?  Thank heavens.<br /><br />4.25 stars.real reason that they work is because they are usually given the emotional weight of Supes caring about the outcomes of the fight, and the participants of the fight.

B0013LL2Z2|5.0|I have always had a interest in media that cover utopian concepts.  They have one thing in common, they all seem to fail.  There is another story cover in the novel, &#34;The Sentinal Stars&#34;.  It too failed.  The real stories here are not the triumphs of the utopian socierties.  It is the failure that makes the story!
B00B29J0I6|4.0|A great time waster and a lot of fun.  Somewhat of a simple game but it makes you think and you'll find yourself continuously playing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great bunch of puzzles<br />Each puzzle was rewarding to complete<br />Good length. I'm looking forward to many more installments. I hope they come out soon
B009RX7IX8|5.0|One of the best shows on tv. It has everything.  I'm so glad it hasn't been canceled. Can't wait to get this season! :)
0671449028|5.0|I read this book to my children and now I'm purchasing copies as gifts for the next generation.  Love this board book and the others by Boynton.
0824835921|4.0|Liked the amount of Kanji and the thoroughly explained meanings along with the explanation of the compilation of some Kanji.<br />On another positive note I have been able to broaden my Japanese vocabulary and immerse myself in the language.<br />Beware. NO PRONUNCIATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE BOOK!<br />I recommend this book to anyone who is having trouble recalling Kanji and their meanings but I HIGHLY SUGGEST a Japanese-English Dictionary (The Nelson Dictionary) for people new to this language.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I was exhausted after reading this book,I found it hard to put down. The story is straight forward with some interesting twists at the end. The main protagonist Harold Fry is a basically a bit of a loser who has been dealt a bad hand in life from the very beginning. He however finds himself and true love during his epic walkathon.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I liked the story.  It was interesting and had some nice twists.  I was pleased to see that it wasn't the usual tearjerker you get out of most Nicholas Sparks movies.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good but Julianne Hough was a little more wooden than the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Overall, it was definitely worth the rent.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This is a terrific read. It has a Forrest Gumpness about the storyline. It has amusingly written dialogue,an intriguing plot and some delicious characters. I loved the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series.  I cannot wait for Season 4!  I tried to avoid this show for so long.  I am so glad I gave in and started watching.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|This move received a lot of mixed reviews. But if you're a Quentin and or Jamie fan then you know that first Quentin likes to step out of the box and yes he tends to use the N word a lot in his movies, but there's no denying that his movies are always great and he puts his heart in his work. Also Jamie has a strong mind and will not do a movie for the money. On to the movie itself, its a very good movie and takes you on another level of cowboys and slavery. So make your own judgement and watch a movie that will keep you interested until the end.
B001HOF8AA|4.0|It was good. I had never heard of her before so it was a first experience in being inroduced to her music. i wasn't wowed like I have to go out and buy more right away
B0010V4TZU|5.0|A great, genre bending album from Vampire Weekend. This is the first of their albums that I have listened to, but I plan to listen the rest of their discography because I liked this one so much.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|I didn't find this movie to be good at all. My 4 year-old doesn't watch it either. Complete waste of money.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars not because it is perfect in it's plot or effects, but because I still enjoy watching it again after many times.  The characters are sympathetic and memorable, and the movie portrays a diverse variety of  humans from the proper early 20th century NY Emma, Mrs. Watchit, and Professor Filby to the primitive tribe of Eloi evolved milleneums later.  I really like the portrayal of Professor Alexander by Guy Pearce, his devotion to find a way to save his fianc&eacute;, Emma and the paradoxes of time travel. Also loved the library hologram Vox. It's a fun movie and stimulates the imagination. The scene of the Morlock chasing Alexander up the windmill still remains of the most scary, creepy scenes I've ever watched!
B000JIJPZY|5.0|This is a good toy to use for tommy time with any infant. My son enjoyed laying on the little pillow and playing with the giraffe and palm tree.He also loved kicking the ball on the bottom up the mat. We used this mat until he grew out of it.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter: The Seventh Season was the best season so far. Extremely entertaining with a shocking ending.  I can't wait for the eight season to come out.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for. Glad to have found it at a good price and good condition.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What can I say. Everyone is talking about this series and I was hooked from the beginning. The downstairs help were just, if not more, interesting than the upstairs family. The acting is superb and the casting spot on. So much better than watching regular T.V. programs. Something to discuss with family and friends. Could, and probably will watch the whole series again!
B002APU580|5.0|This is one of my most beloved novels and while other versions are very nicely done, this is my favorite. Superb acting by the entire cast - especially Matthew and Kiera and great historical details of the time period of this story.  The dance scenes are wonderfully done as well as the music throughout.
B002413TY2|5.0|If you like Jason Stathom and Luc Bisson you'll like this, especially if you gingers. I have little tolerance for pretentious reviewers.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|An exquisite version of the Cinderella story!  Very well acted and directed.  A most romantic and enjoyable movie. Drew Barrymore was flawless!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have this game going on 3 different devices. It's awesome. The only flaw is the price inflation on land!
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|This movie is a little bit depressing but definitely not an average love story. Also picks you up a little in the end. I'm a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt that's why I chose to watch it in the beginning. It was worth watching, so I recommend it.
B000I62JBE|4.0|Classic heist movie with great performances from DeNiro and Norton. One of the better in this genre. Great plot and a great script make this roll along with plenty of twists.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't stop trying to get to the end! Only to get there and find out I'm not finished yet!! I loved,loved,loved connecting with Eva and Gideon again! You have to read  them all so you can keep up! If you're a true fan of the series it's a must read, and worth it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good but not the best can and will get kinda boring but i like it for when im bored :)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Great game that is go at your own pace. Not too fast paced and the only downside is how slowly you acquire peanuts to speed things up.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. It is fun and tantalizing. It keeps you interested for quite a while. I love it. But you have to be into the who hide and seek aspect of a fan.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Great read, really makes me ashamed of how many Cheetos I've eaten over the years! Whole foods for life! Now if only Kraft and Nestl&eacute; would go away.....
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Was very Surprized with this movie had a good story to it and action all the way through<br />very glad i bought it and im very please with it
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My Son and I have watched it so much that I had to buy it for him. The Movie is great and it is great for all ages. Even if you are an adult and you haven't seen a children's movie in a long time you can pick this movie up and watch it. I felt like I was a kid again and my son and I can't see it enough. The Start of it along with the climax was outstanding. Great job everyone for the making of this movie. My son and I give it 2 thumps up along with 5 stars. Thank you.
B00B4804OE|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  It is not like I dislike the other movies but I really enjoyed that character Han.  His mentality and philosophy of life makes him such an enigma.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|My Son and I watched this movie together. We thought it was great and it had a good story line. It kind of brought back my days of playing video games in the arcade. Unfortunately all of the latest consoles have taken the arcades away, but there are still a few for you to go in and play.
B00821OX98|4.0|Classic sci-fi stuff. A little sappy in places but the unfolding of the alien species and culture is enough to keep me watching.
B0082208XC|5.0|My daughter decided in her third year of middle school she wanted to take up drums.  This is a perfect application for her to practice on without blowing my ear drums off.
B006XOBFTM|4.0|A real satisfying version by a person who knew exactly how to do Mahler. Sound leaves something to be desired though, but musically satisfying.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This is my fave series I can't wait for the next book to come out! I already preordered it lol.
B0046UGSNS|1.0|This pretentious Los Angeles garbage employs the LBGT community without merit, or purpose. Failing to break a single conventional norm- 'Kids' feels like a self-proclaimed \\"edgy\\" Disney disaster.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much fun.  It is very challenging and makes you keep thinking about the next move so that you can get to the next level.  I am very happy with this game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was like every other John Grisham Novel I have read.  Very intriguing and suspenseful.  It really kept me interested.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Amazing album, and just an honor to have it on the LP version!<br />Daft Punk is definitely one of the most influent bands in a long time!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|It was a collection of some very good mysteries and amazing detection science.  I really enjoyed it.  It was had to put down
B00594XOZU|5.0|Look it a good app but I forgot my friends user name her name is Mackenzie Sanchez If u know her kik me at Joann12234 and tell me her username thanks but the app is real good I recommend
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well, this app is for sure an awesome one! I recommend you to get it. Definatley worth the money! The only thing I don't like about it is that they hardly ever update it. Id way rather play it on the X-Box or computer, mainly because they have WAY more stuff to do. But I do suggest this app for you to get! Hope this helped.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is really great and I would recommend this game to all fps lovers. I'm just waiting for the update that the iPhone got
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Really great season and I can't wait for season 2 to begin!<br />Totally worth the purchases to travel with and enjoy.<br /><br />20 thumbs up!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is super! Great color and graphics! Gives kids and adults many options and things to do from feeding to actually training and competing with your horse.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Carried by the star's performance, and what should have been a disaster of a premise works out pretty well. Amazon really should put the first episode on for free for Prime viewers, as it does a good job of hooking you even though ep 3 is around where you really get a feel for things.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Needs more rooms and levels nine and ten were sort of hard but it is still a fun game to play
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a story of a man left on Mars for dead, and how he survives for over a year and the attempts to rescue him. It is a wonderful read ... much in the style of Isaac Asimov. You feel like you are reading about McGaver -- how this fellow solves problems cropping up is totally enjoyable. This story takes place about 10 or 15 years from now, and is based pretty much on today's space program capibilities.  I didn't hit a single spot in the story thinking, &#34;No way!&#34; or &#34;Too convenient&#34;. And the humor is great! This is a must read for anyone who enjoys Science Fiction, Space Travel, Survival, or MacGiver DIY situations. I gave it a 10 out of 10 rating on my own scale.
B0039TD826|5.0|Exile on Main Street is a great album.  But as a huge fan of the Rolling Stones, it ranks no better than the fifth best of their albums.  I have listened to every one of these albums hundreds of times.  It would be hard to explain why I think this conclusion is so easily supported, so instead I have simply listed the songs on each album.  Go listen to them!  Here are my favorite Rolling Stones albums ranked from best on down, including my favorite songs on each:  1. Sticky Fingers:  Brown Sugar; Wild Horses; Can't You Hear Me Knocking; Bitch; Dead Flowers; Moonlight Mile; You Gotta Move.  Not one filler song. 2. Let It Bleed:  Gimme Shelter; Love in Vain; Country Honk; Let It Bleed; Midnight Rambler; You Can't Always Get What You Want. 3. Some Girls: Beast of Burden; Far Away Eyes; Before They Make Me Run; Miss You; Imagination; Some Girls. 4. Beggars Banquet:  Sympathy for the Devil; No Expectations; Street Fighting Man; Factory Girl. 5. Exile on Main Street: Tumbling Dice; Sweet Virginia; Happy; All Down the Line.  A double album with an album's worth of filler that is good but not great rock and roll.  And all of this praise for Exile as the best album ever by the Rolling Stones?  Crazy talk.  Not even close.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Its ok if it would start at the checkpoint you ended at instead of starting over. Everything else is ok just a great game to play it is challenging game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love puzzle games &amp; this one is cool<br />Hope you try this one it will keep you thinking lots of fun!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|What makes us human?  How do we develop our identity?  What are memories? These questions and much more are dealt within Karen Joy Fowler's amazing novel.  It's both a coming of age story and a story of a young woman finding and reclaiming who she really is.  I can't give more details without giving away the most important part of the book and what makes it so interesting.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone who wants to understand the fullness of being and the sorrow of loss.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I have seen almost every movie about Zombies, but to read about them made it an even more interesting trip. Max Brooks interpretation of the end of the world is a trip through hell, entertaining till the last page.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|When will Season 3 become available?  I know it's done on HBO.  Can we get it up on Amazon soon please?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|absolutely amazing love this game to death would play it all day everyday if had more levels... please make more ..
B003L77GG0|5.0|My daughter had me order this item for her boyfriend, who is now her husband, for their 2nd year together anniversary...apparently he loved the gifts she chose for him...they were married soon afterwards.  Vendor sent item quickly.  Would definately recommend them to others, and use them again on future orders.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game because it make you think in different ways and its challenging. Also its entertaining and fun. But you cant think too hard about it. It's simple if you really thibk about it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I'm only 10 ,and I share a bed with my little sister so it's hard for me to go to sleep. I downloaded this app,and it was wonderful! Me AND my sister were fast asleep! I highly recommend this app to anyone who is having trouble sleeping.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|The Best Relaxing, Melodies when my thoughts are constantly moving fast in my Head. Great Job.Guys... cant wait to see future updates...
B008X9Z37A|1.0|I was expecting it to be better. It does not have auto sleep or auto awake. The case does not even hold in the kindle fire case
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris was an amazing man and one of America's heroes.  A great man and a horrible loss.  Prayers to the Kyle family.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|He presented everything in a clear and concise manner. It was very easy to understand and that is what I did.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|This cpu is a great purchase works with all games 3d and the more heavy games like crysis 3, tomb raider, darksiders and more.
159463176X|5.0|We all knew that Khaled Hosseini would be able to write a great novel again , he already surprised the world twice with his first two novels ! Yet , Mountains Echoed embodies the same style of Hosseini but represented in new amazing approach ! He takes the readers back & forth through the past 6 decades to live the past & future of his characters , which seems like a new approach to me.<br /><br />The end result is having all his characters becoming 'real' & 'share' not only our lives.. but also our tears.<br /><br />A great novel
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Not at all what I expected and I'm not sure what I expected but it wasn't what I got!  The novel started out &#34;normal&#34; but then turned into somewhat of a fantasy, horror, sci fi type of thing where the author leaves you hanging for the next book.  Except for the ending, I actually liked the novel, but this reader does not do sequels.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is a great series to watch!  I absolutely cannot wait until I am able to see the next season.  This show makes me remember what it is like to have good shows to watch that have great writing and are not the next &#34;best&#34; reality show.  This show is one of those ones that will make you very glad that you have access to one episode right after the other because you won't be able to stand to wait to see what happens next!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I liked the movie and it was delivered on time (early actually). I've already watched it several times and I'm sure I'll watch it again in the future.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|i'm a Jane Austen fan. I love to read the books and the movies help to make the book come alive.
B005S9EK1S|3.0|We watch the movie and to me its okay. Zac Efron is a great actor he should be awarded an OSCAR.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|i'm a Jane Austen fan. I love to read the books and the movies help to make the book come alive.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I must have watched this movie 5 times and its really a great movie. Tim and Morgan should be awarded an OSCAR for doing such a great job.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very entertaining. Keep you wondering what going to happen next. Once I started reading Book One I could not wait until I received Book two. Can't wait until I get to the last book. I am really in suspense now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play this with my little cousins and i play all the time since i dont have a horse and i LUV horses i play this game
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I have not finished reading, I will write a review when I have completed reading all three bok.  However, Book two still have my wondering
B009NY43NY|1.0|I did not like how the series has ended at all.... No spoilers here, still this ending was horrible....Hope True Blood does not follow the books entirely...
B0091REZMW|4.0|love the game and graphics. the energy is used up too fast n diamonds go fast. it takes a bit of getting used to so you don't deplete everything and then be stuck to have buy stuff or wait for time to pass to play again.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Its a wonderful flash for the price. I take exelent picture with my flash. I really recommend this flash. Reevies after 2 years of buying it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A very fun and challenging game that makes you think. I recommend it to help you challenge your brain and solve fun puzzles!
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|I love the Eagles music...this DVD is defective around the 53 minute mark for about two minutes...you can't see the video...picture is distorted...that's the only problem with it. Your service was excellent and delivered on time.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This charger will charge any USB device.  We charge an iPad, cell phones, 7&#34; tablets, and MiFi hotspots.  All charge just as fast as the wall chargers they came with.  My wife's car has constant power to the outlet we are using, so having no LEDs or lights allows us to keep it plugged in all the time and not worry about draining the car battery.  Great Product.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|A few month ago this app was upgraded. The icon changed to ugly and I don't like the graphics in general. Not such a big deal. The big deal is that I can not have two alarms go off a few minutes apart anymore. This is a must for me to wake up in case I accidently shut one off and go back to sleep. I really hate this. It used to be such a nice app, I even got the paid version.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Really enjoyed this! I would recommend to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. Love learning something while being entertained at the same time! Loved it!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman never fails.  Great words, great flow, knowledge beyond what you expect every time.  What's next?  I'm sure there's something of his I have forgotten......
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Ok.  Makes you think.  Wish it was a little more challenging. I'd like to see a more complex puzzle.  However, it was enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really cute and addictive, my daughter and I had fun playing it together. It was challenging enough to keep our interest without being so challenging you wouldn't want to finish without throwing the game across the room. :)
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|Its for sure not what I was thinking!! It is really quite difficult to style the persons hair!! You might find more interest in a paid hair style app!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not much of a reader, but you can just visualize being there.  Pretty intense and interesting on how things are planned out and followed through on.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I've loved every one of Nickolas Sparks books and his movies, and this is one of the best that I've seen
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Took me awhile to get it to download to my Samsung galaxy 5 but got it and works great so far.<br /><br />One of my favorites games glad it was finally available for my tablet.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|We read this book on a multi-state journey and could barely stop reading as we reached a restaurant or a hotel for the night. The story of Adam Brown the man, the addict, the Seal, the warrior, the hero, was one of the best most touchingly honest books we have ever read. We felt as if we had known Adam, wished dearly that we had known him, grateful for his life and service for us and our country. Never can I recall weeping so many times, while still feeling so proud of the man who was Adam Brown. This book will long remain a part of our minds and hearts. Thank you for telling a story that needed to be told. We will continue to pray for Adam's family as well as all of the Seals who lost their lives so that we many enjoy ours. God bless and be with these warriors and their families.
B005SAP45I|1.0|Cars was an excellent movie.  We watch it with our son farrrr too often.  My wife and I laugh and sometimes cry with the sad songs. It has a great moral redemption story.<br /><br />We watched Cars 2 once and vowed never to play it again.<br /><br />Lighting is downright mean to Tow Mater in Cars 2. He is so consistently cruel that when I'm explaining it to my 2 yr old I have to tell him that Lightning is being mean, Lightning is being \\"not nice\\", Lightning is hurt Mater's feelings, Lightning...<br /><br />I realized I was repeating this so often that these characters were not ones I wanted him to watch OR emulate.<br /><br />Stick to Cars (1).
B009JBZH54|5.0|We've watched the serious numerous times and it never gets old.  Hoping for a new movie that was eluded to with Robin Blake!
B004XWLIJS|2.0|AS much as I like action, this one didn't do it for me<br />Seemed to be violence for the sake of it - a bit like the old Charles Bronson Death Wish series<br />Not enough hardware<br />I felt the show took itself too seriously
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I like this game due to it's just like Super Mario Brothers.And it takes me back to the days when the game first came out
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is very well designed and my 3 year old is very attentive to the horse and he loves it, so it's a plus for me.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Used it in the hotel and it was better than having a wake up call! I love that it has adjustable brightness and built in weather guide.
0345803485|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  Fifty shades of grey is the most depth-less book I've ever read that literally has no point or story line.  I'd heard from many people that this was a great book, so while reading the first book (the only book in this series that I read) I kept pushing on through the nonsense thinking that eventually a story line would appear.  Nope. If you like reading about women having sex with womanizing douche bags, than this is your book.
B00CFA227C|5.0|This movie was so action packed. I loved it. It was a different twist on a classic tale. Great scenery. Some scenery had similarities to  Avatar.
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|This application works perfectly with my Kindle Fire HD! I just don't know how to delete a photo/video one here. Can someone please help me with this thing!!!
B005LAIII0|5.0|The story was a bit strange, but the special effects were outstanding.  Certainly worthwhile seeing this movie.  Price was right for both the Blu-ray and DVD.
B005HED08I|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid! It's fun to watch now as an adult and see the cheesy sets and alien costumes! It's great to watch the on my Kindle (AMAZON PRIME ROCKS!)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game and found that my 11 year old grandson does, as well. It was fun distraction for me while it proved useful with him in sharpening him skills of observation and problem solving. Just wish it had more levels!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works Great, has all the things you need to keep track of bussiness when on the road or at home and not wanting to be on laptop or computer
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|I purchased the ghoulia and cleo classroom tow pack for my five year old who is a huge mh fan  this set is so cute and well made I ordered it through amazon for under thirty dollars and got free shipping which you can not beat with how high gas prices are I use amazon on a regular bases and love them thanks again for another great deal amazon
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works Great, has all the things you need to keep track of bussiness when on the road or at home and not wanting to be on laptop or computer
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I love this movie- the shipping speed was great and the product was in the shape I expected...perfect! Cant wait to watch it again!
B002WY65VU|5.0|it is zombies, Woody Harrelson, and if you follow along, the &#34;rules of Zombieland&#34; make this yet another modern version that Romero should be proud of.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have watched this movie about 6 times so far! It was in great shape and I really loved the story line...
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I found the characters in this story very likable and easy to imagine.  I couldn't put it down; I was in a hurry to see if there would be a happy ending for the main character.  I have made the word 'wee' part of my vocabulary as a result!
0425252868|5.0|I bought it for my husband for his 80th birthday and he loved it. He's contributing it to our new local Veteran's Museum in Wickliffe KY after other family members and I have read it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|A great way to pass the time for me and the kids! Love being able to take it along with us everywhere
B002NN5F7A|5.0|Some of the best actors ever are brought together in a gripping depiction of high pressure in the real estate business. This is a movie you watch because of the sheer quality of the acting, and rarely will you see a lineup like this in a single picture. Careful, the language is raw, but realistically so.
B002APU580|5.0|Great movie! Also purchased others in the same category as this one. Definitely one to watch over and over again
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|This is a fantastic read from beginning to end. Love Jeffrey Archers work and he once again did not disappoint. Would definitely recommend, but you need to read the books in order.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was a real eye opener.  Well written.  I will read again.  Highly recommend this to High School Lit. classes.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Jeffrey Archer rarely lets us down - this one is no exception. Well written and keeps you wanting to turn the pages. You need to read these books in order to understand the story line. Would definitely recommend to read as a series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My daughter borrowed my Nook (whoops, is that ok?). It had the Hunger Games Trilogy on it. She never gave it back to me.  Had to have it on my Kindle.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a good read, kept you wanting to know what happens next. A good story line and the historical side of things kept me entertained.Would recommend.
0307472590|5.0|Tenia tiempo sin leer una novela. Una amiga me recomend&oacute; este libro y me ha gustado mucho. La historia te lleva a querer seguir leyendo y no dejar el libro.  Es muy entretenido y tiene buena trama.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Was a good book, but a little technical as far as the medical part goes. That part went on to long but all and all a good book.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I LOVED the selection. Hands down. So I of course eagerly awaited its sequel, the Elite. It did a really good job, and it was a good storyline. I can't wait to see how everything is resolved in the finale. I liked how the Elite deepend the plot a little and gave more shades and dimensions to the characters. I love this series and think its brilliant! Go Maxon!!!!!
B008XBCJ34|3.0|I mainly bought this Blu-Ray because I wanted to see how the Samsung TV  handled 3D - it was OK, not spectacular, but you could see depth in the 3D.  Later I bought &#34;Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey&#34;  and this one had &#34;eye-popping&#34; 3D.  The movie was sorta Ho-hum but the 3D was great.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I am a working woman.  This is nothing I didn't know before - or haven't experienced before.  I was not inspired to do anything differently.  Happy for her success.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This is the same as toca hair salon 2 except cheaper I differently recommend this app. =-) please get this app
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Seriously it is Amazing. WHY IS THERE NOT A Sequel to this or some OTHER scary games(Amnesia:Dark Descend, Slendytubbies,all the other Spider-Man games).WE NEED MORE GAMES LIKE THIS!
B0064W652A|5.0|The beginning of hush...All the classic villains and the heroes of batman 's life come together in this story that spands many tragedies that have affected his life. Unbelievable story and loved every minute  of it. Recommended for anyone.....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awsome!I love it!The graphics are cool because the real!This is a really nice game!I hope others like it too!!!=D
1490313370|5.0|There are so many practical ideas that can improve your life in this book.  They are easy to try and make a difference in your happiness and success.<br /><br />For example...<br />1. Thinking of 10 people you are grateful for - makes you happier by realizing that no matter how bad things are, you have a lot to be happy about<br />2. Making lists of 10 new ideas every day - trains your brain to see more opportunities<br /><br />Plus James is a funny and entertaining writer.  The book is a breeze to read.
B009RWRIKM|5.0|This is really a treasure. Not only for dancers or those who love Wim Wenders art, but for every person that enjoys the extraordinary encounter between music, dance, cinema and, somehow, poetry.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Even with the changes and the triple split of the movie into three, I can't bring myself to hate anything based on Tolkien. More movies means more Middle Earth nerdiness for me. :P
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Imagine my surprise (and delight) when last weekend for Father's Day my son presented this gift box to me as a Father's Day present. He knows I am a movie buff, but I certainly did not expect him to spend his hard-earned money on such a lavish gift (thanks Rick!). I literally had not seen this movie in several decades, and couldn't wait to see it again and check out the bonus materials.<br /><br />\\"Lawrence of Arabia (50th Anniversary Collector's Edition)\\" (3 Blue-ray discs, 1 CD, 1 book) presents the movie in all of its former visual glory, and then some. What a delight it was to see this again. The richness of the colors on this Blue-ray edition are nothing short of stunning, making this movie now eye-candy from start to finish. The movie certainly does not feel it is now 50 years old. Couldn't help but think as I was watching it whether it would uberhaupt be possible for a movie like taht to be made today, if nothing else because of cost considerations. As to the 2 discs with  bonus materials, let me just make a couple of comments on Disc 3, which is exclusive to this collectors box: there is a nice feature (\\"Lawrence At 50: A Classic Restored\\") from Sony on how they restored this movie via 4K restoration. The comments from Martin Scorsese are, as always, enjoyable and insighful. There is a great 1963 feature called \\"Wind, Sand and Star\\", with footage from the set focusing primarily on Peter O'Toole. But the cherry on the cake is a fatastic 90 min. documetary from 2000 called \\"In Love With the Desert\\", in which Eddie Fowler, the original outdoor set designer, takes us back to the locations where the movie was shot in Jordan, Spain and Morocco, 40 years later. It makes me want to visit Seville in Spain badly!<br /><br />The CD (16 tracks; 42 min.) brings the epic soundtrack to the movie, and is a very nice item to have (I have been playing this in my car this past week). Last but not least, there is a coffee table book as well, which again is heavy on the visuals. In all, I cannot even begin to express how utterly  and completely pleased I am with this 50th anniversary collector's box edition of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". And that I got this as a Father's Day gift, makes this even more special for me. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!In all, I cannot even begin to express how utterly  and completely pleased I am with this 50th anniversary collector's box edition of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". And that I got this as a Father's Day gift, makes this even more special for me. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I don't have JOB but was so interested in this when I first heard it was coming. Love Sean Bean. So I decided to read the books. I heard the show is pretty true to them. Just finished the first oneand all I can say is AWESOME!  I cannot wait to read the next one.
0307476073|5.0|Not only is this a story of an astounding saga of a woman on a quest of self-discovery it is amazingly well written and a true page turner. The reflections alone are worth the read, but by the end of the story one begins to contemplate a similar journey, even at my age-63!<br />Twenty years ago my husband and three friends hiked the Long Trail which runs up the spine of the Green Mountains of Vermont from the Massachusetts border to Canada. This summer as we gathered to plan next year's 20th Anniversary of their hike I gave each of them a copy of Wild. They have read it and recommended it to all of their friends as well. It's just a great book.
B00756GRUE|4.0|The Seiko Solar Dive Chronograph watch is a sporty and functional watch.  The size is not too big and the weight is manageable.  For it being solar, there is no need to replace batteries.  I am aware that the battery is proprietary so when it goes, just replace the watch.<br /><br />There are two things that prevented me from giving the watch five-stars.  First, which is more of a &#34;want&#34; is that the 24-hour dial should be a 1/10 counter instead for the watch to be a true chronograph.  Second, what's the deal with the wet suit bracelet extension?  IT HARD TO UNCLASP! It's also not mentioned on the users guide and I bent the bracelet following online instructions.  If they plan to improve on the watch, they should redesign the extension mechanism.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Won't add to the detailed reviews listed here, except to say you should consider springing for the 3-CD set, which includes the concert at San Franciso's Cow Palace. McCartney's vocals and piano playing are special, and he always adds something unique to every concert, providing you with that almost gut-wrenching range of vocal innovations when he gets truly emotional, such as with \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\"
0743270754|5.0|It's like John Grisham mixed with (fill in favorite historical writer).  Reads like a novel, not the hulking textbook it looks like.  Goodwin's approach of examining the lives and attitudes of Lincoln's cabinet members and rivals is refreshing and makes the book deeper, as it explores the differing philosophies and passions of these great men and further embellishes Lincoln's legend as these men follow Lincoln into a Civil War and would have followed him into Reconstruction and beyond.<br /><br />Great book...glad I added this to my library.
B00D1HC8VS|5.0|The 3-CD set, which includes the concert at San Franciso's Cow Palace, is an essential collection of the Wings Over America tour. McCartney's vocals and piano playing are special, and he always adds something unique to every concert, providing you with that almost gut-wrenching range of vocal innovations when he gets truly emotional, such as with \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\" The Cow Palace addition is well worth the few extra bucks. Got the shivers listening to all this great music again, filled with all the raw emotion that used to be the reason we all went to concerts. Treat yourself.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This is the first movie we watched from Amazon Prime.  It loaded well and was a cute movie.  The kids liked it.
B00C9U9YOW|2.0|...Like Clockwork is in no way a 5-star album (that would be their first, self-titled album). This album is weak and uninteresting. It's really fair at best. I can't believe I waited six years for this.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I didn't watch this at the movies or when released to dvd, I only watched it a couple of monts ago and fell in love, can't wait for the sequel ( if I'm still breating that is, not getting younger over here MR Cameron!!! )
1609613937|5.0|Wonderful book! It takes a deep look into diet and nutrition with the western downfalls and lack of quality health. Most of this book is information on western diet, a portion is of his diet and how to get started and the back of the book is filled with recipes from dinners to making dairy free mayo and sour cream. I would recomend this book to everyone especially those with children.
B00B70MMG2|5.0|No action or killings, very slow at times.....then why can I not stop watching?! Seriously this is the best show I've watched in many years. Rivaling 24, Lost, GOT, and some other legendary ones. You gotta watch
B001LF347E|5.0|I cannot tell you how much I adore this series! When you watch it at first, it is a little cheesy I'll admit, but then you're caught up in the story! From the beginning they are able to draw you in and make you care about these characters from the start. Filled with relative newcomers, only major recognizable face would be John Hurt and you don't see his face! He supplies only his voice, but with John Hurt narrating this tale, it starts off great and just keeps getting better. Just go ahead and buy this. You'll love it.
B002C6K7NA|5.0|These guys speak for their selves.  Great music, great lyrics.  Have had the pleasure of seeing them in person and boy can they rock the house.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Seems like nowdays people call anything good music, I listen to all types because I am a musician and have to be open minded to all styles.<br />But please, if people call this good music, don't know what they are talking about, I don't care about lyrics and I don't get offended about them; I care about the music that is what make a song good.<br />Where are the good beats that make people move, if you care about this then you should listen to METAL MACHINE MUSIC BY LOU REED (the fourth side is the best).
B0000C23DO|5.0|Great album.  I recommend it to everyone.  They are a great band and though I haven't seen them in person, I would jump at the chance to do so.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I thought that this app would be awesome because I looked at the ratings but every time I open it it keeps exiting out and saying &quot;Please re download app&quot; and doesn't let me play!!
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|This is one of my favorite bands of all.  I have seen them every time the have been in Austin.  Great band, great guys. no one plays better music!!!
B000FC0O7M|5.0|Well written and with an egoless positive attitude Gene shows us how Mission Control made our space program successful. Awesome! Definitely a must read to balance out your knowledge of the early space program which is likely mostly based on the astronaut's point of view. No doubt, the astronauts had their \\"pink skin\\" on the line and made a huge and the most visible contribution to the success of the program but Gene exposes the incredible dedication, sacrifices and contributions Mission Control employees made not exposed well elsewhere that made the program successful and saved the lives of the astronauts many times. READ IT!!!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|These guys couldn't make a bad album no matter how much they tried.  They are my all time favorite band and to top it off, they are from TEXAS!!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|A good movie.  It seemed like the commercials were comparing it to Contagion (the same film maker's), but it was different.  Down side - not a lot of Channing Tatum.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun and makes you think. Wish there was more levels though. I have made it through them all. So ready for more!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In the game you have fun challenges every day  and you can pick different characters and the theme changes about every month and I would say GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very addicting!!(: This game is also very fun!!(: If you run out of money like I did you go to date &amp; time setting and change the date a day ahead like if today is the 25 you'd changes it to the 26th..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wow. I have not had this much fun with a room escape in a long time. It was logical and fun without being too goofy or impossible. Really looking forward to more floors being added!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Amazing movie with a great plot.  Many twists and turns throughout the entire film.  Joyous and heart-wrenching.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The degree to which I like the product in immaterial. The kindle battery was defective, as I has suspected. The device doesn't work anymore. I replaced it with an IPad.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|Smiled once through entire movie.  Simply wasn't funny.  Was a bad Saturday Night Live skit that just wouldn't end.  Don't waste your time.
B001EC2IT4|1.0|I love the movie, but TV cropped version sucks.<br />It is only slightly better than not watching movie at all.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|My wife and I enjoy anything zombie, and this was a great combo of funny and scifi.  Not in a cheesy way, but a clever way.  Some very cool original zombie concepts and a good storyline.
B000WFBC6E|1.0|I purchased this clock and it arrived with the red needle broken. i returned it and 2 months later still  have not got a refund.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Fuzzy resolution, much like my copy for the nintendo DS. But I love the game too much to not have it on my S4. Just hope they will update that at some point.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun and addicting some levels are hard but that just makes it fun over awesome and really really cool by.
B00BJS7104|3.0|A lot of twist and turns. Stayed awake the entire movie. Story line a little far out there for me. Not sure I'd watch it again.
B00499LTLM|5.0|Very good show. Amazing update bringing Sherlock into the 21st century.  Love love love Benedict cumberbatch would watch him in anything but this is a great show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better, so happy its available to prime members now. A must see from the BBC.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best! The graphics are just unbelievable . It is definitely worth the money! I give it five stars.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|There was so much hype for this book that I expected it to be a transcendent experience.  I was a bit let down, but that said, the book still was a very good read and would recommend it to most people.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|A fun enjoyable game but the same as all other building games, you need to spend money to get farther in the game. I'm already getting frustrated with how slow I'm progressing.... like all other games I'll probably uninstall soon.
B008CB9JJ2|3.0|A stream of conciousness. Sentences structured like we have thoughts, often connected and apparently unconnected. The myriad events, meaningful and meaningless that we all experience. The author could have been describing my life, and has a nice way of juxtaposing things. Would not re-read this book, but enjoyed it at a level of just absorbing without thinking about it too deeply.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Weather components offer variety and I find them accurate. My favorite part, though, is the eager little line that tells me &quot;This is a perfect time for outdoor fitness&quot; or &quot;This is a poor time for outdoor fitness. It's raining.&quot;  Or my most favorite: &quot;It's hotter/colder than you'd like.&quot;  Amazing what my Kindle knows about me!  And the best part? Even if the time is perfect for outdoor fitness, I can stay inside and read a book and not feel TOTALLY guilted 'cause the app is so darned pleasant about it and not naggy!
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|Lots to do for my two year old girl.  She loves it as she does all of the Dr. Panda apps.  I also love it, but it could be more educational (like Dr. Panda Teach Me).  Definitely worth the money!  Thanks!
B000AM2L1O|4.0|my 1 year old loves this doll. the perfect size great gift  very lifelike and soft and pliable.  she enjoys it
B004ATSTLY|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. However, every song isn't a complete package. The live introductions of one song might be at the end of the previous song. Still, it's really a fun album and has a unique Lizzy Hale flair to it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|There is no stopping when you have started. I have to get extension cord so I can keep playing and charge get low.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting game. Some of the floors were aggravating but it was a fun game. Can not wait for an update.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game is so good ..you need patience ..that  ..why I like my dragon ...game like that we need more
B00B7VZN76|5.0|best show ever great cast the acting is great resistance is futile whoopi goldberg is funny so is brent spiner must buy it you'll love it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The casting couldn't be better.  Great story telling by the writers.  Love the setting and wardrobe is amazing.  Can't wait for Season 4 to start!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|This &#34;LIVE&#34; Beach Boys is amazing.... Even with the loss of key band mates, Brian still can make it happen!<br />If you like any Beach Boy's Songs. It's here live!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|AWESOME game! Please don't remove the gem glitch when you recover your account! I'm Farmer Wonton it is is is is AWESOME
B00B29J0I6|4.0|This is another physics-based fun game. Very challenging. Doesn't have the wow factor of Angry Birds games, but still lots of fun.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I travel a lot and listen to audiobooks weekly.  I bought this one and wished it had a rated \\"R\\" label on it so I would have known not to waste my money.  I got through the first few chapters and the nasty language got worse, so I never finished it.  I rarely stop listening to an audio book because I want to get my money's worth but this book was one of the worst ones I've heard.  I don't even want to give it or sell it to anyone else because of the horrible language.  They should have ratings for audiobooks like they do music.  I never would have wasted my money on this book had I known how bad the cursing was....so buyer beware.
1250039037|5.0|Great book! I will be buying the next one, too! Archer is a great story teller. We can't wait for it.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|this  is the best version of the classical story...highly reccomend it!<br />A great show for kids and adults to enjoy together
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am in my early 40's, mom of a toddler, and a certified couch potato. I could say I don't have the time to work out an hour a day, but more truthfully, I don't have the will or interest. I would have never believed you could work out for 20 min/day and have it actually make a difference. BUT THIS DOES! I have done this video 9 of 11 days and I see a huge improvement in my stamina and I swear I can see my legs toning up already! Make no mistake, this video is HARD. Like, discouragingly hard. But do it for a week -- however you have to get through it-- and you will see improvement quickly. And this is coming from someone who is 15 lbs overweight and NOT in to exercise!!! Jillian will instruct you to keep moving, no rests, etc., but if you can't do it, just do your best! The first few days I had to stop occasionally (or even drop my hand weights at times), but I'm now doing the whole video. 20 minutes (of brutality), then it's done! If I can see a difference in a week I can only imagine how happy I'll be in a month or two!
B00969GFFU|1.0|I don't know if you should take my review into consideration because I couldn't finish this book, but the first couple of chapters were a real struggle...It's a very tedious and boring read.
B0095EMOTM|5.0|David Guetta's album puts a unique spin on how music is being promoted by DJ's all over. Get it while you can
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The story takes you in  and captivates you .you start to feel for the young male  Character  starting his world wind adventure
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|It took a couple of plays through, but I'm really enjoying this album.  I bought the deluxe edition so I could get all 11 songs and am not disappointed.  There's a couple of throw-away songs, but you get that on every album regardless of the artist.  Ozzy has lost some range and power - you won't hear any \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" or \\"Dirty Women\\" type vocals on this. But for a 65 year old dude, he does just fine. Iommi and Butler are flat-out terrific and haven't missed a beat.  Bummer that Bill Ward isn't on the album - Wik does a decent fill-in job, but Ward had that unique style that really helped make Sabbath what they are.<br /><br />All in all, if you're a Sabbath or metal fan - this is definitely worth the price of admission, and sure glad to see the boys are back!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's easy fun to play I love  this game and it was free I will keep playing this game it never gets old
B0085YOD1A|2.0|Pretty graphics but really not very accurate or of much practical use. I would not pay even 99 cents for it. I only tried it because it was free.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|A must own. Funny from start to finish, great songs, killer cast (with Steve Martin at his best) and all along side a man-eating plant Audrey II.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was looking forward to reading this book after hearing the buzz in the office by co-workers who read it. I've read others by this author and was impressed by her writing skills. She didn't disappoint in that area for Gone Girl, however after a few chapters I found I was not liking my protagonists as much as I would have hoped. Then I was siding more with the husband. I don't want to get into detail as I don't want to spoil things for other readers, but I also didn't like the ending nor did I enjoy the unreliable narrator device as it left me feeling I was being played. I found peripheral characters likable, sympathetic, more interesting. Flaws and all. Gillian Flynn is an extremely talented writer and I will look for more of her books, but I needed a lot more 'what goes around, comes around' in this one and it wasn't to be had. (sigh)
0062086529|5.0|ordered this a gift for my husband on his &#34;first&#34; Father's Day - baby coming in Aug. It's talked about in the movie &#34;The Story of Us&#34; and it's sort of an inside thing to us. Anyway - great book, great gift.
B00C9U9YOW|3.0|Summary: This is not like other Qotsa albums. It is not like any of them. That does not make this a bad album.  It does not make it a good one, either.<br />Considering the greatness of all the prior QOTSA albums, and how stunning Them Crooked Vultures was, and a six-year wait, there was no way this album could live up to my expectations. I listened to this album many times before writing this review. I tried to be fair. This album has four and half songs that are a masterpiece, three that are okay, and two that are terrible.<br /><br />The guest spots should be done away with and not considered in evaluating the album, as they add nothing. Watching these songs performed live, it is clear that not much was added but the names of the also-rans. Big, shiny names.<br /><br />The album was promoted with a fifteen minute video at likeclockwork.tv. It appeared we had the next Pink Floyd's ''The Wall'' on our hands. Like 'The Wall', the good songs are good, great even. But the turkeys... will make you wince like Roger Waters' vocals in 'One of My Turns'.  The promo painted a picture of an album that was going to be very similar in structure: dark, brooding, menacing; the art work was amazing and seemed to match the music.  There was great promise. I expected a masterpiece. We were left with Mona Lisa wearing a clown nose and a rainbow wig.<br /><br />Could there be a better album opener than 'Keep Your Eyes Peeled'? Lumbering, lurching, threatening from out of the gate. One of my favorites on the album.<br /><br />'I Sat By the Ocean' follows. Not a bad song, but feels like a B-side of another album, or simply, a leftover from another project, be it TCV or another. Has old school flavor. The robots are here.<br /><br />'The Vampyre...' starts with J-Ho's squawky vocals we will later hear on the title track. Even after trying to like this song, it will wear out the 'skip' button. This is the slow jam of the album.  To go to the trouble of hiding Mark Lanegan somewhere in the mix on this album, his voice would have fit far better here.<br /><br />'If I Had a Tail' is another piece of the picture painted by the album's promo, and a good fit. Great music and the vocals fit well. A stand-out track. Punishing bass and aggressive vocals.<br /><br />'My God is the Sun' is Queens of old; this song rocks. Doesn't have that dark undertone; this one enters and exits with a crash.<br /><br />'Kalopsia' really does remind me of 'One of My Turns' by Pink Floyd. Soft, gentle, and then ! This song is cuddly like a furry mouse trap. I like this one.<br /><br />'Fairweather Friends' is the big red nose on the Mona Lisa. This song certainly must be a joke, but the punch line is never made clear. It seems to contain the riffing and over production of a tune you'd hear in a rock opera. Can't get in to this one.<br /><br />'Smooth Sailing'. Sounds like 'Skin on Skin' from QOTSA's LTP and 'No One Loves Me...' from TCV fooled around and nine months later this popped out. Swaggering bravado, as funky as QOTSA can get. A decent tune that is on this album. For some reason.<br /><br />'I Appear Missing' is a good 2 to 3 minute song. Problem is, it is actually five minutes long. I really enjoy the first half of this song; unlike anything else on the album, and hard to describe. We are left to deal with Homme's falsetto in the closing, and it makes this track feel like overeating-- it was great at the beginning but at the end was only heartburn.<br /><br />'Like Clockwork' is, without a doubt, the clown wig. ''Everyone it see-ee-eems'' squawks Mr. Homme. On the first listen, I gave the vocals a pass because I was sure there was a story to tell. It was going to be a Bob Dylan ballad; terrible vocals but great song writing. Alas, this rocket burns up on the launch pad. I'd rather listen to 'Shepard's Pie' from Desert Sessions Vol 9-10. I don't like saying this because I'm sure Mr. Homme is pouring his heart out in the song but it is just too cryptic to for me to understand and to draw me in. Lanegan's gravel-filled vocals could have delivered here, perhaps.<br /><br />Rank Queens of the Stone Age albums however you like, most fans will disagree. But one thing has been constant: the albums are solid and the songs fit together. This album doesn't do that and it is a bit of a put off. As a QOTSA fan one expects 'different' on every album, but not from track to track. This one seems like a mish-mash. QOTSA doesn't make concept albums but they are consistent, and it is that missing consistency that leaves a listener feeling let down by this release. In short, good, but not great. After a long hiatus from the Queens banner, I expected more. But maybe Axl Rose can be a guest on the next album.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app all the time. I just had my wedding and this app kept me informed the whole time. The 14 day forecast came in very handy
0525952926|5.0|I thought I was buying a paperback!  Book arrived quickly and in perfect condition!  VERY happy!  This is the second book in Follett's trilogy - amazing story!  I am learning a lot of history through a wonderful novel:  action, romance and fantastic story telling.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is a must-have for all kids itching to read a book about hilarious incidents and drama with funny packed in the corners. This book is great!
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|What a good movie this was.  Channing Tatum is such a good actor, and played a good part in it, as well as the other actors.  The story had many twists and turns in it and keeps you guessing as to the outcome.  It sure kept me on the edge of my seat.  I will watch it again.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|A kind of comedy for me. Depp can sing!  Love him in this roll.  I don't believe another actor could have pulled this one off.  It must be his love of &#34;eyeliner&#34;.  Anyway, if you like true fiction that ends in an irony, this will entertain you immensely.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I really don't understand how to use it.Could you send ne instructions.It looks like a fun game to play<br />for me.
B00870ZH3U|3.0|Of course Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is magical, but if you've seen the movie \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\" made in 2004, you just cannot love this movie.  Once you've seen and heard Gerard Butler (Phantom), Emmy Rossum (Christine) and Patrick Wilson (Raul), nobody else who plays these roles will do.  I enjoyed the story line but I couldn't help but feel something wonderful was missing and that was the three actors I mentioned.  Since the 2004 movie, I've followed these 3 actors career's and find Gerard Butler just becomes sexier and sexier.  I'm afraid I'm one of his groupies.  And I've found Patrick Wilson in many movies (not musicals) and he is quite a hottie too.<br /><br />I may have my priorities wrong, but these two (mostly Gerard) can visit me anytime.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|It's been a long time since I read any Agatha Christie stories--and I'm not sure why.  When I was young, Agatha Christie's books are what really got me to enjoy reading and plotting.  I'd never read this book before, but it's here where I restarted--and I'm very glad I did.  It was tough (at least for me) to figure out who the killer was--but it all makes sense once you're logical and let your \\"little gray cells\\" work!  I forgot how much fun these books of hers are!  I have now remembered why I hold the author in such high regard.  I'm going to now read a bunch of them again and try to encourage my teenage daughter to read some with me.  I think she'll find that they're enjoyable....they're such fast and compelling--and entertaining--reads.  And maybe she'll find the fun in reading more, too!
B008Y1YK0I|4.0|The Video in this transfer is stunning but the sound is hard to adjust its either too loud or if you lower the volume its hard to hear the dialog in quiet passages...I could probably do some settings adjustments in my AV receiver that would compensate for this making it sound better but this is the only Blu Ray movie I have had to do this for....
B008G8SFGO|1.0|This album is weak and Fake Ace's song writing and guitar playing proves it .  They should hang it up. I found no good songs on this CD , not one  and Paul Stanley's voice is now shot and the drumming is below par . Gene Simmons is going through the motions on this. It's time to quit the Vegas act , this isn't even a good tribute band CD.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Kept my interest.  Felt very connected to characters.  Family is important and I could feel their connection and strength to be there for one another.
0307951154|1.0|I belong to a book club, and this was the selection for this month.  Total waste of time!  Extremely hard to follow, what with all the foreign names and poorly developed characters.  The story line takes way too many detours, and it's hard to keep track of who's who.  Take your twelve dollars and buy any other book, and you'll be way ahead.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun quick challenge. Usually don't need to try to find walk through for levels<br />Fun game to play. Enjoy organizing.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Have read Hosseini's other books and liked them. I like this one as well. It skips around a lot, but was easy to follow. I found it to be a feel good book, would recommend it as a good summer read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. The sub text in this boo  speaks louder than the text itself. Highly recommended if you like a love story with twists.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Wonderful story, did not know at first this was a movie about real people, so wasn't expecting the ending that it had.<br />Would highly recommend this movie.
B000U6BT40|5.0|If you like action adventure dramadies like NCIS, enjoy romance, and don't mind some science fiction mixed in, you will love this series!  Even if you are not sure about science fiction, give it a chance-- usually the mysteries are solved by old-fashioned police work.  See the pilot, and you will be hooked!
B008NMT684|5.0|My grandchildren love this app. They play it over and over. We have it on our Kindle Fire and haven't had any problems at all.
B00A81MV3U|1.0|I usually like offbeat movies, but I couldn't find anything likable about this one. The characters were just nothing special to me. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is good, but I saw a few performances that should've beaten her at The Oscars. Too long and dull of a movie!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The grandchildren and I both love this app. Great hours of fun. Very addicting and entertaining. We have it on Kindle Fire and it works great.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This is one of my favorite Percy Jackson books! Your almost done to anyone trying to read the whole series!!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|It, s Fantastic. Great entertainment. The Gran's love it. I have to say I also am a little addicted to Where's My Perry. Have it on Kindle Fire and it works great.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|There are no instructions to tell you what to do it only tells you your objective. DONT GET IT!!! I don know why it got such a huge rating
B000E9910W|5.0|Every song I could want to hear was on it!! Great memories..would definatly recommend to friends; anyone who loves the Doobies should have this CD.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|It's a good game I wish you didnt have to pay money for more characters but great for young kids
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My husband and I had a lot of fun with this and can't wait for the rest of the levels!! :)
B00B29J0I6|4.0|I kinda reminds me of angry birds but the robot falls into the box not flys into the box, get it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love solving puzzles..this is a fun game to help pass the time waiting for appointments or when boredom strikes...really makes you think and search!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|A movie that I am happy to add to my collection.  Good for all ages. I had looked at several stores locally and no one had it.  This worked out perfectly.
B000GM0KEI|5.0|There are so many great things in this book it'd be impossible to list them all.  Suffice to say that it is a comprehensive cooking class!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is a good game I think they need to make it a little easier to get the diamond dragon.
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|This is another great album from Armin. If you like Trance music and Armin Van Buuren, you'll also like this album.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I would recommend this game to everyone. It is really fun to see how far you can get. When you crash, it's really funny cause your driver breaks his neck
B00BB22GSU|5.0|This album was terrific, their up-beat music and scale surfing vocals will leave you awestruck. If you don't have this, you should definitely pick it up along with all of the other albums put out by this band.
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|Burdon doesn't sound like a young man but he does sound invigorated, sometimes singing so passionately he teeters on the edge of self-parody, but that's the appeal of 'Til Your River Runs Dry: Burdon pours everything into this album, as if he realizes this is his last best shot to get the credit he's due. And, against all odds, he succeeds with this tough, flinty, proudly old-fashioned rock & roll album.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this story! It demonstrates that the rich don't live in a bubble. They are not immune to the problems the poor experience and typically handle them in the same way, of course with more resources at hand.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|On Memphis, Boz Scaggs pays tribute to the city's magnificent soul tradition, Al Green, and producer Willie Mitchell and his Royal Recordings studio, whose location and personnel were used to cut it in three days.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was a great continuation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  I couldn't read fast enough.  I wish this author was still alive so I could read more of his books.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|As with all of Sanderson's work I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A perfect summer read this would be great for a relaxing day at the beach. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys any genre. Loved it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I was so sorry to complete this book.  I have now read the entire trilogy and enjoyed it immensely.  I had heard many years ago how good these books were and didn't believe it......BELIEVE IT!!!
