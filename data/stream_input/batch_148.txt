B007KPV0PM|1|Garbage and that's were I put them.
B004GC2TXE|5|Perfect fit
B0040CTTH4|5|This part fit my 1998 Toyota Sienna very well.
B00S4RW1CQ|1|Cheap design.  Adhesive tape not applied properly.
B00XHNBQPK|5|Awesome
B007VYHGK0|5|excellent
B0088RKIY0|5|overall I am happy with my purchase! I use it everyday and it's perfect for warm weather here in California. The only thing I can say is about size. I like slim rider style so I bought S for myself 5'8&#34; and 160 lbs. the chest is about my size but waist is a little tight. However it won't affect my riding so I'm fine with that. If you plan to wear something like sweater inside and you are about my size, it's better to go with size M!
B00144B32A|5|Cleans well
B00ED5OY4G|3|The Giants lettering was faded on both orders.  I did receive them in a timely manner though.
B00MNLV9P4|5|Looks great on my powerstroke
B00W0UY9T6|2|I had originally rated this product higher but changed because within just under a month and the screws are already rusted! I would have tried to return or even replace the screws but as of one day after the 30 day return period I have no way to contact seller
B0002STSQM|5|This is a nice tread depth gauge.  It's good quality, all metal, and the numbers are easy to read.  I used to use a small machinists ruler but this is easier.
B00GLJ5M9S|5|Very nice item. Fast service.
B00M25PMO0|5|broke after 1 week
B0009H51ZS|5|Fits our 2003 Tundra Truck will buy it again.
B002935IV2|5|This worked great!  My rooftop luggage carrier never moved.
B00852684M|1|Cheap not just the price, don't spend your money. I want my 11.00 dollars back. The only item I brought from Amazon I had to give a bad review.
B00Y2ZT4S8|4|Muy bien
B00A2F38NO|5|one of my best purchases of the year.  Helps so much with all the weekend tournements we are at.
B00FZH0EZY|5|arrived on time. Had my mech install - no problems.
B0082365AQ|5|Yes, the wheels smell like a petroleum factory!  Get over it.  Besides that what you get is sturdy kayak/canoe cart that makes transporting your craft from vehicle to water and back a breeze.  I wish I had purchased this cart sooner.  Very happy now.
B00141DAJ2|3|They are ok for the price and will do for the time being.  They were easy to install but I'm not loving the material they are made from.  If I'm being totally honest, the last set I had I purchased from a big box store, were better quality and they cost less.
B011KHEHWS|5|the towel is very big and useful !!<br /><br />My car is very clean !!<br /><br />I'm so happy !!!!
B000WI67ZC|1|Don't understand why but the tested zippers now move harder not more easily. Will keep looking for a zipper lubricant wax stick, like you used to be able to find in sewing supply stores. Those are about extinct, too.
B009Q0Y3HG|5|Simple install that fit perfectly. Item came quickly and it was a great overall experience.
B000EDOSN8|5|as described and perfect fit and easy to install.
B00GT05CO4|5|I bought this kit when my map lights burned out.  For just a few bucks more than LED map lights at another site, here you also get LED trunk light, LED license plate lights and LED reverse lights in addition to the LED map lights.  They're great!  Much brighter and whiter and a good refresh to my 350Z.<br /><br />At first I thought they didn't work but I had them plugged in backwards.  I didn't realize LEDs aren't reverse-able like incandescent lights.  So if yours doesn't seem to work, simply flip it around.<br /><br />Great product.
B002V9A8QE|3|Part I received was not identical to oem.  Two main issues: lacked plastic on backside, and lacked 17mm flat edges so you'd have to install it with a hex driver and open wrench. (August 2015)  Dimensions of the part were almost exactly the same as oem, so it should fit/work just fine, but beware those two issues.  I did not attempt to install mine, and returned it instead.<br /><br />The picture on the website, at the time of this posting, is inaccurate.  I've attached an image.<br /><br />I went with a Lemforder part, which did look the same as oem.<br /><br />Pictured from left to right, Moog(too big, caused axle rub), beck/arnley, oem.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great product.
B00O813DEC|5|Good quality just as described.
B007KPRN2G|5|Easy installation, look great and function as they should!
B004JO9HP2|5|Happy with my carmats. Fit and perform as anticipated.
B004TOB6EW|5|WANTED TO RATE THIS ORDER A 5 STAR.
B001PL7RK4|5|What a stand out!!!!!!!
B00RM26FVC|5|nice
B00G4RY6MQ|5|Color is spot on with the Honda red.
B0077MM1T2|5|Simple, effective design. Riding and golf, I now get to enjoy my two great pleasures!
B00EMKBRMO|5|Husband loves it.  It's wearing well.  We have extreme heat here, so that is saying something.
B001BS9K3I|5|Exact replacement for my application and working wonderfully. Make sure you study up on and test these parts before you replace them. Generally don't go bad but in my case they did.
B00E1SOSK0|5|how can you beat the price
B00KMD3IB8|1|It didn't work.
B006WQSRFQ|4|Direct fit no mods needed. Worked great on my Ford Freestar Van.
B00P9R1TH2|2|These don't really fit that well. Compared to the gray caps for the actual spout, the threads are recessed further back inside the cap so they don't bite properly on the can.
B002803D6I|1|Changed out the lug nuts, the new lug nuts are to big. They are rubbing against the rotors. Not happy, instead of sending back to amazon going to cut them down. Better think twice about putting on your 323ci.
B005Q3KFBA|5|I mounted this in my Polaris ranger instead of running wires for a AUX light above my head. I love it because i can angle it in the cab if needed or quickly push it back to see in the bed.  I've had it in norther Arkansas duck hunting in freezing temperatures and back home here in Louisiana in the hottest days you could imagine and it still works great. I put a set of batteries in it when it arrived and they are still good. I have soaked this light a few times when cleaning and it doesn't phase it.
B00HEAMAFM|5|Thank you!
B005VPS2TU|5|Great product.
B00AFV7DHW|5|Fit great and does what it needs to do. Highly recommend for 2007 and later Tundras.
B00BZOBDCE|5|Thank you!
B00180FUZG|5|Works as advertised.
B00FKHKQ0W|5|Reviews were correct.  Sturdy and secure mounting for my jack.
B007XUIMTG|4|I am very satisfied with this. My car is running fine now.
B00J5KRUHM|5|Perfect size for a minivan with kids onboard.
B00196QK1W|5|Good price.  It has a nylon roller as the guide for the top wire cable; the original simply had a nylon guide.  It was an exact fit and I had it installed in about 10 to 15 min.  The original electrical connector is on the motor; you must hook up the wire as you slip it into the door to avoid problems. The replacement one had the connector on an extended wire which allowed me to fit it into the door, pull the connector out and plug it in after I had it bolted in place.<br />Installing the door panel took longer, I finally got smart and looked at how the opposite door panel fit.  The toughest part of the whole job was removing the door panel.  I used screwdrivers, my fingers (ouch),  and a pry bar.  I think there is a special tool for this, next time I will not be so cheap and give the special tool a try.<br />It does not seem to be any noisier than the original.  My only complaint is that none of the moving parts had any lubrication.  I recommend coating the metal regulator and wires with silicone grease and also the plastic pegs the hold the door panel on.  It makes it easier to pop back on and hopefully make it easier to remove next time.  Use only silicone because oil based greases sometimes are harmful to plastic or nylon parts.
B008B5X5GC|2|I received them, the installer check them before installing them said 2 where not working, so luckily i over ordered 4 to many to replace the bad two.
B004EIDD2Q|1|weak
B0013TNMY8|5|This product worked perfectly for solving my emissions related error codes on my 2003 Toyota Corolla LE (manual).  This product is the upstream O2 sensor located under the hood at the back of the engine compartment.  My check engine light appeared so I had the car inspected by 2 mechanics who pulled the error codes with their OBDII scanner.  I had the dreaded P0420 code (cat converter) plus 3 others related to the evap system P0440, P0441 and P0446.  They both said I need a new cat converter and evap canister.  The parts alone are approx. $1,200-$1,400 for the factory catalytic converter and about $385 for the canister plus labor.  So probably around $2,700-$3,000 for parts and labor.  I did a lot of research online, watched youtube videos etc to find that Toyota Corollas notoriously throw these codes for emissions.  Sometimes replacing the gas cap alone will clear all of your codes so do the folling steps in this order if your Toyota is throwing these emission codes.  1. Make sure you have a factory gas cap (very important) always turn gas cap until it clicks, never overfill gas tank or top off the gas tank, it will ruin the evap canister.  Stop pumping gas when the pump automatically stops  2. replace both upstream and downstream O2 sensors, Denso makes the best non factory part at a great price.  The sensors come with a small tube of Anti sieze lubricant which you must use on the threads, do not substitute with brake grease or other lubricant.  Unplug all emissions related parts including both O2 sensor and egr sensor, spray all electrical contacts with electric parts cleaner and reconnect.  I also purchased a 7/8&#34; O2 sensor socket adapter which really helps out, access is tough with a regular wrench and it's cheap to buy.  Usually appears in the Amazon 'customers who bought this also purchased...' message when you buy the O2 sensors.  Once both O2 sensors have been installed, you'll need to reset your error codes and then drive the car for approx. 20 miles to see if they reappear.  You can have AutoZone read ODBII codes and reset OBDII codes for free.  I bought an app for android phone called 'Torque Pro' (4.99) and a bluetooth adapter for my OBDII port ($14.99 on Amazon) to read and clear my own codes.  OBDII scanners are usually $100-$140 from auto retailers.  In conclusion, after worrying about these issues for about 8 months, I installed 2 new O2 sensors and a new factory gas cap, cleared the error codes and passed my emissions test with flying colors saving myself about $2,800.  I highly recommend trying this first before replacing the cat converter and/or evap canister.
B00TXVNZQI|2|This is a fantastic idea! I have a lot of keys on my key chain and this prevents the key FOB from wearing down (or breaking) prematurely. The quality is excellent to boot.  UPDATE 5/6/13:  Getting sick and tired of the pins breaking. Very scary to have your key fall off somewhere and possibly lose it. The leather case is good, but that's it.  Downgrading to 2 stars, sorry.
B004BLAU0E|5|Strong, i put it and it lasts under the sun.
B001RLU0WE|5|Surprised that these are the stock on my 08 civic hybrid...
B00GOHNYT2|5|Went on kids car so they can distinguish is from all the other small silver cars out there.  Great size and they like it.
B003G6V6O4|2|I had ordered 9005  but somehow got these 9006 :(
B005M1RI84|5|reliable, perfect for model aircraft
B00809ZI28|5|Great deal for the money...
B004BWU8H8|4|Nice option to have when top is off. Installation was a bit of a bear for a gal with limited tools. Had a channel my inner hulk to get the seat bolts loose. A medium sized breaker bar would have made the job a breeze.
B0048075FG|5|Purchased this for my boyfriend. He has just purchased a 2004.5 Chevy Duramax that has a Bully Dog tuner and the mount that came with it was not in good shape. This mount has been stuck to the windshield ever since. Works great, no slip, no fall. The neck bends, making it great for positioning it to your liking.
B007IFIWDM|5|Perfect!! Great quality!!👍🏻
B00D9BFR8M|3|The strap broke after a few days but it was an easy fix. It fits my Honda VT1100C with hard saddlebags. Can't cover the front wheel all the way but that's fine. Too thin but I like light and easy to store.
B007GRGWDY|5|Arrived as expected. Love em.
B003D2AVMO|5|Works great
B00UCIUNFC|5|be put up and down in 3 minutes or less.
B000JWI8C6|3|First one arrived with the slide welded at an angle. So bad so that it was painfully obvious with a bike rack on the car.  Had it exchanged and the second one was also crooked but not nearly as bad as the first. I decided i could live with it. Aside from Curt's poor quality control, it was super easy to install. seems very tough and rigid. Now just to forget is crooked.
B00BD4SLV2|5|Great!!!
B00KZJQ2L2|1|Doesn't work any better than the board fold over type. But its impossible to twist back into the little bag it came in. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B002INP6QU|5|thi is the e best
B002E024K8|5|Perfect fit. Wish there was one for the back window.
B000WNQNKG|3|product just as expected. It was late on delivery
B00RD2WF6K|5|These sensors were a pleasant surprise! One of the other reviews stated that in their vehicle, the sensors didn't increase the beeping as you get closer to an object. They work perfectly in my 2007 Yukon, increasing beeping as I get closer to another car or other objects. A great savings compared to the $180 GM wants for the OEM part. A bit of touch up paint to make them match the body color and nobody is the wiser.
B00GJ1OP00|5|Worked great on my 4 door si! Hopefully no more bad inside wear on my rear tires
B008BBDYKS|5|BEAUTIFU LIGHT. EASY ON THE EYES BUT STILL VERY BRILLIANT.
B0031NP2JC|2|Was not the right one would not take back because it had been opened so my refrigerator still doesn't work
B002OUMVWY|5|Works well, does not leak like others say it does. Make sure all connections are tight and it will work well.
B009IO1RNS|3|Didnt fit my mustang
B000EDUTQ8|2|Leaked.
B00VNBDWPK|5|So far so good!!  Purchased these to replace an HID conversion I had done just over a year ago and I couldn't be happier.  The light is very bright, and white.  The fact that they are &#34;instant on&#34; is great.  Install was very easy, but took a little longer than expected due to needing to figure out which adapter worked (these are included).  Way to go Opt7!!!
B001HRGYAU|2|This gasket was slightly over sized like it may have been stretched, making installation a bit difficult.
B007TY06JA|5|This is exactly what we needed for our old, faithful 2001 Chev Silverado 2500HD. Smooth transaction, thank you!
B00065ZIJ2|5|does a great job
B000COX92K|5|3 of 4 exhaust studs were broken on my 1994 F-150. I installed these last May and they work great. Check them every couple of months to make sure they are still tight (although I've never had to tighten mine, but it's still a good idea).
B007Y2SIGK|5|Installation  was a snap. Works well.
B00BJ2EG2G|5|Great product. Easy to install if your frimiliar with brake systems and how to bleed them.
B001NI7KE2|4|It seems like this could easily be upset if bumped upward from underneath but that hasn't happened to me. The more weight that's hanging on it the more secure it is and you sure can hang a lot of clothes on it. It does work just fine.
B005F6W43A|4|Good product
B009D41M9C|5|Nice valve caps, got what I expected
B006EH9WUC|4|Works great. Installed in my Jeep as it sits allot.
B0039538RK|5|happy with purchase
B000NMDFNY|5|Satisfied
B00TBI8QL2|1|This image is stolen. I know this, because I'm the one who designed it. If you want to buy the real thing, go here http://www.cafepress.com/stargazerdesignssports.952190444
B005C59QVC|5|Fit perfectly and very good light.
B00MH4663C|5|works perfectly.  jumped my 65 el camino 4 times without a recharge.<br />let a friend borrow the unit to jump his ford explorer and it melted the solder on the jumper cables.  called up Bolt Power USA and they shipped me out a replacement part.  very happy with my purchase.<br />i've used this to power laptops, bluetooth speakers, recharge phones and it works 100% every single time.
B00CA9AB62|5|Excellent, just as described.
B004I3Z75S|5|This is great for repairing soaker hoses.  Just wrap it, wait a day for it to cure and you're set to go.  Much easier to use than duct tape, which I could never wrap carefully enough to get to work. I discovered that although it's great for a leaky hose, it doesn't work for a hose with an actual hole in it, say one that's 1/4&#34; in diameter.
B00YBGAU2W|5|Works great!
B00UEC87QS|5|I love them! took about 2 weeks to arrive but worth the wait. put on my 08 jeep wrangler JK. literally from start to finish took me about 10 mins to install(mostly because the tape was a little difficult to take off the back with short nails). I cleaned edges where tape was to be applied with rubbing alcohol to remove any dirt or oils around the grill and BAM, peel and press. No instructions were included but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. the 'wider side lip' goes on bottom. glossy black(pics make it look a little silver'ish') no scratches or peeling with any of the pieces. so glad I ordered them!
B00IY3YLCI|5|Super bright worked well on my equipment
B00BY9XKWQ|5|Easy to put on and match perfectly!
B00N3UU2Z2|5|Perfect size for what I needed
B001GRN6LG|5|Love my new mats
B00MGGDAL2|2|i would love to order this item BUT it doesn't have an area to add the personalized text. How do you know what I want to say on the text.
B000G1568Y|5|I was pleasantly surprised how easy this was to install. And the performance result, on a '08 Xterrra, was great and the sound made it that much better. I loved the throaty vacuum sound after install.
B001A6TZQS|5|a gift
B00PBF7A5M|5|These guards are rock solid. The mounting brackets are so thick that it made attaching them a bit tricky on my 2015 Yamaha WR250R's factory handlebars. But they're on there now, and suspect they will be as durable as they seem. I will report if they aren't.
B005SUVQUK|4|Works really well & is quite quick at removing motorcycle wheel bearings...
B003VXRPL0|5|This stuff doesn't need an explanation!  It's simple, it works!!!
B00753S8CC|5|Wonderful! Was actually bigger than I expected, and I am totally okay with that! Love it! Came right on time!
B00BTLEHSK|5|Fit good. Front seats were almost perfect, but the back seats needed a little tweaking.
B002UC19T2|5|Works well, but original filter with housing came cracked.  Good thing I ordered this extra replacement cartridge at same time.  No taste to water coming from campground after installing.
B006CPMGEA|5|Just want I needed and wanted! Very pleased with my purchase!
B004SFKJIQ|5|Great item wife loves it, take it to all our fishing adventures.  Great buy.
B008DE44L6|5|Have used these tubes in the past and have always had good luck. Pinch flats and punctures seem to be less common anytime we use these tubes.
B00QYBF52M|5|just want I wanted for my vest,  looks great.  would order again.
B009Y7MJVS|5|Bought one , tested it for a month and now got my second one for my other car. The stood strong in high temperatures (98degrees outside temp).<br />Only a minor thing i noticed was that with the old ezpass this sags a bit away from the car windshield due to the weight i guess. But never came loose , which is great.
B00A2NBXOM|3|I like it but its really LARGE! Had to refold and store.
B000NJ39E2|5|Much easier to use than my previous straps that did not fit into awnings railing.  Length is critical, make sure length will meet your needs.
B007Q8H3UY|5|That was really good meant for the car
B009EVOMZA|4|The trunk its self is nice and easy to assemble, but the rivnuts and the installation hardware are junk. Save yourself some time and frustration and go to the hardware store and buy some good hardware.
B00GOQXTTS|5|Bought to use while caving and it worked perfectly. Held the headlamp in place and kept me from getting injured.
B001O08868|5|Nice quality, fit perfectly. I am happy with product
B004JKW2J4|3|Great bag.  Wouldn't have been able to schlep everything to the beach without it and the trailer hitch platform.  The only negative was the straps that were not as secure as I would have liked
B001BDUTJ2|4|said they were custom fit..otherwise work great .just some are to long..
B003S2E4UE|4|Bought this to repair Grands toys,
B00S4HFNXK|5|Hang these contour, square, white boat fenders to the side of your boat and they'll protect your vessel from damage. They're well made. The white laminate cover appears strong, is UV and tear-resistant. The insides are made of foam, so that the fenders will not collapse or deflate. They are 24&#34; x 6.5&#34; x 2.5&#34; so they store well. The set comes with a set of cords to hang them. Corrosion-proof grommets are on each fender to accommodate the braided cord. This set has a 2-year replacement warranty. These will work for most folks looking to protect their boat. They are light-weight, store easily, and are easy to use. The seam allows the fender to wrap around your boat, giving you better protection.
B001KQF6RA|5|This window unit worked perfect and was a pretty easy install.  Arrived quickly and was well packaged.
B00QMWQK2M|1|I thought these were the original mats that came in the car.  I do not like them. They feel and look cheap.  I thought I had a deal...
B00PC0NHYO|1|Bought these to replace the standard Philips 12276 Premium PSX24W Headlight Fog Lights in my 2010 Chrysler Town and Country, which is part 2504.<br /><br />The listing says it can replace part 2504 right in the title.<br /><br />They do not fit. Had to return them and get a refund.<br /><br />I've added a picture to show you where they are not the same.
B000GU5IGA|5|Fits my 2008 Honda rebel 250 perfectly
B00BJMWSGM|3|Thank you
B0007LEG2K|4|This is a simple reader. I didn't get it to do anything with the engine but read codes, and clear them out. Fits my 1998 Ford F-150 just fine. And also any other vehicle that has the same connector. It came with a book for all of the error codes listed. I do recommend this tool if you are just looking for something to help you see the error codes.
B00F9RNIPI|5|Bought two - one set for each vehicle. Good price for the gauge and length in my opinion. Nice having a bag to put them in plus the bonus stuff - gloves and a brush. Haven't needed to use them yet but am confident their thick 4 gauge wire and heavy duty clamps will handle any job. This was a good purchase.
B00480GYSA|1|Suppose to be a good brand name but the life just too damn short. Purchased a pair of these bulb back in mid April, 2015 for my 2013 Camry Hybrid. One of them just dead two days ago. It didn't even last 5 month. Very disappointed about the short life and money paid. The original bulb at least lasted 25 months before one went bad.Worse of all, there is no warranty from manufacturer on it.<br /><br />Definitely will not buy again or recommend it to friends.
B00JFINAOQ|3|I am giving it three stars only because it did not come with directions or explain that I would probably have to get additional supplies for the work on my vehicle
B00FGR8Y4G|5|Looks good I was very happy with purchase.
B001AWLTX4|5|Arrived quickly. Fits well, lightweight!
B001QVEIZA|3|Seem to be really good quality but didn't quiet fit my 97 blazer i had to cut them and there's about a half inch gap after i put them on.
B009DJU9TQ|5|Cheaper than the salvage yards here, and it works well enough for me. I got it 3 days after placing the order, so shipping was really good too. Don't be afraid to buy it if you need a fender for your HHR, it's perfectly legitimate and it works just fine.
B005R4L0SU|2|The LED's do not all work in the right (Passenger side) rear light!  Otherwise they look great with my truck!
B00062YW6A|1|Item was obviously a return. Shipping box was perfect but items box was torn open and security seal was removed and reapplied.
B006FUT0CS|5|The best &#34;waterless&#34; wash and wax product I've used so far.  Works really well for wiping off dust, bugs, and light dirt; and you don't need to use a lot of product.  I also use it to clean the windows and outside mirrors - just make sure you buff with a clean microfiber or terry cloth afterwards to eliminate swirls.  I also purchased these bottles (Chemical Guys ACC121.16HD Chemical Resistant Heavy Duty Bottle and Sprayer) to keep some in each of my cars so I can clean them whenever and wherever I am.
B0013BROO0|5|Does what it's supposed to do! :-)
B003TY0F2W|1|Media is completely contaminated with oversized glass shards. Couldn't blast for more than 10 seconds before nozzle would become plugged.
B00785LHH0|5|installed in about 7 minutes and my passenger loves it
B000BOAQUE|5|These stay in my boat incase of  blown fuse. Cant be too safe right?
B005SGZC6I|5|I am very happy with this cover for my 18 foot Bass Buggy pontoon boat.  It consists of much heavier cloth than I expected.  Not flimsy at all.  In addition, the strap anchor points are very well attached to the cover and seem very unlikely to tear or rip off.
B009R567W4|5|works as advertised.
B000C34KU6|5|A bit longer for my application although the belt was fine.
B002RZC8WE|1|Worked for about an hour..
B000RNU43I|3|The hitch is very solid. I did have an issue installing it on my 2012 frontier. The nuts that are welded I n t he frame were rusted. Wd40 and a wire 12 gauge shotgun cleaning kit helped clean out the threds. The b other is is one of the holes did not lineup, a drumel with a grinding bit fixed the issue. I gave it a 3 star rating because of the misalignment, granted the truck is used but all the other holes lined up.
B002ZTNV8W|4|These look really great (2011 Ram 1500). They install in about 15 minutes. They do cause a little wind noise and they are over priced. For the premium cost they should wrap each piece individually. They stick both fronts in a plastic bag and I noticed little swirls on one of them from where they rubbed together. I was going to sent it back but decided that it wasn't that big of a deal. But for $100 for some plastic pieces, they should come pristine!
B00T0WXKBK|1|Came in the mail wrinkled badly.  wouldn't recommend it.
B00GA3BBBS|4|Solved the buffetting in my helmet. A very convenient solution for the air flow problem I had on my windshield.
B004BE7V4Y|4|Nice little adapter, works well.
B001DKV7D0|5|This fits with my Toyota Camry 2003 . Installed three months ago. So far no problem yet
B001CA228U|4|Fit my 2003 Ford Ranger 4WD. So far so good.
B005F2WFW4|5|I was somewhat hesitant to order this, due to the remarks about it not fitting peoples needs in previous reviews.  This went into the drivers rear door of my wife's 2004 Tahoe with no issues.  Instructions for installation were not great, but Youtube really helped.  My wife is so happy that the window works!
B00192JFI6|5|as described and fits
B008S9QUC2|1|Love it works great
B003SONMG4|5|As described
B000C5HZEM|5|Heat controls now work as new. This is a OEM perfect replacement.
B007IPKTNS|4|Good battery but poorly designed terminal connectors. Small fingers and plenty of tools required. What were they thinking?
B008WXL0UQ|5|Adorable! And it survived the car wash ;)
B00IJ6INAG|5|Nice Exhaust Tips. Installed on my VW MK6.<br />Video of Installation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCmcUeJNn18
B00681BE2S|5|Worked perfect, and saved over $60 compared to the dealer price!
B000AL8VD2|5|Good Price for a great product!
B00JBIBVFA|5|very happy with my purchase and very easy to install
B00JBINW2K|5|Very nice decal! I feel blessed!
B000YCCP7A|4|Awesome!!!!!!
B001VZN6ZO|4|This product is great so far. I programed it for performance first to see the true power of the 6.0. Holly crap it's like I have a 460 supercharged under the hood. When you get on it you will feel it push you into the seat. I will see how the mpg increase option goes next week and the heavy tow works out that weekend when I have 5 ton of hay on it coming from El Centro to San Diego going up the biggest incline on any US freeway.  But all in all good product.  Its really sad that ford wouldn't let the real horses come out on this motor or any of the powerstroke diesel engine.  If did they would own the market period.  I have been in a Chevy and dodge with the reprogramming and it wasn't nothing like this. There is a big deal when you gain 100+hp and 200+tq to a motor you really feel it.......
B000C809F6|3|This is certainly not your best option. It has a major flaw as it does NOT come with the rubber gasket. Most likely the gasket on your car is swollen from the coolant, and has hard edges from the heat of the engine.<br /><br />While it fits, it does not have the bleeder hole, like the OEM one does. In other words, it completely blocks the flow of coolant, until it begins to open.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very disappointed. There's no reason for it to be incomplete.
B002M2MMXM|5|Great product, fits the car perfectly., Will  continue to buy from this seller.
B000W0KUEY|5|Great product.. Works great..
B0037NIG44|5|Used in 2002 Ford Taurus.  Sons car. Easy to replace. Took just a few minutes. Corrected rough idle and stalling when stopping. 3.0 engine.
B0002Q81Y4|5|Simple to install and it works as described.  Even a Caveman can do it.  Bunk 4 way wiring can be bought in bulk pretty cheap so why spend 3 times as much for the full kit.
B0009I1WF0|1|Thought I measured the diameter of my tires these are too snug and do not completely cover the tire.  Not happy and they are dirty now so probably not returnable.
B000MY8380|5|good spring.
B00915J6MI|5|On my other ATVs I'd drilled plastic and accomplished my own wiring.  After purchasing a couple Ranchers last year, I felt the price Honda wanted for the 12v adapter was a little high and planned on wiring in a receptical myself.  Up against the wall preparing for hunting season, decided to save a little time and order &#34;factory direct fit&#34;.  Was glad I did.  The quality is excellent.  The mounting plate, for the front rack, is well designed.  It won't interfere with anything you plan to load.  In retrospect.  These kits were worth the money, well constructed of quality parts, and quite easy to install.  Honda does it again.
B00IKQ4ZNO|5|I installed this not long after my purchase of my Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk edition. There was a noticeable change in acceleration and throttle response. I don't run dyno tests, I just know that it really unlocked my Jeep's potential. For the price and considering it was the only one on the market, I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B000GTUM9O|3|Ordered it, it arrived quickly, was pretty much as advertised.  But it's really small and would not have done much for me in the way of wind protection, so I returned it.
B001EGT3I4|5|Bought and installed off-brand bearings a year ago.  Both sides went bad.  Hard to go wrong with the Timken brand.
B0063RHGFG|4|Don't be like me and only order one of these kits.....
B008MO7FZ4|4|this is very good stuff
B0002NIH46|5|Great product, fast shipping
B00DDQ19OY|5|They fit perfect .  Ordered  them for a sante fe
B005H12QXG|5|Product is very good quality, Install took about 30 min on the left side and about 10 minutes on the right side. Left took longer because I had to figure out how to take the door panel off. Cables have new clips already installed so no questions on how to route it. Stock mirrors did not have turn signals in them, I did not have to do any modification for the turn signals to work on these. just simply plug and play.
B000JFHNG0|4|every car guy should own a set
B004YD5LXK|4|So many uses. Very strong and reliable.
B000BQWLE6|2|I should have read the dimensions. Got a black one. Shown is a blue one. Tiny!
B000SLL7S0|3|I bought the carrier returned, saved a little. There were no instructions or hardware with it, I looked for other reviews to get an idea of what I needed.<br />I ended up buying two 1/2&#34; carriage bolts 2.5&#34; long, two bolt retainers to keep the carriage bolts on the rack, two washers & nuts for the carriage bolts, two 5/16-13 bolts 1&#34; long for the hinge mounts and two 5/16&#34; bolts 3/4&#34; long (nuts for them too) to go thru the holes i drilled in the door.<br />The hinge mount welded nuts were not useable as it came, I had to run a tap thru both of them to get them to work.<br />I was able to mount the tire (I have an 87 Ford E250) high enough that the license plate is not obstructed.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very useful and easy to use.
B0054YCW62|5|Worked very well on our first trip. As discribed.
B00IUJUELI|5|Fit great, easy to install.
B008D30WCC|2|These fit, with a certain amount of bending and hammering, but they're certainly not a good fit.  As they came out of the package, there was at least a 2&#34; gap once the first of the mounting bolts had been installed, between the hole in the bar and the position of the second bolt.  Although it might have been possible to just force the bar into position and bolt it on, that would have left a lot of stress on the bolt, and I didn't like that idea much at all.  We ended up bending the bar in a vise to get it into a slightly better position, and then welding it to the frame.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't recommend these unless you're very cost sensitive and looking for something of a project.
B00RZ4YTCO|3|the led lights in the switches are a little too bright for my taste. otherwise they work as advertised.
B00FLSGF0U|5|Fits well in my pick up.  We now live on a private country road that's a far cry from a suburban neighborhood street, and this product provides a lot of protection for the carpet underneath.  Good value for the money.
B009TASDNI|5|Perfect fit, and since we now live on a private country road, it protects the carpet underneath and allows for easy cleaning.
B005XQJ5ZC|5|Great product
B002IYJUES|5|Great
B00BALZXLY|4|Nice, easy to fit, a bit overpriced though like all Shoei replacement parts!
B00K889FCI|5|WOW, it really works!!  The headlights on my husband's car were super cloudy and would never pass inspection.  After Wipe New, they look like new!!
B00OIHKJBG|4|Good fit and fast delivery!
B00ATXEPQI|4|Excellent for our road trip. Allowed multiple phones to be charged and plug in our laptop.
B012BKLUNW|1|This image is stolen. I know this, because I'm the one who designed it. If you want to buy the real thing, go here http://www.cafepress.com/stargazerdesign.1611994012
B00681BE2S|1|did not work as stated
B003VDX5D2|3|I gave it 3 stars because no hardware for mounting came with it. Had to go to tractor supply and buy clevis pins and latches. so far it seems a little flimsy but for the price it works fine, i weigh 260 lbs so it seems sturdy enough for me.
B00THR39SC|5|Yes
B00GJIRWSU|5|Extremely easy to program.  I bought this to replace the old one which had a broken key ring loop and didn't want anything other than genuine Motorcraft/Ford brand
B000GU1GS4|5|Installed and rode the dragon,great product
B00MRQV6QC|5|Works as advertised very bright. Have them on my Suzuki Samurai and have no problems seeing at night.
B00B3ODOFU|5|I get more comments and smiles on this decal.
B009DK7RPO|5|Good
B00TKO0J6C|5|Works good
B0091B550Y|5|Bought for 2013 Acura ILX 2.4L.<br />Fit perfect, was exactly as advertised, at a great price.
B001I0DCXI|4|Work better than the original
B004AGE4FW|5|Fast delivery, items fit my vehicle.
B004VKP0DW|4|great set, has almost every gasket i needed and some i didnt
B00C8E9CTQ|5|Exact replacement for OEM unit - Most satisfied!
B000I4JPZE|1|Did not raise good tire high enough to remove the flat tire
B00L32LOUE|5|fits our 2014 Ram 3500 long bed perfectly.  looks great!
B00LND67PA|5|My husband likes it says it works.  Great price.
B000JYI0GS|3|longer than needed
B007TN15EG|5|Really saved my butt earlier this year when I had to replace a section of my fuel and brake lines on a Cavalier. I could pay through the nose for a shop to do it or buy the tool and be ready whenever the need arises. I obviously chose the latter option.
B008QPTV2E|5|Love it and easy install
B000CHW5WC|5|Excellent
B00A1GENO2|5|much better construction than the factory pan. However they need to ad drain backs above the oil level for us FI guys.
B000ML7X2K|2|the cooler is rugged and well built but the cord is very light weight and the cooler can not keep up with cooling like it should.  I have a soft side cooler that is much better at cooling and thought a hard side would be better but this is not worth the money I spent on it.
B003COTFS4|5|Have not had to winch my self out yet but have gotten stuck and the winch worked fine but the way i was stuck i tied on the another atv  and if would of keep pulling i would have drug them in to the hole i was stuck in.  All in all the winch worked good for me
B000COBTJK|5|Very nice and the delivery was on time :)
B000X21U5Y|5|Fits...works.
B00QMWQK2M|3|Use Deluxe a bit to freely. The carpets are thin and barely adaptable to the car. No hole on driver mat to hook up to the retainer that makes sure the mat does not slide. Based on the car description the buyer should be advised.
B000C2Y1LK|5|fit well in my nissan pathfinder
B00IY257WC|5|First repair I ever attempted on a car and it worked perfectly. If you are looking for a how-to try youtube as it had a walkthrough door take-apart for a 2008 Dodge Caliber. I took out 2 screws - then used flat-head to remove the door panel with the power window switches, unclipped the power switch, replaced it and then worked back.<br /><br />Turned on the car and it worked GREAT!
B00CASDZKC|5|Got them for a 2015 Yukon & they fit perfectly around the front captains chairs to keep them tidy. Easy to attach & look nice.
B009X23B2U|3|Fitment is nor perfect. UT it looks pretty good and does what it is intended for.
B0041MTABS|5|they didn't work for us.  but, all in all, product and shipping were still terrific.
B003YMTJ2G|4|solid well made rotor
B003AS99DI|5|Fit great!
B007USCM7E|2|It didn't work
B00008BKX5|5|Works great for hauling ladders
B00C9CUWHS|5|All us Nam vets should have one of these or something similar on their vehicle.
B003TTV972|5|Much better than those God-awful CARB-compliant cans sold nowadays (Nader and Gore must have collaborated on those...just kidding!!).  My only suggested improvements would be &#34;more handle&#34; down along the side, to make pouring easier (tho the bottom has a convenient indentation you can grab), and maybe re-thinking the valve somehow -- I splashed a few drops out the valve while pouring out the main nozzle.  But these are minor complaints, and it's still a 5-star product. (You may want to consider getting the optional filler spout, VP 3044 deluxe filler hose.  It fits in the center of the large, existing cap, the center of which has a plug in it (remove it with a 1/2&#34; drive ratchet wrench).  And the hose has it's own cap.)
B0022ZN68Y|4|A quick and easy way to oil that pesky foam oil filter!
B00BYUXCUA|5|Highly recommended...Great product..!!!
B003HB5WJS|3|They look exactly how the picture looks. They do stick out from the tire a bit, but for this price its awesome. They are also plastic but haven't had any problems and they have been on my car for more then a month.
B004LQCDOA|5|This is awesome.  Beats using a key or stick to air down when going off-road.  It's a luxury item, as keys and sticks do the job...eventually.  This let me air down to exactly the PSI I wanted in record time.
B000C2SC10|5|Been on 2 months no problems easy install.
B009DJR1DI|2|not a good fit, worked for racing
B005RNGL9O|5|i used for my headlight and it's clan it.
B003TTL0TE|5|My vehicle is cleaner than clean after a rub down with this mit. Thank you
B009XOTRBM|5|works great, no problems carrying bike
B000BPURAC|5|Great product , fit well
B001GH5P3S|5|Easy install (10 mins), factory fit and finish. It certainly adds some much needed storage space. Very pleased with the part, worth every penny.
B001L9KI56|3|The paddle is a good size but it doesn't friction hold in place as well as I was hoping.
B000JFNAAS|5|Very good.
B001CUP8NQ|4|Good stuff
B00I3RCOF6|5|orielys wanted nearly $200.00 for this so far Im loving it it works fine no bearing noise and the abs pluged  in and works fine
B0040CRTK8|2|Ordered for a 2012 Jeep Wrangler.  They do not fit, too small.
B001OCVG6U|5|Great experience
B0027URE9G|5|Minnesota made and very high quality. Works excellently. If you need a snatch block (and who doesn't), you will not be disappointed.
B002PL5818|5|On time delivery and excellent product.  No squeaks either...a bonus.
B00RM0VBQS|3|It's cheap plastic with a brand name. Baugh for a coworker. Could get cooler for cheaper.
B0057H2POA|5|It is really nice quality and my husband really likes it and others comment how cool the corvette c6 wallet logo is too
B000ANOUHG|3|Worked ok at first didn't make it all the way through the winter though
B00S1WDSK8|5|Awesome! Great shipping very bright I have them on my work truck for back up lights hooked directly into my reverse light harness and they work fine no blown fuses perfect for what I was looking for! Keep up the great work!
B00WV055CK|4|fit is exact - works for what I wanted.. to hold bags from rolling around in the back
B009DJSLEG|5|got them on time. my mechanic put them in. they work. all is good
B00W4YA492|1|Really not comfortable for my car ride.  I did not like the feel at all.  I was looking for something to use for my long upcoming drive, this was not it.
B004SR8AXA|5|Perfect fit..
B00EK5BSL6|5|Came in on time, bright led's i did have to switch the wires to the bulb(2 peoces of metal along the astic, there are one on each side you might have to switch them around as well) around to get it to work but when it worked it looked great.
B0006JLW6Q|5|I use this to freeze everything from warts to scales skin patches. Probably not what it's meant for, but sure works great.
B003AS99DI|5|I love the fact I finally found a cover for my back seat. It's universal so it accomadates whether the smaller seat is on the left or right, mine is on the left.
B006X8BJVW|4|It show up at my door quick . Easy install but yes you do have to cut out factory grill. 4 stars Bc the top right bracket come broke off and some of the fins look bend out . Easy fix .
B0002MAJB6|1|Cheap piece of plastic. Pigtail was not even close to being long enough to reach bumper plug on my 2013 Ram.
B00BCRMC1U|3|Cheaply made. Not the greatest.
B00W771ONG|5|It works really good esy to install my daughter is so happy the 4weller running like a champ i will recommend thanks.
B003IHMHLW|5|Good qualityaqnd good price. Like that it can be greased
B00C394ETO|2|This review applies to both Girodisc front and back pads.<br /><br />I had these on my 2011 STI and I certainly wouldn't buy them again. Let's talk about brake squeal. I don't mean a minor squeal, I mean a full blown banshee wailing. People knew when I was coming home because you could hear me braking a block away. I tried everything I could do to stop them. Only until I REALLY mashed the brake pedal was I then able to get them to stop making noise.....temporarily. Who wants to do that though? I also gooped these up with some CRC Disc Brake Quiet and that did absolutely nothing.<br /><br />In addition to the ridiculous train like noise I had when slowing down. The stopping power was relatively good until they got warm. Unfortunately getting them warm was the only way to stop the noise. There was quite a lot of brake fade running hot temperatures. I realize this is natural but I felt like I could put my foot to the floor on some occasions and not stop. I don't know if this is all attributed to semi-metallic pads (I doubt it) but I will be grabbing ceramics next time....and certainly not from Girodisc.<br /><br />The only thing magic about them was how so much noise can come from something so small.
B005CHT4W6|5|This stuff definitely makes a difference in how my 2006 Kawasaki Trans Mule and Kubota B7100 runs. I will keep using this going ahead.
B010MHV00O|3|The speed of delivery was fantastic and I received a very nice email from the company that it was On its way and to let them known how I liked it.<br />The concept is great, but it didn't fit properly in my 2010 Nissan Sentra I was disappointed, because it fit my large Hydro flask bottle. The actual holder even though it had several different adjustments for the size of your cup holder it fell out when I turned the corner!<br />They are still trying to improve it and I would be willing to give it another go!
B000I6UTWK|3|Nice Grab Bar but plan on having to cut plastics on your bike.
B00EC0Z8T2|5|fits perfect on my car. Great price and really easy to replace.
B004EIAADG|5|Awesome product. ..exactly what I was looking for!
B008QBTOSE|5|This was a great little addition for our family trip. It is not huge or too small. We loved it.
B00XUU230C|4|Easy installation and much brighter than the factory lights...good buy
B004GEZISK|5|Received order very timely before scheduled date. The light appeared to be exact duplicate of original and fit as it should with not problems. Very Pleased. Thank You. Adam
B007QHQB3U|5|No more. Aching head
B000FOWNN8|1|Pieces didn't stay together very well when walking on product
B005XM5XBQ|4|excellent
B0060AEGOU|4|exact fit
B00AESWXO4|5|Good quality sticker. I trimmed the clear plastic corners off of it but that was a personal preference.
B00KSY3HFS|5|I've drive a little Nissan Juke and I wasn't sure this would fit (i.e.sometimes they are too big and you have to bend them), but I have to say the two circles make this sunscreen easy to fit/use and fold-up when you don't need it. I recommended it to my husband! Although try not to hit the passenger in the front seat when you attempt to open it up in the car!!
B00083XW54|2|I have no doubt that this would be a great hitch if my car would only cooperate in the installation process.  The instructions (attached) show an access hole at the aft end of the mount channel that is to be used to fish the carriage bolts and spacers through.  The channel is closed at that end.  The rather innovative fish wire and fasteners are of no use as there is no access hole large enough for the wire much less the fastening hardware to go through.  So far, not a happy camper.
B00WQHMMVK|5|excellent product.<br /> easy to install.<br /> looks elegant.<br />very useful to store cans and other items.<br />sticks to back of seat,does not hang.
B00XD7L3UI|5|Very easy to install! Looks great on my pickup!
B0093KMYLQ|2|Item worked for about 2 months then it crapped out. I'm giving 2 stars only because they offered to replace it or give me a refund. Spend the extra money and go with ac delco or the gm brand.
B00EQ280SW|4|had to grind down the mounting area
B00KQXYQ42|2|I bought this one for the center storage to keep things close only used it maybe 4 times then the zipper broke. It's now several months later and not able to return it. It does the job but it to small if you do any serious grocery shopping.
B0066QQWA4|5|Installed in my BMW to replace a plastic water pump pulley. The machining was a bit rough in places and I am slightly concerned about premature belt wear but will be keeping an eye on things as time goes by. The other belt seemed to have some sharpness also so I am not too concerned. Installed easily but would have been nice to see mounting screws included.
B006YWYCVG|5|arrived quickly , fit perfectly and was as described
B00BTSHSLQ|5|Installation was easy, and it works fantastic!  Although there is something to be said for being able to ride a motorcycle without being disturbed, it is great having the ability to listen to the radio, or to pair it with my iPhone and check or send texts, make or receive calls, etc.  I bought the dual kit so my girlfriend would have one as well, and we've been able to communicate via the while we're each on our bikes with no problem at all.  The only times it cut out was when riding in the mountains, and we lost sight of each other when I rounded a sharp turn around a mountain, but that is to be expected.  I've used it while riding in the rain on multiple occasions, and so far it still works just as well as when I received it.  I am definitely glad I made this purchase.
B00G4AB4MS|5|Works great, pretty stable even with 2 heavy downhill bikes, a little tricky to get setup for different bikes, but better than having to take the wheel off or lift it high on top of the car.  I've used it for my road bike, downhill bike, 29'er, and even my fat bike (had to strap both wheels down since they didn't fit in the slots).  I use Velcro scraps I got at Home Deport to strap the hold down arm to the frame just as a precaution, but I've never had an issue.  I like that you can fold it up 2 different ways and that you can fold it back with 2 bikes on it to get into the back of the car.  Only thing I wish it had is a build it lock, but I use a cable and it seems to work fine, except when I forget it at home.  I would recommend this rack.
B00062ZI9K|5|Installation was easy, and Looks Great! Used pipe dope instead of tape to seal. Gave it a clean look, as well as leak free. Would recommend this item.
B00V5QDIPW|5|Would not fly without them.  The seller was great!
B005PF8OQW|5|totally pleased with this product
B00BBFJ5XQ|5|Wish i got a bigger size runs a little small. But great product.
B0007UQ2N2|5|Use it for my Supplied Air System as a breathing tube.  I figure if you can drink out of it, you should be able to breath out of it.  Hope I am not wrong.  Meh.
B008Y26YAG|5|Pulled the joint on a rock in my Rhino. I hammered it back it, but never felt safe. This replaced it and when ton without a fuss. Wasn't too impressed with the hardware it came with so I just use the old ones.
B002P8H8V4|3|I had to modify the trim a little to make this a good fit on my 2002 Saturn SC2. It's not the greatest but it works.
B00IUNO8LQ|1|Tabs too wide to fit my helmet with a ratchet clasp.
B00J52DY34|5|it works well
B0000AYA3T|5|I replaced an old unit and the new fit with very little additional work.
B00QP5XD08|5|These work great.  Tried to find stuff to make my own, but you can't do it for this price and quality.  I ordered extra for other ride.  Be sure to get the right size because Ranger and RZR holes are different sizes.........
B00HLW18T2|5|Awesome lights! Highly recomend!
B005CHT4W6|5|Good stuff
B004DFHLUA|4|Did what it was supposed to.  Didn't fix my problem but did bind and seal leak.
B00JXNK1Z4|5|Incorrect size but the product seems nice.
B008CE0W5Y|5|Great product.. good quality, excellent instructions and works as advertised
B006GFLI0O|4|Nice cap and it appears to be made of quality material that will hold up, My only issue with it is I wear a XL hat and the elastic band is a bit tight for me.  It isn't uncomfortable, but I do have a temporary line around my head after I've worn it for a while
B0054N6DT0|5|Perfect fit. Went right in. Reasonable price.
B00LDQGRUW|5|great
B00IK2MNZK|5|Exact fitment.  Great product, no issues.  The only thing that wasn't exact to my oem carb was this replacement doesn't have a nipple to attach the exhaust breather tube to.  This doesn't effect performance, however, so it's not a big deal - you just have to make sure the tube doesn't clog from mud or dirt or any debris.   Edited to add: the engine I used this on was a Tecumseh H35 (3.5 hp)
B00MO9T9SE|4|not perfect but better than buying all new mirrors
B000C9Y16S|3|I chose 3 stars to emphisise that these are &#34;It's ok&#34; type filters. Now to explain why as there are some premium features to it. With mine, both wix and napa gold, this filter has a square cut seal (not nessearily bad.), however, because of the forces for torquing it on, it can be subject the warping. The warping is generally mild, but causes a small oil leak. I have three sources of oil leak when combined with this. First is that the O-Ring on the oil fill tube is old and needs to be replaced because it has hardened. The second is a tiny leak via the oil pump assembly where the pump meets the body and a small leak formed in the gasket. I haven't fixed that one because I would have to redo the timing belt and I just installed it and a crankshaft seal about 4 months ago. Finally, the wix filter is leaking via the seal that came with it. Now, this filter does have a high grade filtration media, a great bypass valve, and a great oil anti-drain back valve. (the last part is not as much of an issue on my 96 Subaru though. Better for top mounted newer Subaru's though.
B00C42TPTY|5|Nice...
B00BF2V8ZS|5|Excelente
B0053P69IO|5|Fit great on toyota sienna 2004. Worst part was cleaning out the bolt holes on the frame that were rusty after 10 years. Otherwise install was easy. Had towed a trailer suceesfuly this far
B00NJAL9MQ|2|2 of the stepper motors fail after 3 weeks
B002UC6SIO|4|Works great.....I do believe thought there is a leftand right side.....holes did not line up.
B00DJ3N3SQ|5|Great part for my car,it fits correctly.
B002YQV18S|5|This did not go on my car. Put it on the canopy of my fish tank For my monster fish. Can you guess his name?
B00LT33KIQ|5|Great cover for my 2001 GTI Sea-Doos.  Fits perfectly.
B00H1ES6S6|5|great product!
B00GWGXAC6|5|this was easy and looks great on my blue Tahoe!
B0075XI71O|5|great product!
B00Y2KIO0W|5|Cheap alternative to a 90 dollar knock sensor. Its been a month now since i changed it. This is my third one on the same car the two older honda sensors both fail. They both cracked. we'll see how long it'll last.
B00VF2IC9I|5|Works wonderful.
B007X48RV0|5|Super cute! These are not the flat stickers, they actually look like eyelashes.
B00LO0M918|5|These are perfect. Brighter than some of the reviews I read. My daughter left a bunk light on and it was 24 hours before I found it...the battery didn't budge. I immediately bought more to change out everything in the trailer. Sometimes too bright in the sleeping area but still worth it.
B00KLY15UE|2|Makes the seat belt too heavy and the belt gets closed in the door.  They look nice tho!  I took them off.  Maybe I will use them<br />in the back seat.
B006YECDJC|3|I'm gonna write a long review since nobody has yet. So first off this thing is legit genuine carbon fiber. You can tell it has been hand crafted because real carbon fiber isn't made to look 100% perfect. It was cut alittle bit off from the factory one so it didn't quite line up correctly and looks a bit weird, but it gets the job done. Yes it does fit in the factory gasket and yes it does look nice with the carbon fiber look to it, but until it rains I won't know for sure if it will hold out the water. Took me literally 5min. to put on it was that easy. Is it worth the $30?  Probably not but that's up to whoever buys it. I took a risk and I can say for sure that I'm not disappointed with this, but at the same time I'm not amazed with it either. Overall I gave it 3 stars because shipping was a pain and it came out of the box scatched up. I put this on a 96 civic coupe
B008H67X1I|5|Product works great on the specified surfaces and delivery was right on time.
B001VJS2FE|5|Its simple, easy to use, accurate, lightweight and fairly priced. Buy it!
B000RT8ENE|5|Very solid, well built.  Comes in a sturdy case and has good instructions for setup and use of the torque wrench.  Very happy with the purchase.
B000EVYGZA|1|Voltage readout was off. Home 120 volts showed 134 volts in error. Sent back.
B0125VJOSU|5|good quality product.
B0009JKGII|4|This product is quite effective at serving its intended purpose of removing tough bug, tar and other road grime. I was pleased to see that Amazon wisely chose to be ship this Turtle Wax Bug and Tar Remover in a clear plastic bag that was sealed to prevent the possibility of leakage into the shipping box, in the event that the trigger top leaked which was thankfully not the case for my shipment.
B00BFEGPIG|1|Piece of crap. First day of using it and it broke instantly. Not worth it
B001AZX7DG|1|it's not like the picture ... when you buy another picture the logo had not black but was laser printed as is as is the logo nissan ...
B000H961YI|2|not what espected.
B00F2CSQAW|4|Works well! I've beat mine up pretty hard and it's still hanging in there.<br />Put a dab of glue on the screws that hold the grill on the front. They work loose.<br />It took a while to get this part. It shipped from China and the &#34;estimated delivery date&#34; was off by a couple weeks...
B00CFALFXY|5|Great towels and they wash wonderfully!
B001C97V4Q|5|Quality part...as good as oem quality it looked like.  Def a good buy.
B007RW2XYA|5|Excellent product
B002MGPFPU|5|This ramp is lightwieght but durable. We use it indoors but carry it with us when we go out for one step encounters. Works great as a potable piece. I will be purchasing a six foot one soon!
B0031I807I|4|As of 1 month, discs are looking/working  good.
B004M1Y8BU|5|Perfect fit. Very easy to install with the proper tools. I did not remove my wheels.
B00R1NPMEI|5|Should have came with them stock, They look and fit good.
B00MLI6OHC|5|One heck of a light no doubt about that. Will save you alot of headache and time by getting yourself a simple toggle switch and making your own wire harness. The directions and harness that come with it are a pain. Other than that excellent light solid and durable.
B000P5CXJ6|5|Harley Davidson 2008 STREET BOB !<br />Just Beautiful !<br />Easy instalation !<br />Took 20 minutes !<br />Performance just better than Ever !
B004LOGS70|5|I've had one of these on my car for a couple of years now, and it still looks just as good as it did when I got it.  Bought two more to put on my new electric bike (which is black with yellow highlights).
B003G0MCN4|5|Fits like a glove and now I don't have to be paranoid about putting something in the trunk and staining my beautiful fabric.  Haven't had any spills yet, but the lip seems more than capable to cover anything below gallons.
B00FQQFCQU|3|Had to cut off the emblem and use another in it's place that was more stable
B00KXSHEMG|4|I used this paint pen to touch up a paint chip on my 2014 Subaru Crosstrek. The color was a perfect match, and the instructions were pretty clear. The main thing that was tricky was the spring-loaded tip to get more paint released from the reservoir. While I was applying paint to the car door, I accidentally pushed too hard on the tip (it doesn't take much!) and a lot more paint gushed out, requiring some quick cleanup before I made the paint job worse. Once I got the hang of it, that didn't happen again. The other part that was a bit tricky was the timing. I tried to follow the directions exactly for how much wait time to allow in between applying the paint and the clear coat, but when I went to apply the clear coat, the paint was apparently still wet and it smeared around a bit and was no longer as smooth. Next time I'll plan to let it dry another few minutes so the paint job doesn't get messed up.
B000BOAZM8|5|I never knew they made this, high temperature resistant tailpipe sealer helps keep tailpipe in place
B0091YXN46|5|Good
B007SAA2KI|5|Looks great on my New car(Ford Escape 2015)
B00C42UUIE|5|Perfect fit, took 15 minutes to replace.
B009AGY7IQ|5|Arrived earlier than what was promised.<br />Mounts easily, quite well made.<br />Would buy one again, if I was in the market for it.<br />Hopefully won't have to, if the car lasts longer than I.
B008N22QP4|5|I would like have one about half the size. It good quality and looks very good.
B000CO9M5I|5|Excellent Item
B00NVBW5EY|4|2013 kia optima sxl<br />Works when needed.  Doesn't catch everything, i only use on driverside. I would have in ever car i own just in case.
B001AIZ5HY|5|One has to follow the instructions (and the videos) closely.  I received a like-new lens result.  3M makes products that really work well.
B007PSRF0I|4|Nice protection!! great textured finish
B002XLGR6K|5|very high quality
B00NR2FVRA|1|Did not work,  took it to the shop and they charged me $300 for diagnose and new CDI but it works now.
B00MS5XUXY|5|Hook Is great and a definite eye catcher!  Joe and his team were great to work with!
B00LMRES30|5|Great product!
B000CQRTVK|5|purchased these based on the review, they are nice pads, so far so good, they don't need shims as they have a IMI patented system wagner calls for their built in shim which has a slightly raised back. Fit perfect and so far so good. Used for Tacoma prerunner
B00LOS65ZQ|5|very helpful, friendly and was a great person to communicate with
B000C704U2|5|I very much like Raybestos pads and shoes. I find they fit well, perform great and last a decent amount of time. No problems.
B00NGOWPGY|5|Item shipped quickly, was as described, fit good and looks good.
B007NLQO0O|5|If you want to save money by either DIY or not paying outrageous prices from a dealership to change oil in your Subaru. This 6 pack of genuine Subaru oil filters is the best way to save lots of money.
B00RV417XM|5|these lights are just as bright as my headlights! the amount of compliments i get on these are crazy! definitely invest in the resistors though to avoid hyper flashing. worth every penny.
B0050SFVO2|5|Listened to the reviews and glad i did. Worked like a charm.
B00P2QAAG6|5|Smaller than what I thought it would be, but fits perfectly next to license plate. Obviously very noticeable to other cars, have had people move away after seeing the magnet
B00X3EQMG6|4|Does exactly what you need it to do.  Nothing more, nothing less.
B000CSOLWI|2|Didn't work
B004P9YZLC|5|Work great on 2002 Tacoma 4x4 Dbl cab 6 Lug.
B001KSGMTO|2|Product page was unclear as to which engine mount this is. This mount only fix automatic transmission engines.
B00AEAXU26|1|Not happy with the sizing. I am a 6ft2 in around 300 and not fat. This vest did not fit at all it is currently a hanging piece in my closet
B002E39YBW|5|It was exactly what I needed to fix the problem on my Nissan Frontier! I took it to a local mechanic and had the whole thing fixed in less than a half hour. To get the part and have it installed was under $100.00. With parts and labor, this could have cost me over $500.00 had I not researched and ordered the part myself. Thank you Amazon for having such a great variety of items to choose from!
B000C5CEKC|5|Real good and price excelent
B009OO59M2|5|Great low cost addition to my TJ.
B00T7JHUI0|5|They work well. I use it to hold a iPhone 6 plus with a battery case in the car, So it's holding a fair amount of weight for a small net. I cleaned the area with rubbing alcohol and used a heat gun to apply it. Heat the area up prior to applying, then apply and heat again. It's the middle of summer, so if the net was going to fall off it would have done so already.
B009RC2HVC|5|installed in 10 min works perfect also includes rod clips awesome
B002EFP3D8|5|I have been playing World of Warcraft since 2004 on the Beta. Love this game and yes, I am always on the Alliance side. Just cant be the bad guy. I mean seriously, justice aint gonna dispense itself =) Great product and looks good on my car.
B000AME50Y|1|Horrible product
B004R36XLQ|1|I had to modify my exhaust hangers to make this hitch work.  It is not a direct fit by far.
B002OW5J44|5|great vent, good directions. I bent the metal flat bars so the outside of the cover was closer to the roof. I put some foam left over from the vent around the bottom edge so nothing can enter into the vent and end up in the screen. Otherwise you will get wasps and all kinds of debris inside the vent when you are traveling. I've never seen it addressed and that's a shame, you can avoid a mess later by taking a little extra time to seal that bottom edge. I used some Dicor lap sealant, non-sag, non-leveling to hold the strips of foam in place and then closed the cover on to it to make sure it adhered. Don't get the sealant anywhere near the bottom of the cover. It is made to be opened, not sealed. Good luck!
B004I0E9YG|5|Was an easy install on my 99 Dodge Grand Caravan.  It came with the  bulbs which is a really nice bonus.
B001U2DPUE|2|got one more channel yippee
B00445U1KG|5|Excellent quality, fits well, great protection and awesome price
B00C8E91CE|5|for some reason these things do not last very long.  This is the 3rd one I have put in a GMC Yukon in 140,000 miles.  This one seems fine now, but all the others did too when they were new.  I have given up trying to convince my wife she does not need to set the parking brake on level ground with the trans in park, so I will probably need another one or two if the Yukon holds up.
B000CPI5ZK|5|works
B000CCOL3I|5|My 1998 Hyundai Accent (4 cyl 1.4? L) had fuel over-delivery to cylinders 2 through 4, uneven / tractor-sounding idle, uneven acceleration at all speeds, and occasional slight coughs at freeway speeds / RPMs. I expect the primary problem is an oxygen sensor, but I wanted to clear out any secondary maladies in the fuel system, in case an injector was stuck open.  I can hear and feel different operation in my engine congruent with what I expected. Engine cycles are ~50% better at idle, ~70% smoother at freeway speeds, starting is easier and less smelly (i.e. less excess gasoline fumes out of exhaust).  Having said that... 1. A REAL review would take the engine apart to verify cleaning power. I do not have the facilities to do that. Weight this response accordingly. 2. This Techron was merely a diagnostic tool - it seems to have cleared out an injector problem, allowing me to diagnose my remaining expected rich-mixture problems as a oxygen sensor failure.  Five-star rating because I *estimate* the Techron did its job correctly.  Note - I purchased at 5.00/bottle on special.
B000C34KT2|5|Fit my mustang gt 2002 perfectly. Wait till your engine cools down though ;).
B00AETUVM4|5|Very nice cables -- works well.
B002UC18AM|5|Perfect for the new curtains I made for our '96 Jayco pop-up. And my cheapie sewing machine sewed right through them, no problem at all. No need to hand-sew.
B0002JMF9I|5|Works as advertised.
B00LOX4SNM|5|looks great on the side of my jeep, got 1 for each side. colors haven't faded after weeks.
B005JKEREQ|4|The symbol was a little elongated....
B00KLKXVW8|5|I started taking the supplement on Sunday by Monday my milk supply started going up and has continued everyday. I would recommend this product to all nursing mothers if they started to drop production.
B003AVUDBM|5|Very noticeable difference in handling. Worth every penny.
B000UVCK9S|4|The lights are great. They Are Very bright. I love it when u sync it with ur music. Everyone in know says it's cool.
B00MJ44SKS|4|Fit my 2001 prizm pretty well. I did not like how they fit around the side mirrors though. There is not much foam tape hitting the mirror and leaves a small gap, but no water seemed to get it unless it is raining hard with highway driving. Great for keeping the car ventilated during the hotter weather. Will buy for future cars, if they will fit.
B00BD4SK0Y|5|Although I didn't receive the color I ordered I like them very much. they weren't hard to install and make my car look great.
B00HXXZM14|5|A wonderful little devil, I put this on my toolbox to help dress it up.
B002E5HMT6|4|Inexpensive, which is what I was after.  It runs just fine, but only time will tell if it was worth it.
B001KMO1JI|5|Bought these for my '95 HX and they are great. I bought the ski used and it just had bike grips on it.  I didn't realize the factory grips anchor into the bar.  Glad I bought they OEM part.  Well worth the price.
B00VU110PM|5|Perfect!!!
B004W97GBG|4|Not the best fit... But from 10 feet and further they look great!
B00TYXZNBA|5|Redline mototcycle oil is expensive. I changed the oil to this in my 2005 FJR1300, and after about 10 miles, immediately noticed a positive difference in the engine, and more importantly shifting- silky smooth.  I used a KN 148 filter.  The oil now has 3100 miles on it, and the oil is still performing very well- MUCH better that the purples, or mobils, or spectro, or other oils.  It says on the container this oil has an ester base, instead of PAO (in mobil1 for example).  Maybe that is why?  Anyway, The other oils do work, but would need changing due to shifting getting sticky issues at about 1000 miles or so.  None of the other oils I have tried, and used are near this.  But...  It is more expensive.
B00AM7GYR4|4|It works alright just doesn't stay on really well. It is as advertised and very well made
B00KGGTGO4|5|I like to use these folding types as they save space and these are the best Ive had yet.  Great quality and price!
B000P6WMHS|5|great extension bar for the slide hammer puller.
B007ILANWY|5|perfect for the back of our yacht
B00CASDZKC|5|I love my children, I also like my car so when I looked for a solution to keep the back of my seats clean the Kick Mats were the answer. First of all they are clear so the mats blend right in without looking out of place, they are easy to install, easy to clean and great value for money they come in a pack of two - everyone is happy
B0067FMX3O|3|Applied to clean glass and half the &#34;s&#34; fell off.. replaces the &#34;s&#34; cutting up another sticker... LOL
B00Y8QLKQ0|5|Worked very well.
B00V30J86I|1|Did not work at all in my car.  Way to small
B00EM9E5DS|4|Doesn't seem very bright, until I got it on stage. The cable is thinner than I thought.  I works great.
B008G3AAHG|5|I thank you so much for the fast service you extend to me. an excellent job.
B006TMLPJI|5|Perfect fit and good price
B000R3SYFS|4|This thing is a perfect fit for my window. It's a bit bulky to move around inside the car, but it does the job. It's hard to tell whether how much heat it's reducing as I'd need another one to keep the heat out of the back window as well.<br /><br />I primarily got this to protect my front dash and its doing a good job.
B000C2EEJY|4|correct size and was securely packaged so as not to damage gasket
B005C74G5G|4|looked nice
B0002JMF9I|4|This made the adapter that I needed
B00EKTIX3I|2|sent back had keyholes on each handle
B0044B0YJ8|5|It's an oil filter....
B008G2XSXU|1|I only received the left side I was under the impression that it would be both sides
B007H2PZQ8|5|Love this chair. Very comfortable and portable. I purchased it to take on our family camping trip but have enjoyed it out on our deck already.
B00AMEM7XW|3|Too bad it's imprinted.  Also the height could be reduced to keep the cover off the floor.
B00EZUL6ZY|1|didn't fix my car
B000BZG742|5|totally pleased with this product
B00E1D1GQE|4|Love the concept of this product, but the quality is mediocre. When I received my AutoExec was broken and I had to repair it which seemed a little odd, the sliding tray was install wrong or damaged during shipping. Once I had it fixed it worked as planned.<br />If your in sales this is a must have. Great for paper work and a place to put your computer for on the road work.
B002ERKBWY|1|doesn't come sealed like one from the factory ... besides that there was some chrome build-up inside the housing. i can definitely tell a difference between this and the original one.  ADDED 11/11/2015 Since i've gotten this product it has costed me 150.00 to get 2 new ballast ignitors replaced because of the cheap build quality
B00KI4XPU0|5|Worked great.
B001L9ZBZS|5|This decal was so easy to put on! Love the font, and size isn't too bad either
B008KWL5C2|5|One of the best truck purchases I've evere made. These should come standard in all crew cab trucks.  Looks great in my F-150, and seems  indestructible.  I would 100% recommend this product .
B00C250JQG|3|Size is right, straps could've been better but still secure.
B001JEK4KW|5|finally my neck is not rubbed raw by a newer seatbelt. Great product!
B001VXXUWK|5|Comfort and safety in one!
B00BDEO6CK|5|This product does the job and eliminates orders
B006ZSUR5O|1|didn't work
B007HOGFE2|4|Before I review this product please keep in mind that if you live in a high crime area this will NOT keep a criminal from stealing your bike.  This as any is more of a diversion tactic.  That being said it is a very heavy duty lock, dust cover for key hole, comes with 5 keys which I have had no problem inserting or unlocking.  The protective case will still scratch your paint a little so be careful.  This is also much bigger than I was expecting, it is not a product that you can coil around your seat post as it is too firm.  That's my main issue with it, it's a little overly firm for my liking.
B00JGC7TCK|4|works great
B00NFSNAS8|3|Broke on the second tire.  [update] I am bumping this up to 3 stars because the company was good enough to contact me and offer a solution to the problem.  While I cannot take them up on this offer as I have already purchased a different product I wanted to recognize the level of service this company provides.  If I can recommend anything it is to try this out for yourself and contact the company if you have any trouble.  Obviously other love this product as it is very highly rated.
B00LNOMXBG|4|I liked it, but it was not the right fit for our car.
B00NM4PCTK|5|Heavy duty and actually fits my forks without tightening it until it deforms or leaving huge gaps on the clamps with the bolt barely in the nut.
B00S09T8M4|5|This item is great! My boyfriend washes his car at least once a week and goes through microfiber cloths pretty quickly. The glove is beneficial because its a glove and you don't have to hold onto it like you would for a towel. It just sits right there on your hand. It can be used on an part of the cars exterior or interior if you'd like. It doesn't leave behind little fibers or hairs and it leaves a clean finish wherever you're using it. We love these microfiber cleaners. These are our go to for car washing.
B00684TGWA|5|It programmed easily and works great
B00CGFPW64|4|ok
B003K3GKGW|3|Great price, OEM fit, no complaints
B003CGDPVK|5|Fits, while soft top is collapsed. Huge plus
B00JGJGLEU|5|Good and sturdy.
B001MOSBRW|5|Works perfectly. Exactly what i needed
B00KRP1BYC|5|It works !
B009OBW5XQ|3|Good product with decent price not the greatest
B000BRN284|5|They do their job
B00K7LBH40|5|So far so good. It started. We'll see how long it lasts, although I did get 11 years out of the stock one.
B00BTGDR9A|5|Love all chemical guys products and was shipped in a timely manner.
B001F0IE7A|4|First one installed fine, but was hard to put the pin in when in travel mode. Sent back and recieved another one, only slightly better, but I couldn't store the boat in my garage if I didn't have it. Overall would recommend. My boat is only about 2500 lbs, and works fine.
B00412YYVO|5|Worked great and saved me a lot of money.
B002BELP3Y|5|Makes drying a lot easier and eliminates scratches from drying
B00PTR0JKA|5|looks and works great
B007W553KS|5|First shaft drive oil change seems to be good oil. Bike is quieter.
B00BCR60TK|2|ok not a good fit.
B007HRVO5O|5|perfect for outdoor shower / water faucet. it is compact, slightly smaller than OEM.
B00PJPHEBO|1|Did not work at all with Torque free version or Torque Pro the $$$ APP version. Then it says it works with some DR something APP so i tried that.  it barelt worked right...ive worked with other ones that are much better but are much higher priced. in this case i def got what i paid for.  With these scanners its always best to not mess around and go with the more expensive one but at least you know what your getting<br /><br />Will be returning this product for a full refund. It simple DOES NOT WORK WITH THE APPS THAT IT CLAIMS TO WORK WITH
B00WFILH3E|1|00000 starts all day long...yall don't even try this one please don't be stupid like I was.
B004BTBBEK|5|Turns with the tire.
B00098PO3G|5|Fantastic spray and works on picky soft plastics.
B00VKXV2V2|5|These lights are awesome! Fit right in every slot no problem, Love them, they look great. Visibility isn't the best at night time, but makes for a cool effect. Came with two extra that i can't figure out where they go.. but I'm not complaining. If they don't work, turn them 180 degrees and try them again!
B00VR5RPZ0|5|Perfect fit!
B004HOCH92|5|fit hyundai 2009 accent. the procedure to install was simple but awkward.
B0067P2E7O|5|great product
B00S4UJJIC|1|Unfortunately it fits the car but some electronics does not work after. I had to buy the original Toyota piece. This third party parts never work as they should be from my experience.
B0002GXPBS|5|Big loud and yellaw....love it....good quality and style...well made too....buy again soon!
B00OKNX5R8|4|Products were exactley as described. Delivered promptly
B00265A5SE|5|Had no problems with the fit and installment. Great and cheap product...
B000NOO798|1|BEWARE!!!!! I used this on my 2002 Nissan Sentra with only 87K miles and it killed the entire cooling system. My car is now going to be crushed into a cube because the repairs will cost more than the car is worth. DO NOT USE.
B001LGTXJG|3|The size in the description is misleading! The dimensions they give are 44&#34; X 36&#34; which is true if you include the length of the straps. The actual net is only 24&#34; X 24&#34;. I thought this would be a lot bigger than it is. Am very disappointed. Quality is good and it will work, but not the size I was expecting.
B006GFU39Q|3|It fits through the holes but really needs to be bent a little more. On my VTX1300 it fits but is literally up against my rear shocks. For the price I'll live with it.
B00838808A|5|this came fast and is just what i needed
B00B2ACZHS|3|They burn out quickly
B000WJIZOC|5|Works as advertised. Correct length.
B001O7PBW0|5|Includes both gaskets!  Good filter and new gaskets makes it easy.  Worth the extra cost.
B005OVATCY|5|Worked perfectly with my 2010 chevy impala ltz
B0009OMY9C|3|These seem decent quality -- I have no way of testing their accuracy. However, several of the gauges were rusty on arrival, despite being drenched in copious amounts of oil.
B00DPIFNME|5|perfect product
B004G5LTZK|1|I returned this shortly after receipt.  There are at least 4 design and/or production flaws.<br />1. The tie is not at the middle, as it is pictured and where it should be.  Instead, it is at the top.<br />2. The smallest wrenches are stored closest to the outside, instead of closest to the middle of the rolled up roll.  This means 1 or 2 small wrenches immediately fall out when you carry the roll.<br />3. The pockets are appropriately cut at an angle, so a whole set of wrenches of increasing size can be stored neatly.  However, the width of each pocket should also get wider. Instead, width seems to be somewhat random, so that an unexplainedly narrow pocket is placed between two larger ones.<br />4. There is way too much cloth here, unless you need an emergency parachute with your tools.
B000COMX3Q|5|Great item!
B002UC6W0S|5|easy install
B0009JKGJW|4|While I don't think it's a miracle worker, it provides the lubrication and function when I've used it with noticeable results.<br />83-RX-7:  The Fuel: Seems to help my Carb idle reset return to normal smoother (an issue I'd been tinkering with for a while)<br />94 CBR900RR the Oil: Seems to made the shift a little smoother<br /><br />Try it out, you may love it.
B00UZM4XPQ|4|they did the job, it hard to see them in the day time .. but at night the stand out !!!
B00Q754Y86|5|great service from you...btw, it looks great on my daughters jeep/ she loves it..
B00D1CQVIY|5|excellent product
B00OY3KZ7W|5|Good quality cover you won't be disappointed has lots of grip love it.
B007Y5M9D0|5|Prefect fit for my 95 honda accord wagon ex. They are different for different Hondas. You must be careful to buy the correct part. Cheaper than advanced auto, auto zone, napa, rock auto, and oreiles. Would recommend.
B00DS6NRJE|4|work perfect.
B001HZKGCE|5|What I expected.
B00BHD5WIO|5|Plastic! But does what is meant for ! And with the 2 badges look super nice
B00TUNSOMO|4|Quick Wax works well to make your boat shine. It is a gentle cleanser that helps remove water spots, dust, and other debris from the hard surfaces on your boat, and it also leaves a protective layer that helps prevent future spots, dust, etc.. It contains UV protection that really lasts and helps to prevent color fading. It does a great job
B00YYIVH2Y|4|It works good, I suppose.  It just was a little small for my back seat, so it didn't fit as tightly as the picture leads on.
B002JH7PEQ|5|purchased 2 years ago and it still works, it gets thrown all over the van when grandkids move to front sit to &#34;sit with grandma&#34; at the park, the car does have to be on for it to work. would be nice improvement to have a place for the wire to wrap around and stay. but definitely not taking a single star off my rating! if you are indecisive, try this one!
B0018KXFHQ|3|It is functional to put the logo nissan cd but could be improved for a better finish ..
B005XH6J2S|1|Amazon said that this product was guaranteed to fit my 2004 Kia Rio. The lip on this strut is way too close for the bushing on the bolt to turn. This also happened with the G52015 (the front left strut). There is literally no way for it to fit in my vehicle. I am very disappointed with this product.
B001C99TLE|4|nice kit well see how long it lasts
B00HMDEDVA|5|Works for my 150cc Runmaster 2 kinroad gokart.
B00MAG6RMM|5|I purchased these to replace the reverse, running, and cargo (both sides of third brake light) on a 2015 Silverado. They work well and have a very nice crisp white color. They are at least as bright as the incandescent bulbs if not brighter. The picture is not very good but you can get an idea.
B003E2WQE4|5|Work good and easy to put together
B005RR42LY|5|Look cool I love it
B0066TE46A|5|Working very good!
B00KIXSXWQ|5|Haven't used it for the minivan yet. But two days after I bought it, I went to a friend's lake house for some boating fun. Her boat (with two engines in it) was dead as a door nail (the kids had left the radio on for days and days).<br />I remembered this handy tool and went to the car to retrieve it (I had already charged it). Hooked it up and charged her boat in a flash.<br />Love the size too. Very small. Easy to keep in the van. It also has a case--most of the others I was looking at did not!
B00AVEADPW|5|Bright, nice patterns and everyone sees it during the day.
B0054T95ZS|5|I bought these along with the plastic covers. They work just fine.
B000C44DIY|5|Good
B00HU6N3LK|5|This leather cleaner looks great so far! It dissolved easily into the water with no clumping like other concentrates sometimes do. It did not streak my leather or leave striated colors, it applied smoothly and evenly. I used it on a saddle strap to test it, and now I'll use it on the whole saddle since it worked so well. It also does not have any stinky chemical smell
B0007Y4P8W|4|worked
B00BI2HQ24|5|Excellent, don't even need to bolt the unit down to use it, doesn't move it runs so very smoothly. Love it, but I will bolt it down for safety reasons.. Well worth the money.
B004AAE3DQ|4|work like a charm
B00IEKP8VO|1|Poor construction. Rotors rust after 2 months of use. They start cracking after 6 months. I only been having these rotors for 10 months. I would rather spend a lil more and get better ones. Spend cheap get cheap parts.
B00SC0ZP1Y|5|perfect
B000CAVDPO|5|Bando's belts are of excellent quality, and they are quite fairly priced.  I also am pleased that it is an American made product.
B00MOPFRZ2|5|Went on easy and look great!
B00I3JWJV8|1|They hardly give off any scent
B00FM6V1S2|5|Bright and beautiful. No leaks after 2 months of use. Perfect, but pricey.
B0046U91LE|5|Exactly the same as what the local auto parts store are selling, made in china! Hope this can handle the engine for 50k miles.
B001PWA0IO|5|Exellent product safe kids
B0049IT2NA|5|Absolutely Fantastic Love them
B00YWBVDWM|5|Pegs fit great!
B003BZR1Z8|5|Great tools.
B004AGDE5S|5|these brake parts will be a improvement over what I am using now
B00GBVHPV4|5|thanks
B003YMBO2E|5|These look great and protects the cowl from any mirror damage. Took less than 5 minutes to install
B004QEQIN4|1|I ordered this product 10 months ago.  Electrically, it works as it should.  Windows go up, windows go down.  However, if you're like me and care what your truck looks like, you'll want to order a different switch.  From the beginning, the finish began to wear off of the button I use the most, the drivers window.  I have to swipe into the parking garage at work, and I have to swipe into my community at home.  At a minimum, the window is up and down 3-4 times a day.  Apparently, the paint on these switches isn't up to that duty cycle.  It has rubbed off almost completely.<br /><br />The final straw came as I was cleaning my door with Armor All.  A protectant.  And the paint wiped off with Armor All.<br /><br />The seller chose not to stand behind their product, citing a 6 month warranty.  Odd that the first switch lasted 9 years and the paint never came off at all.<br /><br />So if you need something that works, buy this one.  If you want it to look good while it works, get a different brand.
B00DHQU34W|4|I really like this sunshade.  It's solid,  has a cool carry case and does it's job well.  But I am omitting one star because it is bulky.  It also forces you to bend your mirror quite drastically in order to remove it (at least on 2005 to 2012 Toyota Tacomas) and leaves about 4 inches of open window around the mirror.  It's not a &#34;perfect&#34; fit but it does the job very well.
B00LBIX48K|5|Super Bright. 6000k has a nice white even color<br />Fast shipping. Easy to install. No flickering. Excellent Customer Service.
B00PBOOQ9Q|1|The fob shell won't stay close and it keep setting off my alarm
B0002KKTT0|5|Just right for a sure grip and the ability to get a screw back out when necessary.
B00407TVAE|5|Perfect Match for the car.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Came in on time & worth its price!
B00TIQU3X6|1|The sticker isn't really the size n its to small so im not really happy fir that
B00KTIQAZW|5|Worked as described. Very simple to program!
B0006HJO1S|5|Very good fuel injectors, Best seller
B00062Z5R0|5|Just what I needed for the MSD Coil on my 2000 5.9 Dakota Quad Cab 4x4.
B00NTOHWOQ|5|I bought these and some of the cheaper ones.  The cheaper ones just don't compare to these. These had way better light, major improvement over standard halogen replacements. The cheap ones look pretty much identical except when they are on, the light emitted was half that of halogen. Don't save a few bucks an regret it like I did. I just ordered more of these good ones to replace more lights in my 2003 BMW 530i.
B0000CBIK5|5|great pump
B00DW4YLLK|5|We bought these to store gas for the upcoming hurricane season for our generator. They are good quality and the price is great. We will more than likely purchase some more in the next few months.
B000CGVPQU|5|Great price. Do there job. What more do you need.
B00H9S71LW|5|Definitely worth the money if you're looking to get OBD data for you auto. Works great with ANY app on your Android device, and can read almost any code. If you are having trouble reading some data, it's not this device's fault! Does more than I expected and I'm glad I didn't go with a cheaper model.
B004TSP0UY|5|Awesome quality, gave my car a total face lift
B00DAFND10|5|I was happily surprised by colour match, fit and quality if the part.  My only small concern was that the inside if the bumper lip behind the grill could have used a shot of paint and clear coat from the rear angle.  It was much easier to put on than I expected.  I would buy again, hope I do not need to.  I would recommend this company.  Yes even shipping was good.
B00EPA7CZC|5|It is what it isss
B00M78820I|5|Perfect! It works great!
B00DJVOMC4|2|Super small
B000Z0HVHA|5|worked well, very well made
B001O06GPS|5|Great item and service...thanks!
B00T36PXUO|2|Product did not perform as expected. I put the large container in the storage area, a small bag under the kitchen sink and a small bag under the front storage area.<br />Had mice in all three areas, three weeks after installation.
B00029KA8G|4|A little difficult to put on, but it feels and looks great once done.  I put this on a 2001 VW Jetta GLS and should have gotten the 4&#34; version, so that made stitching a little more difficult as I tried to pull the edges as close together as possible.
B004MTCMMY|5|Great little stickers. They look nice and are easy to put on.
B007D7QOH6|4|Great value, good strong action, only reason not 5 stars is the ends are a little bulky compared to the OEM arms but they fit well. Also they included the ball that mounts to the vehicle at each end of the arm. The ball is gold anodized instead of black powder coat if that matters to anyone's visual sense (I would have liked them to be black like the OEM. Over all great value with a couple of nitpicks.
B000A0EJD4|5|Beats paying 4 times this for the dealer to do it.  Takes about 5 to 10 mins to do - most of that is just making sure you snapped everything back right.
B000UXHDJ8|5|Looks good on back window!
B00KVESGYW|5|I use this in my diesel Mercedes. It seems to help with fuel mileage on long trips, I can get about 30 mpg vs. the estimated 24 mpg on the highway. The gallon container is a better deal because its concentrated and less per ounce than the other quantities I've found.
B00CAYDVAK|5|Amazing what a difference. If you are thinking of changing any of your bikes stock performance parts, this is a must have starting point.
B000BYGD2O|5|Direct fit. Worked great.
B00DP5KF3O|5|Colors are true to picture and worked great to match our jet ski
B003721CC8|2|It put a lot of pressure on my truck lid in one spot, I ended up not using it cause i didn't want it to damage my truck, I use cinch straps in a V to the truck lid so it disperses the load if I put 2 heavy bikes on my rack
B00KKNHYWE|5|I love this thing . Clears fault codes using bluetooth,  pairs w tablet  which is definite plus . .
B00D8FR34K|5|Great quality lights.
B009DJOT0Q|5|Unit was priced right. It fit correctly and works perfectly.
B00HT2Y7ZG|2|Didn't clean the air like it claimed.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Super bright! Works excellent!
B00BUHL9RK|5|Ordered these months earlier.  Finally got around to the project, and thought I had purchased OEM Mercedes.  So I was a little apprehensive to use these.  But, I've never had a bad Beck-Arnley product so I decided to use them.  They appear to work great!  If anything goes awry, I'll update.
B001QVMXKM|5|It came in very quickly and fits pretty snug , I ordered a size small. It's over all a very nice helmet for the size.
B008427D88|4|Fit my Suzuki LTZ 250 and Nissan Frontier rivet holes perfectly. Attach and detach easily.
B004YWP834|5|Exactly what I expect., thank you.
B00XCANO4O|5|This is the best tire gauge I have ever owned...It's big, rugged, and very easy to use and read.  I have 3 vehicles in my yard, everything from a compact with aggravatingly short and tight valve stems, to my pick up truck that is very easy to check.  This thing with its extra long length and dual opposed air chucks makes it a cinch on any car or truck to get a quick and very accurate reading.  In many ways this gauge just does what any tire gauge does.  But is just far better in being very user friendly, dead on accurate, and, its read out is very large and clear. (It's also as tough looking as they come. I think you could run over this thing and not affect it in the least).  I particularly like the tire like cover over the meter that is not hard at all, but very soft like a real tire and doesn't irritate your hand.  Getting a reading on this is as simple as just pushing in on the valve and the reading immediately pops up and holds there on release until you push a little reset button on the side. One may be put off when first opening this because of its size.  It's really long and big and you may get a false impression that it will be ungainly or awkward to us, neither of which being at all true. In reality, its far easier to use than the cheap ones that don't allow any variety in valve location or length.  (It's so long you can even use this standing up on some wheels, for those whose knees have seen better days). I effortlessly read all the tires on all three of my vehicles, and am now keeping it in the truck tool box.<br /><br />In conclusion, like all guys, I have had some form of tire gauge around the house since my teenage days.  You can get by with a much cheaper one of course, but if you want the best, something really rugged and accurate that makes it as easy as it can get, I highly recommend this one.  Undoubtedly the best gauge I have ever used, and could very well be the last I ever own...<br /><br />Free unit provided in exchange for a fair and honest review...
B001J5YA4C|5|totally pleased with this product
B009DJYDQ6|2|wrong part arrived. ordered for the rear door and one for the front door arrived with the key hole. the one in this picture was the one i ordered.had to use the back section from the old handle.
B00KR7GJ4M|5|Love it
B000YJDC5C|1|Cheaply made
B000GU0NW4|5|Worked like a charm, exactly the tool I needed.  Better price than what the dealership offered and I had it at my doorstep in 2 days!
B00538KEE6|1|Did not work well<br /><br />After only a week started to peel up on the back window of my truck<br /><br />I will send pictures later<br /><br />As a navy vet not a good display of my service
B0023V9J0Q|5|Worked great!
B008KZQTHA|2|Not very clear on what wire goes where took an hour just to figure out what wire went to the factory wiring.
B000CFSFUU|5|Absolutely awesome product. Tune isn't required but very much so recommended. AEM has an awesome line of intakes.
B005DM0OC4|5|Great fit looks awesome under the hood truck feels way faster great piece of mind knowing my coolant is clean
B0055DQCOU|5|good to go,
B00K53DSZ6|5|Good Battery ffor the price.

B001RBCU90|5|I love this decal for it shows I love my dog
B00T47K604|5|very, ery good
B00KTHVKQM|5|Fit and worked as expected.
B00UFERZKO|5|This was a great purchase.  We have used it multiple times for our computer & cell phones.  When the engine is running, our phones will charge to full capacity in about an hour!  We had read on another review that the fan can be noisy, so we were cautioned about using it at night.  The fan has some noise, but when traveling, we have not been bothered by it.<br />Overall, this was a great purchase for a really great price!
B004BCJJ3W|5|These are a perfect match and install easily.
B00O9SGTWW|5|perfect!, saves battery in trailer big time. good light, similar to OEM color
B000AMKUIA|3|I returned this product with a full refund .<br />I never installed this because of the instalation requirments were to timely and a device needed to be installed in the car .<br />I was looking for a replacement from my factory horn which has a terrable sound .<br />Fortunately I don't use my horn often I was just looking for a little more juice in the sound .
B005Z8HAUK|5|Great item.
B00FFDV7LI|5|Great fit, works just as good as new! Fitted on a 2008 Lance Charming, also had the impossible screw already attached to the motor. Can't complain!
B00C3OCI88|5|Absolutely love it. The leather is genuine and tough, and the best fits well.
B00BZQQTPS|3|I bought this for  my 2015 Ram 2500 after getting the part number from the dealersip I bought my truck from. It fits okay. I find that the cap itself is small for the hitch so it has to stretch around the outside of the hitch plug. Its not going to fall off for sure.  Updated Review 9/14/2015: This does not fit my Class V 2.5&#34; hitch. If the hitch is dry it will stay put but after a drive in the rain it slips off. This fits a 2&#34; hitch perfectly but not suitable for the 2.5&#34; Class V hitch that comes on 2500 & 3500..
B007X6KYTG|5|worked perfectly couldnt be happyier
B003TNSMQO|5|This fit my Lowrance Mark 5 Pro-x fish locator perfectly. Easy to install and functions very nicely.
B001GG4KHG|5|My son is a hockey player and he loves it so do I. Thanks so much.. 😀😀
B00F4PCPMW|4|I like it considering on my CBR that part was just black so this made it look better
B003KS59WI|4|This lanyard is pretty dope, made of good quality material. only gripe is i wish it had subaru printed on both sides, not just one.
B0033WDIB0|4|Good product, should include more zip ties.
B005LDBDI4|5|Used to touch up spots on my gutters.  Worked great.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Fast, easy and fits. Great transaction.
B00E9BSBBG|5|I love it. It's a great bumper sticker. Just be careful putting it on. It's actually a few stickers in one making a whole image. So just be careful so you don't get any wrinkles or bumps in the image or anything like that.
B00HNW9SRO|4|It's a little bit small for my Nissan 01 but I stretched it a little & if fits I been looking for a cotton fabric like this I couldn't find any where so I give it 4 or 3 stars
B000BMWXZM|5|smart gifts to give to co-workers
B004KEJYAY|1|Leaked like a sieve through both the hose and the lid, and did a very effective job in coating everything in my toolbox in a thin, persistent layer of hydraulic fluid.<br /><br />I'd like to return it, but it pretty much had to go straight into the trash.
B005S2K1GS|1|I wish I could give this 1/3 of a star. I received the vest. It looked good when I got it out. Went to unbutton it to put it on. The middle button ripped out of the thing. Fine quality here(sense the sarcasm?)! Well I tried it on to check the size. Mind you I wear a 3XL tshirt. And ordered a 5XL vest just to be safe (due to recent comments about it plus the size chart) and it was still to tight! Why is there so much guess work? I didn't like it and as a bad taste in my mouth as a 1st impression I won't order from First Manufacturing again!
B004RFKBEO|4|Love this thing. Fairly stable. Super easy to load bikes. Easy to put on and trake off with two people. Great buy.
B00L3FL690|5|It works well - and relatively quiet.  I would buy again.
B00YKD4J82|5|Works great for my 7-year-old.  Would be even better with a visor but it's great for the price.
B00REJX30Y|5|Love it, and was easy to put on
B00HEZKEFA|5|I've tried 2 other popular brands with results no better than soapy water. They were total waste of money. THIS ONE WORKS! Sprayed on my spoke rims and grime oozed off. Had to double check, IS safe for all types of rims.
B000CLSOLE|4|Order 2, not sold as a pair
B009Z7UJZA|5|Flaps did not fit on my honda coupe so put them on my honda sedan and they fit perfectly.
B000CIGDKG|5|Did just what I was looking for. Make sure you read all instructions 3 times and keep them with you as you install !!!!!!
B00DEJTGVI|5|Great product, arrived on time and was an easy install.  I put these mud flaps on a 2014 Ram 2500  Crew Cab CTD SLT.  No issues at all used factory holes and every thing lined up nicely.  Would not hesitate to purchase a again.
B00BG3GKG8|3|Nice price.... But wrong part
B0006IX87S|5|Excellent product
B004HCOE8Q|5|One of the best chrome polish that I have used and I used many

B00KQPJSVQ|2|non marring- but they bend too easily
B00CCSD6CW|5|Looking good on my Acura TL
B00CO6OLFS|4|Can't go wrong for the price has everything you will ever need and then some
B006SA3ZB2|5|Loks great on a motorcycle helmet,made of vinyl i think..
B00PBHZHWS|1|Very cheap product. The threading does not keep the mirror tight so it moves around during my ride.
B008HZOZ2E|5|Ceramic pads with replacement brackets and brake pad lubricant.  You cannot beat that price!
B001946B04|5|Great product!  It makes me feel better to know I am using an environmentally friendly product.
B009VTHRMK|3|Eh, not overly impressed with any improvement over worn out originals.
B00CWNVAPW|5|THESE MIRRORS ARE LONGER AND ALLOW YOU TO SEE MUCH MORE OF THE AREA IN THE BACK OF A SUV AND ON THE BACK SIDES.
B001LHVOVK|5|Excelent product
B001KSAMZE|5|1999 Cadillac Escalade. Worked great. Fixed problem with wipers, alarm, windows, interior lights, etc.  Simple plug in. Getting TO the BCM was harder than anticipated, but I saved about $400 doing it myself
B005M226VW|3|This replacement glass didn't fit correctly in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ. It was about 1/8&#34; too big all around. (1/4&#34; overall width and height)
B00ZEGKG4A|5|it was just as expected.  came fast
B000NOKNKA|5|Nice
B000CIQ2O8|5|Great price and quick delivery.
B004YX1Z4O|2|does;nt hold up to the weather to well wears out on the corner
B00C5RB03W|5|Better buy this today if you want to keep the red wasps and hornets out of your sewer hose
B000Q6UEW2|5|This is exactly what I needed to change the oil in my MKV Rabbit.
B007GR5YII|5|Absolutely love this helmet.
B000FW7V50|5|great price---- fast shipping
B0048WARQI|5|if you can be patient removing the tappet screws this is a great looking chrome piece for your bike.
B00CKFWKWY|5|Has worked for every vehicle I have used it on.
B001BN76IE|4|If putting in a 2004 F-150 5.4 like mine.Been in for about 3 weeks. Sounds much smoother and mileage seems better around town, have not had a chance to check highway mileage yet since I was pulling an enclosed trailer. 11 mpg with that.
B000C57W40|5|Worth getting to me, I bough this along with the center link when I ordered my inner/outer tierods, pitman arm, and droparm. That way I could just drop the entire assembly together and copy over the measurement close enough to drive up to the alignment shop. I'll have the old ones after I bust the old assembly apart along with the center link.<br />These will be reusable and after I check all the hole diameters on the center link I will decide if it is any good. The thing besides being able to just copy the assembly over I don't have to waste time busting these rusted things off the tierods, figuring out if I need to turn it left or right while trying to get my vehicle back together, and I don't have to wait for these to arrive if it was too hard to remove the old ones.
B009IFIETM|5|Easy install
B000C2S78I|5|Installed 2 months ago  in a 2005 civic and no problems so far. Hopefully it will outlast my oem milage one.
B008UEHEKM|5|Definitely helps keep my engine cooler, fit perfectly on my 1999 Honda Civic Si, and looks great under the hood. Highly recommend this product if shopping for a high-end aftermarket radiator for a great price
B00O3H8TZY|4|nice
B00CIWQC9Q|5|Nicely made, fits great.
B004DRV8HA|3|Very reasonably priced and they work, Fastening brackets snap off but light can be safely jury rigged by garage.Having clear lens is important. After a few moths the cheap bracket snapped. I push headlight back in regularly.
B0030GIWJC|3|The fog light seem to be made from the same manufacture as the one on my vehicle, which is a plus BUT, mine is clear and this one here has a tint to it which does not coordinate with the other side. Does not state that the glass is tinted.
B00GW3E7C6|3|Adjustment strap kept slipping, had to tie a knot around the strap to keep it from loosening.  Easy fix but something that shouldn't have to be done.
B005UUIP3O|5|Great self defence item.
B00D8D1YYC|1|I have a 2014 BMW X1.  This cover is too big for my key.  Also, it looks really cheap.  Doubt it really protects the key from anything other than a scratch.  Didn't even bother to spend the extra money to send it back, right into the garbage.
B000CISLSI|1|The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. They were easy to install and fit perfectly. Down side: While driving down the road they shake so much that the images are very distorted. If they are being used to back up a trailer, they are great. I would not recommend purchasing this product. If I could return them, I would.
B00LOS5TJ4|5|running great
B00AHJZBCG|5|I have bought a number of flood lights and apparently this is the one I was looking for without knowing it. I love this one and will be ordering a second. Super light as in what it weighs in your hand. Super bright pure white spot light. Charge lasts forever.
B00QQYX11Y|5|They are heavy duty
B005DSO4RY|5|Item came fast, packaged well and did not require dropping the bumper. Having both the upper radiator and lower bumper grills provides a clean, custom look. Very pleased with item.
B0060HVFO2|2|WORKS OKAY ON SMALL SURFACE SCRATCHES BUT NOT WELL AT ALL ON DEEP SCRATCHES ON MAROON PAINT
B006BDWM4C|5|Worked great for may 07 malibu. I had it cut at true value for 50 cents. Walmart messed one up the first time so i had to buy 2 times. Saved some cash. Key appears to be slightly longer. I do have to jiggle the key a little bit. Easy to program.
B00HH3UY5O|5|Great seller ! The small issue I had was very quickly taken care of, 5 stars***** Thank you !
B000V4ZGRM|5|just like the one I replaced
B002RZUSN0|1|I think that I would have been better off printing this sticker on my printer at home. Looks like thats what they did here. Terrible quality. Look elsewhere.
B004I12424|5|absolutely a perfect fit. Thank you !!!
B002X6VXL4|5|I love mine which was a gift from my daughter several years ago.  That is why I have purchased two of them as gifts for others.
B000X3EWK8|5|did not install yet, but I think one piece was used, actually I don't care a used one, what I care is the different shape with others ---- there is no middle gap on the pad, see the photos...<br /><br />Update Sep. 15, 2015<br />After consulting experts, I have known it's designed as this although very very uncommon. I have installed pads successfully last weekend, you may write a note on this part I thinkAfter consulting experts, I have known it's designed as this although very very uncommon. Sorry my bad, seller may write a note on this part I think.
B0021KVFG0|1|Installed in 2010 MDX TECH with Curt hitch.  It did not work.  There is a vague reference to the need for relays and obtaining them from Acura in the online description.<br />Acura does have relays but this wiring does not have the sockets to install the relays.  There are two relays in the OEM Acura wiring, part # 08L91-STX-200A, none in this product. My inquiry to Curt customer service resulted in  acknowledgement of the potential need for relays, but no place to install them. No help there.<br />Other reviewers indicate their product worked or had inline fuses. Mine has none.  I did put fuses in the fuse panel for trailer wiring although Curt does not mention the need for the fuses.  I have power to the Curt module and that is where it stops.  Mine is either defective or not the correct model as specified.
B008A2PEPQ|3|Good quality for sure, with a great look with seemingly decent durability.  However as stated in another review these fit SMALL.  I got the 5x just be sure and it only barely fit me and not with enough comfort to keep it.  If you wear 2X shirts a little loosely the 5x will probably barely fit you.  If you wear XL shirts comfortably the 4x is probably the best way to go, and so on.  I don't know what it is about biker clothes and these stupid size categories.  Can't you just call the 5x &#34;2X&#34; like everyone else?  Also if you are tall (above 6 foot) what you order may not even make it to your belt while you are standing.  I think that is a silly look personally.
B0018JUJ9O|5|Had one of my catalytic converters stolen (passenger side) on my 05 Tundra 4.7 V8. The muffler shop only replaced the missing cat and the o2 sensor that was attached.  I had an engine check light come on because the old Air Fuel Ratio Sensor was original and the O2 sensor was too new. Hence, the computer detected that there was a leak between the forward sensor and the o2 sensor on the same side.  I decided to change the remaining 3 sensors to bring them back up to speed.  Afterwards, you can feel the difference the new sensors make on a vehicle with 70,000 miles that is 10 years old.  It runs quieter and with good response. After some driving, the check engine light went away with the new sensors and I could not be happier with the money I saved.<br /><br />To replace all four sensors, I also bought the following:<br /><br />ABN 3 Piece 3/8&#34; Drive Oxygen Sensor Wrench Socket Set<br /><br />Denso 234-4260 Oxygen Sensor (rear sensor in cat) ( I only needed one of these.)<br /><br />Denso 234-9051 Air Fuel Ratio Sensor (forward sensor) (needed 2 of these)<br /><br />OEM plugs and thread anti-seize are included.<br /><br />The hardest part is removing the old sensors. Take your time and use WD40 or similar to loosen the part.
B0002X520S|5|Yeah, this stuff is significantly better than Sno-Seal, just like everybody says.  Lower melting point, absorbs better, no hair dryer needed, makes the boots look better.  Will see how it holds up with use, but is looks like a bit better product.  Sno-Seal user for many years.
B00LG07MZE|3|I bought this specifically for my 2013 Ford Escape and with all honesty I've only used it once but it flimsily did its job. The extra wings at the corners seem a little excessive and seem to get in the way.  But all and all I feel you get what you paid for and I feel like I paid for a cheap sun shade.
B00IKZO332|5|Awesome lights.  And BRIGHT!  I'm so happy with all the lights I've bought from them.
B00YB5GAEA|1|I didn't get a chance to use the light. After charging my wife went to unplug the USB cable and the entire back came off the light. Needless to say the construction of this light is poor.
B001GG6E0W|5|i bought this to put on the back of my car. So far so good! Installation was easy and I even messed it up a bit and fixed it (something I've never been able to do with any decal before- typically if you screw up you either deal with it or throw it away). Hasn't faded yet and adds the perfect personality to my car. I'd buy it again if need be.
B009S9RURU|5|These are way better then those stupid yellow baby on board stickers. Had to buy 2 cause these are super cool. Thank you for making these
B00ECW2T38|4|I took my time and installed it carefully, following directions and using the right inserts, and is holding on very well.<br />good grip and enough surface to step comfortably and safely on it, yet doesn't gets in your way when moving around the back of your vehicle..... perhaps because I am already &#34;shin trained&#34; by the hitch ball... ;)
B00IJBXNHE|5|Fit perfectly and easy to install!  Love it.
B00LG1YVMU|4|All gaskets., filter and 5 Quarts of semi-synthetic oil were present. My only complaint was no directions as advertised. Its a pain to change if you don't have a motorcycle lift. I used a floor jack. I may let the shop do it next time.
B0046BG0GC|3|Easily shreds...kind of cheesy.  But I love the betty boop
B00684TIVE|1|Not working
B00TX3UXD4|5|My car gets a lot of that spittle sap on it in the driveway and then pollen and dirt stick to it like a magnet.  Washing was always a chore, but now with Chemical Guys Maxi Suds the crud stuck onto my car just dissolves away without a lot of scrubbing.  It breaks away grime from my rims easily as well, which also took a good deal of brushing.  The rinse away is great. This is better than any car wash product I've used in 30 years!
B002DOFOZ2|5|Worked in automotive before retiring and found  the Gorilla brand the very best. Lock socket fits over lock lug  so there is no muss, no fuss no slipping. Some lock sets have a real shallow design on the end that the lock fits into and have fun keeping the two pieces together long enough to remove or install the lock. Make mine Gorilla brand.
B00S8KQ83C|4|A bit challenging to put the seats and I hope they will replace the elastic thing's on the sides with a belt, so you can make it snug fit, but all in all we liked the looked of this on our Hyundai Tucson 2015 model!
B00B4KP7PI|5|yes very good
B0028OQI8Y|5|Added these to my little guy to replace my red/Amber lensed marker lights.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Bought to go on all off road vehicles and all my friends too (5 Sets)
B0053ZNMDE|4|Be careful, you can't get it back in once screwed up
B007PVIARW|5|Fit my 2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring well. I got this because with two dogs riding in the back of my car, fabric cargo covers tend to get pushed around and bunch up and don't end up doing anything to keep out hair or other messes. This tray works well, is totally waterproof, and easy to clean. The only minor annoyance is there is a tiny (maybe a centimeter) gap between the rear wheel wells and the sides of the try so some dog hair does tend to get in there. It's not a huge deal for me because this still covers much more than a cloth cover ever did.
B0081T3PP4|5|Cold as ever. easy to use!
B009D291C4|5|Excellent tool ! Definitely worth buying .
B000AP1MU2|5|Great filter as expected. I put these in all of my vehicles.  It's a bit pricy up front but it's the last one you'll buy and it will increase performance and possibly save you a bit on mpg.
B00ORLLJQC|4|Be forewarned this replacement shell does not come with VW emblem sticker. Even though the video and other reviewers says it does.<br />Unfortunately, I disassembled one of my remotes before receiving these replacements and in the process destroyed the original VW emblem sticker. Other than that the replacement shell looks, feels and operates as good as the original remote. This is a quality item. One other problem was that the rotating butt end of the original flip-out key did not fit well in the new shell. It bound up and would not flip out. Visually they look the same but the diameter of the hole in the original key is slightly less than the replacement key. But if you are careful you can drive the really small split pin out that holds the key into the butt end and transfer the original key into the new butt end. Once done it works perfectly. I am not giving this item 5 stars just because of the lack of emblem stickers. If they had come with the remote shells it would be a solid 5 stars.
B007USCM7E|5|Easy as pie. Save a trip to the shop.
B00N160W1M|5|Love it! Excited to put it on!
B00G4V3GZA|5|totally pleased with this product
B000IY6UR0|5|I put these on a 1988 Toyota pickup with 22R motor. They fit perfectly! Another brand name I bought cheaper kept falling off the distributor. All these wires are premeasured, numbered and the boots sealed.
B00MRDARLK|2|When I tried to install the strip and began to peel it off it came off with torn small edges
B000CQHVLI|5|Stuff has been on the converter for about a month and is still sealing up the hole fine. I'm a bit surprised it has held up so well.
B008F8QGLQ|5|Perfect fit! Switched them out within minutes and they adjust easily. Prompt shipping too! All around great experience.
B00XWWXRPI|3|Came packaged nicely and was easy to set up.... but the hooks that came with it would NEVER fit over the front seat of any car. The way the hooks click onto the frame there was no way to hook them to the headrest. We ended up having to use zip ties, and then cutting them off when the kids were done using them. My husband is a big guy (6'4&#34;), so even collapsed, it was in the way of my daughters legs in the back seat. My son didn't have that problem, as I'm shorter and could have the front seat pulled up more. It worked, they were sturdy and were easy to use, but NOT ideal for quick set up and take down.
B00HW58R92|4|works great
B00JN1XGRG|2|The tip and base are starting to turn brownish after a couple months, it stands out on my black car, good thing my car has other blemishes that I don't care too much for the looks of the antenna.  Also the reception is barely any better than it was before with no antenna.
B000HZT89C|5|Bought it to put in my new car,  and to replace my old one (11 years old)  I love it.
B00JM5ZH5M|5|Bought these boards for our 2015 Chevy Traverse because they looked like the factory ones and our 5 year old needed an extra step to climb in. The dealer wanted $740 to install OEM boards! These Westin boards look great, work great and where pretty easy to install, especially with You Tube on my side. I would totally recommend these to anyone looking to add running boards to their vehicle.
B000B5ZM6Q|4|They fit perfectly.  I'm a little concerned there is nothing at the bottom to hold them on the tire since I live in a high wind area but I will reserve my judgment until I've had them longer.  If I find that is a problem I will update my review accordingly.<br /><br />EDIT: We've had a couple really windy days as fall sets in and these have stayed in place perfectly.<br /><br />EDIT: (Nov/3/2015) Down to 4 stars... why?  I found one cover off the tire a few feet away after some high winds. I'm NOW wondering how these will &#34;hang on&#34; during a Maine winter outdoors, As much as a hassle as it might be I'm considering adding rivets/eye hooks on the bottom to run a bungee behind the tire.
B00IN5X2P4|5|Works great
B007982OXM|3|Works as stated but not very tight in cup holder
B00BCRMBSO|3|These were pretty easy to put on my seats. I've got a 09 Ford Fusion. It's a pretty thin material and I was worried it would tear. It did on the drivers seat a little bit. But that was the only spot. Other then that it's pretty comfortable to sit on and doesn't move around. The wheel cover fits very snugly. I've got three kids and they can really make a mess, so I feel better having covers on the seats. I'm curious to see how well these will wash when the time comes.
B00D6YIQ4Y|4|They were a little long for my Jeep Patriot. But they look nice once installed.
B000N4UQL6|5|Ass advertised.
B00JA3BMDW|5|I use this every time I cook a pizza on my ceramic cooker.  It allows me to make sure the pizza stone is hot enough.  You can't go wrong  given the price.  I highly recommend this product.
B000CAINDE|5|Needed one of these for my '07 Nissan Sentra. I originally got the Jumbo size and it was too big. Standard size fits just right.<br /><br />It helps keep my car decently cooler during the summer. It can only do so much in a hot climate, but more importantly it keeps the sun from ruining my steering wheel.
B00REJX5BQ|5|Great Tonneau cover, can't beat this price.<br />Pass the test on a huge rain storm and NO water leaks. Looks great on my 14 ram 1500 short bed
B0012TRBPK|5|Love the value and quality of BikeMaster batteries. Been buying these for all my bikes for years with zero trouble.
B007NZ9UOW|5|Exact replacement as OEM, car rides smooth. Just reuse your springs if they are in good condition.
B00FC22PVS|1|There terrible will never buy another set! They flicker and go out half the time they don't even try to come on
B007OC9JGI|5|espensive but efficient
B00L6F04U4|5|Very satisfied! These lights were a direct replacement for my camper. They went on in a snap and are very bright. Just what I was looking for.
B000G2AOU8|5|Just as advertised. Follow the instructions and make sure calipers are sanded and cleaned with the supplied brake cleaner. Looks sharp!
B000C2SIR8|5|It the right part ,good quality..
B00BAZCOT4|5|Yello
B00KHUQ9NK|3|It's okay.. But it reaks alot. I hope it goes away
B000AS1XYE|5|Lunas only makes QUALITY PRODUCTS.
B0044A3086|5|Excellent
B007TY0SQG|5|Fits great!!
B000ILOK84|5|Works perfectly on my 1964 corvette 327
B008VSB0DE|4|Use this to blow water out of garden hoses for winter storage and also to empty the water lines in a Travel Trailer for winter storage as well.  Works very well.
B00XQUVJ3S|1|Bolts that secure the locking pin backed out after 10 min ride after installation. Added a lock washer to prevent this from happening again but I wouldn't expect this from a part specifically made for a motorcycle.
B00QXZQ5KA|5|Nice merchandise
B00IPEF3ZK|4|Cute but they do not fit smoothly on my PriusC.
B000C7UTQG|5|It is doing a great job
B00H7HDGG4|3|I Really Like It It Fits My Honda Accord Perfect But I Did Have A Little Trouble With The Instructions & Figuring Out How To Use The Pins.
B00ILEA4JE|5|It worked great and came quickly.
B0077FINY6|5|Excellent
B00V7TJ5HM|5|Perfect !
B004ME8MZ0|5|actually pretty nice. I was not expecting much based on the price. from the front od truck, look like OEM. they do vibrate somewhat and I found that I can use the factory mirror for most, but need the extensions only slightly. great for backing but as stated, do vibrate some. there is an adjustment screw inside mirror  to prevent movement but is plastic, so be careful not to over do it.
B000F0QRXE|5|Fits great on my 1995 F-350.
B003RVKYZU|5|Did not work at all
B00221YLQE|5|the cover I got for my Polaris fit perfect. the price was better than anyone else too.
B0002U2V1Y|5|did my classic porsche and worked extremely well-smooth as glass
B00NEL7NY8|3|Have not used it yet. I will say though, one of the bottles lost half or more of the liquid in the box before it arrived. From pressure maybe.<br />The lids were on tight, the box soaked.
B003CEJWI2|5|Very good cover , price even better. Give my 2005 sienna nice look. Will buy it again.
B000BQKVOI|4|I use it often. Good for small places and easy to empty.
B00063YKNY|5|This link is what I think about this product I purchased: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsPh-EgH65M
B002QVY14C|5|intake kit work great.
B002UC8RN8|5|As advertised. Easy fix. Quick delivery.
B00DRG2NA4|5|All I did was wash and pre wax and I could already see the shine. Water just rolled off the car like water off a ducks back.
B00EZ6X86I|5|Looks great
B007KPERVG|3|easy to install and looked like new until it rained.  one got water in it and stays fogged up, but still looks better than original. I did not call to complain.
B000J3FP1C|5|Missing a page of the instructions...not that they were that usable anyways. If you're buying this with the confidence to install yourself, you are probably competent enough to figure it out. I pulled up the instructions online (Google search) just to make sure I didn't miss anything important. The brackets are thick and look good. Don't toss the oem bolts in the trash until you're done, you do reuse some of them.
B0089LT6KM|5|Fit good no complaints.
B009B923EW|4|It does a great job keeping my f-350 cool and dark.  Seems to be holding up well to heavy use (being put up and taken down) Wish it covered a little more than it does though.
B0013T7OL0|5|great
B000B7RCJE|5|It's a new spark plug what else can I say just what the doctor ordered
B00ZYTX932|5|Great product! I highly recommend it.<br />Instruction were clear to follow.
B000CKGAV6|4|good so far.
B00FT101VS|5|Super easy installation and looks super clean.
B00XA3C1TW|4|Direct fit so easy instal. Pretty bright and I love the color it produces. Would have spent the extra money to get color changing demon eyes if I knew about them
B0001EW044|5|Works well
B004I0YK2C|4|OK
B004PLAGEK|5|This product is just as advertised.
B006QGD996|4|These work great and at 15 feet the straps are plenty long.  I'm using these to hold my Jeep hard top on the ceiling of my garage, and they seem more than adequate.  My only complaint is that that plastic ratchet handle covers slip off far too easily.
B00CHDA58A|5|Very accurate for my 2010 Honda CR-V. My car looks better and newer after I fixed it.
B00BDQL8ZG|5|A little plumbers tape and this works great, no leaks
B00EN4MV9M|5|Love my vinyl Om decal.  I have it on the back window of my SUV, and it hasn't faded, peeled, curled, or chipped.  A couple of people have stopped me to ask what it means, which I love.  It opens up conversation with those who don't know.
B00V3YUBPG|5|Great product as described. Did not alter ride whatsoever. Truck looks great, and install was painless!!
B003YDFW1W|3|Sturdy. Not a big fan of the paint job with the blue paint. Looks nice on the car.
B00OB68DTE|3|Better than chemical feed threw the power washer but takes about 6 ounces of soap to get a decent foam with the green soap. Have not tried the others yet but the green is the only one that specifies its for the foam cannon. Also says you only need 1-2ounces. Overall I'm happy with it but I'm pretty disappointed with the lack of foam that their soap provides. Also where the fitting for the power washer goes on is leaky. I put about 10 layers of pipe tape on with no luck. Buy some pipe dope before you order and put a ton on the threads.
B005R4LFIU|2|Had these professionally installed because of the wiring and look phenomenal on my truck! They pair well with the red and black look of my truck and the halos look incredible<br /><br />***Update 2 years later<br /><br />After the bulbs only lasting a couple months and tired of replacing them, had LEDs installed and still have been having issues with the driving lights shorting out... with how much of a pain it is to access the headlights i am about to put the stock back on to get rid of this headache... aside from the halos, your better off tinting your oem headlights to go for a similar look.
B002VVIC06|5|Works great and easy to install
B003FFP2X2|5|solve my problemgreat tool
B001RMT5Q0|4|They fit, that is good.  Everything went together good in my 2003 ford Taurus.  The only goofy thing is you have to detach two metal circle clips that hold a wiring harness to the back of the headlight assembly.  I pried them off the old headlight with a common screwdriver.  Then I took a small needle nose pliers and opened the holes back up a little bit.  Then I placed the new wiring harness onto the new headlight over a plastic peg.  I put the little circle clips over the plastic peg and took a small deep well socket and placed it over the circle clip (socket diameter smaller than the clip), and hit the socket with the handle of my common screwdriver to press them over the plastic peg, reattaching the wiring harness to the new headlight assembly.  Looks like new...
B006C169L0|5|This is for my 2014 Grand Cherokee.  This is the first fitted sunshade I have ever bought.  I love the fact that it has a rigid feel to it and it comes with a case for storage.  I will have to buy one of these for every vehicle I buy from now on.  Very happy.<br /><br />Glad it fits my awkward windshield size as I had issues with the ones in stock at auto stores.
B00YB5GAEA|2|I had high expectations from the product, but it doesn't seem to meet even the average ones..<br />On the first day itself, the back of the light, where the usb plug has to be fitted, came out while removing the plug, that shouldn't happen.<br />For a rechargeable device, doesn't it make sense to make the device which indicates if it is getting charged or not, no such indication is there, I just have to assume that no circuit got broke when the back came off and that it would still recharge properly next time.
B003TP310Y|1|The only problem purchasing products on line, you are unable to see the manufacturer of the product beforehand.  I purchased a set of headlight assemblies and the manufacture was Eagle Eye, the light reflectors fell off within 2 years.  I replaced one in April with another brand and supplier.  The second assembly from the new supplier is another Eagle Eye which I think is junk.  What do I do?
B005ESO6NK|5|Very cute....make me smile
B0075XHDHI|1|not worth the high price, can't get the first flare to work without going off center, cutter is poor quality. tried nickel copper and steel , same results , over half of the flares leaked.
B0028WNNW0|5|1
B009YLT33G|4|I installed this winshield and it works and looks just great. I only will clean it with a microfiber cloth to avoid getting any scrathes.<br />Very happy and an excellent price.
B0058JBY1M|4|Good one, very hard and stiff....  but paid more money and feel like very expensive.
B00Q6IBKQS|3|Much more blue than I had expected.
B00367PJTG|5|I got this for my husband  for his birthday.  He just got his dream car - the G8.
B00OZYJVBG|5|Rapid delivery, good looking piece. Easy installation on my road king.
B00KGSCTYQ|5|Great bag. Fits my vulcan custom perfect. Genuine lether. With a nice smooth finish. Nice buckle with a quick disconnect buckle behind for easy opening and closing. Strong magnet to hold down the front lip from the windstream.  Over all superb construction.
B003NBFKDK|1|It arrives with no screws/bots/nuts!!! There is no way I can install it!
B00WMKKXZI|5|Excelent part<br /> for price
B005CCJ25K|5|Very nice , high quality
B00I3Y86QK|3|I really did like this product, installation was very easy. Product description shows everything that is included but do need to make sure when purchasing that everything is shipped complete. I was shorted parts on my order and after a couple of emails back and forth I decided to go through an autoparts to get the missing parts. Other than that its a good product.
B001D003AS|5|Extremely fast shipping from Wholesale Parts and Tools, arrived the day after it was shipped. When I received the gauge set, the high side connector was defective, but a quick email to the supplier got me a replacement shipped out and I received it the very next day. The gauge set seems well made and works as it should. I would have no problem recommending it, especially from a company like Wholesale Parts and Tools that stands behind their products.
B006RQ41L0|5|So far so good. Got this today for my 2015 Ram 1500 with Rambox (Quad Cab, 6.5' bed). installed in a leisurely 45minutes.  Looks good, seems to work well. Will be pouring rain this weekend so that'll be a real test. :)  Just make sure you adjust the tensioners properly with the cover closed and the hottest bit of the day (After this has been sitting in the Sun all day). Then it'll stay properly tensioned and you'll minimize having to make adjustments later.<br /><br />Remember, this only fits the Rambox Ram trucks that come with the accessory mounting rails (all of them do by default, but some trucks in the used market are missing/broken).  If you measure properly everything will drop right into place. Or if you're like me and mess one of them up by an inch, it'll take you an extra 5 minutes to figure it out. :)
B0099XTZIW|5|good value for the price.  the mercury marine dealer wanted<br /><br />good value for the price.  the boat dealership wanted $250 for a starter.
B00NLWFGSU|4|I have the factory once and they are not the same. It's good but not perfect as of thickness and luxury feel. I would give 3 starts for the product but 1 more for the supplier with who I had some requests and all done in time and professionally.
B0026TBFIO|5|It works great. Charge the batteries of my boat without the necesity of any regulator or other things.
B000K3GMT0|5|Works great. It did not come with instructions but it's pretty self explanatory.
B00A2DWXFA|5|This is a perfect cover. I had no problems putting it on or taking it off. It is super convenient.
B005Z8HAUK|4|Purchased at elsewhere.<br />Pros: Fast pumping, easy to use, handy light (ive never used), compact, easy to set up. Allows one to connect hose to tire via thread connector and not have to hold in place.<br /><br />Cons: overheats with larger tires (35&#34;), have to partialy inflate four tires after offroad use, wait 10-20 mins to cool, finish inflation. Has shut down on me at least twice due to overheating. Gauge never read correct pressure,<br /><br />Im working on a cooling system/heatsink to increase operation time. Tough one. Worth the $$$
B003S2E4UE|3|This has worked for some projects like fixing a rear bumper that was unpainted, but I used this to fix an interior part in my car and the weld broke and did not hold up in high temperatures like it should have. I had even waited the specified cure time and it still broke apart.
B00MOWDIGA|5|Thanks
B002DOME1E|4|These come in handy .  When u need them.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Ver y well
B001N75T3C|1|Didn't fit my rzr like it said it would. Had to cut it in four places to make it fit
B005HMND9Q|4|Fast delivery and a great product.
B00O123CBC|5|2003 f150 extended cab long bed. What can I say the lines fit perfect. Delivery was quick and saved alot of time and money. Had 2 lines from front to back on drivers side changed out and bled in about 2 hours. Glad I found fine lines, I highly recommend and will definitely use them again.
B005C1B6LO|1|Emblems are a dissapointment. Too thin. Looks almost like a sticker. Probably look better on interior dash or door panels. Got charged double shipping for an item that came in the same small package.
B00K889FCI|1|Tried it on my Road King Head light. No<br />Difference
B0024E6V30|1|Provides clean water for our RV.  The best deal for these are from Amazon.
B00IQVBVO4|5|Plate was very nice, had several compliments...am happy with purchase
B008Y973GS|5|perfect fit great price.no problems. NICE JOB !!!
B00QH9GWN2|5|Nicely made and looks great.  We applied ours using the soapy water method with a plastic squeegee, on the back of our RV and it was quick and easy to apply.
B003E2WQE4|5|a good carrier for a small motorcycle
B00K53CLKE|5|Fast and as discribed.. A+
B00Y2OYVX2|5|Work very very good and bright than HID
B0000AY9KE|5|Holds the boat's battery in place.  Does what we needed it to do.  Would recommend.
B000R4BYMM|5|Great
B00W4F1U8A|4|Not bad and works good, just not the same quality of construction as my previous ones.  ie., the cord is a lighter weight and not finished as well.  Hope they last.
B00Q54273I|4|Really good quality jacket, feels very soft and well made. I was hoping it wouldn't be too small, I ordered a medium, and usually wear size medium/large in things so it fit pretty well to what I was expecting. Like the other review says, it does fit a little snug in the shoulder/armpit area which could be a downside if you want to wear a long sleep shirt or layers. But other than that it's great. The fit of the jacket around your waist (how it comes in and hugs your waist a little) doesn't make it feel too small at all. I thought it might but it doesn't, and I am able to move around with it zipped up as well. Not planning on zipping it but that is a plus. Really good purchase~
B005J1Z4CE|5|Good deal for enthusiast.
B00EMKBRMO|3|Love the jeep decal but I wish it was bigger :)
B00C6JE2FC|5|This thermostat is working real good.  The nice thing is we didn't have to re drill the holes.  I would buy it again.
B00K6LQ55C|5|Ordered this for 2015 DCSB TRD OR. Fast delivery.  Good quality packaging.  Between directions provided and online video, installation was pretty straight forward.  I have owned this for several weeks now and endured some drenching rain without any issues.  Haven't hauled anything yet. I would recommend.
B000J4NM7U|5|makes adjustment on breaks a breeze good stuff made very well
B004I11ZKQ|5|I purchased this item on January 19, 2014 and as of Aug 5th, 2015 they are still perfectly clear with no hazing or cloudiness.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Very nifty. Easy to use for both bicycle and car. Socket rotates easily to allow solid connection to valve stem.
B00370N1UG|5|Very effective without any effort.  Must take care of items once cleaned as rust will reappear as it always does.  Highly recommended
B00TNTURCU|5|Excellent Quality!
B00DU0FQDS|5|Bolts up fine.
B001GC2LVM|5|Easy to use. Definitely a good value. I thought I would need 2 but one does the job!
B008032ST0|4|Bags fit correctly and installed easily
B00BCRMAAS|5|not an exact fit but usable in my vehicle. Great value for the cost.
B00HRIHYOS|5|A very durable Sewer hose kit for our travel camper.

B001PYID3G|5|My application: 1999 Ford Taurus, Rear brakes. Fits perfectly. No headache at all
B000C2UKKQ|5|It's a well known brand for its quality and dependability, it's easy to replace.
B00993N0MO|5|Received this item fast, just has discribe
B00E6TXWA6|4|Very interesting product.  Good to try it once.
B009FO0B6A|5|Good
B00IA10Z6A|5|Kids loved them!
B000GRZXX6|4|In my case this was a bolt up replacement for the stock rotor.  Be aware that this rotor is 6mm thick, whereas my stock rotor was 5.5mm thick.  My 2007 T-100 caliper had plenty of room for this rotor and new EBC pads, but that might not be the case for all years or for Scrambler and Thrux.  Everything is bedding in nicely.  Braking is more aggressive than stock, but that probably has more to do with the new HH pads that were installed with the rotor.
B00T9W255I|5|Works great for marking tree stands so i can see them in the dark with a flash light.
B004J326BA|5|Worked as promised!
B008MISF54|5|Just plain good.<br />Used on a KTM 990 Adventure.
B00NJICJHC|5|I ordered a size small and it fits perfectly, it's a very nice helmet. Everything on it goes up and down easily.
B00UBUQXQE|3|I wouldn't buy this one again.
B005SUVQUK|5|Arrived on time no damage done to product.  Nice plastic case. Easy to use worked like a dream. im sure I'll have theses for year to come. Thanks Pit Posse
B00IO4EYMY|5|I am quite satisfied with them
B001CMHF30|5|Fit is great.  Somewhat awkward to roll up while in the car as Velcro is on the pax end.
B000E347SO|5|A perfect fit
B00SFKMRT4|5|They work super well and fit over our seatbelt finder ideally. I will buy again for second car now that I know they work well.
B007CDYWSE|5|Fits properly. K & N is a big-quality brand.
B004PZF9FW|5|Great addition to my jeep, puts switches right were I need them
B007TZ9C08|5|very good
B00U0UWQ2A|5|Great little accessories for the price. Very well made.
B002SINBRQ|5|Thankfully, I haven't needed to use it yet. It's in my trunk just waiting. Hopefully, I won't need it, but if I do...it's there. I love the zippered carry case.
B000H8XK5W|5|Exact original piece and easy to install
B00LZ47RC4|5|good
B00IZR6FDG|1|This product does not match 2008 Audi Q7 3.6 premium as claimed ....I bought 12pcs from 2 stores and non match the car....its thread is short and with bigger outer diameter
B00BD3NW08|5|Been using Bilstein shocks for a minute now on my GMC Yukon and they perform great. Highly recommend them.
B004RNR9QY|5|These hoses have no added taste for the RV water. I have only used them a week so can not comment on durability but the connections are nice
B0013ERRT4|5|Durable.
B000CO7IIQ|5|works great
B00JQH8WZS|5|Thanks
B00HEP4LTU|2|Out for 6psi
B00FPTEW5K|4|Exactly as expected.
B004GNLGTQ|5|Easy to apply, and worked well for what I needed. The heat shrink wraps are a great added touch.
B000E28HWC|5|great product!
B00NXRXXBU|5|Fits Hyundai Veloster, very quite, very good upgrade from the factory blades.
B0002JMYKS|5|Nice set of tools. Made well enough for the jobs. Fast shipping.
B00LMAV6PU|5|Worked great, good price.
B00S5NS9W0|5|Put one in my car and one in my husband's.  We are both pleased with the results.  One side works well for the daytime and the yellow for nighttime driving.  Just wish they were a little bit longer.
B004NNLE82|5|Just as described and perfect
B00KGETCHW|5|These fit perfect in my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!
B007V2C07G|5|Cover fit my 2015 dodge perfectly. Very easy to take off and re-install.  Keeps the truck cool
B00G91GQ8E|5|Well made, good looking.  Fits my wheels perfectly.
B000H6EOF4|5|This works perfectly to let anyone know that changes the oil in the wife's 4Runner, that it uses Mobile1 5w30 and Mobil1 only.
B0010T7Q7K|5|Great fit and finish.
B00873J0YY|3|We just got them and put them together.  Not sure if we are going to be happy with them yet.  I wish they had put instructions with them on securing them down with the ties.  We will definitely use different ties to tie them down.
B007XZJTCA|1|Extremely unsatisfyed one piece was bent and the other was cut wrong and doesn't match up properly.
B000K03V2Y|5|These mufflers are very well made and fit nicely on my 2006 Cadillac DTS.  They return the car to the original whisper quietness with no unusual exhaust sounds that are sometimes encountered with non-OEM mufflers.  There are a few points to consider relative to the installation:<br /><br />1. The chrome dual tail pipes on the OEM mufflers are cut at an angle with the top edge sticking out further than the bottom edge.  The Walker mufflers are cut straight-down.  You may want to consider this if you only need to replace one muffler as the Walker will not match identically to the OEM.<br /><br />2. Walker produces a Y-pipe that goes from the mufflers up to the resonator.  The recommended way to replace the mufflers is to cut the original Y-pipe and clamp the lower portion of the Y just rear of the resonator with a 2 1/4&#34; clamp.  The mufflers are to be clamped using a 1 7/8&#34; clamp.  In my case the shells of the mufflers were rusted out but all of the stainless piping was in excellent shape making me reluctant to replace the stainless Y-pipe with an aluminized steel replacement.  I was able to cut the mufflers off of the original Y-pipe and attach the new mufflers to the original Y-pipe.  I attached the new mufflers by placing a short section of 1 7/8&#34; pipe inside of the 2&#34; inlet on the muffler and the original 2&#34; y-pipe.  I clamped it using a 2&#34; stainless steel band clamp that I bought on Amazon (Dynomax 33228 Stainless Steel Hardware Clamp Band).  The connection sealed without any leaks and will be easy to replace the mufflers in the future if needed as the clamps do not crimp the pipes at all.  One caveat with this approach is that the dual tailpipes are no longer centered in the opening in the fascia under the bumper, i.e. they favor the outboard end of the opening on both sides.  The uninitiated to the way it is supposed to look will not notice, but you will.  I suspect that this would not be the case if I used the replacement Y-pipe from Walker.  In addition, you will likely be able to complete the overall job in less time if you use the Walker Y-pipe.  I spent a fair amount of time fiddling with the right length to trim the original Y-pipe so that the Walker muffler tips did not stick out too far.  The extra time and effort was worth if to me as I wanted to preserve the original stainless pipe.<br /><br />Overall, these mufflers are your best option available if you want to return your car to the original exhaust sound with a reasonably good look at a fair price.  An OEM replacement with two mufflers and the y-pipe which is a welded unit will set you back about $1000.  The Walker setup is around $300 on Amazon including the Y-pipe.
B009W3Q4RO|5|Works great<br />Well needed
B0009H51UI|4|FRAM usually ok.
B001JDE6ZW|4|The mirrors shook while driving.I wrapped a few layers of bkack tape untill they fit snuggly in the holes and used rubber washers ibstead of the metal ones.no more shaking and they are as still as the ones on the doors.little enginuity that's all!
B004GCKY9A|5|This fit perfect. I tried to youtube how to replace it and they all showed cutting your tailgate. I did not cut mine. It is fiberglass. With a little effort it will flex enough to fit.
B001AM3LAI|3|They got the job done for a good price
B000C58046|5|Great quality and as I said there are two per a pack. Though it only shows two it never says how many you get. I don't like to assume because.............well you know what assume leads to. So buy the amount you need.
B000BUQOEU|5|these things work great except straps do not hold up well to uv
B004RCP50M|5|Installed perfectly however be prepared to disassemble all front body panels and remove from car to gain access for installation. Not a big deal on a Smart Car, just time consuming. This is not a quick install. Yet none of that reflects on Blue Ox...it is just the nature of the vehicle being a Smart Car...some drilling required. Best tow assembly on the market for any vehicle in my opinion only once assembled and coupled with appropriate tow bar.
B00030AVBK|5|Nice product at a great price,
B0091XT102|5|Works just what I was looking for and the price was right.
B0010E00T6|5|Old filter smelled weird. Car now smell good.<br /><br />Make car smell good. Buy this Fram filter.
B00I5A28RK|1|there were no instructions on how to use it and the font is wrong. very misleading indeed
B000WXRBBQ|5|Works great.
B00KB1QBK6|5|Easy to install and looks great. The low profile in channel look is very nice.
B000X21W4S|5|I've been buying WeatherTech products for more than 10 years now, It's a great product quality and fit perfectly on the car.
B0087EFYV6|2|A very nice sprayer for the money.  I made my own carpet cleaner using this and it works great.  A real money saver, too.<br />EDIT:  After using this for awhile now, and very infrequently I mught add, I rescind my original rating and now give this 2 stars.  Leaks like a sieve and really does not foam up like it should.  Will look elsewhere.
B007NVS0ZQ|3|I like this product a great deal. However, it fits a bit big and I think it runs at least one size larger than the size chart. The ARMS alone seem to be made for the Hulk. According to the size chart which only goes by the chest size, I needed a large. The arms however would need to be filled with muscle mass the size of the HULK. This Jersey would be better if the forearms or sleeves zippered off.  Shipper did get it to me on time.
B000CODFJ2|5|Came on time and as advertised
B001DKNH8I|5|Excellent product and very easy to use. My second time to use it on another transmission rebuild.
B00NPIIZ8S|1|This is not a printed tag just a sticker on a metal plate. Took a long time to ship and was orange instead of black
B00Q8P9XU4|4|good quality
B0042HE5K8|1|Fit as expected. My only complaint is getting shafted with living in Alaska . Almost paid more in shipping then the price of the part.
B000XEGEWG|5|These towels are great.  I use them for car detailing.  Leaves no lint behind.  I highly recommend.
B003BKVM8U|5|Really lights up underneath my tail gate.
B00AGK2AQQ|5|well done
B006ID37ZS|5|Nice easy to use compact air pump with gauge
B000CAXTWO|5|You need the clear to see if crud is coming through the system.
B00KLIWMCU|3|In Florida I think we need something a little thicker that will block more heat.. It does cool it down some to not burn your skin off when you sit down.. so it does help :)
B00T36HLYU|5|I have used this type mirror before on another truck and it works well. I have never had a problem with them.
B004002CS4|5|Great!
B004LHTO1O|4|1/4 of sticker has little adhesive on bottom.  This part is also thicker.  It allows quick removal.  That can be good if owner wants to remove this sticker at any time.  That can be bad if anyone else wants to remove same sticker.
B0048ECQHO|3|The hole for the front mat is on the wrong side. They do not fit perfectly but look ok.
B008QBT8YY|4|Works well.
B00CQHZDGG|5|Very well made and just finished a 5000 mile trip with it and I think it helped. I typically have some lower back issues but not with this. I particularly liked the way it kept heat on my back without getting too hot.
B00267PZUK|5|Miracle worker!
B00T1LRTNU|5|I ordered this for my husbands 2007 Jeep Wrangler. It looks awesome and only took 30 minutes to take the old grill off and put the new grill on. Very easy for someone with limited car knowledge
B0045CUNNS|5|Works great on quick disconnect lines that aren't seized up....for that you'll need a hose cutter. Quality is very good and they look pretty similar to some of the high dollar tool truck versions that some of the other mechanics around here have.
B00KQ81M94|5|It shams :-)
B000EH0ORI|5|This little magic thing is awesome. No more mess refueling the boat
B003IS3HV0|5|satisfied! Month ago, i received this small bottle, first feeling is i should order a bigger one and pretty expensive. today, i used it, amazing, only 1/3 bottle for my little nissan juke, for big car, enough twice, good value! everything, same as they said, easy to clean with hand soap, only thing is u need muscle, thick honey exactly.
B00E9HWS9G|5|Nice
B000JFNAAS|4|Works nicely
B001BNCILY|5|Bought these for my dad. Die hard Tigers fan. He lived them. Fit his Suburban perfectly. Well made.
B001CF1V3C|4|I have a 1974 CJ5. Drivers side bolted up to the slider prefectly. Very comfortable. However the passenger side has to be modified. There also isn't enough metal on the back of the seat to accommodate the tilt actuator bolting on, so I just made a template with the Amazon box it came in, had the metal cut at the steel supply store, welded a piece of angle to the back to accommodate the lock mechanism, and bolted it right up to the original tilt mount. Great seat for the price though!
B0009JRVWC|3|It is what it is.  I also wish Winegard would make one that is more sturdy than this which is flimsy.  However, it works better than the vice grips we used after the other one broke and we were traveling. As someone else said, if you see it cheap, buy one to replace the one which breaks.
B005JPJMI2|5|So far I'm very impressed with this product.  Goes on and off very easily, leaving a nice shine and slick surface with no streaks.  Used a microfiber cloth to do the whole car.  One side to spread it, and the other to buff off the excess.  I have found the Zep Professional spray bottles from Home Depot work very well for spraying detailing products.
B001BRYTY4|5|Bought this a few years ago, still working in my Outlander.  I love having this in my car, so I don't get the &#34;air filter pitch&#34; every time I go to get my oil change.  I don't really know about performance or gas mileage, but to me is worth investing in this long term filter, rather than the cheap ones that constantly need replacing.
B00C7XZX0U|5|It good
B0071F54EO|5|Arrived quickly looks and works great!
B00HSHVVXI|5|My car looks AMAZING!!! Such a difference from that horrible yellow light. Makes my mom cool points so much higher :)
B000CGFHBY|5|OEM Part.
B00IN9J4Q6|2|Didnt fit the bolts in the back of my truck bed. Drilled out the holes so the bolts would fit. now the head of the bolts wont seat properly.
B005CQT6VQ|5|Son LOVES it, and uses it every day.
B00HS0GDKQ|2|I didn't buy these struts, but after a fair amount of research, I wanted to share what I uncovered about SENSEN.  Caution!, Google &#34;SENSEN quality&#34;.  These are Chinese made struts, and you are putting your life at risk if and when they fail, and for the price, you can expect them to fail much sooner.  There are videos showing these struts breaking the weld, which can cause your wheel to turn unexpectedly on the road, and if you are at speed, you stand the risk of a serious wreck.  Stick to quality brands like Monroe/KYB or just buy OEM.  Remember the old adage, &#34;You get what you pay for&#34;.
B000GU20K2|5|Super fast shipping! Plugged right in to the old wiring harness. Took me 3 min to install.
B00595OM82|1|I ordered a single piece but got four that didn't match the listing picture. If you look closely at the OEM cap there are hexagons in the field behind the Tristar symbol. The picture in the listing also had a hexagon pattern. What I got was four caps with dots in the Tristar field. no where on the back does it say Made in Germany though the listing says OEM part.
B00J52R3AE|5|Exactly as advertised and works like a charm.  I set it up outside the large tree line about 50 ft. from my rv.
B00I5HRFSU|5|Quality blew me away! Nice strap at a great price. (At least when I ordered, amazon prices fluctuate so much. Under $10 when I ordered and closer to $5.)
B0000AXY62|2|After one Michigan winter in which my truck was hardly driven, I ended up having to cut the lock off because the inside was gummed up and would not turn, even after several applications of penetrating oil. I ended up with the key broken off in the lock.  Maybe if you live in the south or southwest, this lock will be good but if you live where it will be subjected to harsh winter weather, pass. I'm going back to the Curt model, which may not look as pretty but never failed to open.
B000X90YUO|5|Second time  company compressor buyer
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great! Helps keep the car cooler in the texas heat.
B00MJ80UDI|4|This products was delivered on time and was exactly as described. I love the outcome of this products application on my project. Well worth the money would recommend it
B0096BH5V6|4|Love the cargo liner, but a pain to install. You have to cut liner and install rivets into the frame in order to install.<br /> Google diy rivnut tool and there are a few good guides how to install it and save some cash.
B0083SL82A|3|Had to exchange them as one was spinning loosely on its ball socket and the motion of the bike would shake it out of place.  Now that we have two good ones they are working fine.
B0012TT9VE|5|As expected<br />Fast arrival. Good price!
B00TZMD88U|5|we put it on trike and adjusted it . runs great.
B00S0CSEVC|4|fit good, now it is brighter then the orignal
B00DZEZ4HW|4|Easy to install and does a good job.
B000H70OU2|2|Been trying for five years now with many other techs to make work  the GlowShift  Vacuum and Trans Temp gauges to work on my 99 Canaro.  So thinking its to late to return the gauges.  They do have a video that they  need to eliminate the background noisy music in the installation.
B00AV8HIUG|5|Worked as advertised. Was a little difficult to get the shelves to seat on the wall mount during assembly but got it together and mounted in less than 10 minutes. Would definitely recommend this one. Looks good and sturdy.
B008Y791O2|5|Made the transfer case shift smooth again.
B0062A0Y9E|2|Put on 2013 Jetta TDI. No brighter than OEM. Did not last very long - about 15,000 miles. Take the last part with a grain of salt because not 100% sure I didn't get any oil on them during install.  However, for lack of brightness, I'll try a different bulb.
B00434UN06|5|I don't know if this is still available, don't see it on the CG site.  Works great though.  Long lasting, smells good, and easy to use.
B00M0CBV9U|4|It exspanded my carrying compacity which is the whole purpose of buying one of these things, so it did what it was needed for.<br /><br />I drove from Montana to omaha, then from omaha to north Carolina. The bag held up well but we there was water in the bag when we opened it. We did not hit any rain while driving but there was a significant rain storm in omaha while we were parked... So I have my doubts about the waterproffness of this product while driving 75 on the highway.<br /><br />As long As you wrap whatever is in the roofbag you should be okay. We had vacuum bagged all our clothes and shoved them in it so they were waterproof anyways.<br /><br />Also, you need a roof liner or else this thing will slide and shift some with movement.
B008427D88|4|Purchased for a 2012 Jeep Wrangler.  These clips are used in a lot of places.  Good fit, would buy again.
B003VLBPJA|2|Heavy duty is not exactly what I would call it. The first thing I had to do, was close the gaps on the hooks, they kept coming off the cord. I know you get what you pay for, call it &#34;light duty cargo net&#34;. Also fits poorly on bike. Thank you.
B00K5MW7ZE|1|Pure junk!  Lasted less than 10 months on my 67 VW.  So thin and flimsy, it just came apart like tissue paper..
B000RFRR4U|4|works great
B00NJ4YGLI|3|Not too shabby. Wasn't as bright as I hoped. I have a slight tint on my fog lights so that doesn't help either. Not bad for the price though.
B00651C4W0|5|This was a great purchase! Looks much better than the factory one
B0009Y2CFS|5|Great
B00OO2JHWC|2|I put this grill on about 2 months ago and the chrome is bubbling up and the seams of it are falling apart.
B004RCSY1O|5|As advertized
B001O7PNNM|4|Used this on my 2004 Silverado with 200k miles. I had never done the cut then wax thing before and am relatively new to the orbital buffer that I used. All I can say is WOW. This made me look like a professional. The truck looks great. I had some minor scratches that washing and scrubbing couldn't touch. Along with Diesel marks near my fuel fill from years of neglect. Cleaned it all right up. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to bring back that show room shine.  Update: I used this on the front of my RV as well. That video is on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rZiXHcEWqc Also, I added a couple before and after shots from my truck job.
B00GSAUHB8|2|Doesn't fit well I'm my car, I have a small civic, so I can't imagine it fits well in any car.<br /><br />I may not be using it correctly but I believe I am and it isn't a great fit.
B00BP5VWRY|3|O-ring toward the grip ends are showing signs of wear.
