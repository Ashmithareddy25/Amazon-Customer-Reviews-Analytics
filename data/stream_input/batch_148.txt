B0009PCPNQ|5|Worked like magic removing dirt and grime from my car interior. Lifted the dried coffee and soda crusted in my cup holder right out.
B001DRNNKI|5|My husband change our's and said it was easy to do, and way cheaper than at a dealer. Will get this again then next time.
B0024ECDL4|5|works great and no leaks. I leave this pressurized for feeding the timer for my drip system. quality and flows good enough for my pressure washer to run on it and my pressure washer is a beast
B00BAXMXWY|5|Fit perfect,  looks oem, all hardware included, easy install.
B005MZX6WW|5|This item arrived perfect and i put it right on my car. I'll buy again from this company. Best custoemr service I have ever experienced. Thanks folks!  What a nice team of people!
B00CU8ZS48|4|I like these because they are a low increment in weight and perfect for motorcycle wheel balancing.  1/8 oz. is about 3.54 grams which should let you make small incremental changes to reach an optimal balance. I would prefer bismuth or zinc (something heavier than stell would be smaller but these are okay too). Here are a few tips for you from my own experience/observations:<br /><br />STATIC BALANCING -- There are stands that allow you to static balance your own wheels. They are easy to use. Here is my procedure.  I am certain it is scientifically the best way to achieve an optimal static balance:<br /><br />a. REMOVE WHEEL AND OLD TIRE: Remove the wheel from the motorcycle and remove the old tire.  Note: There are ways to do this without purchasing any special equipment.  You should do a YouTube search for &#34;Zip Tie Tire Change&#34; to find out how and &#34;DIY bead breaker.&#34;  You will find good instructions there on how to do this. When YOU control the process end-to-end you can spend more time and tweak things to get to an optimal balance that many professionals don't take the time to do.<br /><br />b. CLEAN UP THE WHEEL: Remove the old weights from the wheel and any adhesive residue that may be left. Wash the wheel with the rotors attached (taking care not to get the wheel bearings wet -- if not sealed type bearings then remove them). Let the wheel dry COMPLETELY (water remaining will throw off the balance.)<br /><br />c. CLEAN UP THE TIRE: Tires often come with various stickers on them and these should be removed completely including the adhesive residue. Do this as these things will wear off later and have a small impact on your overall balance.  Note any balance compensation dots (or marks on the sidewalls). Pirelli uses two red dots to indicate the lightest point of the tire, Dunlop uses a yellow dot. If there are no balance compensation marks on the tire then skip to g. to install the tire on the wheel.<br /><br />d. PLACE WHEEL (NO TIRE) ON STATICBALANCER: Ensure the balancer is on steady footing and it is level and install the wheel on it giving it a spin to ensure that it rotates freely in both directions. Let it settle to a stop. NOTE: The more friction free the bearings are the more accurate your balancing results. The more friction free the bearings are the longer the wheel will spin (if you want to test). Note: Ensure that any tire pressure sensor (TPS) system you have and valve stem (with cap) is installed as well.<br /><br />e. FIND WHEEL HEAVY POINT: Assuming the wheel has stopped and the heaviest point is at the bottom you should test that by grabbing the bottom and turning the heavy point of the wheel 90 degrees in one direction holding it there and then letting it fall to settle again. The faster it falls the more out of balance the wheel is. Once it settles mark the bottom of the wheel with a small chalk mark (heaviest point).  Now do the same thing again but this time turn the heavy point 90 degrees in the other direction and let it fall. The caulk mark should be again at the bottom.  If it is then good.  if not then keep doing this till you can find the heaviest point (at bottom).<br /><br />f. BALANCE COMPENSATION ALIGNMENT: If you have balance compensation dots (or marks) on the sidewall of the tire this is the lightest point of the tire. You should install it onto the wheel (rim) so that that mark aligns with the heaviest point of the wheel (that you marked above) and the sidewall arrow indicating direction of tire rotation is correct when you finally install it onto the motorcycle. This will bring the wheel-tire closer to balance so that final balance will use fewer weights.  Skip to h.<br /><br />g. NO BALANCE COMPENSATION -- INSTALL TIRE: If you do not have any balance compensation then install the tire ensuring the arrow on the side-wall indicating direction of tire rotation will be correct when the wheel is installed on the motorcycle. Note: It is a myth that the heaviest point of thewheel is adjacent to the valve stem -- you must determine the heaviest point to take full advantage of balance compensation.<br /><br />h. BALANCE THE WHEEL-TIRE: Place the wheel (with tire installed) onto the balancer and give it a spin in both directions to ensure it spins freely and let it settle. It shoud settle with the top of the tire being the lightest point. Mark that point on the tire sidewall with a small chalk mark. Test this by turning the wheel 90 degrees in one direction, holding it and then letting it settle again. The chalk mark should be at the top. Try turning it 90 degees in the opposite direction and repeat this until you are confident you have found the lighest point of the wheel-tire. Using a small piece of tape locate a weight to the top on the inside of the rim (do not permanently fasten the weight yet).<br /><br />Retest your balance. If you still have a light point the chalk mark should rise to the top. The faster it rises the more out of balance the wheel-tire is. The slower it moves the closer to balance it is. Add a second weight on top on the other side of the wheel (directly across from the other weight on the opposite side) and retest. If it still needs more weight then add more weight alternating beween sides and moving the line of weights so that their full lenght centers at the top (lightest point) of the wheel-tire.<br /><br />The objective is to use as few weights as possible to attain perfect balance while splitting the weight evenly top opposite side of the wheel. The reason you want to split the weights as you are assuming there is no dual-plane counter imblance and you don't want to create one. A dual-plane counter imblance cannot be observed using a static balancer (you must use a dynamic balancer, aka computer spin-balancer to correct for that).  Search YouTube for &#34;dual plane counter imbalance&#34; to see an explanation of at this concept. That said, balancing the wheels dynamically provides the best possible balance and saftey. Though many motorcycle shops don't do this I would like you to know that a dual-plane counter-imbalance will cause your front wheel to wobble and though it may not be noticable it will be felt in your handlebars as vibration and if you ever have a wheel-bearing go out or other problem the imbalance will make the front wheel prone to &#34;death wobble&#34; (look that up on YouTube for an example as well).<br /><br />i. SET THE WEIGHTS PERMANENTLY: Remove the adhesive from the weights (one-by-one) and place them in the same location as before but as close to the center plane of the wheel as possible.  Note: Use acetone, alcohol or other degreaser to remove any oils/grease at the adhesion point to ensure good adhesion.<br /><br />j. RETEST: Retest the balance of the wheel to ensure that it has no heavy point (or light point for that matter). If you give the wheel a spin and mark the top and do this several times the marks should appear to be random (not all line up around one half of the wheel). If the marks are all on one half of the wheel after numberous spins then your wheel is still out of balance and you must remove the weights and go back and re-do.<br /><br />k. INSTALL: Install the wheel. Consider fresh wheel bearings or even the new technology ceramic bearings which lower rolling resistance of the wheel, improve longevity,improve performance and fuel economy.
B003YMHH0W|4|EASY TO INSTALL AND IT WAS'NT OVER WELLMING ON THE TRUCK IT ISTHE RIGHT SIZE AND HOLDS THE LIGHTS GREAT
B000COU1YO|5|No problems with this vendor but I have to write a long message just to   finish this up  and be finished with you
B0002KKIQ4|5|Best degreaser around.  Just wish I could find it at local hardware stores..
B00DSVMCQS|5|What a great bargain.  Great quality for the little price tag
B00HHGRXA0|1|These were a direct fit for my 2006 Trailblazer EXT with 4x4.  I could hear a vibration for the last half of a 600 mile trip.  I brought it home and put these on.  Noise gone and they fit well.  Tightened up the whole front end.<br /><br />They only lasted 18 month or about 6000 miles.  Cheap junk.  Buy Moog or Timken
B00L7X9P28|5|They bolted right in and look great.
B0028JQZ5U|4|The creeper performed as expected while performing oil changes and lube on my 2 vehicles. The headrest is a great feature.. The creeper probably would not be suited or sturdy enough for professional use
B00BBMOGNS|5|Easy to install... took less than twenty minutes. Great quality for the money!
B004HAAPRC|4|Great lenses. Had to sand some of the plastic bumps off it to get it to fit my trailer. Also had to add a new ground from my RV to the trailer because they were not very bright. Once I added the ground, they work great.<br /><br />Update from August 2013: One of these has now failed. So be aware, the quality may not be all that great.
B0040M30U6|2|Too dark for GA= $193 ticket
B006LMI0I0|5|Received the product sooner than estimated shipping date. Very sturdy bug shield. I've had it for a couple weeks now and it's made a HUGE difference in the amount of bugs and debris actually hitting my windshield. Install took 5 minutes. I did have to use a couple of screws to attach the shield, which was one of the reasons I chose this product. All other bug shields I could find were installed using sticky tape, not screws. The plastic is thick, but has enough give not to shatter when a rock hits it. Ive had a couple large rock chunks hit the front of the shield, without breaking it. Jeep logo on the shield looks very slick!
B000GV4QT4|5|This product is just what I asked I am very happy and recommend its purchase will not disappoint, sending it on time and everything
B004R302PY|5|Easy install, perfect fit. Works great!
B000C9SL6E|5|perfect fit quick delivery
B001IAB776|3|Easy install, no upper bushings included (which will clearly need replacing in all older rigs), mediocre lift in summer, I expect poor results in winter, does not slam open, cylinder much smaller diameter than original (thus requiring much higher gas pressure to perform), marginally better than the ones I took out but very inexpensive.
B00DFMP8F2|5|Very affordable alternative to the factory product. Easy to install.
B00N787YJW|4|I really like these quick releases.  I installed them on my WRX to help hold my bumper up because it wasn't sitting properly.  They look really good, are well built, and function properly.
B000X25KPK|5|This is the 2nd one I have purchased. 1st was for our Lexus GX470 SUV and now for our Cadillac SRX SUV and I love them!
B005VLCJJ8|5|That is why I love genuine parts. Fits perfectly and easy to install. Will buy genuine parts all the time.
B004ZVXFZ2|5|works great fits well and BRIGHT! tried others that cost more these work just as well. be sure of width room in housing
B001RNOHBC|1|I purchased this item in march,  once I connect it to 100AH battery, it blow up the Inverter circuitery, leaving the item smoked and smelling as well.  After these didnt worked anymore. I dont recommend it.
B00D45XRRQ|5|Item fir perfect, took me less than 20 minutes to install and works perfectly! 2011 Toyota Corolla.
B007ECFURK|5|Awesome item, love the quality and look of the item. Not some cheap knock off... really like the quality of item
B0008FUH46|1|To start, the lock itself is a great item.  I ordered this one to replace my old one (due to the key breaking in it and not being able to order replacement keys from Reese).  It shipped fast as always but there were no keys in the box.  I sent for an exchange and received another one in record time only to find out it didn't have keys either.  These are coming with no factory packaging.  I bought my last one at Academy and it was in a large plastic case with the keys zip tied to the lock.  The packaging on this unit is totally different.  I could care less about the packaging but without keys this thing is useless.  On a brighter note, Amazon's customer service and return policy is flawless as alays.
B00514BAR2|5|This compliments the Kury grips better than the add on that just wraps around the grips. It is adjustable. Gives the hand a chance to let go and get some stress release without using or needing a throttle lock. If you are OCD, you can buy one extra for the opposite side so they match, but the left one would be non-functional and only for appearance.
B0024GQJ2G|4|I love this helmet accept for one thing, I thought I was going to be able to buy a face shield attachment because the picture looks like there are snaps on the visor but they are not. They graphics are pretty and the click on straps make it easy to put on.
B0006JO0XI|5|I had a little very cheap 3 amper that fried on me because I hooked it up to the panels before hooking it up to the battery (This fries the controller) I'm very happy with this one. Its much better quality in every way.
B000EH0ORI|2|Disappointing. Not very reliable.
B00D8DR0AO|5|AMAZING!!!! Won't wash truck conventionally ever again! I'm very particular about my truck being clean and this is a godsend. Can do my crew cab Silverado in just under 15 minutes. Was a meguiars nxt generation quick detailer user at $10/22oz. And this is head and shoulders above at $2/32oz. Made a customer for life!!!!
B000E4UW1Y|5|It was just what we wanted and they worked plus cheap price.It done the job we have put it on the truck and it work.
B00AKVWBKQ|5|Excellent -  The part arrived quickly and was a perfect fit.  -  Thanks
B00G0OUGSG|5|perfect fit
B002DU3S9A|5|There is not any product much better than these Battery Tenders....I have about 12 of them for my toys and machines with batteries. I have not had any problems what so ever. Try to stay away from the Tender Jr. Doesn't seem to have the staying power as the rest of them...
B000CQDS06|4|Good Product I realy like how it works,the only thing is I have a standerd trans and it has to be positioned out of the way of the stick shift or the seat has to be all the way back.
B000WJ6ZS0|5|This is the best cover.  It doesn't leak.
B000CSCF4E|5|Works great, easy to reprogram since it replaced the one I lost. Would recommend buying. East to read buttons for anyone.
B00KTJ8K54|5|Easy to configure.<br />I recommend it.
B005Q9YI1W|4|The choices seemed endless while researching crossbars before the purchase. This model had not been reviewed at the time but the description, pictures and price provided enough info to decide. When they arrived I used the reviews from other models to evaluate these for deal breakers. I found none of the common pitfalls found in others in fact they more closely compared to highly rated more expensive models for half or more less money.<br /><br />As far as design and quality I am well pleased, the fit is solid to the vehicle without any slack and the bars have a good sturdy feel to them with a nice finish. Locks and covers appear to provide ample security to ward off casual theft. As usual installation instructions were minimal; however, the actual install was only 30-45 minutes. I have yet to put them in use which for now will be carrying luggage and such. I foresee mo problems with that but will follow up if any occur.<br /><br />Given that the price range went from $30 to $300 this item seems a good value and well built with a good fit to the Jeep
B000JZUR86|5|It was good quality part and was properly fitted. Easy to install. Only bought one and it held the hood up with no problem.
B0089T24Q2|1|Works terribly on my C300 Sport 2011
B000C2Y020|5|Came with a gasket and made of aluminum instead of the original steel unit. Fit my 1976 MGB perfect, easy to install.
B000EQCXS2|3|So far ok but plastic shrink protector were not put on correctly and for the price plus high shipping cost I could have gotten them from the dealer for less.
B004KL0I9I|5|Great Bluetooth Code Reader.  I've been using this with my Galaxy SIII Android phone to display information not built into my dash, ie intake pressure, mpg, and digital speed and temperatures.  My car actually threw a check engine lite on the way to family Christmas and I was able read the code and reset it to see if it would come back.  A friend is actually planning on getting the same model.  Definitely worth the money.
B00T2GT9L4|5|I bought two of these, and they both seem to work just fine for my fiancee and me!  Granted, I haven't had to use the jump starter just yet, but the battery and flashlight both work flawlessly.  Definitely recommended for a car emergency kit!
B005IUT7S8|5|A timing belt replacement is not something you want to cut corners on. Gates makes a great kit. No fitment issues. All parts except the belt and WP are OEM. Belt had good marks and was easy to line up. Water pump came with metal OEM gasket. The machining on the sprockets and pulleys was excellent.  The kit comes with decent instructions.  These are helpful when used in conjunction with your service manual.  You can complete this kit with a thermostat (which it does not include).  It does however, come with a thermostat gasket.  I would not hesitate to purchase this kit again. I saved a bunch of money and got quality parts for my car.  Recommended purchase.<br /><br />**Edit, after 3500 miles all is well.  Car runs perfectly, idles smoothly.  Couldn't be happier.
B000OZS9Y0|5|Works great. I would have nothing else to hold on to if I had not purchased these. The hold handles on our kawi mule are too far to reach. They are very useful.
B00BQVF8J0|3|You don't get many uses out of this backing plate.  The center of it gets steaming hot and the glue eventually breaks down causing the velcro to separate from the plate as well as shred your pad.  It was nice while it was together, but if you're a novice like me, don't think you're going to buy just one of these and use it for years.  I was able to use it MAYBE six times before it was toast.  Not to be confused with six cars or six sessions, but rather two buff passes and four polish passes on three different cars. (Not all at the same time.)<br /><br />I used this backing plate with a Porter Cable 7424XP on 5 and 6 with light to moderate pressure.
B003VCDI7G|5|Just as advertised.  It works well and took about 10 minutes to install with just a 10mm socket to take the old one off.
B0024E6V30|4|This filter does a great job of cleaning up the water. The only issue I have is that it greatly reduces the water pressure. Tried a new one thinking it was clogged but it didn't help much.
B00JF5LRN0|5|Works well, love that it folds up so we can park our SUV - MDX in a parking spot when we ski.  I did purchase the &#34;19.6 cubic ft. Extra Large Waterproof Vehicle Cargo Carrier Bag&#34; that fits it great, and is not too high that you can not see out the window.  Also liked that curve on the hitch bar that curves up and out of the way of the duel exhaust pipes.
B009DVNHLQ|3|To blue.
B00A14QSGA|5|I like that this is an aluminum shaft.  I did not follow their instructions to cut the HVAC unit to install.  Instead I removed the HVAC unit and properly installed the door.  It is a nice replacement for the blend door.
B007CDYX7Y|5|k and n now making mercedes filters.
B004H4ALIQ|5|There are some sharp edges on the door, if your not careful will scratch your arm reaching in.  But otherwise extremely pleased with it's performance.
B005J1QBKS|5|So far a lot better than cheaper ones I had before
B00KMQ6WHC|5|Love these!!!!
B000CKGAV6|3|Not as bright as I had thought they would be and the distance of the beam is relatively short compared to the advertisement
B004NEFQ9Y|5|Great product, is as described. Officer approved!
B000UGZEZK|5|Shipped fast and fit perfect.  I was worried about the little nub on the side of the intake as my Camry doesn't have a fitting for it but after opening the package I noticed it was an optional connection that is filled in.  You have to drill it out if you want to use it.<br /><br />I would definitely trust these guys with another part.
B003BZX26K|5|THE ONLY WAY MY HEAVY CAM MOTOR WOULD STAY IN TIME!!!!
B000CHR9ZA|5|Good condition, thank you
B0066PI2GM|5|It s nice
B000BWEH6K|5|These flags work perfectly for use inside a window - car, home, boat, whatever. They are large - 4x6 is a good size and will last for years.
B0068C2I2C|5|Great
B00FZ58GGU|4|👍
B000CMH8SS|5|Everything it said it was.
B005K97RRA|5|No problem transaction of pro-packed item as described&#62; 5 stars *****
B004HEF8QG|5|did the job
B001IZIFNK|4|Very nice over for the price.  I especially liked the anchor points for the elastic bands.  Clever.
B008C0X534|5|I was using a generic one size fits all sun screen and it didn't provide good coverage.  This one fits perfectly.  I just rolls up, it doesn't fold into a small package so as long as your are OK with that this will fit the bill.
B00ZS9RWZE|5|GO DONALD GO, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
B00FOSSQJU|5|i have a Jetta TDI 2013, i was reading a lot for this product and seems the best option out there for diesel additive. Right now a few tanks later, my engine noise is a lot less and my mpg gone better!. Get it.
B00ICV9MNK|5|Good
B004VE4VTM|5|It does exactly what its made to do and its good quality.  Fits between the side rollers on an ATV winch roller fairlead.
B0001EVNK6|3|I installed this on my father's 2003 Ford Ranger. The bug deflector itself is a nicely made product, looks good on the truck and fits well. The reason for only giving it three stars is because of misleading installation statements. One of the first things they say in the product info for this application is &#34;no drilling required&#34;. I figured they'd use existing holes in the hood inner frame to secure it. I opened the box and unwrapped the part, pulled out the instructions, and the first thing it says under &#34;What you will need&#34; is a drill. Sure enough, it requires drilling for the retainers. It's a good product, but buyers need to be aware that the &#34;no drilling required&#34; may not apply.
B000XVZ8F8|5|I dont alway have access to wiring diagrahms and even if i did this tool is faster and more convenient.
B000E2CVI8|5|I use these on a couple of my vehicles and have done so on vehicles in the past. Honestly I like K&N, but the main reason is that stupid bolt on the end. Makes it worth the extra cost. I do believe you could get a similar performance filter for less, but they also have a good cross-reference DB.
B000WN5F96|4|Note, these hoses are very stiff and it would have really helped to have a 90 degree bend in one end of the hoses.  The main thing is make sure that you have enough room to be able to use the straight connections that are on the ends of these hoses.
B00DBEMGP4|1|Fits the mounts, that's good, but these are not exactly crees.  Can't read the licesnse plate at all with these installed, will have to get a better solution.
B007KPWQBE|5|Works great.
B000CEBXRS|5|I used this to replace the wimpy OEM glow plug relay in my 1996 F250 7.3L.it works like a champ and even mounts up with the factory bolts.
B007KOC19C|5|Works well and fast shipping. thanks
B0066RQLOA|4|very good
B003CKMO0O|4|Nice powder coat finish, works well, and it is a good value for the price.  Happy with IMS and this product.
B001KS2PYK|5|This wiper was extremely easy to install and works as advertised. The price was good so I have no complaints.
B00LC66FZ0|5|Nice decal
B00C024Z9S|2|Not as brie as I thought it should be
B00877SL2M|3|Lights burn out fast
B0002JMIEK|5|After using this product, I will never use wax again. Very easy to apply. Leaves an awesome shine. Fantastic product. I've used many brands of waxes, some easier to apply than others. However, Liquid Glass is not a wax. It applies so easy and is best applied in the sun. It will bond to the surface with the heat of the sun. I apply it to the windshield as well and by doing so, it gives way better visibility in the rain........wipers optional.
B000OCHBLK|5|Works excellent
B00JDPQ4MQ|5|looks to be good shape ! thanks
B004APM12G|5|it work as described
B000XV8CH4|5|I bought this CD case holder to store CDs in my new VW Tiguan. Even though the product description said it would not fit my vehicle's overhead storage bin, it does in fact fit in one of the bins. So I am very pleased with it.
B004BFW82I|4|Get mist spray without dumping a lot of water. And the stream shoots straight. After a few months of use, you may have to disassemble and clean the rubber seals. I'm a tinter so the small little specks matter to me. Otherwise good sprayer.
B0041CDPQO|3|If you have intentions on using this for a cigarette lighter you might want to look else where. The socket is too big. But if you want to use this as a charger, then it will work.
B004Q1CJ8A|5|I thought it looked very good for the price!
B0045U140Q|5|Excellent mount.  Easy to install, took maybe 20 minutes.  Would recommend this laptop mount to anyone looking for one.  You get what you pay for.
B00C87FOFO|4|No instructions but matched discription exactly
B009IE2MX2|5|Very good
B008VQKN9I|4|good product so far they have held up to my rock crawling
B003XGYDE2|1|Bought this around 2 years ago, solely as a means of keeping tires inflated in a second car which sits in the garage over the winter.<br />I think I used this thing fewer than a dozen times, having the motor on no more than a few minutes each time before it inexplicably stopped pumping out air. The motor still makes a noise, but the air function is...ka-put.<br />I don't know what's \\"fair\\" to expect for durability, but however high that bar is, this item fell below it.
B005P004FG|5|Excellent sticker. I would recommend this for any Zelda fan that would like a true replica of one of the symbols from the Zelda franchise.
B000XEBI9K|4|as a bumper guard, i found this to be one of the best, the \\"retaining\\" bar is an excellent feature, I've seen other guards from the competition and they all look more or less like dirty towels hanging from the trunk. This product holds it's shape  Quite happy i choose this instead of others.
B000CAVW5K|5|Bought this because original equipment slave cylinder developed a bad squeak (130,000 miles on 2000 Mazda Protege).  Removal of old unit and replacement with new one was simple.  Squeak is gone; as an unexpected bonus the clutch pedal now operates effortlessly.
B0091XPJ4O|1|Very difficult to apply, the material is too thin and the adhesive seams to be very cheap that can cause damage to paint.
B000630B1Y|5|Make no mistake, K & N filters are top notch, but beware of people who claim huge improvements in mileage and power (i.e. 10-15%).  With the billions of dollars the auto industry has spent trying to improve gas mileage and power, every car made in the world would have these as original equipment if such gains were possible.  If life were only so simple.  People who replace a CLOGGED filter with a new one will notice an improvement (if it's clogged badly enough, the improvement might be that your car runs now).  Definitely better than many in fit and quality, plus being reusable, but a magic bullet it is not.  A clogged K & N filter will also cause performance problems, it's just that all you have to do is clean it properly, and you are off and running; whereas a paper filter, you have to throw it out.
B000C7VYRO|5|Wife's van sprung a leak and I had to get a radiator fast because our schedule doesn't stop because of car trouble. Ordered late Friday evening and the package arrived, undamaged and ahead of schedule! Put it in on Monday night after work in about 2 hrs total (including all necessary verification of repair and test driving). You cannot tell any difference between the original radiator (and it was) in our 2004 Caravan and this unit. The fitment was exactly perfect. Couldn't have asked for anything better!! It's been three days since the repair and it shows no signs of any problems. Bravo!
B002TS4Z98|5|I placed this on a garage trash can.  It was easy to apply, and the price was great.  Would purchase again.
B001CHCDI2|5|easy to install, I feel more responsive power
B0013FLAT6|5|2011 Suburban LT 4x4 with the 6L80 6 speed transmission, 5.3L v8.  Fits great, good price, arrived safely, looks and fits the same as the OEM one that was in there, bacuse it IS OEM!
B001UC9Q3E|4|Got this for a friends Chevy Astro van and they are good quality brakes for the money and they were easy to install and works well so far.  Update: my friend is getting brake squeal.
B00029J40G|5|This kit had everything I needed to install the cooler and was for my needs just the right product.  I used this in addition to my car's OEM transmission oil cooler but it is rated, on the flex a lite site, for 10,000lb GVW which is more than enough for a passenger car or light truck.   <br /> <br />Anyone considering adding an oil cooler should of course take the time to make sure they have the proper space available to mount the cooler.   <br /> <br />If you live in a region where the temperature drops then the only thing missing from this kit is a thermostat, to stop the cooler from getting oil flow while the oil heats up to operating temperature, for those in a hot area there is no need for one and you should be ready to go right out of the box minus the extra oil.
B00MOR4D5U|5|Great product, loved the way they looked. Was having a strobe effect and couldn't get it to stop. Emailed the company and the responded quickly in an attempt to fix the issue. For some reason after all we tried we were unable to resolve the flickering in my 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited so I sadly had to return the system. The company was very supportive with all of this.  Well I tried several different resistors and they were all no help, until I got a hold of the New Brights brand resistor. Man they are obviously well made, a lot better than those others. It a small size black box and it plugs in a lot easier than the other ones and it works the low and high beams! Everything works great now!! I want to thank Sason for all the help! He spent hours on email with me! The best customer service I've ever had!!!! Here's the link to the resistors should you want to try them out, I suggest you forget the rest and go straight to these! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QDELX80
B004YWP834|5|La mencancia fue recibida en la fecha indicada por el vendedor, todo a mi entera satisfacion, y por ello lo recomiendo.
B006CV6RL2|5|Great workmanship.  Very durable material. Should hold up well against the weather.
B0007G8X4W|5|Add lots of power the only problem I am having is not the chip it's that my clutch is slipping because of all of the power that has been added but the chip works great
B00C73D8V6|1|I got one from Walmart. It worked okay, except the dime slot got stuck. It would not dispense. Finally it exploded. The springs pushed smeverytjing apart and change went everywhere.
B003GZJBQK|5|Cap leaked on me had to pull over on the side of the road for a good 5-10 minutes then headed back home. Got a replacement cap right away from mishimoto. Great welds great radiator.
B008CE0TN4|5|I bought this and put it together to move my 14' boat around. It has an electric trolling motor with HD battery and a 9.9 HP gas motor on it. I would say the total weight of the boat with various things in it is around 700#.<br />I have to store the boat inside my fence (HOA rules) along side the home and the typical trailer front wheel is only some 4&#34; and got caught and dug into the fine landscaping gravel when we pushed the boat up a slight incline into the yard. This meant I had to lift the front end of the trailer and boat which was a little hard on my nearly 70 year old back that I have had surgery on already.<br />I noticed that the 12&#34; tires on the trailer itself never had a problem due to the diameter and when I saw this dolly with the dual tires on it that would roll better and I knew they would solve my problem.<br />Just one word, the tires on this thing are cheap but then again they sell for $10 each locally at Harbor Freight.
B00M3NEBMK|5|Wish I had this along time ago
B003YXA8MK|5|i didnt buy this for myself i got it for a friend of mine for his birthday and he loved it so i think it was perfect for him
B0002JN2EU|5|I have a 1999 Toyota Camry. I inherited the car from my father and it had a check engine light on when I got it. The light would come on and then go off, but it never stayed off long enough for the computer to reset. It was time to get the inspection done but it would not pass due to the light coming on. I took the car to two mechanics. They cleaned everything they could think of to make the light go off. Then one of the mechanics talked to another mechanic at the dealership. They replaced parts until I said ENOUGH!  I had spent several hundred dollars on parts and labor. I still had the same problem.<br /><br />I went to my local auto parts store and bought some Seafoam. When I got to the register the guy at the counter said, \\"That is really good stuff. Let me know how it works for ya.\\"  I thought, \\"yeah, right, he is just trying to sell the expensive stuff.\\"  I had already tried the cheaper fuel system cleaners.<br /><br />I put a bottle of the stuff in the tank. By the time I had run 1/4 of a tank through the car the light was staying off for much longer than it ever had. By the time I had run 1/2 a tank through it the light went off and has not come back on in over 3 years.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing!
B00UNTU3VO|5|Best car duster I have ever used. I like to keep my car looking nice and clean without the hastle of having to keep going to get my car washed. With this duster, it makes my car look fresh clean and spotless. No more long and expensive trips to the car wash. Now I'm always looking fresh.
B004GCXCWG|5|just what I needed
B00BEIV1XC|3|windy inside, lets water in
B0007OWD2M|5|Love this stuff!  It is by far the best glass cleaner I have ever used for my car windows-the only one that doesn't leave awful streaks.  I do prefer the aerosol to the pump container but that is just me.  Can't go wrong.
B005ZTNW3I|5|This guy feels very solid, although I havent used it yet I can tell it is going to do its job and last a long time.  The materials are of good quality and the design is great.
B000BZGKCG|4|It's an oil filter.  What can I say.  Probably made in China but I trust the Bosch label.  Assuming it's not counterfeit, lol.
B00DB6Z1H2|5|love it
B002TS2ZSG|5|Got this for my son-in-law.  He loved it. Put it on his truck as soon as he opened it.  Thanks
B004J2YSYO|1|went out in less than a mile. dont waste your money it will leave you stranded. just  buy oem replacements
B00XZ9OXP6|4|The product works however had to return it because it did not look identical to the original key. It does not have the Toyota crest on the back. However, if you're not worried about that go for it. Very easy to program. Google for instructions.
B006A6JLLC|4|Not vinyl but worked for me.
B008ESIODA|5|Saved over half from what the dealership priced us. Thank you. Its nice to find a fair deal once in a while when everyone else is price gouging us to death as it seems. I'll definitely come back for all my auto part needs.
B005VDN74C|2|I couldn't tell how many wires it had by the description. When I received it it had five wires and my vehicle uses a three wire. I contacted the seller and they were very helpful and sent me the correct one right away. I installed the new one and it worked great.
B000B68C0S|4|The handle is great. The only thing i did not like about it is the plastic rod holders both broke off when i was installing it other than that it is great!
B00MVICODA|1|It was the wrong size wrong color to big it u look at the size in the picture so what a waste
B00CU77HL6|4|Not fancy but does what I want it to do. Easy to install. Customer service for Trailtech was great and very responsive when I called them about an extension cable.
B000C34KVU|5|God quality belt. I recommend it. Car runs very smooth in sound compare to the previous belt.
B00NRLCATI|1|Never used. Did not like quality.
B000Z33Y1E|5|I have used many digital gauges in the past, but this analog pressure gauge beats them all.    Very ACCURATE, easy to use. The clip locks into position so that you dont have to hold it while measuring the tire pressure. No loss of air while measuring.    The BEST FEATURE is ofcourse the fact that it can be used to monitor the air pressure simultaneously while pumping air into the tires using the flexible tube inlet on the other end.
B00HL8ATQE|5|Loved it!  Perfect!  Exactly what I wanted!! Thanks
B000C7YQ2Y|5|I got this cap for my Mustang. Gas prices a this high gotta help make it harder to get in the tank. I would recommend it.
B001RB61LS|5|Just received my Horde decal in the mail today and I couldn't be happier with this product! Very nice size, not too big, not too small; easy to apply and very sleek! It also arrived in a relatively short amount of time, an enormous plus!    I'm actually going to be buying another one for my opposite window at my girlfriends suggestion in just a couple of seconds :)    Great seller! Also, love the instructions, lol
B000C3ZCT4|5|Replaced shocks on Explorer Sport. Restored ride back to comfort and control. Would give these a look if thinking about shock replacement.
B00J5KYJAS|5|Made my jeep look awesome
B001EOV46K|3|I am surprise it okay I recommended but is not an excellent product, for the price is good tats it..
B00G9QQRVK|5|Perfect for the ATV.
B0002KKHS8|5|Wow what a jerk I was. I attached a cellphone holder on my dashboard which didn't work out. When I removed it the two sided tape it left an oily residue on the dashboard. Tried every vinyl cleaner I could find to no avail. Then in a fit of anger and total stupidity I grabbed my bottle of 'Goof Off' and started rubbing. Completely removed the stain AND the top layer of my dashboard's paint. Drove me crazy and couldn't keep my eyes off the stain and the fact that I once again created a bigger mess by trying to solve a simple problem. Enter Vinylex. Read the reviews but simply didn't believe that it would do anything which the other cleaners hadn't done. Purchased it anyway and tried it this evening. Couldn't believe my eyes. Did several applications and the surface stain and imperfection from the Goof Off essentially 'dissolving' a section of my dash is almost undetectable. Seemed that the Vinylex would cause the undamaged dash surface top coating to 'bleed' some coloring.  As I rubbed the rag over the defective dash it essentially 'covered over' the stain and imperfection in the damaged area. Couldn't be happier with the results. Truly a remarkable product.
B0015RYAHG|5|Perfect fit, quick shipping.
B00122EEK2|2|Worked great for just under 3 months.  Now the check engine light is back with the same error code.<br />Looks like I need to replace the same sensor again.<br />It is in a 2006 Honda Accord... traveled approx 2,000 miles since the last replacement.<br />I'll look for another brand to buy this time.
B000CQ49X6|5|.•:*PERFECT*:•.10 STARS*.•:*DREAM SELLER*:•.100%RECOMMENDED!:•.THANK YOU*:•.<br />FAST SHIPPING! EXCELLENT SELLER!
B000C9TD2K|5|I've used these trouble free for a couple of years on my 2009 Jeep Wrangler. It is basically a bigger version of what it would normally take. Highly recommended.
B00J5J856I|5|Love it. Looks awesome on my white evo x that I debadged and replaced with this. Definitely recommend
B00P73KWE4|4|The price and free shipping is why I bought it.  When I received it, I was pleased, it was made as heavy as other brands.  I had to modify it some because I have an older Honda, but I used the brackets they sent which is a simple and easy idea.  I put plywood in the bottom of the basket as I had seen on the reviews before I bought it.  This really helps it take a load and beating without being bent up.  I live on a ranch and use this machine regularly. On the top rack, I haul a 25 gal. sprayer and in the basket are my chainsaw and sprayer accessories.  I like it and had money left to go to dinner.<br />Only con. Light expanded metal.  Easy solution. Put 1/4 to 3/8 plywood in basket and go.
B007LQPCY0|3|The floor mats were molded as advertise but were not perfectly molded.  I do expect the mats will last the life of my truck. However, the reason for my 3* rating was because the mat material is very stiff and resists my attempts to adjust/make the mat lay better.
B0032J1KAK|5|Excellen!!
B00KL3ALGO|2|I bought these from reading all the good reviews. But I wondered why there were so many good reviews afterwards. I've been using this product for a few months. They stick on great. That was the only reason I have 2 stars instead of 1.<br /><br />In terms of being a sun shade, it doesn't have much merit. You can see from the pictures that there isn't much difference between the portions of the window not covered by the shades and those covered by them. I have a small car and yet the shades could not cover most of the window surface. It does almost nothing to keep the glare out of my baby's eyes when it is really bright and sunny.<br /><br />I will not buy this again.
B000GZQOUY|5|AAAAAAAAA+++++++++
B00BLP2PME|5|Fast shipping .. Product as advertised.
B0052SF0LO|1|It worked until the first rain, then it crapped out. Remembered reading a review that recommended sealing all edges with silicone, but that is way too much trouble.
B000VEBD74|5|Came early and exactly what I wanted !
B002VDV738|5|Great price. Good Quality. Excellent fit.
B00BHZT9DG|5|It is pretty good
B000JI4Y6Y|4|Easily fit on my Night train. Very pleased
B000EQAVK4|5|Not much to say about this filter. Is the factory unit and fit perfectly. Only concern was the packaging. It was shipped in a soft, pliable package. Surprisingly the filter was not damaged but the box suffered some external damage.
B000BQ08SW|1|does not fit the carberatur edelbrock 1406 a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B001AZH6H4|3|I was very excited about this in the first place and the concept is great and it is very sturdy but the plastic that goes around the metal part of the headrest doesn't really fit snugly.
B00B4WSMN0|2|Save your money and get a good cover. This is not it and  its a one size fits all. My trailer is 18 feet and the cover I received could cover a 24 foot trailer.  I had it for less than a year and all the corners and part of the front and back have holes. Where ever there's a corner or edge, it has torn.  I thought I could get 2 years out of it, but no. Maybe if you keep your trailer in door, with no wind, it may work.
B00JQ6HPT8|5|Parts arrived in time promised. All parts were in the package. Love them!! Very easy to install but definitely a 2 person job. I'm very pleased!
B00V5PXCRW|5|Great comfortable grips and look pretty cool and came in at a timely manner :)
B00863OHZW|1|NOT NOT WELL MADE,,,,,,U WILL SEE MANY OF THESE SECONDS.PERIOD. BUY<br />Park Tool Rolling, Adjustable Height Shop Stool<br />by Park Tool UNDER 100.MY REVIEW IS SOLID
B005HEA90K|5|ok
B0068OS996|5|great fit
B004IARL32|5|3rd brake light mounts right up, easy to install, just have to splice 3 wires, looks great!
B00AF4UJ20|5|The one piece unit came very well packaged. All the parts were sent with it, including extra brackets to insure a proper and secure fit. Instructions were very clear. This was a great value and it also came with free shipping.<br />Looks great on my 2007 Ridgeline. The pre-drilled holes for the fog lights were an added convenience.
B006FR2ABE|3|I like the way they look and they do their job well enough.<br /><br />Just FYI, These bar ends that you're going to replace yours with aren't weighted.<br /><br />As for the connection method, I had to make these super tight to keep them from rotating.  They are probably going to rip out the thread inside my bars when I pull them out, so I doubt my stock bar ends will go back in.  These feel cheap enough that I worry hanging my helmet over them will make them come loose.<br /><br />All that being said, I'd probably buy them again because they are so much cheaper and look cooler than other options.
B004GFS2C8|1|Did not work well.
B004I17GCC|5|Simple quick review.<br />These fit like the factory units.<br />They are made in Taiwan and are of very good quality.<br />easy to install and they even come with the bulbs installed!
B000CILHAW|5|I have been looking for these side markers since forever!! I really like them. They look very nice on the car. Better than the stock yellow ones. This makes the car look more clean and very nice. These look better than the ones on ebay which has like a bigger detail to them. Now these look exactly like the orginal stock in which the detail is the same but just in clear. And that is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />It came with bulbs as well which was really nice:)
B002MEIVX0|2|The item did fit , however does not fold electrically as did the original
B002NESUA8|5|These are a good filter, don't kid yourself these are made by wix and private labeled for UniSelect. They are the same as a NAPA silver filter. Been selling them for 10+ years.
B0006IX7Y2|5|It is very easy to use.  It keeps the goods flowing downhill and keeps the sewer hose out of the mud.
B000CGM1KY|5|pump dropped right in, hooked right up and has been giving me better gas mileage since! Direct delco replacement for less $$
B003SNW8YC|4|Good product
B005BLIW9O|5|Took me a minute to figure out how to switch it out with my clear shield, but easy once I did.  During the day, I can see actually clearer than with the regular shield.  Everything looks somehow sharper.  And all but the most direct sunlight is pretty comfortable.  I can wear it night, but I generally don't.  You can still see, but not quite as well.  I rarely drive at night anyway, and if I started regularly I probably would switch out for my clear shield at night.  Little pricey, but even being a cheap guy I'm glad I got it.  Looks great on my helmet as well.
B008EMBMMG|5|Vivid color... Great quality
B000NNONWK|5|My dresser lives in a carport and I should have bought this cover a long time ago. I've had 3 other covers either blow away or sun fade and rot. This cover fits snugly and all the way to the floor. at the listed price this is one heck of a deal.
B004HP2J0S|3|Is nice trim.  I have lamp guards on this light on my Jeep and had to remove, insert bezel and re-install guard.  To install have to get the bezel lined up for not just a round bezel, but one that has to go in certain way.
B004ZK4YKI|5|Re-gearing my WR250X with this 40 tooth sprocket and a 13 tooth front sprocket rpm at highway speed is much better now.
B006R0DPVI|5|Bright & good quality but not the best. Worth the money though.
B00BLKXT88|5|Dont waste your time in other they simply dont perform and I have tried them all.  5w30 gives you great economy and protection
B003WGO460|5|They work great and are long lasting. Worth the price but I'm hoping for a price drop so I can buy more
B000X3DEC0|4|maybe i've never changed pads before but when i first saw these in the box, i thought i bought the wrong ones since they looked so small. not much brake dust and no more squealing brakes
B003SODY8A|5|Very heavy and made better than my OEM. Perfect fit for my 99 Escalade!
B000CAVR1O|5|Great quality and packaging was really good. Look like the original.....great price for quality of the product. Recomend the site.
B00979OEPM|5|ever since i bought these gloves people move out my way fasterer
B001O99EOO|5|These are the Stoptech Cryo Sotted rotors that receive much praise on Ford Superduty/Excursion applications. Works Great! The price here on Amazon is by far better than anywhere else I checked. The brakes on my 2003 Excursion were weak at best before. I replaced all 4 rotors with these and replaced brake pads with Hawks LTS pads. Stopping power is MUCH better.<br /><br />Make sure you order the right rotors- they are side specific front/rear.<br />Power Slot 126.65086CSL- Left Front<br />Power Slot 126.65086CSR- Right Front<br />Power Slot 126.65071CSL- Left Rear<br />Power Slot 126.65071CSR- Right Rear
B000CITGIM|5|Snug fit. Nice neutral color. Really enhances the appearance of the truck. The installation was a snap and could be done by a single person. Great product.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Works great!
B003G6V6O4|2|We're not as bright as expected, ordered super white and box said super white but are still very blue. Melted my wire harness.
B001P2EYHC|5|Love it!
B000JWKMA2|5|I have now had these magnetic plugs in my Prii for one oil change each and they have successfully caught a lot of ferrous particles on a normal manufacturer recommended oil change interval. These magnets are strong enough that prior to installation I was able to pick up my torque wrench with one.<br /><br />If you are planning on trading in your engine soon it won't make a difference for you, but I plan on keeping my engines for over 10 years. These magnets are a very cheap way of decreasing circulating abrasive particles that may be too small for the oil filter to catch, or could otherwise clog the oil filter and force the bypass valve to allow oil to circulate unfiltered.<br /><br />I wish I knew which if any of the gold plug brand magnetic plugs fit the honda metropolitan so I could get one for my brothers' scooter. Those don't have oil filters so something like this would make an even bigger difference.
B005FKBYLO|1|I'm not sure if these guys have ever SEEN a 2006 Chrysler 300, but the kit I was shipped has the wrong pads in it.  I get halfway through doing all four wheels and realize this.  It's listed as a compatible vehicle for the kit three different times
B006GLEBIO|5|I installed this kit on my 350z and it looks great. The rear wiring was a little short, but all that was needed was some extra speaker wire. Lights are very bright and work well. Second day on my car, it poured out, but the lights still worked the following day. Thanks
B003NDM0QI|5|It came quickly, works perfectly as intended. Fits right on. I would recommend to get the K&N cleaner kit because I clean mine about every 3,000 to 5,000 miles. But make sure you have time to spare because once you clean it, you need to spray the oil on it. It will take at least a few hours to dry. You don't want to put it back into your air filter housing and start it up because all of that oil will get inside.<br />But the filter works perfectly. Had it for a while and always had good experience with K&N.
B00FKPJIGC|5|Used for the door lights in my Mr2. Very bright. I like the easy to use connectors. Quality 3m double sided adhesive backing.
B0016P8O6U|5|My new car did not include a 12v outlet handy for powering my GPS.  My previous car had an outlet near floor level in front handy for this purpose but the plug-in in the new car was not well located.  All I needed for the new car was a 12 volt extension cord to feed the GPS from a lighter outlet serving the back seats. I was looking for a cheap 10 ft simple 12v extension cord. This inexpensive coiled 15' cord serves the purpose perfectly. I ran it from the back of the center console to connect to the GPS power cord.   The GPS cord goes under the floor mat to reach the extension cord connector. I could have used a shorter extension cord, but the surplus extension remains coiled under the drivers seat and is no problem.  It was inexpensive and it works.
B007BU5XI6|4|Scooter was not hard to assemble. It cranked up first try and ran very good. Still waiting on the bill of sale(its been 3+ weeks) In week 3 it died a coupe of times. We are in the process of putting a dual fire spark plug in it. Overall it has been a a good purchase.
B004R4ZP6Y|5|Great product
B0007LXTN2|1|We couldn't get the product to work like it was suggested. It was a pain getting it to stay in the window. Wouldn't recommend this product.
B0002UEPVI|1|I am a mechanic and have purchased this item and many other similar types of permatex silicone tubes.

B00CZG1ZRY|5|Holds the EZ Pass perfectly.
B0031XXW4O|5|I was skeptical about this &#34;bendable rod,&#34; but decided to try it based on others' reviews. They were right! This is a GREAT product!!!
B002QLTDEU|5|Looks great on my sentra and I never see it on others cars. Much better than the tired palm trees. Its been on my car for three yrs now and still looks brand new. One of my top purchases for my car.
B008XIQ5KA|4|Bought these as Christmas work gifts. Wife liked it so much, I had to order one more, because she took it- NUff said Key tool is odd otherwise a 5 star
B0013TNFEA|5|I had a lawn mower that needed a new  plug, I couldn't find it in a store, Amazon had it, it was a direct replacement. Installed it, Lawn mower has been working great ever since
B002A956Z8|5|Perfect tool for winter.
B004FRY7J4|1|I don't like this at all.  It looks cool, but the wind curls right under it and pushes under my goggles making it impossible to ride safely.  I took it off and went goggles only with zero trouble.  I hope this thing is biodegradable because I threw it in the trash.
B000YHBAGW|5|It is everything I needed and more. I would advise others to get one as well. You never know these days.
B00JIEX722|5|Worked perfect
B000GYNNBS|5|Came on time well packaged easy to install I was done and riding in 20 minutes
B003124Y38|1|I installed this on my quad and the 3rd time I rode it the spot welds broke. I am 55 years old and ride very slow and steady. This is an overpriced piece of garbage not worth the costof shipping. Save yourself the money and trouble and find another company who makes a product that is built stronger.
B007KXJ1SW|5|Perfect for my 2010 honda civic perfect fit
B00M6YFELS|5|Hi , I installed this Relay on my 4Runner to power my fog lights , I installed 8 of them in the front of it , my old one just burned out , well , really melted , but this one is working really good now , is nice because comes with the socket.<br />I know some people here with special tools will complain about this little relay, it's not good I check it with my atomic particle analyzer , I use my electronic engineer/ nasa/mad scientist tools and is not rated to power even a led light or whatever you want to complain about , but for me , my car and my needs works really good , 8 , 55wats lights working all together at the same time is enough for me , I have them on for hours with not a single problem I'm really happy.
B008E7QO88|1|Although this item was listed as fitting my 1998 Honda CRV it did NOT FIT; it was about an inch shorter than it needed to be.  On attempting to look up Dura BP617 MS I was unable to find them anywhere on the web.  That leads me to conclude that these were some outdated and out of manufacture ends that were touted as applicable to my application.  The correct product should have been Dura MKD503.  I'm sure the brake pads received are fine in SOME application but most definitely not mine.  I have to fault the supplier and not the manufacturer for attempting to dispose of their leftovers by mis-identifying them.
B0002ILK6I|5|The battery was a tight fit in my R80GS.  Had to remove the top shock bolt to install.  Cranks the big engine just fine.
B005KGIZIS|5|I love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It came so quickly and it is so silky smooth. I can't wait to use this with an id case next year for college.
B0026FCGJU|3|The bag i received  was the Kinnedyne E-Track Storage Bag witch is $20.46. the bag I ordered is $9.81...so i guess i got a deal but i really wanted the orange bag. but no biggie i will keep the better bag. thanks for the mistake....lol
B00AYQSQ92|5|When I saw these, I couldn't believe the price.  I've seen the Mugen pedals listed at $180 on their website and $220 on another site.  One reviewer stated that these are fakes, but I can't believe that Amazon would open themselves up to litigation for selling knock-offs.  The box has the Mugen logo, the brake and clutch pedal are etched with the Mugen logo and the installation sheet, which is printed in Japanese, has the Mugen logo.<br /><br />Some modification was required for the brake and clutch pedals to go on over the metal pads after removing the factory rubber.  Fortunately I have a Dremel tool and it made short work of opening up the back side of the pedal covers.  The only thing, I'd recommend would be to replace the provided machine screws with stainless steel.  Your friendly neighborhood Ace hardware has them in stock, for just a few dollars.<br /><br />I added a Strut King stainless dead pedal cover and now the interior of my 02 RSX Type S looks awesome.  These were well bought.<br /><br />Update, June 25, 2017<br /><br />These have been on my car for over two years.  Since installation, there has been zero maintenance required.  I have never regretted this purchase.
B004C65DYQ|5|works well
B001FVCNWG|5|Nice to.be able to haul things with the car. Now I don't have to take my gas hog truck everywhere
B000CPI5YG|5|It was nice to be able to find this and order it so easily. It was here in a very short time and everything was exactly as stated.
B0009V1WSE|5|Works great. I wouldn't use a trailer without it.
B0040CX74U|5|A great product for a a very good price.  This same item was way more expensive at the dealership.  Thanks!
B008FBDA26|1|The sticker wasn't cut properly, and the details aren't there. Also part of the sticker didn't fit correctly and part of it bulges because of this.
B003CSQU0G|5|Gauge works flawless as I excepted with an auto meter.
B00ATTRBD6|5|A bit on the high side, but I'm well satisfied.
B00A7YJ59G|5|Very good works throught the wheel or around the tire very reliable and easy to use
B00Y5HU0TU|5|Very nice in my hand and looks great.
B0057CD6AM|1|Not Brite enough in dark areas
B001FGDJ6U|4|Starter works good and was a very good deal. Thanks
B00B3V2HRY|5|Very pleased
B000GKJKGE|4|I bought one for my silverado. Its not perfect fit. But If you have patience and by doing some modifications to it  works pretty good for the money.
B003VPCGJO|1|This did not work. I even took it to the dealership and they said it was definitley broken.
B00FXSHCR8|5|Nice they work well and look awesome
B005ZHFXKU|5|Once you figure out the wiring it's nice & flawless & you can always add the other accessories such as window & a/c control if wanted
B0081GLU40|5|for the price this is a steal, very easy install all you need is a pocket screwdriver and boom there you go. but on a side note tag light bulb is too long for the 2012 honda civic tag light housing. It barely fits in there
B001D1OPPG|5|nice tank
B003VLBPJA|3|worked well 4 2 rides :)
B003UGJ2XW|1|Didn't affix well to my Grand Cherokee mirror and dropped at any major bump. It's easier to keep my tag in the visor and hook it on the mirror when parked.
B00BVEMV7E|1|Second set now failing after 7 months.  Seems they will work and look great for a few months, then something goes wrong.  Most recently they will come on, work for about 5 minutes, then shut off.  Bench test to a 12V battery brought same results.  First set one went out at a time to which they sent replacements, now a few months later the second set failed as well.  Put an old set of (supposedly) lower quality ballasts in, and work like a charm.
B00DHK3Z84|5|Vary easy install pending ur upgrades the main jets in there kit came with 6 main jets 145 ,150,155,160,165,170 check ur plugs and find the best jet for our application
B003ZMDAJS|5|Love it. Looks great.
B001DC9YSS|5|Perfekt!
B008S2S2VQ|3|These are attractive units.  I used the included LED units as additional back-up lights instead of  &#34;running lights&#34;.  My only problem was, the seam on one of the units wasn't sealed quite right, so, at the first rain, I got moisture inside the lamps fixture.  I sealed it with silicone and now its fine (after sucking all the water out with a vacuum).
B000AA4RWM|5|Great set of levels make getting level at campground a snap. Graduated markings tell you how many inches you are off.  Good adhesive backing eliminates need to drill holes.
B0009IBJAS|5|Working great keeping my lawn mower batteries charged over the off-season. LED lights work in stages as advertised.
B0031XUKQW|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B0033YQB5S|3|Won't a lot of water get on motor
B00NUE88FW|5|Easy ti install and works like a charm.  I'm no longer dragging my antenna on the rafters in the parking garage...
B00BUS3AKS|5|Subaru Dealership wanted twice the price,i shopped around and Amazon became my HERO !!!!!!!
B004BTOH5A|4|this arrived quickly and worked perfectly
B000P17NXQ|5|Easy to install.  Easy to setup.  Makes adjustments to fining tuning e--brakes on the trailer as simple as possible.  The real time read of the voltage and the multiple color options for the screen are nice touches.  Greta, compact size, fits perfectly on the lower dash with a couple screws.  The added bracket options in the box make putting this anywhere convenient.
B00065JM8U|4|This fan is nice and well made. It was also easy to install. It is a bit noisier than I had hoped, but it does move the air adequately. Having two speeds is really nice too.
B007AOSA06|4|Exactly what I was looking for.  Easy to install (don't follow the supplied instructions.  While they are the correct (p/n) instructions, they are out of date for these mats.  While pricey, they are much better than the OEM mats.  I would purchase these again.
B0019FHSO6|5|My son loved this.
B0066Q3I74|5|AAA  GOOD
B003D86ETC|3|WHY DID NOBODY MENTION HOW TINY THIS THING WAS?! I'm so disappointed right now was excited for a kick ass new bumper magnet. I can't believe shipping was almost $5. Came super fast tho.
B000CN5QG8|5|This was a great addition to my bed covering. Keeps water and dust from going through the cracks around my tailgate.
B007RVR2BU|5|Very prompt shipping and 5-minute installation.  A far better solution than a trip to the dealer and a $380 charge, and that's after a 2-week wait for them to order the parts.
B00JTR2D2I|5|Perfect price for good product
B000C3YSV2|5|Got it on my 94 jeep grand Cherokee and bolted right on no modifications. I even picked up some mpg's and I love the whistle on full acceleration.
B0000ATZCE|4|I like it, and it works for the money, so I consider this is a good buy.  But, any semi-good bike thief will be able to cut this cable and take your bike.  I bought it for my son, who uses it at school, so I think for his purposes, this should hold up fine.  But, I would not recommend this lock for public lots, or colleges where the people we are trying to protect our bikes from are a bit more creative.
B003UI1VZC|4|Perfect fit and easy install.  The only things I have to mention is that the original came permanently greased with no grease fitting while this one came with a grease fitting that I needed to grease - so I had to purchase a grease gun that cost almost as much as the tie rod end.  Also the bolt that the castle nut goes on was much shorter than on the OEM.  I don't know why the differences, but it works.  Thanks
B0031BH1KM|5|T'was all it could be as a Barnett product. And then some...
B002KJSEWU|4|Bought this in the same order as a Playstation game and a DVD. Guess what? They packed it in the same box, loose, with only minimal bubble wrap. Bouncy, bouncy, UPS delivery and voila! The disc packaging was messed up.   BOOOOOOOOO! Hire a new guy in the warehouse, Amazon!
B004XG3R3O|4|Some assembly required is usually a joke in my shop but this license plate holder had us scratching our heads. The combination of nylocks, spacers, and how the plate would look best took a couple of try's. the plate I was mounting was extra thick so that added a degree of difficultly too. Two surprises, first not having a leash is a blessing since if the plate is off, it isn't dragging or getting wound up in the winch cable. Second, it acts as a surprisingly good deflector to keep a lot of mud etc out of the winch cable.
B00OJHGYU0|5|A++++ fast shipping.....great comunication 😃
B0031WGPGC|5|Auto parts stores don't seem to carry 13&#34; blades so I found these on Amazon. It's hardly rained since I installed them.....but they did work well. They are not soft and thin  like most blades, seem stiff but do a great job. Hope they hold up to the Texas heat...
B0019R2VCI|3|Cool decal, way smaller than expected
B00C80HM9C|3|The product is simple to install and easy to use, you may want to consider buying another light to go with it because it is pretty small, I like the product but the only thing it didn't include is the owners manual
B005E3GOO4|5|Worked as expected on my 2009 GMC Yukon. Home Depot cut it and I programmed it myself.
B005XRRAXU|5|I got this for a friend since he needed some cheap taillights for his car. He loves them, but I think they're ugly.<br /><br />They fit pretty good and they work.
B00BAYR4AY|4|Installed on the bow of our 17ft Blazer jet jon boat.  This light illuminates the entire river, shoreline, trees, objects in the water for a long and wide range.  I run it on 24v battery bank for the trolling motor.<br /><br />The mounting hardware and  feet leave a little to be desired.
B000CNHLRK|4|This was a good part and at a good price.  Have bought these before and will continue to buy them again.
B0006O2P2Q|5|Smells like heaven, especially since my vehicle was reeking of cigarettes from the previous owner, and this air freshener definitely did the job!
B006R07K9Q|5|with these I can now put a new or use  set of mirrors that are OEM and/or I can look for who is selling the right size mirrors for me.
B00HEPBLXE|5|Love it. Looks awesome. Just be prepared to destroy your OEM shift knob in the earlier Z's. You're gonna need hulk strength and vice grips to get it off
B000COO406|5|These fit my 94 Ford Ranger perfectly and looked great. The ride is so much more stable now. Great buy
B000C5O1VW|5|Product came as promised and works like a champ.  No issues thus far with my mower running on this spark plug.
B001D58Q3E|5|The quality of these Michelin wipers are great.  I've been using them on my Lexus GX470 for the past 6 years.  The last pair held up for almost 3 years in the southern California sun.
B0049MTGQY|4|Really easy installation. Came with the six m10 x 1.25 bolts
B0001MQ7EK|5|Works great for keeping the drinks cold and the size is just right. Have used it several times and it hasn't let me down. Don't expect a freezer, 'cause it's not. And it doesn't do a good job of cooling down warm soda and beer cans. It's really not intended to do that very well but for keeping food and beverages cool, it's just the ticket.
B00E7G4AEA|4|Nice.
B00G3BRNZ0|5|I've noticed a smoother Idle and maybe a mile or two in gas mileage but I do think it's worth the money. It does run smoother and acceleration is a bit better. All in all I'll keep using it
B001N0D60C|5|My rabbit's foot arrived within five business days of ordering. Everything went was smoothly as things could possibly go. And the rabbit's foot is exactly what I expected. The only complaint I have is that you aren't guaranteed to receive the color you want. I was lucky enough to get the color I wanted (red), but other customers may not be so lucky. There are four colors, and the color you get is random. You can at least make this purchase with the peace of mind that this is a reliable vendor (they even hand wrote \\"Thank You =)\\" on the box receipt).
B00DW8ENKU|3|I don't remember ordering these but I might have
B004I0WS6M|4|You can't beat the price, and it's a very good headlight. My only reason for not giving an extra star is that I would have liked to be able to choose the brightness of the bulb (which is great, but I'm one of those people who like an extra bright light), and the color of the bulb's light (I prefer the bluish tint). But really, it's a very good product.
B002VVGPE6|5|I bought this to replace the stock 4&#34; windshield on my FLHX. It's great! It was difficult to find definitive info on height recommendations and the height measurement instructions require 2 people, string/level and a ruler. I had a hard choice between the 6.5 and 8.5&#34; windshields. I'm 5' 10&#34; and ride a lot on highways and interstates. Most reviews that listed a personal height were 6' tall. I needed a windshield to move the air stream from hitting directly in my face and side buffeting from on my ears. I use a Mustang Wide Vintage seat on my bike which does not sit me as low or back as others seats might and I'm glad I chose the 8.5&#34;. I see easily over the top of the windshield (which I prefer) and it moves the air stream over my head. It has also reduced the side air buffeting by 80-90% so I can now hear my radio while on the road. It also looks good on my bike. If you want to look through the windshield go with a lighter tint. The Dark Smoke is difficult to see through at night.
B0068D9L6W|5|Great Seller and Great Product!!!
B002818HZY|4|The sowed parts of the strap are too thick to enable the door to fully lock. This is handled by pulling the straps further into the car which pulls the Bumper Protector higher up. This is okay, but should be noted in the instructions. Of course when the Bumper Protector is in place the lower space below the pad can not be reached. You have to upload the Bumper Bully into the trunk to reach the lower space. How might this be corrected?
B00AF67MSC|2|didn't come glue nothing to mount to car once I got it on look cool doesn't come on always when you press buttons
B004GKNAMU|4|This is an awesome glove!  I usually wear LARGE size for all my other moto gloves, but for the zero gloves its a MEDIUM...<br />A typical motocross glove doesn't really provide (or require) much dexterity because it's difficult to get a durable glove out of a fabric that wont cut off circulation to your hands if its tight to your skin.<br />This glove, however, is made of a very stretchy (yet durable) backside that allows it to fit close like a mechanic's glove without squeezing your fingers numb after 30 min of riding.  Your normal size will probably fit just fine, but this is one of those gloves where going down a size will give you that &#34;wearing nothing at all&#34; feeling without constricting your blood flow, which is something that I like.
B000FW2MWW|5|Battery Tender 081-0148-25 Quick Disconnect 25' Extension received in a short time. Works great for the garage if you have a motorcycle parked behind your truck and the electrical plug is in front of the truck, for an example.
B00I93BOZ0|4|We've never had a product like this before, but we figured it'd be interesting to try it out. It's pretty awesome! It's like your own personal light show for inside your car. Use responsibly and you're set. Obviously it's a vanity product but at a decent price it's something I can see anybody who enjoys lights and light shows enjoying this product. Recommended.
B000EVN7W8|5|Does it fits on mi Mitsubishi lancer 06 es?!
B000FGE6AO|5|Filter was easy to find & order. Fit perfectly, arrived quickly.  I think it has actually improved my gas mileage by about 1 mpg.
B001F15YC2|5|Awesome. These Air Lift bags fit great. The install was easy. We like how they function and how we didn't have to do any drilling. We also like the wireless compressor system.Very glad we purchased these.
B007JVQFUM|5|Just as good as factory
B00PXF8LYY|5|Perfect fit
B000BUU5TU|1|I have bought two of these now trying to get one that does not leak at the garden hose connection. It is a cheaply made connection that is easy to break. Don't waste your time and money buying and installing these cheaply made tank flushers. Also an 1 1/2\\" hole has to drilled in the tank to install, in my case what am I to do now??????? Extreeemly Mad......
B001G7HXF6|5|AAAAA
B003SZ3D9Y|5|Fit right into the girlfriends BMW without trouble.  Just as high quality as the original; I think BMW made a stupid design with that stupid small hose barb that they put the stupid hose clamp on that doesn't unscrew - thus making you break it off and buy a new one.  That's probably why you're looking at this thing to buy too.  Whoops.  But I can tell you it does work as a direct replacement.  And yes, of course, it got here on time.
B00FH7VZRI|5|It works just fine for securing my cargo.  No more sliding or tumbling around.  I'm thinking about buy some for my other vehicles.
B000BWE4RC|3|Only problem with the pump is it arrived with the plastic container cut open and smelled like it was used.Very dissapointed with that. Otherwise seems to work ok?
B000CIQ5DG|5|I'd decided that this pump was just what I needed for my 1979 Fiat 124 Spider race car; a pump with built in pressure regulator that was a better choice than what was in the car. I found this pump at other sites and at the last minute, thought: \\"just for fun, I'll try Amazon\\". I was pleasantly surprised to find this pump on Amazon and gleefully ordered it as it was nearly 50% lower-priced than the other parts warehouses. A happy choice!!!
B0019COQ6C|5|Great
B000C8ZJ9C|2|Did not fit the vehicle as it was specified to. Had to be returned.
B00JXVY54Y|5|Must have if you are a DIY type of person and own a BMW with an N54/55. The plugs are very sensitive and important part of the car. Even touching the end of the plug in these cars can cause misfiring. This tool allows for perfect and easy installation of spark plugs. A must have for anyone who does DIY work.
B002UC14JW|5|Received the part promptly and it worked correctly.  It completely met my expectations.
B000BUOSGG|5|Wonderful little dish drain when you are camping out.
B00CQ44I42|5|I have problems to fit the replacement tire because my car have five 5 rims originals, no come with a normal spare tire.
B001N729FS|5|Not much to say here other than that it works.  I bought 2 of these for my brother in law.  He has two clay pigeon throwers that work off of a car battery.  They are mounted in a small metal housing on a trailer.  Well over Memorial Day while doing some skeet/trap shooting the thrower jammed.  Unfortunately, while he was checking out the jam someone hit the button to throw a clay pigeon and the machine nearly took his head off.  Fortunately, he only ended up with 6 stitches to the side of his head and an story to tell.<br /><br />After that I bought two of these, one for each of the machines, so that in the future, if a machine jams, they can quickly disconnect the battery and ensure nobody accidentally get nearly decapitated.<br /><br />They work well...quick and easy to install and use.  I'm sure there are tons of other uses for them, mine is just one.
B00HF4XXY4|5|fit well replaced old nasty part
B00BR1TLS8|1|Caution DO NOT PURCHASE  this light.  I have bought and returned 4 times and none of them will stay on after charging.  This is a defective product.
B0006HPA02|5|Fit on my 2005 silverado 1500 great. Looked up part number on msd and purchased through amazon. Msd has always been my first choice for ignition parts. Only complaint I have is the third plug wire was rubbing on the bolt on my steering shaft, so I had to wrap some loom around it. Other than that very satisfied with msd and amazon once again.
B00INZ65B2|5|went together well, work without issues
B007GO20YM|4|Took ~ 1 month to deliver, but it works. Quality seems to be there. I've mounted this to my motorcycle helmet - only time will tell if it holds up.
B000BRFTH6|1|Used once
B00B56EZEA|2|be careful when opening trunk with this installed, will catch your fingers and hurts
B000VAUZUO|5|replace my 2003 honda civic lx and i feel the big difference on the gas and smooth on the idle.
B009FUFCDQ|1|Worthless. I washed them this morning in cold water and put them on the line. With just ONE washing, the edgings have frayed and the fiber has detached from the weave. So, buyer beware. Absolutely worthless, and Amazon....you should be ashamed to put your name on them.<br />  I'll use them for packing material and good riddance.
B000924QO0|5|I'm a professional detailer.This sealant is one of the best out there, if you're paint is prepped properly. I use my 3\\" Griot's garage buffer to apply this stuff on the lowest buffer speed with a 3M Perfect-It waffle pad. Meguiar's has been in the detailing business for a long time and I use all of their Mirror Glaze/Professional products. Some other brands are more expensive for less amount of product and produce the same results. This price is great for the amount you get, buy this and you'll be happy. See the images I uploaded.
B001Y93OBI|5|Great wheel covers - nicely packed. Directions on wire ring insert would have been helpful - easy to guess where the ring goes
B000GTQQ2G|4|It's a pain that you have to purchase a special tool to change spark plugs but this tool makes it fairly painless once it's in your possession.
B00BG423YA|5|excellent product, five-star seller.
B0000AXNMO|4|I cleaned my windshield and applied the Rain-X as per the manufacturer's directions.<br />I thought nothing of it until a couple weeks later when it started to rain.  I noticed that my windshield was repelling the water.<br />Rather than smear across the window like usual, the water formed beads and rolled up and over my windshield.<br />I didn't even need to turn my wipers on.
B0022XTZO0|4|This product arrived in a timely fashion. The acid was easy to install in the battery, after a short charge period the installation in the motorcycle was straight forward. Function check of system provided a perfect part at a fair price.<br />Thank you..
B0013BBK0E|5|This is a fantastic product from Suzuki that fits many of the Bandit tanks, and definitely fits my 2011 Suzuki GSX1250FA sport touring machine.  I bought this cover because my dark paint is getting scratched over time from sitting close to the tank - especially on high speed corners.  It is easiest to install with two people, and is a very snug fit.  I made a youtube video - search on redonkilaus - and you can see the installation from start to finish.  Good luck!
B00DBEPIX6|5|I still have this 1993 and under every circumstance and consideration, it is in &#34;very good condition&#34; and I intend to restore the car because my son is now 24, married, a summa cum laude graduate and Northwestern graduate student, while working toward his Doctor of Music and working now with his new wife as band director and assistant band director [wife Kaitlin] at a fine school [secondary] for arts and sciences.  These will never wear out and I'm pleased with every aspect of the transaction but needed to note the personal emphasis as I hope this will be picked up on by other vendors/sellers to help me in the restoration project while you should know, the car looks and acts like NEW!  Thank you for this opportunity to write a review and yes, it is objective as the 5 cylinder with Turbo and every possible option you expect on upscale, luxury cars is indeed on this 1993 Acura Vigor.  Kevin M. Callihan, Sr.
B0027UJNPY|5|High quality, great fit. Perfect complement for my 1969 Firebird Convetible.  It was delivered on time in great shape. I should have replaced my old rings sooner!
B006Q9KRCU|5|Good product and great fit!
B008UHXQU6|5|These lights were just what we were looking for, and we paid a fraction of the cost we would have paid anywhere else.
B0002KR88A|5|A++++ Excellent product and service
B008FYKU8A|2|It worked well until it flew off on the highway. Thanks goodness it was only drizzling, so I was able to make it home safely. I brought 2 of these wipers (one that is 26 inch and one that's 22). I'll give this 2 stars instead of 1 because the smaller, passenger side wiper, is still working after 2 months. For both wipers I took my time to make sure that they were set up correctly, so I highly doubt it's user error in this case.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product. For something like this, I recommend go the safer route and try something else.
B00192QSVS|5|I put these brackets on my 2011 jeep wrangler. They fit perfect. I mounted KC slimlight 130W's to these brackets and i'm very pleased with the outcome.
B001EGT3I4|5|This was a perfect fit. Saved myself alot of money. I will be doing the drivers side this spring. Borrow or purchase a gear puller, it will make the job alot easier.
B00MQA72EY|5|Great quality.
B00DUL8BSO|5|My husband was very happy with the purchase. The Mustang is his baby and If the cover makes him happy...I'm happy.
B00BVBQGU0|5|The part fit well.  Came well packaged and is of quality construction.  Not the cheapest on Amazon, but the quality is apparent.
B00681BDXI|5|Easy Setup!
B00BR233M2|4|I bought this jacket in black size medium and overall I'm really happy with it (I'm 5'9, 135).  It's not perfect but pretty close to the jacket I was looking for.  What I like:  The leather is really soft and makes the jacket super comfortable.  Stylish but not so trendy that it will only last one season.  What I don't like:  The arms are too loose, I wish they were a little more fitted.  I guess that makes it more comfortable but I think it would look better slightly more fitted.  Or maybe I should have gotten the size small but I'm tall so I usually size up if I'm not sure.  Anyway I kept the jacket and I still like it.
B000BM8RT8|5|This little compressor is indeed very powerfull..<br />Excellent for offroading and for trucks with 32&#34; or bigger tires.. My old sears 12v Compressor took 20 minutes to pump up each tire after 4wheeling and got super hot where it requiered some 10 minutes of cooling time between each.. making it a total of ... FOREVER!! .... To fill all 4... This MV50 took care of all 4 in bout' 30min total with no cooling time in between.<br />Defenitely worth it! Well built and small enough to carry arreound all the time.
B002IUUYC4|5|The 13001P Vance and Hines header fits perfectly on my 78 KZ1000 LTD (which isn't listed on the fitment list). The tail pipe however needed two minor modifications to fit (a custom fitment to the mounting flange and a different brake pedal).
B00COE3ZHA|3|The wiper wont fit Mazda 3 S, 2009, even with many fittings provided. I had to replace rubber piece on the wiper to make it work. Otherwise, Fast shipping and item as described.
B007J4706C|5|Worked amazing
B0040CTTH4|5|It worked on my 1998 Toyota Corolla.
B000C19DNM|5|Got here fast and works great. Instructions could be a little more clear.  Took about 3 hrs self installation. Cheers.
B001FIDNGO|3|Time will tell how well they will hold up. I have not had it installed long enough to tell how it will last. Very difficult to attach if the seat belt is too thick.
B0075Y0L9O|5|pretty good everything I love it and the designers cool I was looking for something like this and I can say you I recommend it if you want to pimp you stuff :P
B008G23K4C|4|Ordered on a Thursday,  delivered next day,  WOW!  Installed in 30 mins,  perfecto fit,  looks great,  night vision improved.  (FORD focus kona).  ONLY con:  replacing halogen bulb will be a hassle in future,  retainer clip and dust cap very tricky,  require removing assembly for bulb replacement.<br /><br />OVERall rating:  9 🎲.
B003969PKS|5|works ;)
B00SGPUVN2|5|Very easy installation, I've put them on all my vehicles something you just can't live without and they look so cool.
B000CIQ47S|5|Great Product
B0065V4N24|5|Working very good so far, much better than Kats which didn't seem to last.
B0001EW4EK|5|Arrived on time.  Installed easily and look good.
B00BJNNNQU|5|Amazing product! Less than an hour and my headlamp got clear transparant again!
B000CP0KHG|5|work as descibed
B00DJSAH1W|4|Nice starter kit , worked well only problem removal tool very cheasey , bent it first try had to run to RadioShack for a better one.
B004X5QWAA|5|Had no issues installing this item in my 1996 Jeep Cherokee. Item is well made and is sold at half the cost of other retailers.
B00DNISLX4|5|Excellent!
B000GU36KU|5|it was better than I thought for the price and it worked amazingly on my 95 wr250z it even came with the cover for the clutch
B00NUJCCNQ|2|The first thing I saw that bugs me is the cheap eyelets that are on the belt!<br />Ragged metal tabs curled up onto a rubber or plastic washer. Cuts & Scratches!<br />I dont care for the polester cuff under the zipper on the ends of the sleaves !<br />This is suppose to be cow hide but I believe its water buffalo cow! Same grain & it comes from the same place, Pakistan!
B001UEB2XY|5|Goood
B00P645K5K|1|Proceduct feels and looks very flimsy and cheap. It does lay flat as it supposed to since it was folder in half (twice, which created a crease in form of a cross on the middle) for the shopping purposes. The way it was shipped is a joke, since it was folded twice and tided with a string!<br /><br />I was expecting more of a rubber mat, rather than foam/paper product.<br /><br />I would not recomed this product.
B000CNA0G4|4|I ordered these from a site saying they give a 2.5\\" lift.  After install I actually got 4\\".  Overall I am very happy.  They came with bushings installed. Just plan ahead and have replacement bolts, I had to cut two of mine.
B005G21BDW|1|One of the four turnbuckles was not crimped on one end so the hook & spring assembly fell out leaving the turnbuckle worthless.<br />I guess if you don't inspect your items before you ship them there is no quality control.
B00CM4QY3O|3|These are of nice quality, well sealed, nice flexible shafts, all metal is plated to resist corrosion and the wires are shrink wrapped at the bullet plugs.<br /><br />Just don't trust the sizes stated. The listing states the size is &#34;4.8 x 3 x 0.9 inches&#34;. But they are really only 4 3/8 long (including the shaft, which sticks out much longer than in the picture, 3 times as far actually), and only 3.5 inches from rubber base to tip. The lit area is just over 2&#34; x 1 1/8&#34;.<br /><br />They also aren't super bright. Not as bright as a 21 watt bulb, maybe 2/3rds as bright, by my calibrated Mark-I eyeball.
B005C57NA8|5|fast service.. great product...
B00SV54LBK|3|I recevied this and pulled off the grill to install it. I did the install according to the instructions provided. I went to put the grill back on and it wouldn't fit because the nut holding the bracket on was interferring. The instructions clearly stated to put the nut for the top part of the grill bracket on the underside of the grill. I turned the screw around and tried to install again. I could get it on but it still didn't fit exactly right. I like the way it looks but after reinstalling the grill I noticed the center and even the ends where the bracket is were loose. I pulled it back off and installed a couple of wire tie anchors ion the center and put more bow in the brackets. I reinstalled the grill and the center was good but the ends were still loose. I would say that this is redneck engineering at it finest (I should know because I'm a redneck!) make it fit even if you have to force it a little and it's fits ok but not exact. Rugged Ridge needs to go back to the drawing board and work on a better installation method. I will probably pull the grill off again and figure out a better way to mount it. I do like the way it looks.
B001J60YYQ|4|A little work to install. found it easier to take the bed of over dropping the tank. We'll see how long it last!
B00NLQZMYE|4|Does the job, but a user manual/guide would help and I wish the cables/connectors were more durable. It would also help if the plug into which you connect the charger were on top of the battery; I have to pull the battery from the housing in the motorcycle to connect the charger. Unfortunately, if Mirai's batteries discharge to less than 20% they're useless and this charger won't recharge the battery. Some competitor's chargers will reset their battery and enable recharging even if the battery has discharged all of its power.
B001CA6KYM|5|Looks beefy and seems well built enough to outlast the car. Love the fact that I can grease these versus the non-serviceable originals.
B0002STR90|4|I am a shop owner and these help in cleaning a surface really quick!  i go thru alot of them and this is a good place to buy them.
B000FCRGNC|5|Noone makes them like Zymol; you can feel the difference. They last a long time as well. Would recommend over anything else.
B00EITE0R8|4|Looked very nice when arrived, but the jackets run small.
B000JZZ9WU|5|Works really well with my INR Nav unit in my Sierra Denali.  The bracket is the right shape for mounting under the dash of the GMT800s<br />Can't verify for other trucks, but do your homework beforehand and you won't have an issue.
B000FQ2106|1|it fell apart in less than two months
B004GCSWOE|5|Fit perfectly
B00Q3JTJE0|3|Not sure about genuine leather claim. It doesn't feel like leather at all. It has many warring sign of cancerous agent on the packaging which is not disclosed here plus it is not a characteristic of leather. A bit bulky feel to it. Very easily put on my Accord 98. Seller issued full credit for return of the item.
B000E5S6XY|5|Relatively easy installation<br />Some assembly required<br />Noticeable increase in power<br />Good improvement to MPG<br />Dresses up the engine bay nicely<br />Good first mod to your car
B000E0IDT6|5|Delivery quick, products excellent.  These cords are stout, the hooks are a useful size, and past usage of the same product proves them to be durable.<br /><br />They deliver a lot of utility per dollar.
B0057HECZU|5|Very good stuff
B0041RU044|5|Painted my truck with this!
B002MEUUAM|5|This is my second set of replacement headlights. I replaced the originals (because of fogging of lens) with TYC brand lights. Two years of driving with those left me feeling unsafe at night due to poor adjustability, and a beam pattern that was very uneven: lots of hot and cold spots. These lights are much better: full coverage and good adjustability. Relatively easy to replace on my '97 Civic CX: just remove the fasteners on the top of the grille and in the wheelwell (there is a good video on YouTube about that,) and peel the bumper cover forward to reveal the 10mm (I think) bolts and retaining bracket. Penetrating oil may be handy. Very glad I did it: I feel much safer at night!
B004W979TK|3|Lights are great its just the top bulb wont go in right.
B004DJCS2M|4|It works, it restored my battery to almost store grade, and it keeps new battery from sulfating. but make sure to by the big 32oz bottle to save money.
B005MX016S|4|Works well not well enough to give it 5 stars but cleaned lots of grim off my 13 year old Lexus RX..
B002UC6OYC|5|great
B0001EVXCY|5|Fit like a glove, went on very easy. But rain still comes in. Doesn't come down far enough.
B000GU5IH4|4|This fits my 1982 Honda 900F just right. It looks real nice and I feel lots better when the 9 is covered up. My only issue is that the black color is discoloring pretty quickly. However, it is the relentless cooking of that good ol Texas sun that is taking its toll on the Nelson-Rigg cover. So, better the cover than my bike.
B00EKCZKVI|3|Very cheaply made but it was cheap so what was I thinking.
B000LG9M1Q|4|It was fun to program.  My neighbor read the instructions while we sat in the car.  Its so nice to have a remote again, and I always thought it would be so expensive.
B00K7935CE|5|Exact item, good quality and good adhesion.
B005KKR2B0|3|cant fit on my rmz450
B006MIWA6Q|5|We are very pleased with the tire cover for our new jeep! It is just what we were looking for!
B00168Q1R6|4|Nice sturdy rack - easy to install
B0050VFA8G|5|I bought this a Christmas gift for my son. I've been using one of these for emergency power for over three years now whenever the power goes out. It has a 500 watt capacity but it also has a surge limit of 1,000 watts which allows me to run my home furnace blower motor when the power goes down (Note: my furnace blower motor has a 380 watt motor but it has a surge of 850watts when it starts). I paid almost $50.00 for the same unit a few years ago and I was very pleased to see it for only $30.00 when I purchased it this time. I've owned about a dozen power inverters over the years and this has been the best by far! One caveat, be extremely careful to hook it up carefully because if you accidentally reverse the terminals, it will blow the fuse and it doesn't come with a replacement. I learned this the hard way with other similar units in the past. I would definitely buy one of these again.
B00TRSEJLW|5|Easy to install, looks great and protects again dummies, careless people
B00H1I639Q|5|They helped sell the truck I had
B001UMZ07A|5|if you own a black car - this kit is a must
B000NIRZIE|5|I like this jacket. It's cute, tough, strong, stylish, genuine leather and the girls say I have nice feng shui and that I look like a preacher. Namo Amitabha!<br /><br />Yawh! I got this vest fast. After I clicked \\"place order\\" I had it within less than 48hrs. The piece and fit are outstanding. I ordered XLT and it looks fashionably tailored; perfectly, for my baby cakes! Smile...Wink!
B00OM8T3MW|5|Perfect, it works for a month already, and feels like new.
B00B9EY8K4|5|works great
B0049QQV2M|3|I received the part today for my 1995 Buick Roadmaster. It definitely does not have the look and feel of the original. It looks very cheap. The metal holding the float is very thin. I dropped the tank and installed the fuel pump assembly today. I will put the tank back tomorrow and see how it works. The price was good, but it looks and feels cheap.
B00AC712SA|5|Works well with my Heritage Softail.  Sturdy and solid.  Perfect for lifting my bike off the floor for winter storage.
B00853KY8C|5|Great love it..looks well on my Truck.....,,,.,..............
B000R2J2J6|5|Bought a used Acura TL with only one key.  It was about 40% less expensive on line.  Had a local shop program it and over all saved over $100 doing it this way versus dealership.
B004UPZXQM|2|Having some experience with spray detailers, I had an idea what to expect. Basically some gloss, a slick surface, and short-term protection. There is some controversy regarding whether water beading is a sign of good protection, but I won't get into that. What water beading (or sheeting) does accomplish is it at least shows the presence of product.<br /><br />There's another way to show presence of a car wax/sealant that a car detailer showed me years ago, and that's the steam test. It doesn't measure protection, per se; it just shows the presence of a product so you can see how uniformly it covers an area, how easily it comes off, etc. Basically you coat some product onto a bathroom mirror and allow steam to build up in the room. Areas of the mirror coated in wax/sealant will have a uniform layer of steam that is different from untreated areas. It won't repel steam, the barrier causes tiny water droplets to build up uniformly, (appearing as if there is 'more' steam there). You can try it yourself and see what I mean.<br /><br />I bring this up because after noticing that the V7 just didn't seem to do as much as other similar sprays (the gloss was fair but not very good, and I didn't notice the extra water beading that other spray detailers provided at least short term), I wanted to see what it was leaving behind. I did the test, using the V7, along side a couple other spray detailers.<br /><br />The results surprised me. The areas treated with V7 left very little behind, with some streaks of presence. I also applied some Meguiars UQW and Turtle Wax Ice, both of which showed solid coverage (and the TW had remarkable durability to removal, incidentally).  When I applied two more coats of V7 over its area, it began to show more signs of coverage, confirming my results: This appears to be an extremely watered-down detailer, high in alcohol so that it \\"flashes\\" (evaporates) quickly. It came completely off with a bit of soapy water, whereas the other products actually were rather stubborn to remove.<br /><br />I give it two stars because as a quick detailer, it's fine. It will clean off fine dust and fingerprints, and leave a wee bit of shine. In the gallon size the value is fair, but $18 or so per bottle is silly, seeing as how it has just about zero sealant properties and even the shine it leaves is inferior to some $8 spray waxes.<br /><br />I've heard that CG is hit and miss with their products, but V7 is generally regarded as one of the hits. In my experience, it is not. Maybe they make some good stuff, but this isn't it. I don't want to judge the company by one product, so I'll give another one of their products a try, probably.  I gotta say, they do a really good job with graphic design on their packaging; especially the \\"vintage\\" line. I digress.
B000BNH0I6|4|You get what you pay for.<br /><br />Prepare to scrounge around for enough bolts and whatnot to mount these to your particular vehicle, but having said that... they sound tremendously better than the &#34;Meek-meep!&#34; that the Tacoma came with.  Good quality for the price.
B00BQHABMS|5|works as expected
B002R0QSYS|5|Great replacement lights for 1988 Samurai.
B000FW2MWW|5|great product and service
B007TG7ILC|1|The wiper clears the windshield well but when it gets to the end of the stroke and changes direction it emits a loud sound.  It's very annoying.  I checked the wiper and didn't see anything wrong with it.  I will be replacing it very soon.
B00HZBL8OO|4|Works but a little Tedious.
B003FOTBKI|4|cute and easy to use
B00557LMYG|5|Exactly what I needed. Fixed the problem.
B000CMFE52|3|I love the way they look, but GT needs to find a way to secure them better, Perhaps the same velcro they use on tail light covers. The seller did great! Great price and fast shipping!  The product gets one star and the seller gets 5 stars, overall avg 3
B001RZ65MO|5|The Best!!!!!!!
B000RI9GF0|5|I use this for de burring sheet metal parts and it works really good I  recommend highly a plus !
B0019SKITA|3|very good if you want to alert drivers from far where your car is stationed.<br />very good magnetic base which maybe good for the car body to stick gently.
B00905VB9K|5|These are a good set of clutches installed myself...it was very simple...had to adjust a few times but once they were set right I haven't had any issues
B000B61TPS|5|Have been using this all summer.  Would get the one with the handle if I were to do it over.  Easy to fill.  Keep it connected to the drain fro the water from our camper.  We are very close to the dump station but the handle would make it easier to haul over the ground.
B008G2XODY|5|Great product. Better than ones on EBay!
B001W9CP0Q|5|These smart cables are the way to go. As an installer at circuit city (RIP) We love these things. Makes wiring your radio idiot proof. Plug and go. Just take a few extra seconds and push this and the vehicle specific harness together semi gently to avoid pushing the pins out of place, and they will be good for a long long time.<br /><br />These smart harnesses are the same price or sometimes even cheaper than regular harness that require soldering (Don't butt connectors or crimp caps, just don't do it right the first time.) Which really makes it a no brainer.
B00B13O94I|1|Not happy with it at all poorly made and bulky
B009P4531S|2|Nice quality for easy cleaning, but the rear mats appear to be more than twice as large as will fit the actual space. Mysterious.
B004M0ZWPM|5|Great
B004SRRP2W|5|forgot to add works excellent on a 2006 Ford Taurus 3.0 and like I said easy change out max of 30 mins if you don't have a serpentine wrench Advance Auto will let you use one free
B000CM2VQM|5|fit perfect and was an easy install
B001O0544W|5|My alternator died on my 05 Honda and would not restart.  I installed this new one and guess what.....it fired right up!!  HA! Does what it should as it should.  Includes alternator pulley thats pre-installed so you do not need to swap your old one over!!
B001UJB9AU|4|Used this item head-to-head with the microfiber type and found lambswool to hold more soap and suds up better.<br />The only thing is that after rinsing, this mitt needs to be inverted to completely dry out the backing before storing.<br />Otherwise this is the mitt to own.<br /><br />2016: After 2 seasons of car washing, this has started to fail. The stitching at the thumb has come undone. I was very careful to completely dry after use, before storage. Time for another...
B000E81VN8|5|Yeah great box folds away when not needed holds heaps as well very happy
B009TU9S9G|4|Almost a perfect fit
B00EF403J0|5|good value shipped quicker that promised - happy customer
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Much cheaper than any auto parts store or big retailer. The type is labeled on top. Box is huge compared to how small the fuses are but i'm not going to complain. Great to ahve on hand and can break this down and put spares in a few cars.
B000FQ7RA0|5|I bought this as a direct replacement. It came in faster than expected and it fits my 1989 yj flawlessly. if you have to buy one then this is the one you want.
B003UG7SK6|2|NOT SURE HOW THIS ITEM WAS REALLY TO BE USED
B003YCZ1F0|4|I bought this clamp kit for my adventure helmet rather than using the one with the boom mic. Works great!
B0012WHBSO|4|My GF was looking for an easy solution that didnt way a lot for her car that for some odd reason leaks air slowly.  In the end she needs to get it checked out but she really does not want to spend money on that at the moment and she is stuburn.  So I decided to get this for her and it seems to do the trick.  Instead of me following her to the gas station every time she comes over I now can make sure her tires are fine before she leaves back to her place.  Easy for me and she is happy her tires have air.
B00F7S7882|4|I like the tag cover but the cover for the screw don't fit. They don't sent you the screw to fit.
B000OUUGGO|4|I guess if you want to compare it with comparable Snap on or MAC tools it will fall a little short.  Since I am a hobbyist and a mechanic of economic necessity it will work just fine for me.  Professionals might want to pay the 3 to 5 times more for the perfect feel, It will work fine for us who do not make our lively hoods from the tools and who are therefore less choosy.
B00PV37ZEA|5|I was given an opportunity to write a review for the MAS 27 auto trash bag and organizer purchased at a deep discount. Do you spend a lot of time in your car?  Do you drive car pool for your kids and other kids?  Do you accumulate a lot of trash in your car?  Do you have fast food cups and wrappers, banana peels, Starbucks cups, napkins, straw wrappers, drive-thru receipts, coloring pages, newspapers, unfinished food, Kleenex, and even diapers and baby wipes covering your floor? Or are there wrappers stuffed in the arm rest on the passenger doors? Are you driving around in a TRASHED car?<br /><br />Have you tried using a trash receptacle in your car and found that someone just trips over the trash and tumbles it all over the floor?  Or you make that fast left turn and the trash bag scatters trash all over the floor? What to do?<br /><br />I found a solution with the MAS 27 auto trash bag.  The MAS 27 trash bag fits neatly over the back of a headrest and keeps the trash bag off the floor OR the MAS 27 bag can stand open on the car floor for your convenience.  You could even place one of those stick-to-anything Command hooks on the front panel or back panel or side panels and the trash bag will easily hang off the floor.  It looks cleaner and your car stays cleaner.<br /><br />The MAS trash bag and organizer is large and strong and waterproof (no spills or leaks).  The waterproof liner wipes off easily or you can just add a plastic grocery bag to the MAS 27 bag.  Then just grab the plastic bag liner and toss in the garbage. MAS 27 trash and organizer bag is made of canvas material and has a large metal frame. There are adjustable webbing straps for easy installing.  Two mesh side pockets are on the MAS bag to hold bottles or tissues or extra plastic grocery bags for the liner.  There is a Velcro closing so you can “contain” the trash until you empty the bag. Two pieces of Velcro are on the bottom so it can be placed on the floor of the car and won’t tip over as you swing around those curves!<br /><br />AND this MAS 27 bag can also be used as an ORGANIZER BAG to hold things you need for a day in the car with the kids.  Juice boxes, fruit, granola bars, sunscreen and more will fit nicely in the bag for a quick trip with the kids to the park or zoo or a day at the beach.<br /><br />Add a scented fabric softener sheet to the MAS trash bag and organizer to keep your car smelling sweet! Easy way to keep your car cleaner!!you swing around those curves!<br /><br />AND this MAS 27 bag can also be used as an ORGANIZER BAG to hold things you need for a day in the car with the kids.

B00BI2APMW|5|Works as stated and for the price it is hard to beat
B0041CG336|4|It perfectly fits a Honda Shadow Spirit saddle. Great improved comfort particularly with very high temperature.
B007A8OJX4|5|Highly recommend it, already put 2,000 miles on these and no need to adjust yet.
B002ROJFSK|1|two pairs so far, both start flickering like crazy and not lighting up completely. Customer service is useless because they only have a 30 day warranty. Bought a different pair of light bulbs from same company, had to swap those out too because one bulb stopped lighting up. Utterly terrible
B002UXBELY|5|I bought this product for a Raxiom Smoked Projector Headlights - Dual CCFL Halo (99-04 All), for a 2004 Mustang. They were easy to install and have less blue then the projector headlights that was equipped. You can really see the difference, is it 90% on a Mustang? No, but I tend to think this is because the car is lower to the ground. With this product and some added fog lights to a 2004 Ford Mustang, you can't go wrong. The product shipped fast and was packaged nicely. For the price, you won't get 2 pair for the same amount.
B00068XCQU|5|After killing two car batteries in two winters, car sits dormant, I purchased the battery tender and the car started right up when I returned in the spring. Paid for itself in one winter.

B00JVHLS3G|1|Cheesy sticker. :-(
B005I5TW2E|5|this is kind of like the zenex shine but not as good it works ok but its greasy and runs the zenex shine does not and dries flat its also more expensive, works well besides that though.
B00IZ2ZVOK|5|Excellent for camry 2002 LE 2.4
B000CPZT1S|4|these appear to be good quality mats that mold well to the inside of my car. the thickness is about right and they look durable. I do not detect any rubber smell as was mentioned by other reviews.
B001D6OZCE|5|These seat covers are the best I have gotten yet.  Great quality, very durable and dress the interior up nicely.  Highly recommend this seller.
B002E387MO|5|My aunt was having trouble with her turn signs on her 2002 Impala.And by the way she is 91 and still driving. After reviewing the problem replaced the switch its been 3 weeks and still working. Also by the way Dorman has a great video on how to change it.
B000W0RQAA|3|Would work great if it was long enough.  A class five hitch needs the T-6 not this one to fit.
B004ETGQKG|5|I had read all the reviews so I was perfectly prepared, and pleased, with what I received.  It met expectations.
B000J3ZSI2|1|Purchase this custom sun shield because it said it would fit our car and it does not. Had to return.
B002PWJRWS|5|This has been a godsend for helping my aged mother-in-law step up into the front seat of our Chevy Tahoe. The non-slip grids are very good as well. you can step with confidence you won't slip at all.
B0011Z7PXS|2|This cover is advertised to fit cars up to 157\\" long. I bought it for my 1995 Miata, which is 155\\" long bumper to bumper. It is too small to hook over the front and rear bumpers, so it is constantly blowing off. It is plenty wide, but too short. Since a Miata is about the smallest body style out there, I have to question the sizing system.
B001FCMD7U|5|Solid bars and they look great, I recommend you thread the plastic washers first then install them. Other then that easy install
B007GEN67C|5|I am so proud of my daddy as a Vietnam Veteran and I used these to create a very special iPad case for him!!
B0002KKPXK|5|Does exactly what it says.  It isn't clear from the picture, but it has everything you need except for a tap handle.
B001737OQW|5|Pumps up the tire pressure quickly.  Back cover easy to loose when removed.
B003LSJJJ6|5|I love these goggles, keeps wind and dust out of my eyes and I love the transitional lens, you can't beat the price
B00C5TEBIG|5|Great Product
B0009H51U8|3|Fram is an easy go to filter that I've used on and off for many years... But, like others have said, the silicon around the filter is too thick and some model vehicles can't completely close the housing around the filter element as securely as with other filters. Not the sellers downfall via Amazon.
B001DRG57Q|4|Fit and worked in my 1994 Buick Regal but was not the solution to my flashing low coolant light.
B00D9C2CDO|4|Bought this specifically for my family's vacation trip to Florida.  I did read up on the reviews for this, it is WEATHER RESISTANT not WATERPROOF.  And for the folks that run the straps into the interior of their car via the windows and then leave a 1 or 2 star review because the inside of their cars got wet do to the wicking process it creates.  You are not intelligent and don't blame the product because of stupidity on your part.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I actually sprayed the entire bag down with Rustolium NeverWet.  It used the entire set to do this.  NeverWet doesn't stick to the weather resistant material very well, but it did add a layer of extra protection. We used trash bags on the way to Florida to cover all the clothes in the bag. I ensured the zippers on the bag faced the back of the vehicle, not facing into the wind & made sure the zipper cover flaps were secured down via the velcro.<br /><br />  I had a large piece of cloth in between the bag and the top of my QX56,  So when we had stopped to eat on the way home, there came a HUGE and fast storm.  It DUMPED rain in buckets down.  When the rain let up, we hit the road and experienced a bit more rain on the way but soon got out of the storm.  10 hrs later at home I unpacked the bag and the clothing that was on the bottom of the bag was a bit damp but not soaked.  The clothing everywhere else was very much dry.  I assume that the NeverWet was rubbed off and the cloth held enough moisture to allow it to seep thru the water resistant material over time.  On the way down we had used garbage bags just in case but forgot to pack extra for the trip home, otherwise it all would have been completely dry.<br /><br />  So to sum it all up, Spray it down with NeverWet, put your items in leaf/contractor/heavy mil trash bags or tarp, make sure the zippers are pointed to the back of the car and the flaps are pulled down over them and your items should be very much dry the whole time.<br /><br />  I didn't notice a huge gas mileage decrease, I think we avg. 15 mpgs (it's a V8) we normally get 16ish on the freeway.  It did free up a lot of space inside the cabin of the QX56.<br /><br />  I used 3 to 4 tie down straps in conjunction with the built in straps, as I just didn't really trust the built in ones.  I did get a little slack in all of the straps once they got wet but that of course is expected in that situation.<br /><br />  It's cheaper than a roof top carrier box, but no where near as cool or water proof, but worth the $50 or so it costs.
B000GRNSDS|1|The propellant in my 10.9 oz can ran out before the lubricant did. Also, my spray extension tube fell out of the nozzle all the time, apparently a common complaint. I brought this to the attention of www.jigaloo.com but it was dismissed as a child safety issue.
B00O25WTLM|5|Thank you
B00B8SYNUQ|1|Sure, it's cute. Yea, nerd's rule. And I swelled with pride in using this the very first time...until I attempted to remove it from my windshield and it ripped.<br /><br />It's cheap, very cheap. Not worth the price.
B0016I3RNM|5|Difficult to put in with bed rails already installed in a 2013 Tundra. Must cut to fit. I would recommend it though. Very pleased with it!
B003UZ7RNU|4|This is a very good product from Kolpin... sturdy and easy to assemble alone, but does not work well with the Kolpin Sport roof... only because if it rains, the front of the roof does not overlap the windshield enough, so water still comes in the cab. But still a great product!!!
B00803BD8W|5|make my car awsome even its only a wheel cover i like this product easy to install i recommend it
B00KQX5D3K|5|Product was delivered on time, easy to install and got my GE Simon XT security monitoring system fixed,
B002DHMF0G|2|go to tripageLED.com  a much better product.  This works just as it should though. you will have holes on the side of the brake light mount from no turn signals.
B004F04Q4M|1|broke when trying to take one of the key rings out. i only needed 2 of them so when i took one of them, everything came out. the ball pins fell out as well as the spring. waited 3 weeks for a piece of junk.
B004BZE45C|5|I have a 2014 Mustang 3.7 base model, 6 speed manual. I was looking for a mellow, rumble kind of tone. This was the perfect choice. Quiet at idle, yet will roar as the rpm's rise. The sound is not raspy or high pitch. Don't try to imitate a 5.0, just get the best sound available on the market.(if you want deep tones). More agressive mufflers are available if thats what you want.<br />This motor is respectably powerfull. I noticed an improved throttle response and a few more horses. I highly recomend this kit.
B000OCINIK|1|I was excited to have this for my new car. However, the product broke during the first use. Very poorly made. I recommend finding another option.
B003EMEX6I|5|I have a Jeep Wrangler 2002 Apex. These seat covers are awesome. They were easy to install and fit like a glove. I would recommend them to all Jeep TJ owners
B00A7WIWEW|5|I have both right and left sides of these and they look and work great.
B00SCXCQV8|5|Lights are very bright and seem well made
B007RZ0UUG|5|Looks as pictured and looks awesome under the hood(or should I say trunk lol) good quality and not to much so it still has a 'clean' look to it. Good buy.
B000CMKG6O|5|Works great on my 1998 BMW R1100R to run a four-wire trailer (note: the bike is not CAN-BUS.)
B000CQROUG|5|Just what I needed. Worked great and fast delivery.
B007BXCKAC|2|This is a high quality filter. I know because the first one I purchased I cut up and inspected. However, over $5 for shipping is highway robbery. This filter weighs less than 4 ounces in the box, and the package measures 13/4x13/4x21/2 inches.It's unfortunate I don't need 50 of them :P
B000CFQ34A|4|Installation is a pain, until you figure out the best way to do it..<br /><br />The easy method, that you figure out after having done it a couple times:<br /><br />1) Chock the front wheels and then raise the rear of the car off the ground. Place car on axle stands.<br />2) Fold the airbag into a hotdog bun shape (fold the circular ends in, and then fold the bags in half like a bun), and then use cable ties to keep the bag in the hotdog bun shape (just using the cap as suggested is not sufficient).<br />3) Run the hose into the top of the spring.<br />4) Slip the hose through the piece that goes on top of the bag and then out between the coils where you plan on installing the bag.<br />5) Attach the hose and clamp to the bag.<br />6) Push the top piece, hose, and bag into the spring between coils.<br />7) Remove the cable ties.<br />8) Inflate the bags to 30 PSI. Check for leaks.<br />9) Lower the car.<br />10) Adjust the air pressure.<br /><br />Otherwise getting the hose on the bag is a pain.
B00AOIM2CC|1|The connection gets started, but then disconnects less than a minute later.<br />Technical support does not seem to know the difference between a wifi password and a bluetooth password.
B000CO9FHS|5|ok
B003KKO4H2|4|Fits and does the job.
B00BSGBARW|4|I installed these in my reading lights in my old 84 Winnebago.  They work, but the base length is just a tad too long.  Really had to work to get them in there.  However, once in, they are great.  Lots of light, no heat and a fraction of the energy consumption.
B00C1BT9BW|4|Nice little selection of tools to help tighten down most things that the road shakes loose. especially for the price,
B004BSNNY2|5|threw it in the toolbox . . . don't need it , but just in case . . .
B0018YD32Y|2|Two RS999286's arrived, both do not fit. The bolt sleeve at the end of each strut where the bolt slides through was too wide. They would not fit into the shock mounts. The bolt sleeves had to be ground down. For $100 each, this was BS.<br /><br />YOU NEED ALL FOUR RANCHO SHOCKS. If you just get fronts or rears, you wont notice a big difference. At setting 1, the vehicle is bouncy. At 10, the vehicle is tight. Either setting, the \\"shock\\" from hitting road bumps is gone. Better than stock? Yes. Worth the price? Not convinced. I would not buy rancho again due to the shocks not fitting.<br /><br />RS999910 - I had trouble with the fronts as well, same issue being the ends were too wide. It took beating them in with a block of wood and a rubber hammer. Rancho never responded when I confronted them about this.<br /><br />04 F150 FX4.
B00EE6VNA2|5|These are amazing headlights! It's a must have for all eclipse owners. One of the light bulbs went out but that's because I don't have a cap installed for my stereo.
B00IKZTRLA|5|This is one of the BEST THINGS EVER!!!! Got this before I got my new vehicle so I got to put it on before anyone saw it. Looks like it came that way!! Could not look any better1 This is so AWESOME!!!! I LOVE it!!!!
B000NHLG6W|5|Needed a 90 degree elbow to accommodate a gauge on my RV propane tank.  Works just fine.  Don't need the tap for another propane line.
B00MZWX6H0|4|The pins don't lock in to or line up in the housings as well as they might, requiring a little bit of finicking to make the connection. That said, the kit was dirt cheap. It was complete. It did, in fact, work. So, yeah, I'll buy it again - but it'd be nice if they improved the fit a little.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I love this. I got used to these gap fillers so quickly I've almost forgotten about the absolutely infuriating problem that their arrival solved!
B00OUDSTEW|5|The mirrors work great. They fit and the light hook up for the mirrors was easy.
B002L9XYYW|3|I just did the the control arm and sway bar bushings in front because I replaced some on the rear of the car already with stock. The front flexes more anyway. My impression is that steering and handling is improved a little but also there is more road noise because these are stiffer than stock. One thing to be aware of is that the lower control arm bushings at the back tend to become welded to the cam bolt and you have to cut them out which is a major pain. You'll need a hydraulic press and also the pipe fixture mentioned in the installation to drive the old bushing out into. I got one cut at Alro Steel Co. I also used a tall angle iron fixture that I had used to rebuild a transmission is to prop up the lower control arm in order to get the center alignment under the press head to push out the old bushing. Here's a tip from experience. Use a chisel as mentioned in the procedure to knock the old bushings flange up and out of the way for the pipe fixture to fit over. The more you can drive it to the center, the better the chance that you will press out the entire bushing including the outer shell casing. Otherwise, you'll be using a hacksaw to cut a groove get the bushing outer shell from the lower control arm.  Where the lower control arm welded seam is in the way of using a chisel just drive it on either side and it will lift up were welded edge is. Once it starts to lift, use the edge of the chisel to drive the bushing flange toward the center all the way around like a flower. Spray some BP Blaster between the control arm and old bushing shell.  When you use a socket to push it out the bushings, the shell will come with it. Expect to hear a few bangs when breaks loose on the press. Alignment must be perpendicular and centered for safety sake.  The upper bushings are much easier.  A tip here would be to use a knife to cut that rubber lip that hangs over off first.  Otherwise, it will grip the the socket when you press the bushing out.
B00MT0NC1S|4|I love minions!  This sticker, however, is trying my patience.  I started to put it on my car, but it took too long to remove the backing.  The little details of the figures did not want to stay on the sticker, even though I followed the directions and rubbed vigorously .  I will try again when I have more time.  The decal seems to be good quality.  It arrived in good shape and in the time expected.
B000V8VZ78|5|Great Product!!!
B003K2S1HY|4|I've bought a few of these for my dedicated HPDE Miata.  Pretty standard part.  I carefully disassemble each one and replace the factory grease with Royal Purple synthetic grease.  Does that help?  Who knows, but it makes me feel better.  Just go easy on the grease; note how much is applied at the factory and try to duplicate the amount.  Too much grease will leak past the seal and make a mess.
B00IKIHZ16|5|Bolted right up. Good power
B000GTYGSC|5|Great price
B003UM9GDM|3|It will not work on  my Goldwing. The jack has plenty of lifting power .The problem is that with the center stand on the bike being where it is you can not get the jack positioned so it will raise the bike evenly. I am going to try making some brackets so I can use it on the goldwing. As others have stated the release pedal is SUPER sensitive.
B0045XRK06|5|With this light I don't have to cut on main lights if I am up late working on my laptop.
B00I04QDPY|5|Works great and really bright
B001B5GA0C|5|I bought this as a replacement clutch for my 2002 Acura RSX Type-S.  I was able to swap out the clutch in my garage, taking out the axles was a bit of a challenge though.  I did not need to replace the flywheel as it was in good shape, not warped or burnt.  Be sure to align and torque everything properly during re-assembly.<br /><br />Have driven 5,000+ on the clutch so far, it feels great, just like original equipment.  Was a bit grabby the first couple hundred miles, but broke in nicely.<br /><br />Saved $800 by doing it myself.
B00DPIE1EK|5|Amazing these didn't come with a new car, but cheaper to buy online than at the dealer.
B002G29KLK|5|good sturdy quality. Can be used to keep bathtub clean also or wash large pots
B004KRKHUM|5|Does not fit 2014 KIA. Price was right, looks great, we adjusted it to fit, delivery was quick :)
B00KHX6WMU|5|I Still Have no used it. I bought it for precaution
B002E2UK8O|5|I purchased a set of these Optilux bulbs in H11 fitment for my previous car, a Mazda3, and they lasted until I sold the car last month, almost three years later.  They were used mostly during inclement weather.  They're bright bulbs with a yellow tint that cannot be missed, even when they are off.<br /><br />I just installed a set in my new HB4/9006 set in my WRX, and these are just as bright and yellow as the old H11s were.  Looking forward to many years of yellow swag.<br /><br />Remember, as with all auto bulbs, DO NOT touch the glass, or you will dramatically shorten the life of the bulb.  It's possible to install the bulbs while touching only the base, and that is in fact what professionals do!
B004QEF970|5|Perfect fit; great price
B000182E28|5|hello I wat to purchase this product but i don't know of which color is the light that it emit. is it white? or yellow[[ASIN:B001CU1B96 PIAA 5296 520 Clear ATP Black Lamp Kit]]?
B004JPNL5I|3|The lower cable retainer circlip would not fit as delivered and required filing of the brake boss. It was 1/16&#34; too short. Otherwise it was fine. Volar never responded to my querries.
B000NCOKV0|5|AAA+
B009HQ7DVW|5|This replacement baggage door replacement latch was a perfect fit.  Drilled out the rivets on the old latch that was broken and then I re-riveted this one in place.  No adjustments needed and it works like the one that it replaced.  Will look to buy more should I have any more latches break.  Good value for the cost.
B000BS1Y3I|5|In 2004 on my 1997 Ram I paid $100+ to have the same quality product installed! Only took 5-10 min to put each one on.
B007Z4XQSW|5|Changed the look of my truck took less then 15 minutes to install couldn't be more satisfied!!!
B0036FFT4S|5|I just installed the intake. It took about 3 hours. I have a 93' YJ and the hardest part was installing the heat shield because it requires you to move the power steering reservoir by install a longer hose (which was provided and in the directions). My stock hose was stubborn and I spent most of my time getting that thing off.<br /><br />The rest of the install was a breeze.<br /><br />I took my jeep out and immediately saw a difference in power. It sounds good, feels good, and I'm hoping I can save a few dollars at the gas pump too.
B0002MB92Y|1|Only worked for 2 hours waste of money will never buy an item from this website is a waste of time and money
B0073MF7L0|4|it was a little wider than the factory radiator by about 3 inches, and the inlet and outlet nipples were smaller than the factory hoses, but i made it work, truck runs alot cooler, and it looks awesome under the hood. im very satisfied with this product for the moeny spent on it, as it is cheeper than a factory single row radiator.
B004HK2DK4|5|I had to replace my hubcaps on my 2009 Toyota Matrix because one went missing.  These fit perfectly and I feel so smart because I saved a lot of money over factory replacement parts.  There is no little Toyota logo in the middle however that does not make any difference to me. I recommend this product. To me they look the same.
B00KH2X8W8|5|This was so easy to re program.... I can't believe the local ford dealership wanted to charged $80 for this and to re program it. I was finished in less then 2 minutes. It was like a gream and it's been super helpful during our rainy season.
B003PM8ER6|5|This was fanstic I love it. It was exactly what I was looking for. Wished for decsles or steering wheel cover but im happy
B000RBILHQ|5|Love it, very comfortable.
B000VU91SG|5|Fit perfectly in my 2012 F150.
B001L9XQYG|5|I recived my decal it came to me very fast. This is a great seller never any problems.   Thank you   charlotte, Glade spring,va
B00L5TDGMY|5|good quality and easy to instal.
B005JCY7RG|5|Awesome
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Been using every day for a couple months now. Still in perfect shape and folds easily. Just wanted to keep the sun off my brand new dash and it does the job well.
B0051CAE1C|4|It has worked flawlessly in connecting to my SCION XB 2008 to my Nexus 7 tablet with the Torque App. I mainly bought this item to read and erase DTCs from some of the cars I was working on. It also gave other common data readings like RPMs, speed and coolant temps. It however doesn't read more sensitive electrical sensors like ignition systems nor can you can control or shut off spark plugs.<br /><br />I do wish the LED indicator lights were brighter and facing outward toward the vehicle it makes it hard to tell if I plugged it in properly sometimes and to read the status of the connector.
B001CEG9BC|3|I gave it 3*s just to log in and say &#34;This does not fit my 2005 Focus as it said it does in the compatibility widget at the top of the screen&#34;
B001DRP9G4|5|Great filter and been using it for my mercddes GL for many years
B00381IQ0Y|5|Came well packaged and is of excellent quality.  I feel as if it will last the life of the car.  Afe has created a filter with more surface area and still flows better than the paper ones.  Even includes instructions on different ways to clean your filter, as well as a couple of stickers to stick on your cover to ensure the mechanics know its a washable filter.  Also, my intake temp has come down a couple of degrees and nearly matches outside ambient air temp.  Now all I need is the airraid intake tube!
B005ZFB5IQ|4|i have the basic f150 rollup windows only came with a radio, no cd. cloth seats vinyl floor. and it fits with a slight gap. i don't trust the sticky pads that came with it but it is holding for now.
B0055DP5AW|5|match my grizzly well looked allmost factory !! wish they had come with instructions! though lol nice product look pretty beefy
B000CITK8S|5|Awesome.
B00FJJ04DU|5|A Christmas gift for my car enthusiast husband, very well received.  He uses it often and loves how easy it is to switch between creeper and stool.
B000IUPKWK|3|Well the black plastic part and white plastic part in the black plastic part weren't the right ones for my 2003 Dodge Dakota.  I managed to use the old ones and it works and fit fine other than that. It did make the installation quite a bit longer.
B00GX4Y9AY|5|I had to jump start my car 4 times in one day due to a bad relay draining my battery before I could find it. This jump started my car 3 times in a row without a recharge. Of course I drive a 4cy focus. Overall it is still a better value than AAA or having to wait for someone to come along and help. Edit: Had it for a couple of months now. Had to jump-start my car at least 20+ times due to an minor electrical drain my car. After jump-starting my car 4 times without a recharge, I only saw 1 of 5 battery bars drop. Of course this is with a battery that was not 100% dead. Just a little under what I need to turn it over. The flap that covers that battery cable connector on the main unit is coming off. I didn't expect that with a silicon type cover.  Over all the unit has performed well. I still have not used it as a battery bank for my phone or laptop, so I can't speak to that.
B002UUYOPU|5|best windshield ever
B00AXA98XC|5|I bought this item, the seller delivered it before the promised date, it seems to be of good quality, it's been on my boat for a month now and hasn't shown any fading signs. great striker and looks sharp.
B000BZAAY0|5|Great product that one must buy if needed.
B001AXGT7O|1|maybe good for a small motor
B00PZYCT7S|1|what a waste of money! I love when things arrived damaged and I can't use them! It's bent and some of the backing is falling off and they aren't even sticky!
B00NH0K0SC|1|I did get that item
B001GJ9K8C|5|I've used a few of the popular car wash soaps on amazon and this one seems to be the best. I received this soap in a car wash bundle kit from my girlfriend. I really didnt think it was going to be anything special. I was previously using Chemical Guys Maxi Suds II with a FoamMaster sprayer and wasn't too happy with the results. I was like well i'll give this a shot. Man was I impressed. This made my car shine beautifully. It produces a nice amount of suds and lathers nicely when washing. For the price, you cant go wrong.
B00JGP8I1S|1|this product did not work.  sorry;
B000BZXM0O|4|Was glad to be able to buy these parts for my 14 year old Infiniti Q45t. the original brake pad clips were worn out and would not hold the pads tightly in place. these worked great.

B0015S90KW|4|SAME as my (Raybestos 980470R Professional Grade Disc Brake Rotor)<br /><br />I decided to try ordering a Raybestos rotors from Amazon and do not regret it at all. I installed them in less then 2 hours with (Raybestos ATD1222C Advanced Technology Ceramic Disc Brake Pad Set) on a 2007 Camry V6. So far the stopping power is great, the feel from the pedal and steering vs the older brakes from AutoZon* (rotor and pads when they were new) are far superior. Not a sound from them at all.  Only FOUR stars because i have never used Raybestos brakes yet and have to see how long they last.
B0007Z0I0K|5|Perfect fit for 2007 Pathfinder.<br />There was a problem with the tracking of this order.  I contacted the seller about this and the problem was quickly rectified.<br />NAFTA made.  Good buy.
B0007UQ2N2|4|the hose seem to be just what I wanted. So far I have not had any problems with kinking or leaking so I consider this a good product. Apex7612 Never kink boat and camper 2000, 1/2 inch x 50 ft.
B001DRHMRI|5|Same filter that BMW uses in the 2008 335i. Cheaper than the dealer and includes the drain screw crush washer. Don't know what else you could ask for.
B00E4CQH9S|4|Decent protection. Fit my face just fine. I'd like em to be darker.
B0002Z9QO4|4|We used this item in a recent driving vacation to Colorado from Texas.  Loading our luggage in this roof top bag freed up needed space in our vehicle.  It is easy to attach if your vehicle is equipped with a roof rack with side bars that the straps can be pulled under and around.  It is amazingly large.  We could fit one oversized piece of luggage and two average pieces of luggage in it, as well as some small incidental things.  Taking the advice of other reviewers, I put the luggage in plastic trash bags and then put them in the roof top bag.  It is water resistant, but not waterproof, so you must keep this in mind.  We drove through a downpour in NM and did have some leakage.  Luckily, the items that did get slightly wet were not damaged.  Occasionally we heard some noise but nothing that was louder than the typical road noise. We are very pleased with this item and highly recommend.
B001TCXOTW|5|I use these at my job as a motorcycle mechanic and they have never failed to deliver.  Much easier than squeezing test leads into fuse sockets, and very well made.  You can always buy alligator clip test leads for your multimeter and just clamp onto the ends of these.
B00HX1ZY7I|5|Great!
B000C01T1W|5|I purchased these rotors (front & rear) for my 2003 Forester. These Centric rotors look and feel much nicer than the rusted out OEMs I had, and combined with new pads provide a much firmer, smoother brake pedal. Packaging was decent, but the box could have been a little sturdier considering the heft of these rotors. I've only had them on for ~900 miles, but I'm definitely happy with them. I would recommend to any other Subaru owner.
B000LY7JZE|1|Didnt mount properly to the truck. plus the item had several dings in the unit bar. The bar was too loose in the box.
B007KPVGCY|5|5 minute install, quality construction, and looks great on bike.  Workmanship and finish are equal to OEM parts.  I was cautious after some other aftermarket item purchases but not with this rack.
B0078U9ZME|1|it is written it is suitable for h2 hummer but it is not suitable
B00651CLCS|5|This thing is solid, somewhat flexible and cooler looking than the hideous metal swirly antenna my 2013 Rubi came with. No problems with AM/FM reception whatsoever for me.
B001E2J3QK|5|The speakers are a great upgrade from the stock speakers in my 2001 Ultra Glide. The sound is much clearer and quite a bit louder.<br />One of the best upgrades I done on my bike.
B002QVU4RK|4|its the best air filters in the world , but this item is mush expensive than other k&n filters .
B00466BJF4|5|great and cool. i like it
B00MWNZ51C|5|Delightfully efficient blades. Full coverage with no streaks.
B0026PBBGY|5|Inexpensive and does the trick!
B001O25GA2|5|This is a light-weight, easy to use fire extinguisher that is just right for use in the kitchen.  The price can't be beat anywhere in stores.   Wish shipping and handling were free but can't complain because I received it within 3 days of my order.   I would definitely recommend it.
B0025YU860|5|I was considering buying super-expensive sheepskin covers for my new RAV-4, but decided to save my money and get these instead. So glad I did! They are very stylish and cute, and help to brighten up my grey car interior. The fabric is soft and feels durable. The fit is not as good as with custom covers, of course, but it's good enough to get the job done and protect my seat. Plus, it's hard to find covers like these, with no sides, to allow for proper side airbag function. These are a great value for the money (you get 2 for this price!).
B0066KPYTK|3|It's cool but I had to put it Ova the original symbol
B000I4R9VQ|3|intal this accessory in a toyota truck throttle body, I really thought I would get a better performance in the initial acceleration but I got was a good top speed greatly improved my toyota shift is too heavy and wanted to improve their torn.
B001AJMOLS|5|The price was very reasonable and they fit my pickup very well.
B0002Z9QLW|4|Bought this for a recent trip of about 1000 miles round trip and it performed well. Seems sturdy and went together easily. Be sure you have a decent set of metric wrenches and/or adjustable wrenches to get some muscle into the bolt tightening when assembling it (takes less than an hour). As the other reviewer noted, the rails are sold separately but I actually didn't want them. I paired it with a Highland Rola cargo bag also sold by Amazon, which comes with straps that you can rig to this unit. Although not mentioned anywhere, I was happy to see that a few sets of holes were provided for bolting your license plate to it, as well (you'll need to supply your own bolts/nuts for that).
B00P2B5JFS|5|They are NOT TURQUOISE OR ANY SHADE OF BLUE. They are green ! Was upset but they work and feel fine. They look like the color of the picture at night time
B0048FJKAE|4|I received the dashmat and unrolled it for the night. It fit very well and looks great. I needed more velcro strips than came with it to hold it in place. If the company could supply a few more strips it would be a great product.
B004RCRA6O|3|The equalizers were too small, I needed the 7.75&#34; ones, but there is no mention of the size in the description. There is also no easy way to determine the equalizer size on Dexter's website.
B005N6XC7O|5|Very nice
B0013FU0CY|1|The raised stamped area was flat in 3 places, surely to leak! I would go after market before buying this!
B00HNGBOL8|5|Better quality than OEM, no problems with install.
B006STTIUU|5|This works exactly as intended, to apply polish with one side and buff with the other.  It's super soft and hasn't left lint on my black motorcycle.  The stitching around the edges isn't perfect but it's a &#34;rag&#34; and that doesn't affect its performance.
B000X1E59S|4|GOOD OIL.

B000M5ZVRK|5|We are using it in the lab to replace wasteful water usage for chemistry and biology filtration.  Good piece of equipment.
B00407TVGS|5|Good Prices, Great Products And FAST Shipping, Thank You !!!!!!
B009X23B2U|5|Matched and fit perfect in my 2012 Wrangler
B005R5PQES|5|I looked up how to change this regulator on youtube, and ordered it here.  It was really easy to install, and is and exact match for the one removed (minus the broken parts).  It fit like new, and the window is back in working order.  My wife is happy.
B000COP73E|5|Installed quickly and no problem with 17&#34; spare tire clearance (its close though)  Sound is great with no droning and not overly load inside with normal driving- you can still have normal conversations. Litte quicker throttle response and wakes up on full throttle with a throaty tone. Would like to have more angle to the rear where the tip sticks out, mine is straight out the side with no angle but still looks good. Showing some surface  rust on pipe and muffler welds but tip still shines after almost a year.
B00BQYCJKI|5|The best towels I've ever used to wash cars.
B000EDSSDY|5|works as intended; easy to use; can't complain
B004IL96U2|5|Great look, love it
B00188EHSY|5|Fast shipping,  great pricing!
B000BZDEJS|5|great service came in on time and works perfectly and it was a good price. I would defintely use this company again for future products thanks
B00BKXDYJU|3|This is the &#34;standard performance&#34; (comes in blue pack) bulb.  I wanted the &#34;long life&#34; bulb (comes in red pack) for my Subaru Forester clock back-light.  I guess I have a spare if that blows.  So far it is working fine.
B00LEBLI82|2|The light these give off hurts my brain.  They do not use as much power as an incandescent bulb, but jeez.  Unless you want your camper looking like an alien abduction surgery theater, I would go for a more expensive LED with a warmer tone.
B006LB52G4|5|Fit was fine. Need metal gromet inserts to allow proper torque to be applied to cases when tightening shd screws.
B003WLPWVQ|3|Looks good.  Kids like it, but visor comes off too easy.
B00O83KE74|5|My husband absolutely loved them and they were very simple to install
B000JLMTP4|4|Awesome delivery and packaging. Fit to specs. Truck runs like a champ.
B0052KI59Q|5|fits great and the magnets work great
B008G39Y0U|5|Easy to install and shipped fast. Great product for price. They were from two manufacturers and installed slightly different but look fine and work great.
B002LWL3XI|3|Was extremely shocked to open the box and find that there was rubber \\"flashing\\" all over the manifold gaskets themselves. This flashing can be seen in my \\"customer photo\\" above. Went ahead and installed them, since I really needed the car, so far it seems to be okay.<br /><br />Included 6 each of two sizes of o-rings for fuel injectors, but needed 12. Additionally, my engine does not have locating pins for the end rails, so I used the end rail gaskets without pins (obviously), but they're asymmetrical, and the tiny instruction sheet didn't mention if you're supposed to install the end rails with the long side or short side inside the engine. I installed the long side inside the engine, seems to be fine.<br /><br />Update, two months later: Car has other issues, but none of them are related to this gasket set; it's still holding up fine.
B00280BL9O|5|Does what it does
B0001WW37U|5|Works great.
B000C9JS66|5|ACDelco 213-796 GM Original Equipment Manifold Absolute Pressure Sensor<br />Very nice part from ACDelco and quality made you will not be unhappy with this purchase, works great as the manufacturer intended.<br />I have been using mine for some time now and it's still working GREAT :-)<br />Buy with confidence.<br />RagenRat
B004RCRS9I|5|This worked well on my house siding.  Threads are a bit tight on the Mr. Long Arm pole I was using but it worked and stayed put which is better than some other brushes that tend to unscrew.  I loved the 4 sides.  This worked well when washing the soffits.  It does get a bit heavy when I had the pole fully extended to 23ft so be aware of that.  As far as longevity, I would say it is a third worn out after washing my 1800sq ft house and 700sq ft garage.  I am ordering another to have on hand.
B00DTVT22O|5|i use it a lot, works just the way i need it to.  doesn't shake at all.  don't buy a more expensive one this one is just fine for home use for changing chains/tires or lubing chain
B004F8CF3I|4|Got this for my sister, however they somehow turned my 1 into a 2 on the order form. I'm sure she'll use them, but was not happy it was doubled!
B0007LEG2K|5|Works great, very simple. Highly recommend it if you need one. Did I say it was simple to use, it is.
B003VAV0L4|5|Just righ high for  my dodge ram 2500
B001737OQW|1|it has not been 1 year and it already is not working.  i had one of these before so i purchased another.  the first one i returned and now this one already is not working.  i got good service from my very first one  but not so on these last 2.
B00FUT16D6|5|This sticker is bad ass let everyone know what I think about them when I blew past them in da blaza
B007SKAKPU|5|works great, was able to figure out what was wrong and replace the part myself, saving a lot of money.
B002WTHW26|5|fixed my problem with one application
B00GP8S54Y|5|Great jacket.<br />Even better than on the photo.<br />Great produced and magnificent embroidery.<br />I deeply advise this purchase.<br />I am another going to buy two for my friends.<br />Great fast service.<br />Thank you very much
B001ATBEK0|5|great stuff for cleaning oily greasy things. Works very well as a final wash for engine parts when rebuilding.
B000ET525K|4|Easy to use and cheap
B000IYCSLW|5|Installed these on my truck Feb 2014.  They seem like very high quality bearing units, some of the nicest I've ever seen, and have been trouble-free for 25k miles so far!  I only wish I had done my ball joints at the same time because now those are bad and these have to come back off.  The ABS plug fit perfectly.
B008213AU6|4|Kind of a rinky dink set up. Putting tape on the hood to protect it from the bumpers. Should have designed it with a larger gap between the protector and hood. Looks good though.
B0002SQVX0|5|Works as advertised, took the haze and swirl out after compounding my 98 Explorer. I used an random orbital polisher but Im sure it works fine with rotary as well.
B00B1VCXRA|4|Cute but a little smaller than I had expected.
B00CX39J3G|4|It works, nice and bright.  Its an easy enough task  to install and is a good do it your self project.  What  MB won't tell you, is that the instrument cluster is tied into the computer.  So don't turn the car on and drive with out the instrument cluster installed.  My car up with SRS code.  I can't explain why.....just take it out and then put it back.<br /><br />r
B002S4TPP2|5|Arrived quickly at a great price.
B00BHNH3WC|3|This kit is a bit on the pricey side in regard to other similar &#34;kits&#34; out there. The filling compound and cleaning agent (which is straight nail polish remover) is very tricky to use. Even after about 6 applications, I was still unable to apply the right amount of pressure to flatten out my scratches and just went right to painting in the scratch. I would venture that the average person looking to repair scratches does not need the filling compound. The scratch would need to be VERY deep, and scratching deep into the metal below to make the compound necessary. The code matched my paint perfectly though.<br /><br />For 99% of you out there, I would say get a paint matching your cars code, and the tiniest bush you can buy at a hobby shop (the brush that comes with the kit is too big.....the instructions even say so!). The rest of the things in the kit are not necessary and just a waste of money.
B004HCOE8Q|5|I use this on high end stringed instruments for restoring original shine.
B0034ZRPUG|1|I returned it, it is too bulky!
B0077IIHT4|4|Keeps the car looking cleaner longer, until it rains, it doesn't remove water the spots. Overall great purchase for the money.
B00AUFMI46|5|Fits perfectly in my 2011 Hond Fit. Keeps dirt from getting on your carpets and these easily come off so you can hose them off and clean them. I am so impressed with these Weathertech mats I bought a setf or our 2014 Dodge Caravan.
B000KKM7WE|5|The net on the trampoline will fail long before these anchors will!  So glad I purchased them, now there is no worry about wind turning my trampoline into a sail.  The stakes may not go easily into clay soils, but in my case I just dug a hole and packed them tightly.  They're solid like a rock now.
B0024E71BQ|5|It worked out great exactly what I needed
B00BZR3O46|2|Color matches the LED lights on my vehicle, but useless as fog lights.  Do not have a fog light pattern. Waste of $80.
B002XG44LU|5|Big fan of werewolves, and love having this nice decal on my laptop. Well-made, has been holding up well with over a year's use.
B001RBDRWE|4|It's fine. Good quality, wished it was just a little bit bigger.
B000WAH0ZQ|5|Great value and so far they are not shedding.
B000CPLNH2|5|This was a direct replacement and went right in. Remember to make room for the unit to come out. This will help stabilize you idle.
B000GU3KHO|1|The cover is good finished but not is for my Suzuki DL V-strom 650. Bad buy. The size XL is small for Dl650.
B001C4OBCG|5|I've bee using these filters for over 20 years on my automobiles and motorcycles.  Good for mild increase in performance and very easy to maintain.
B005MZUZR6|5|Love these!  They cheer up my car.
B00JG3OHVK|5|Great stuff. No comparison !
B001BNFV0Y|3|Not as thick or as big as we had hoped - does not cover the floorboards of the car.
B0007M1ZGE|5|Wow. I do a fair amount of fabrication and the item is A+.  Awesome quality.  Very well done.
B004LLQNL4|1|The seat straps did not fit around the seat.  This item was returned.
B00AFDMV04|5|This fit perfectly in my 2014 Escape.  I had a 2001 Escape and I have no idea why I didn't get one of these before.  It will save your carpet and keep things looking nice.  It is light weight so easy to remove to clean.  Just hose it off and done.
B002MESVUI|3|neither 1 of them fit in my 2000 honda civic that well, and they have WAY too many reflectors in them so my HIDs cant be used in them, all they do is scatter the beams everywhere in zig zag like patterns
B00032K4FG|5|It is what it is.  Not sure what kind of quality everyone else was expecting (tempered glass or something) for the price, but this lives up to my expectation.  Solid enough for a plastic piece that doesn't need to do anything except cover a license plate.  Tint was fine.  Not too light, not too dark.
B002P8OU0G|5|Its fits my car perfectly and look same as my existing passenger side mirror.  Very happy with my purchase and completely satisfied with purchase. Fast shipping.
B000BR51BK|5|I'm not very car savvy but a friend showed me how to change the engine air filter. Since my previous disposable filter was getting dirty and needed to be changed, I ordered this. It fit my 03 Avalon perfectly. The filter comes in a plastic wrap, pre-oiled and ready to use.  I can't speak to the mileage as there are too many variables involved to say if this filter is really making a difference. I've used a K&N filter in my other car and used the cleaning kit which was very easy to do and really cleaned the filter up. This is a good purchase for any car even if you're not comfortable doing very much maintenance for yourself.
B00XMBUY6E|5|Took a 52in light bar for my jeep
B009AC6FKI|4|Everything worked perfectly except for a minor modification needed during installation to clear the stock seatbelt mounting point on the floor.
B006GLEBIO|1|\\"works on any car\\" HA wires are too short to mount the box safely... Also where is the mounting hardware... Dont waste time or money.  Go elsewhere.
B00CPL8PSG|5|works and my car is faster and smoother
B004SS6EMI|5|Covers and protects my 2006 Cobalt with no worries.
B001DR9W8A|5|the pads are very quiet and do a fine job. a very good quality pad for a decent price.
B0002KR88A|5|The fuse holder works as expected.  We installed this in our van and it hooked up with no issues whatsoever.
B001T3Y8XW|1|I had received this item a few weeks ago but never could get it to work.  I am into electronics and know how a multimeter works.  Unfortunately, this one does not.  The seller promptly sent me a replacement but it does not work either.  I suggest buying a more expensive one, or a cheaper one, but not this one.
B005H7CZUY|5|This was the exact OEM part for much less than dealer price and works perfectly.
B008Y4HU7U|1|Bad for actually made my nose bleed
B00PT0K2BI|5|It works great!!
B008W9UBVY|5|great little item!  My old remote kept falling apart,due to over tightening the screw.  This new remote fixed that problem, and looks better than the original!
B0001L0DFA|5|A landscaper friend told me about the nozzle he purchased at a wares show, found these on amazon had to purchase<br />I love these. easy to use.
B001DCH3T0|5|Worked as described.  Happy camper--keeps the tailgate glass up now.  Easy to install,  Key is to get something pointed behind the spring clip holding the old one and the new one when installing.  I used an antique ice pick I keep in my tool box.
B009ELOCKU|5|What more is there to say. it's a silverstar bulb. It's the best there is. It was just a simple plug and play turn signal/taillight for my Jeep Commander
B00E8642WY|4|Makes my truck unique enough to bring smiles to people who see it. Glad I can improve their day. Stays on pretty well.
B00M1WH9NQ|3|I've had this product for a while. Its very cheap looking to me but no one else seems to notice once its on the bike. I was pulled over once but the cop (Virginia) didn't say anything about the lights. It works fine. has a clean look and I'm happy with it. When something else comes out with a clean look, I will switch it out.<br /><br />I would recommend this but only because there is really nothing else out there that I can find.
B0018N6L3S|5|Hard to find  BMW Z3 floor mats and at about half the price of the local BMW dealer. I will use this site in the future.
B000HZDFVO|5|regarding SNOWCHAINS --<br /><br />For those folks that are local enough to San Diego to present their vehicles for fitting -- I make SURE they have the RIGHT,<br />[snuggest] fit possible and that they know HOW to install their new SCC snowtraction products in the easiest, quickest fashion.<br /><br />Perfect fit everytime!<br />[...]<br /><br />google snowchains101 to find out where<br /><br />Snowchains vs Cables which is best for you?<br />[...]
B000VZ9CL2|5|Item as described with steady pressure readings. Value relieves excess air while attached for quick evaluation. And yes, it glows in the dark.
B00397EFNE|5|Very good
B003X89J1M|4|Works well. Not the easiest install or remove.
B00GRHRYHM|5|Perfect. Make sure you tighten the screws on the back of the mirrors once you have them positioned. And when you install them to the jeep tighten the hand screw very tight with pliers or something and they will not move whatsoever. Very quick to install and even quicker when you want to take them off.
B0002HRBSU|4|This is the missing link
B004Z904VC|4|Real tough to get it on the steering wheel. Does fit great, and I got lucky lining up it's location. Other wise do it again!<br />The only problem after 3 weeks of usage, it still smells, and it smells of gasoline! It's going away slowly with use and washing!
B001IWFBXK|5|Perfect replacement for my VW Tiguan 2011, high quality
B00469FOL6|5|I bought this for refills. The product is outstanding. Knew that I would be using a lot of it because I have classic cars and hot rods.
B00COOSE6M|2|Review of the product: 2 stars<br />Review of the customer service responsiveness: 5 stars<br /><br />i wish these would have worked out, unfortunately a series of problems led me to return this product.<br /><br />Initially i recieved a wrong kit altogether (9006 kit in 10000K, i ordered an H11 kit in 5000K), i emailed OPT7, only 25 minutes passed until i got an email from Michael with a new tracking number for the correct kit that was being sent out.<br /><br />I got the kit, put it in and immediately noticed that the color was not the advertised 5000K. i let it go for a couple of says thinking that the bulbs probably just had to break in or something. A week passed and nothing had changed as far as color temperature, but now my passenger side bulb started to flicker wildly, and that the driver's side bulb was dimmer than the passenger side bulb. at this point, keep in mind i had installed the kit with the relay harness and the anti flicker capacitors (included with every kit regardless of what you order from what i can tell, so good deal there) and the bulbs still performed poorly. At this point, i was unsatisfied with this particular HID kit, and wanted to return it. Michael was very understanding and apologetic and sent out a return label for me to send the kit(s) back.<br /><br />again:<br /><br />product: 4/10<br />customer service 10/10
B007VIGC0G|3|It's ok. No miracle worker. Good for mild mildew.
B00K6197VG|4|Fantastic Product! When I decided to change my headlights i decided to order it all and send back what i don't want. First i looked at ZXR Halogens (supposedly as white as it gets for Halogens) In my opinion for $59 a set their not that white, and i have a 28&#34; LED light bar on to compare what white is. Than i tried HID; they are very high performance but they get hot and can melt your housing depending on the size of it, plus your going to be mounting a lot of extra wiring (conversion kit). Lastly I tried LEDs; This is tricky depending on your set up. The most Important thing I can say is spend the extra money for quality, if you wonder why you see such a difference in price between LEDs its due to quality. The cheap lights only look nice when your looking at the car but don't serve much practical purpose. Next; Vehicles that come with halogen lights have housings that are designed to reflect halogen light and Vehicles that come stock with LEDs have housing made for LED light. Now, unless you want to spend $300-$600 on all new housings with the lights in them make sure you get a high powered LED like this one. The quality of this light is amazing. It is as white as my 18000 lumen light bar (but obviously not as bright, safe for driving). It is as well a very constant and soft reflection with great reach. Most of these lights come with a separate ballast but these are a &#34;all in one&#34; whats in the picture is all you need it plugs right in. The ballast and fan is inside. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is the size. I have a 2011 sliverado and because of how large the backing is they barley fit. If you don't at least 2-3 inch's of open space behind your bulbs you won't be able to mount the headlight. If this is the case with you and your unable to move anything or modify the space buy the version with a separate<br />ballast. Tip for a quick way of restoring head light lens; Spray a generous amount of windex on the lens and rub toothpaste (the blue gritty kind) in with a clean rag, spray again with windex and wipe again with clean side of rag, than clean with water. hope this helps.
B006VHGN8O|4|Great Caliper Covers: High quality, looks great, easily cleanable. Took off a star as the interior part (by the MGP logo) did not fit with the Honda Prelude (Stock brakes, stock wheels). Had to customize in order to fit properly.
B001G8AIMU|5|good product and good service
B0030A10V0|5|The product performs just as stated.  When you have spent months disconnecting the battery everytime you park for any period of time, it is a welcome change when the product really works.
B008E8MZ8A|3|I got these to replace my city lights, they look really nice with the color skewing blue but they aren't very bright.
B0046KJO2A|3|In this case, I got what I paid for.  While the quality is acceptable, this liner does not retain its shape as pictured.  I've had it for 2 years and the &#34;corners&#34; are almost all ripped and it constantly gets trapped in the door because it will not stay rigid enough not to flop out of its intended footprint.  Still not a bad buy and functional.  But, I think when it is time for a replacement I will go with a tougher model.
B00H8KKGHW|5|I have used this grease before and it is great, using it for the landing gear on the trailers. It works good. Thanks.
B00Y401JHU|5|Very well constructed. Compact yet roomy. Easily installed and removed for emptying. I had no problem hooking it around the headrest behind the seat. It is a sturdy bag for sure! It's nice to have a trash container over the seat that doesn't tip over and spill every time I turn a corner or come to a stop. This bag is an extremely convenient way of disposing of litter on the go and keeping my car clean. It’s nice to have a bag to help keep the litter in my car under control.  All in all, it’s a nice bag and if you have kids, you should definitely get one or even two.<br /><br />Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes
B005HBQ81C|5|We used this to put up window film inside our home. It was such a handy tool and works great!
B0068TKEGW|1|The holes on the driver floor mat do not match the floor hooks.  Very disappointing.
B0012H6HMK|5|This is my fourth set!! Love them. Go well with our little retro camper.
B00LTHX0PU|5|I loved it. Now some discounts please
B000E4KJLM|5|Perfect  fit easy change out about 10 minutes
B000GBBP8O|4|The StrongArm came in quickly and was very easy to install. Saved me from using a 2x4 to hold up the hood of my Audi.<br /><br />Thank you
B00DYSDS72|3|Got these for my '08 Tundra - different sizes for driver and passenger sides.  The adapter included looked a little different but it works. Decent blade performance for the price compared to $30/blade at my local auto superstore
B000C9SAJC|5|Thank you!!! :)
B00IRPPZQO|4|great for the price.  does streak a bit but you get what you pay for
B001PN8760|5|QUALITY ITEM
B0041U1ST2|5|Fit perfectly
B00FEBKLAO|5|VERY EASY TO INSTALL TOOK ABOUT 15MINS AND AFTER THAT THE RESULTS WERE IMPRESSIVE AND AT NIGHT JAGUAR LOGO PROJECTOR SHOWS  A VERY CLEAR STABLE IMAGINE OF THE JAGUAR LOGO .I BUY ANOTHER PROJECTOR FOR MY OTHER JAGUAR
B0023WIUCS|5|Nice addition to my trudk.  Well made and easy to install.  Arrived quickly and improved overall look and night vision.
B000BVQ7XW|5|Product represented a great value--a lot for the money, especially compared to local auto supply stores.  Thanks for the prompt service too!
B001C8WOR6|5|I used the Amazon compatibility tool to select rear pads for my 2007 Mini Cooper S (Non JCW) and got entirely the wrong pad.  When it was time to do the front brakes, I used some external resources to determine which part number I would need, and these worked great. They seemed like a REALLY tight fit at first--make sure you compress your calipers COMPLETELY before trying to put the caliper unit over the brake pad carrier.<br /><br />I put plasti-lube (anti-squeak) on the entire back of the pad, but none on the 'ears' (based on a recommendation on a Mini forum). They squawked a little bit when I came to a full stop, but only for the first 20-30 miles. Now they seem to be seated well and work great.  Haven't had them long enough to see if there is less brake dust than OEM, but I hope so.<br /><br />I put new EBC slotted rotors on at the same time, which may have added to the brief squawk. But as I said, it didn't last long at all, and wasn't that bad.<br /><br />To add to the confusion, the box even says Mini Cooper S (JCW), and mine is not JCW, but they worked great. Do some outside research first.  Don't trust the compatibility tool.
B0000VWM1O|3|I received this switch panel with no labels to affix to the switches and no instructions of any kind. I was familiar with the brand, so thought that it would be fairly complete. I guess the seller repackaged the manufacturer's product and ships incomplete. Not worth my time and effort to return, so I'll just cut my losses and proceed as is. You get what you pay for!
B0074EJ6IC|3|Soo cute..but the material started peeling.
B00DD0ZWQQ|4|Great car mats, very strong material.
B003U4YLWG|3|I didn't really like purchasing from this seller. I contacted them about tracking information and never got a response. The package was two days late. Nice product, but you might want to consider purchasing it from someone else.
B009M0S4Z2|5|Easy to install in our leased car and helps keep the seats clean for the eating in the car person.  It stays put and the cost is less than other brands out there.
B008EM5S30|4|Works good and is movable.  A little longer than I would've liked.  Put a piece of tape on floor in case my son moves the stop I will know where to put it again.
B000GU0PG8|5|I ordered this lens because I love the look of clear glass that the newer Harleys have out of the factory. My 97 Fatboy had an H4 with a sealed beam looking light that was clouded.  The visual difference is jaw dropping. I have a headlamp train nacelle and it adds even more chrome to the look.  Simply amazing. The high and low beams are top quality and I am as pleased as I could be. The headlamp has a larger diameter rear end so, you will have to trim your stock plate for it to go in or, buy the larger plate at the dealer. I can't wait for the matching spots I ordered to get here!
B0033YWTZE|3|1 side is stubborn and wont stay down bcz its not curved to the car like the other side. But.... it still looks great on my mustang
B008CK7396|5|what can't I say about it, nice easy to stick on sides of ammo boxes so you don't grab the wrong stuff going to the range
B005Z7FYBI|5|Very cool! Get's loads of attention. Would buy again!
B000F088S6|4|This pump works fine but for alittle more money I should have gotten a larger capacity.  It took a long time to pull the necessary vacuum in a small air conditioner system.  I used the standard oil that came with it and eventually changed it out with premium oil.  The premium oil made a big difference in time and level of vacuum.
B000E4U1A6|5|Broke my mirror on my 1998 Toyota Tacoma and was happy to find a replacement for so cheap!  Installing this mirror literally took 5 mins.  Theres a triangular plastic trim piece to pop off from the inside of the door.  Then there are 3 10mm bolts to remove the old mirror.  The new mirror came with (3) screws, but I was able to reuse the hex bolts from the original.  Fit great, can't tell the difference!
B004AJ9OYA|5|Fit great look great installation was straight forward and the price was right. Put these on my 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 crew cab. Would recommend these to anyone.
B004OKCP6E|3|I would've given these a 5 star, but when they came in they were stapled together with these HUGE staples that were practically impossible to remove. Once I finally got the staples out, it left holes in the floor mats. They weren't visible once I put the mats in my four runner. I guess you get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend them.
B0009I7K7Y|5|Great Product!!!
B009DK7YQQ|4|Not the most comfortable pad but better than factory plastic. It gets really hot with the top down but that is to be expected. It looks great with by mats!
B00CPGGZNS|5|I am a professional firefighter an also volunteer, over the last 4 years I had paid a lot of money for lights an have been disappointed. When I plugged these lights in I was speechless, these are by far some of the best lights I have ever owned!!!  100% satisfied an will recommend to everyone who asks!
B002O5I1B4|5|I love the look of these in my truck with the matching steering wheel cover.
B001CJHU9W|1|First problem is the clamp-on connector doesn't stay connected to the valve stem on my tires.  It's loose and wiggles and slides off to the point that it doesn't depress the valve to keep it open.  Secondly, when I do manage to get it to stay connected (usually by holding it in place) the gauge reads 5-10 pounds lower than any of my other gauges.  Returning it...
B00NMZ4ODY|5|Great price. Fast shipping. Thanks
B00BP19P4U|5|Great quality sticker. Looks great on car.
B003POEOIM|4|I have been purchasing my car cleaning supplies from Griot's for some time.  Though i usually order directly from their website, ordering from Amazon was much faster and a smoother transaction.
B000H774BY|1|I never did use the device to re-start a car, but after it sat for a while and I decided to top off the device...I discovered that it will not re-charge.  My wife bought two of them at christmas.  Neither would recharge, despite a very careful reading of the instructions.  Makes lots of beep sounds but nothing works correctly.  I then went onto the web and discovered MANY others with the same experience.  I am amazed that Black & Decker still has the device on the market.  It does not reflect good brand quality.
B007NKXSKY|5|Installed this product on my ranger midsize. Does a great job lighting the cab!
B009EJXN48|5|This  product is excellent!!!  Easy to use, does great in wind, snow and ice.  Very easy to handle.  If you park outside, you need this.
B00HK97ZOI|1|Does not fit a 06 5.9 Cummins at all
B00B7FQWNG|4|What can you say about these?  They are overpriced plastic filler pieces.  I needed some as it looks like somewhere along the way a mechanic took them out and forgot to put them back in.
B001GIMNPA|5|This banner was more than i expected. its good quality and for the price, it cant b beat.  its somthing i can keep around forever and is a 100 times better than most of the ones i have ordered before.  nothin but happy with this one !
B00JQTYGBU|5|Quality product.<br />Magnets hold it in place.<br />The blocks are tall enough to allow use with the Roush side splitters, which I wasn't sure would be the case when I bought them.<br />The price sure beat the $ 65 / ea. for the billet items sold on that tuner site.<br />Highly recommended !
B002T4DJXU|3|Let me start by saying that I gave these shocks several months on my vehicle before reviewing them. I personally hate to be negative, but these shocks didn't hold up well at all. Initially they improved my ride dramatically, however after several months, they feel very loose in the absorption arena. I'm going to have to replace them very soon. I'm giving them 3 stars due to price, but really should be 2.
B007VRBBBC|3|The Mic needed calibration offten and never read the same twice. The mic would get sticky as you turned it the loosen up again causeing the ratchet to operate before the tips were even in contact with what i was measureing. Not a pro tool but ok for checking the machine shops work.
B00BYH6C1E|4|Fills the need to stop items falling between the seats.this item was ok but not as good as the one shown on tv.
B00LU0UBH6|3|Cleans the interiors well but very average when used for cleaning the exterior of the car.
B000HZUXNW|5|This item has been up to my expectation, practical, durable and easy to hold and attach to the car seat. Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery also,
B007Q45LQ6|1|Disappointed because light bulb burned light socket. Had to spend $100 to replace socket.
B001N3TUPO|2|I have a few surface scratches on my Escalade and it only masks a few of them temporarily just until the next washing. The description gave the impression that it was a permanent fix, I should've known better. If temporary is what you are looking for, enjoy. I do not recommend for scratch repairs.
B005X4QCAA|4|Really like this product, I bought it to compensate for my speedometer malfunctioning but later found out I still had to repair the speedometer so I really didn't need to keep the product, but I am keeping it and using it, it's really cool my old car feels like a newer car with this
B00FQDRHMK|5|Love them looking great
B00FJXKE5E|5|I had a mix up with Automatic, and their customer service came through with flying colors. On top of that, I'm a much better driver for it. I was getting scores in the 80s when I started, and now every week is a 99 or 100 and I'm saving a bunch of money on gas. I helps if you have someone to be competitive with - my father in law and I compare scores and that keeps me driving sensibly!
B001AGN758|5|Fast derlivery. Easy to install. Perfect fit. Price is resasonable. Recommended for 2004 Toyota Sienna XLE AWD. You'll needs two nuts,two bolts and one gasket.
B001JSRMJ4|4|I was looking for decent summer gloves. These do the job. They are airy enough. I would like some more protection on knuckles.
B007TVTHSO|3|Fast shipping and packaging. The part works fine, just kinda noisy. It makes a constant high pitch whistling that gets more intense with each ac fan speed setting.
B0012ETJ1O|5|My headlights were factory lights that were dull and yellow.  I could barely see anything at night, even with the high beams on.  Now that I have installed these Ultra lights I am able to see everything and I dont even need my high beams at all.  Deffinately 50%+ brighter and worth the money.
B000EVYH72|4|Works well
B008X02HVY|1|The strut was back-ordered. When the strut finally arrived, both this and the left side strut were installed. Upon driving the first time after installing, bumps and knocks were noticed from both areas about the struts. After much investigation to determine if something was left untightened or misaligned, the new struts was determined to be the source of the noise. This is the third set of struts purchased in the last year made by a Chinese manufacturer with the same issue. I now have a set on the way from an American firm!!
B002M4B3Z8|3|parking light was out had to use my old wiring harness on the drivers side light had no low beam
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Super bright. Sturdy construction. Amazing value. Some of my pictures a re a little blurry but all the light in them is only from these lights.
B0029T0S70|5|I bought these with my car in mind, I needed something that did not leave lint behind after washing my car, but this are incredible good and high quality. The picture does not show their beauty. I am actually saying beauty, because they are well made, excellent product. And yes my car is shinny. I used them for my car, and now I use them in my home, in the kitchen, bathroom, these are great multipurpose towels and they are washable. I will be ordering more of these for a long time.
B000COC67E|4|Holds 230 lb man no problem at all<br />Casters on the wheels are legit<br />Good Product
B005FRSHBC|5|Amazing product, fits perfectly and is rugged. Only thing that could be better is to have the same holes for the drivers side mat on the passengers side, the passengers mat has a tendency to move around.
B00RUE2WOG|4|Good mirrors. I lost the nut that screws in to make it bigger. Trying to find a replacement nut but mirror are good and as advertised
B0030C4LOQ|1|The didn't fit and alot of things about the seatcovers should have been been mentioned by the company that made them.
B000CPIDFW|5|Title says it all.  it is a perfect replacement for the Rear center hose on a 1966 Plymouth Valiant V8 with 10&#34; rear drum brakes.
B00L3XGGJ2|4|Best spark plugs buy performance testing and value
B000S2SKIY|5|This Canister is a great update for my 2004 Silverado. When my old one failed it was the old style, this fits perfectly in place.
B00B92NP8W|1|I bought this mirror to replace my existing damaged folding type mirror in Honda Accord 2002 EX sedan 4D.But the mirror was not folding as described and going to return it back.
B00CEPVE2C|5|perfect!!
B006WN9V9K|5|good
B00HZSLJSW|5|Great mirrors, easy to install and look great!
B003BYFTEE|5|It would be better if it had little table on the top. I  like everything else about it  , and the price.
B000O707IO|5|perfect
B007TY3H78|5|This was a perfect fit for my 2004 Ford F350 pickup tailgate and looks great. it was an exact replacement for the oem part with a very good savings.
B00168IQKQ|5|Perfect. Overlay was perfect too.
B006G14FK8|5|Awesome device.  Even charged a low battery back to life.
B000E71E0Y|5|Certain Chevys have had a problem with the alternator voltage going over 17 Volts. This is due to an interaction with the alternator and an ungrounded ignition coil. This Ignition coil fixes the problem. You need to add a grounding strap from the engine to the bolt next to the plug on the coil.  It solves steering wheel lock-up, flashing instrument panel and the battery light coming on.  It is well worth the investment.
B0042Z0E6E|5|Lightweight, does a great job, dries quickly, easily folds and goes back in bag storage...we use it for RV camping.
B007AL4W4M|5|I bought this for my 2012 tundra rock warrior, it was like a one min install, kinda stupid that Toyota doesn't install these from the factory, but now I don't have a big row of blank buttons
B000SKV4U2|5|This is the recommended oil for my high performance European vehicle. My car now has 130,000 miles of every day use, and the engine is running GREAT. There is a reason AMG and Mercedes specify this oil. If you are thinking about using it in a vehicle you care about, PAY THE EXTRA MONEY TO PREVENT ENGINE SLUDGE, ENGINE WEAR, AND in general costly repairs down the road. Its recommended to be changed at 10,000 miles in my car, but I change at 7500 just as an extra precaution and since I do drive it hard sometimes. Always use the same viscosity as is recommended, and use that same viscosity every times in order to ensure the engine operates under the same parameters. Regular oil is garbage comapared to Mobil1, I will not buy any other oil even if the car did not specify it.
B00D2HI32U|5|Nice & compact. Easy to use. Read instructions first or you will think batteries are dead. It's a guy thing you know! Range is about 50 feet. I would recommend this product as you do not need to mess with a bunch of wiring.
B00EHYOVKU|5|It works great!
B000J3FOOU|5|Worked great
B000VMF426|5|This tire cover looks nice and was not too hard to install.  I've only had it on for a few weeks, so I can't speak to its durability.  I have it on a 235 70R16 tire.
B001R958M8|5|Excellent quality
B0034ZUZM6|4|Great winch for the price. The wiring was a pain though due to the way they have the fuses located in the middle of the wiring.
B008XN7NUG|5|Great scan tool, very capable and the updates really make a difference. The renewal option is expensive after the initial year, but overall I am very pleased with the tool. This tool gets used in a professional environment multiple times daily. Was very pleased with the level of Porsche software, although it won't do everything (programming, some maintenance resets on newer vehicles, some live data isn't read or in the wrong calibration i.e. kg/s instead of g/s on most MAF readings) Can do in-depth diagnostics on almost any make available.
B00JXLHT56|5|amazingly simple solution to the problem of switching over to led lamps
B00GR4WUC4|1|This looks nothing like the picture. The red mustang in the photo must have some other chin spoiler. The quality of the product is poor, and the finish product not up to par. I would not recommend buy this chin spoiler. It took a long time to get to me after order.
B00BRL73Z6|5|great product
B003VAYRNM|5|These rods work exactly as described.  It is cheap &#34;insurance&#34; to keep your RV water heater from corroding.
B002OUZK7W|4|Great product. but needs a snap on cover over the main body to protect the reset module and button . Began using it the day it arrived. Thanks Lew Hassell
B00T7CRMJY|4|These are very similar to items we purchased from a sheepskin seat cover and accessory specialty store in Santa Barbara, CA.  The construction seems identical except that the seating area on the first batch is a single piece of sheepskin; this one has multiple segments across to same material cost and uses more of the sheep pelt/hide; presumably all are made in the Peoples Republic of China.  The others came in a number of colors to match the interior; these only are available in the yellow/tan color in the image I see here.  The fit is fine, and based upon the wear of the first batch, these should last between two to four years in regular daily service, with the probable wear being seam failure to the backing material upon which the hides are stitched, or the side/back material that is some synthetic fur (the first had the same, and it does not wear well).  The price is less than the relatively expensive Santa Barbara store.  If the seams/backing fail sooner than I expect, I will post an update and complain to the seller.  Note that sheepskin is cool in summer, warm in winter, and protects the leather upholstery from many types of wear and damage.
B001J7CO02|5|This is an excellent product. This airhorns set is much louder than I expected. Also I've use this on an international truck by using the solenoid from that truck. Everything works well very happy.
B00GG4OA3W|1|I received it and it was only 23in
B000R4M462|1|Receive with missed pece
B00Q9ALVAS|1|emblem looked like it came from a junk yard find , has cracks in the plastic and had half of the 3m sticky tape still stuck to it
B00757GT1U|5|Recommended product!!
B00TKO0J6C|5|Great price & it works as good as more expensive ones.
B000BUOSG6|5|I was tired of attaching the clip-on extenders and losing them, so I added these extensions as they are quite a bit more substantial. I also put them on using silicone so they should stay put.
B0007ZDRE4|1|The pressure gauge's lens fell off right away. The cheap plastic fitting that connects to the low pressure side valve, leaks badly. And the instructions are poorly written.  Stay away from this thing!!!
B00C8FRUD0|5|This product is very good.  It looks great and is easy to install.  Comes with everything that you need to install.
B00515NJ20|5|Perfect fit on a 2007 Chevrolet Malibu with the 3.5L V6. The quality of these plugs are great and they come with the correct gap right out of the package.
B00HNYPB96|4|Works as it should easy to install
B00EZUL6ZY|3|Doesn't feet really well my RAV4 2015.  But they looks fine
B000C5HYNO|5|we have ac now!!!!!!!!
B00GUN97RS|5|Awesome
B003PJOBQ2|5|Fits, works great, good idea, if you need one, this is a good one, thumbs up quality, does what it looks like it should.
B00853NL0K|5|Nice quality made. I used this for my Alabama golf cart and it added a nice touch. High recommend product.
B001S21LJ8|5|Shipped fast and reasonable price. Install was quick and easy and it sounds great. Still evaluating if it helps mileage.
B000C7VX8O|4|FITS GREAT
B004HII1G6|5|This product is the SCHIZZLE!!
B004BAXOKI|5|Godspeed 1992 to 1995 Honda Civic Coilover Springs Lowering<br />easy install<br />ride nice<br />easy adjust<br />good quality<br />cheap<br />..<br />..
B00M9MRA14|2|I installed the PDM60 on my Honda NC700x.. It controls my Garmin, heated grips and a accessory connection.  It has been s little difficult to program .  You program without power but it has to be wired up to check .  Read all the directions and make notes.  Mine went out around a year old on a trip. I emailed the tech email given and over two weeks later no response .  I like the concept and may try again unless I find something better.
B0031HC8PO|5|Item is just as OEM at a fraction of the cost at a Parts Store or even more so at the Dealership. You can not go wrong purchasing this item from here at such a great price.
B007F9FPR2|5|A very good quality pintle mount. Heavy duty with good clean welds. Great deal and worth the price in every way.
B000C9SR90|5|Great OEM part for a portion of the cost.
B008NQL00W|5|this is the best, no need for any switch or relay... works perfect... don't think that there are other that works better with the appradio 2
B004SMGAJ6|5|Was shipped quickly and performs perfect
B00HD50BEK|5|Good~
B00WL11AMS|5|I received the kensun 12v compact air compressor for being a valued customer. This product works great. Comes in handy for all types of situations. I would recommend to anyone who needs to inflate something...
B001L2E8MC|5|The shipping time was abit too long, but was worth the wait. The hubcaps came wrapped quite well and arrived without damage. They fit the toyota rims perfectly, I was pleasantly surprised that a set of wheels this inexpensive would be this nice. A few weeks after I installed the hubcaps om my wife's toyota she noticed one of them missing. I don't know if someone stole it again or if it fell off. I looked on the net could't find anyone to sell me one cap so I had to buy 4 all over again. Well so much for the good deal haha, now I had to buy 8 hubcaps. Im still happy with the product...
B001CKOA2Q|1|Never got the product. I ordered 3 items from 3 separate companies with a gift card for amazon more than a month ago. Got the two within the week and these guys product never arrived. I ordered 3 stickers from them. I wa skeptical about doing business with these guys because I read the reviews and saw the negatives and the positives. I thought it was just the stingey people posting bad reviews. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!! They will not follow through as I have learned. I triedto contact them and got no response. Don't lose your money! Go somewhere else!
B009S091LW|5|Shipping from 3rd party was of premium service (I am a amazon prime loyalist and received very fast).  Cup holder is of superior quality and well worth the money; I mean...after shipping its a $25 cup holder and well worth it!  Nothing is cheap when it comes to river boating, and I recommend this to every boater.  Don't waste your money on suction cup holders...<br /><br />Durango, CO!
B006K34TWQ|5|Gearup2Go were great. Item did not fit my machine and they were great about the return. Very helpful. I wish the item fit my machine it appeared to be a high quality product. Will buy from them again.
B001GSQPR2|1|This is the second flight deck purchased in 3 months.  On both occasions the sensor unit cracked  because of the vibrations.  No more Shimano wireless sensors for this reviewer!!!! It cost me too much!
B002RK9F1G|5|Top Quality Decal.  Very satisfied with this product.
B009FUF6DM|5|good for dusting and cleaning without any stains on the surface and easy to wash and clean microfiber material in washer.
B0089HZ0W4|5|Nice frame. Seems to be of very good quality. The black looks great on my Tungsten Silver Passat!
B000A0CAWQ|4|Maintenance mandatory, so necessary evil.
B0036UHVLW|5|great!
B000XBCURW|5|I got this to protect my black interior of my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee. From the black dash to the leather trimming. This does a fantastic job protecting my black interior from the hot sun. Leaves NO residue and no grease feeling. Love it!
B000QGZXCS|4|works well on cleaning costume jewelry but not so great on my brass doorknob
B00HVHN2CI|5|Keep from falling on the remote and beautiful stripes
B002UC4XG8|4|As I did convert from a Thetford version IV to the Thetford version V toilet this extension was needed and worked perfectly.
B001EOV492|5|Very product and fast delivery.<br />Thank you!
B00CIC43BU|5|Problem with the first battery and the company will stand by their product.  They were very helpful and wanted the sale to be positive.  Very pleased and will use again.
B008N2JLRU|5|Greatly fit. High quality. In one word, perfect.
B003YJ8TVQ|2|This thing worked once for me too.  Now it is not working at all. I will need to find a better unit.
B00206GG7I|5|Did a great job with extending my battery tender connection on the Multistrada so that I may connect it to a SAE USB adapter and hook up my iPhone to it.
B002GIN4TS|5|Looks good, fits well and has good storage capacity. The underseat dead space is now put to good use with the Du-Ha storage organizer.
B002CPO7IW|5|ATV power winch looks to be just what we wanted.  Haven't tried it out yet, been too cold!  Quick ship, arrived in plenty of time for Christmas!
B001KO7Y4A|4|This is a quality built item. The only issue I had was with the magnet that was not properly glued (epoxy). It may have been caused by the fact that the magnet is polished so there is little for the glue to hold on and the glue applied was not enough so the contact surface with the glue was further reduced. I scratched both the magnet and the filter surface to make sure the bond will not fail again while on the engine.<br /><br />I would suggest that the design be modified and the magnet to be retained by deforming the edges of the hole it sits in. This way the magnet will go nowhere. I could have done this myself if not for the filter screen being attached on the underside. I did not want to risk damaging it. This needs to be done during production before the screen is glued.<br /><br />One star off for the magnet otherwise this would be a solid 5 star product.<br /><br />For the record I installed this on a Yamaha R1 2001.
B0068ESK1I|5|Shipping was quick. Product arrived and tested it right away.  Holds my dirt bike nice and snug. Very easy to work these straps. Into place and tighten. They also hold their place very well.
B002PUTC0M|5|Very flexible tool, the only disadvantage is the air chuck does not really seal all the time, but all you have to do is press it slightly more, but is not a problem.<br />I used it for a couple of weeks at a automotive shop, and i'm super satisfied with the product.<br />Matco Tools sells the same inflator for about 80 bucks more.<br />To install the battery it only takes about two min.
B006WL6YU6|4|the knives are a bit dull (my only complaint). but good enough for the price overall~
B001JT1IWU|5|Great coaxial cable being used for my CB setup, both ends of the cable are properly molded and there are no obvious imperfections.<br /><br />Cable quality wise, the cable works great - no issues found.
B000P75G0M|5|My husband Audie and I felt an immediate difference in the air around us and the manner in which we could feel the air conditioning and heating.  The prior day of receiving our windscreen, we had traveled over to the lake and in the heat with the top down, could barely feel the air on maximum, with the windscreen, it was as if it seemed 10 degrees cooler in the same outside temperature.  We are very pleased, just be gentle when removing it, The insert holes are gentle and can easily break.  Last, just another gorgeous sporty addition.
B0009H519Y|5|Works great!!!
B001D5BQ18|5|Work perfect and for Southern States where is always raining is the MUST have for your car.<br />Excellent product ... Michelin Quality
B000CRVFYQ|2|get hard quickly
B008PTM6EG|1|This does not work for me
B0048BQLZU|5|This helmet has saved me from several branches to the face while on my ATV in Central Maine.  Good airflow keeps your head cool, even on hot days in the sun.
B00OUTEQT8|5|Price was right and they all worked!
B00CODI06W|5|Spiffy wheel covers. Excellent Price. Fits great
B009T8MA3Y|1|Bad quality product. The logo came off the very first day and I spent 4 hours scraping that from my windshield.
B004TMHF8K|4|It will work but smaller than I anticipated. Works great though
B00HUHXTTA|1|Wasn't what I thought it would of been.
B001EOWRUW|5|works as it should had no complaints
B000K7JGVM|5|Very good product
B0055DR56Y|5|Tight fitting into receive !! Hitch or Receiver problem ?? not sure, ordered togatheir. Had to use block of wood to hammer into place Works great though !!!!
B0000AXTUY|1|Plugged it into a less than one year old normally working automotive battery. After leaving it plugged in for 20 hours and over night temperatures of 7F the vehicle would crank but would not start. Hooked up a battery charger I know works, it reported that the battery was at 50%. After leaving the other brand battery charger hooked up for ten minutes the engine cranked and started.<br /><br />This is a common theme throughout the reviews for this product. Schumacher quality control must be extremely poor. The instructions alluded to the distinct possibility that this unit might be DOA. I will never buy a product from this company again. It seems like sending junk out the door is A-OK with them.<br /><br />Pay for shipping to return this hunk of junk? And what about my time, installing, removing it and shipping it back?!<br /><br />Do not buy. Stay very far away unless you like playing the lottery to see if this product will work. I am glad I found out it didn't work before I went overseas for two months and came back home to a dead battery and a charger that was worthless.
B001KO15UY|5|Very pleased that Cycra sells these. Keeps the handguards looking new.
B00IXMA1RY|4|The tool works great and is well built.  The only issue I have with it is that no instructions were provided with the tool.
B0002F68JK|5|I am using this cover on a 2014 Mini Winnie E350.  It fits like a glove.  Just camped when winds came in and the cover stayed on, no problem.  Nice to have access to cab area while privacy is still maintained.
B00063X7KG|5|first time ive ever clayed a car so that was interesting. its very &#34;soft&#34; for clays (ive since got a few stronger ones) but this got most of the job done. my ODC made me get the blue clay next for a few trouble spots
B005N53CBQ|5|I bought this, along with the matching front seat covers for my 1994 Volvo 940.  They were relatively easy to put on and they look fantastic.  They are well-fitted (with a lot of tugging and tucking on our part), bright, colorful, and fun.  Getting the center back seat belt through was very complicated but my hubby is very handy and got it done.
B000CPJLVC|5|Works like magic. Shipped fast, and definitely held up to extreme temps. Didn't fade and looks amazing!
B000PRYDF6|5|i am very satisfied with my socket set and am appreciative of the great price; i would definitely recommend this socket set to anyone whose at least somewhat handy with tools. thanks
B004SK5I46|5|Alright so your probably reading this review because your looking to buy the scangaugeE; well im not going to tell you to buy it, im going to tell you what it does and hopefully convince you on this great product.<br /><br />DESIGN<br />first off the design isnt the best but hey ya gotta do with what ya get cuz it doesnt match anything on the interior, other than the customizable screen color which is amazing and has a few very vivid colors in the spectrum which are the primaries, matching the color of the SG to my dashboard was a piece of cake and spot on.<br /><br />INSTALLATION<br />the provided 6 foot cable was just the right amount to route from the OBD2 connector through under the dash to the driverside A pillar and behind the A pillar bezel to the headliner then over to the rearview mirror, where the scangauge sits. back to when i said the cable is just the right amount i mean like and inch worth of length left in my saturn L series. awesome :)<br /><br />THE GAUGES<br />well everything that the specs say it will read is true but is based on your car. everything reads for me except fuel pressure, but i didnt get it to read my fuel pressure so whatever. it gives me so much info on my car its amazing<br /><br />RESULTS<br />i strongly believe i am driving better due to this gauge.<br />the day i got it my AVG mpg was 16... Holy crap in a saturn ! after watching  the instant MPG while driving under all conditions i am/was able to tone my driving habits to get better.<br />so i started out with 16 mpg avg day one( driving like i would normally while acting like there wasnt a scangauge in front of me)<br />day two 26 mpg avg<br />then so on i was getting 28 mpg avg for the week<br />up until recently my best was 29 avg<br />BUT wait! theres more. tonight driving home i was able to attain 30.1 AVG MPG ( best so far, and probably all ill squeeze out of the 4cyl engine )<br />it also tells you instant MPG so you know what your workin with at any given time. not to brag but my best with foot not off the pedal was 42.X MPG wow! when foot is off it goes up to like the 100's<br /><br />i believe this lil gadget has helped me learn my own car even better. ive owed it for almost two years and wondered why im always getting gas so often in a saturn. cuz i drive like i thought was efficient, guess not :(<br /><br />overall this gadget is awesome! and my gas needle is like never moving anymore, lolag but my best with foot not off the pedal was 42.X MPG wow! when foot is off it goes up to like the 100's<br /><br />i believe this lil gadget has helped me learn my own car even better. ive owed it for almost two years and wondered why im always getting gas so often in a saturn. cuz i drive like i thought was efficient, guess not :(<br /><br />overall this gadget is awesome! and my gas needle is like never moving anymore, lol
B000CODCOK|5|When I tune my motorcycles I use a Wego III AFR meter that I can now interchange between bikes, thanks to this sensor plug kit. The price is great! Everyone else's were so ridiculously high it was crazy!
B0042HBNZI|5|Works great...
B007L56FGU|3|very thin material
B00CYTVHJS|1|Worst Mistake Ever Buying! didn't come with very good instructions, no pictures. installed the kit, went out for ride. It was like riding a horse with a saddle that doesn't fit! horse is not happy,and your not happy. came home checked out what was the deal. brackets put shocks metal to metal on swingarm. Dangerous,and bad ride! Do Not Buy This! It Will Hurt You!!
B007HIIOLK|4|Easy to install, look great , 4star for now till winter comes, it seem to be a winner! Really won't know to till winter get here.
B000BQKWZG|4|Better than the plastic one that comes with the trailer kit.
B0017UBHQS|5|These handy Push Retainers are perfect for sealing up all those holes in your fender wells and firewall -- the ones that let water and mud get into the engine compartment, and fumes and/or noise to enter the passenger compartment.<br /> The 100-count bag gives us a low-cost, quick, and easy way to spot those holes and seal them up -- and keep your rig quiet and free from fumes, dust, and moisture.<br /> The body diameter of these fasteners allows a perfect fit in all 1/4th-inch holes.<br /><br /> Of course, they also do an excellent job at their normal use of retaining automotive plastic panels and pieces.<br /><br /> My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon !
B006MX81FA|5|I wasn't sure sure what to expect from these covers, they were only $59.99 for the whole set, and I spent $25.00 a couple of years ago on a cover for the driver's seat only. But I am very satisfied with these covers. After a bit of a tussle, they look absolutely great on my Toyota Rav 4. I smile every time I get into my car. They have exceeded my expectations, and then some! They fit exceptionally well. The headrest covers are less than stellar, but still look good. I'm very happy.
B00HJ2OI00|3|it's ok, not bad and relevant to it's price
B004RNR9BY|4|Great for clean drinking water at campsites. Used the Camco filter along with this hose.
B004G8JLP2|5|Very good value
B003FPF22I|2|Not as bright as I had hoped
B00L9QY7KI|5|Awesome
B003PJR1FU|5|It is a good quality product,very eye catching, great price. Good way to share your support of WI AND the Packers! Highly recommend!
B0089HSJD6|1|cheap cheap cheap. material looks nothing like suede. more like crushed velvet. stitching very loose and lots of it. kind of a frankenstein dash cover that looks like it was pieced together from scraps.  includes 2 small Velcro tabs to secure to dash, but you will need at least 8 to secure this thing properly. fit is actually pretty close but  a little too wide to lay smooth without bloating. good news, amazon makes it easy to return items.
B0037TAHJU|4|Arrived early and works very well.
B0033CKDT0|5|Ok, let me start with the fact that I am not a mechanic.  I bought this for my 2002 Toyota Camry which had a check engine light on and would not pass inspection.  The Cat arrived quickly and it good condition.  It came with both gaskets so I saved some money there.  It looked exactly like the original one in my car.<br /><br />Old one comes out, new one goes in.  100 miles later, the check engine light is off and I pass inspection.  This one cost about 40% of what an actual Toyota one would.  Not sure if it will last as long either but I am not intending to keep this car for another 10 years.  It should last 3-5 years though so if you are in a pinch, I would recommend it!  Just can't comment on the longevity of the product.
B004FOK6DS|5|The product was ordered for my wife as a Mother's Day gift from my kids. The product arrive a head of schedule for Mother's Day. The wife was happy with the product because that is what she wanted for her call. I would recommend this seller.
B001BYB6HU|4|Was looking for something a little lighter than the big bulky helmet i have for buzzing the HD 1200 to and from work, this fits the bill. Jafram provides rapid sales service, delivers on promised items without issue. made one exchange (due to size- my fault), within one week of sending return, replacement arrived!
B001B5E16W|5|I didnt install this myself, I just bought it for the person that installed it for me.  I did some searching all over the internet and you can save a very small amount of money going with something that appeared to be less in quality.  Shipping from the seller was very prompt and on time.  All the parts needed to replace the entire clutch (except flywheel) are all accounted for.  The clutch works great after install, and i'm quite satisfied with it.
B00HNGBOL8|5|These are way better than your standard parts store ball joints.  I've had them on my Jeep for a few months now and they still seem just as tight as the day I put them on, but not over tight.  I would definitely recommend these.
B0035GX3P0|5|bling bling!
B005HAYDR4|5|Works very well and priced much better than on some other sites.
B0018QO4K2|4|I had a hard time trying to find these. The assortment is great, covers a variety of emblems. I recommend this to any working on or restoring a vehicle.
B00H6XB0NK|5|Good transaction. Quickly shipped. Very sticky. Easily cut and installed, I used it on the underside of the motor cover of a motor home. Worked great.
B000K5SD68|5|these glasses are great for riding! for the few times that i go without a helmet, these are leaps and bounds better than just wearing regular sunglasses. the foam does feel a little cheap in some cases, but nothing has happened to them yet! all good things so far
B000C5CERK|4|fits a 2012 kia sorenta 6 cycl.  little tricky with the lock that allows cap to spin but turn cap and then lock what i did.
B001NKUD8U|5|My husband's old   Cabin was worn out and this one is exactly like it and cost alot less.  Just what he wanted.
B000CMHUTA|5|Good Liners!!!
B005OJ3RSO|5|Looks perfect
B003FKNZP4|5|Good fit
B0049IZ3J2|5|We use this on my jeep for my pressure cleaning business to carry our cleaner and hoses. We also use it to haul all of our coolers and beach stuff on the weekends! We have stood on it numerous times and it is very sturdy. Great price and works great!
B00CH8R5RE|3|I really like the quality of the mats - no issues there.  Just note that when you buy the &#34;complete set&#34; you are not getting the cargo mat which I would have considered a &#34;complete set&#34; otherwise it should say &#34;front and back row&#34;.  I should have paid closer attention to the pictures which does not show the cargo mat.
B000GTUM9O|5|This fit my CRF250L perfectly. It was easy to install and stays on very solid, yet it's easy to remove if necessary. I would recommend this.
B00CE3PAEC|5|Perfect fit made a noticable difference in the handling.
B000B8JUAW|2|One thing is for sure, it'll be difficult for a thief to steal your gas. I have the damnedest time doing so with my key.
B002QAMXKC|5|This was a great buy for my old truck that I am restoring it stands out now Thanks you so much
B001AWLJG6|5|Perfect in all respects
B004DDXHLE|3|the rack didn't come with any directions, just the rack pieces and a bag of nuts & bolts, etc.  the rack was dented in quite a few places and fits awkwardly on top of the jeep.  not very appealing (visually), but overall it's still strong enough to get the job done.
B0009IBJAS|3|It is doing well as a car battery maintainer but not powerful enough to charge a dead battery. It will charge smaller batteries such as lawnmowers or motorcycles.
B0093XZDS4|5|You can't go wrong buying Bestline and adding it to your cars engine, I increased my MPG!!! The gas treatment is so easy to use, I simply add 2 ounces for every 10 gallons, I always have a bottle in my car.<br />NO-SKWEEK is by far the BEST Lubricant spray on the market today, My sewing machine pedal was sticking causing what I call run-a-way syndrome.. I sprayed No-Skweek on the pedal and it's totally fixed not costing me any uncessary repair bill, there are 1,000's of uses for this product in and around the home not just for your car.
B00JF92IHK|5|Look great.  Helped dress up an outstanding  car even more!!
B003VDX5D2|5|$37.99, 2 day shipping with Prime Membership. Rated for 300 lbs. Easy install...watch the youtube install first. Marked my holes with whiteout.
B000BZEI5C|5|I went to a auto parts store (A national chain that claims to have the lowest price).  They quoted me 180$ for an Oxygen Sensor.  I found the same one here on Amazon for about $70 less.  I picked the free shipping and it still arrived in about two days.  It was exactly what I needed.  My check engine light is off, I saved money and it arrived promptly.  It doesn't get much better than that!
B000XBGUZ0|5|Installed in a 1999 Kawasaki 1500 Vulcan Drifter motorcycle.  OEM plugs, made in Japan.  Easy to install, used torque wrench.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Awesome product will be using it at work at the dealer ship
B0002NIJPI|5|The same as above. It is a fun pack and lots of our friends like as well! Fantastic, wish there was more of a variety.
B00SYVH7U8|5|Was pleased on how well it went on
B001P2BHI6|5|Worked great with the Reese ball mount I also purchased (Reese 7028100 Class V Heavy Duty Ball Mount) but you'll need a huge socket to tighten it down. 2 7/8&#34; if I remember correctly.
B000O707IO|5|I had trouble getting one particular riding lawn mower battery to take a charge. This charger just reported bad battery & didn't charge at all, I swapped to an older charger to start a charge into the &#34;dead&#34; battery, then swapped to the extreme charger which refused to charge at all, Xtreme charger then did it's thing & brought the &#34;dead&#34;battery back to 100percent charge & battery has functioned normally ever since. Very pleased with the final result.
B00QXLI516|4|Nice kit, super easy install, takes almost a minute!<br /><br />Only so-so part is the chain anchors fit pretty loosely in the truck mounting points, not so loose as to be any kind of safety issue but maybe a noise issue. Guess for something like this they have to have fairly loose tolerances. I may try and work out some sort of cushioning for the anchors to alleviate this.
B007NZ4XIA|4|Fast shipping and looks like a quality part.  It's been installed a few weeks with no problems. I would recommend to others.
B001O1X65A|5|This worked as described to diagnose and replace glow plugs!  Quick and easy.  Definitely a good tool to have on hand for projects around the house, too.
B0081J6VPA|5|Easy installation, my car looks great I could not be happier. Every body has asked me where i bought them. I am very pleased
B009UKUUWE|5|Works great. I'm not a professional by any stretch, but I used this to wax my car in about 20 minutes, and it was a breeze. It's so nice to just run this over the roof rather than trying to reach over and straining to wax the top. I'd say it cut the work by about 80%.  As I get more comfortable with it, I'll probably try and use cutting pads and compounds as well.
B0012RI71Y|4|The only complant that I have is that the pigtail could be about 8\\" longer.  Install was a snap and only took about 10-15 minutes.  Good product.
B00FPFHZTE|5|Impressive output. Forces wildlife to wear sunglasses
B008EK9LYE|5|Works great.  I wanted a charger that was small, unobtrusive and looks good.  This one is all that.  When I installed the unit the upper slot didn't work.  Filled out return with Amazon and literally received a replacement the next day. I have prime so shipping cost nothing either way.
B001P7C7QM|5|Its a great tool to have. I have recommended to other techs in the area as well as in other states
B005HINTGC|5|Cheap fast and it work out just fine....
B005RT0SVU|3|the product is ok. and received it in a short time and planned delivery. but the only thing I can complain is. there was not  the 1 x Free cross screwdriver in the package...I don't why..
B002J8UPO2|5|Love it !!
B007EXMYIC|5|Did not show up on time other than that excellent product
B000FW4LIK|1|This product is not what they advertised. I filled in my make and model and this product did NOT fit. In fact it went flying off on the highway and risked my life when I was travelling at high speeds in bad weather. Don't bother ordering this product. Go to a local store and have someone fit a wiper blade on your car in person.
B008G2CSSG|4|Cables do the trick and were easy to install on my 99 dodge ram.  Nothing much to say they are cables
B000C7LYYM|5|I have used these connectors before and the work very well for low voltage hi amp projects. you can crimp or solder the cable into the terminals. I used this order to setup a removable winch on a Hummer H2
B000B68C0S|3|The last time the handle broke it was a $75 item at the dealership, so bang for your buck this is amazing! My only beef is that no color information or selection option is given for this part and it comes in gray. I needed tan. Easy fix though if it the pewter handle that's broke. Pull the new one out and install in the old housing. Easy pleasy and color cooridinated.
B00L4U0JWE|5|It is a good product. I would encourage people to use tape even when the black will come off the paint.
B0019D1S76|1|Just got the jacket..took the advice of the reviews and ordered one size up. What a joke..not even close to fitting me. Your sizing chart is NEXT TO USELESS. Very disappointing.
B00KMYYS20|5|Provides excellent waterproofing on houseboat party tops
B002QA386A|4|Purchased just one of these to replace my trunk bulb in my 2012 Toyota Camry.  But this bulb would work but I would have to do away with the bulb cover as this bulb is longer.  So I took it back out and used 4x 194 168 5-SMD White High Power LED Car Lights Bulbs.  But there is nothing wrong with the bulb, just a little long for what I needed.
B00SKN9PNC|5|Just installed this tonight. Shipping was fast and like everyone else I'm very happy with this. They need to wrap it better before shipping as it does arrive with some scratches in the paint. If you're a Jeep guy installing your own bumpers then you know how to touch it up. It isn't a big deal. 5 stars it looks great and the install went faster than the stock removal.
B00NJAMTNO|5|Loved the Deer Heart Buck Doe Decal!!! We put our son's name, Lance and his to be bride's name, Amy on it. We used it as the cake topper for their cake at their rehearsal dinner. It was PERFECT!! We had it done in Cammo.  Thank you so much for perfect cake topper and a decal that is now on my son's back window of his truck.
B005H53DHK|2|I placed the order for 6000k bulbs and received 10000k bulbs instead. I also ordered two other sets of 6000ks for my two other vehicles and they were wrong as well I ended up with 10000k and 8000k. They are ok but I preferred 6000k over anything else. Other than that, I did receive the lights in a timely manner so for the price I guess I can't complain to much.
B0016IMSB4|5|Perfect Fit, Perfect Fix!  I first thought my front fan blower had gone out in my 2004 Chevy Tahoe Z71 until I researched online.  I too have the dual climate control.  Discovered this part was all I needed to fix the problem and it worked just as everybody else has said.  Great Relief to fix it so easily & avoid the high cost of dealer repair.  Thanks to all for your reviews.
B00KLELMTS|5|great product just like it said plug and play I installed it on a Wednesday and Friday I picked up my travel trailer my wife plugged the control in then I mounted it Jim
B0028MP0TO|5|First time DIY on my 2009 HHR.  Check Engine Light is now off.  Trouble codes are gone and mpg is up 28 to 30.  I plan on buying the post/cat sensor soon.  I saved over $100 on this top quality product.
B0041U2SUK|5|On my second one; (wife likes to run passenger side of car into things).  Good fit.  Good looks.  Quick installation.
B006EH9WUC|5|Well made, keeps the battery fresh on my rarely used Chevrolet.
B00B7QLESS|5|good
B0041CDPQO|5|Worked perfectly.  No problems with devices plugging in (and staying in) for power.  Arrived on time also.
B003VASGOS|5|Good
B003JHFRPO|1|Haven't even had these 4 months and already the &#34;weather tech&#34; label is falling off.  These are sharp looking floor mats, but take the nice logo away, and you spent a lot of money on no name mats.  Of course it's out of the return period.  Very unhappy.
B00JIIZCM6|5|I have a goat sheep bag which is fragile and easy to get dirty. This product is so good. I could clean my bag without a little damage.
B0040M31H8|5|Just what I wanted and the pic is what you get.
B00F8Q99E4|1|Installed and the ballasts went out after a few hours of use. Worked great when it did work but quality of ballasts is questionable.
B000CK5QHA|5|Excellent, I am very satisfied with this order. Couldn't find a better deal at a better price and have this excellent product.
B0089T0T8C|4|My blow motor resistor went our in my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Two screws to swap out the part. It look a couple of minutes.
B00OSB2CUS|5|Very happy with this product, great fit on my 2015  F-150 and very easy to install. Great cover at a great price.
B001AH8IMO|5|Easy to install and great product.
B001N1E9Y8|3|sucky at first but after that they work real well do clean guns very well at first before you start useing
B0002V9IFU|5|Good quality leather cleaner and conditioner.  Worked well on a leather sofa and car seats. The only issue I had was that it leaked during delivery, but Amazon had it in a plastic bag so there wasn't a huge mess.
B000CCMLD0|4|I thought it would be a bigger can. The product works well, just would like the can to be larger for the price.
B007H2PGOE|5|I found this product to be very good. Have used it before and found it here for a great price.
B007ZDG5U4|5|this really made a difference with my new rims for my hummer. it gave it that look i was looking for...
B008R5NWR8|4|My son has only worn these one time so far. They are a little tighter than expected and my son is quite thin. But he loves them. They do seem to be the right size for my 9 yr old who wears a size 3 shoe.
B007CVSBL0|4|These are very easy to install, it takes about a minute or two per hook.  You only need a large phillips screwdriver.  They're also nice looking and perfectly match a black bedliner.  They seem very solid, the ring &#34;locks&#34; in the up position, or can be set flush with the rail.  My only complaint (reason for 4 stars) is one of my 4 hooks was missing the bolt that holds it in!!!
B00BLZBCL4|5|They were strong and worked really well. Very good design. Also, quantity was great for the price.
B00FYJSRN4|4|Good gaiters for a light user.  We got these for a trip because they were inexpensive compared to some others, so it depends on how much money you wish to spend and how hard you will use them.  We used our for hiking and glissading on Mt. Saint Helen's.  They did okay, but did eventually unstrap themselves in the rough terrain during the night.  During glissading, they did keep our boots and socks dry of snow and ice.  These are light weight material, one-size fits all.
B00DOLOGC0|5|excellent product!!
B00N11DURK|5|Excellent upgrade if you need to change your brake fluid.  Improved pedal feel.  I use in all my German cars.
B001EP0GOK|5|I bought this for my 2011 GMC Acadia. Good quality I can feel right out of the box. It fits perfectly to my Acadia. The only obvious thing you can see after installation is the 2\\" square hitch receiver head. Anything else is well hidden under the car (check out the picture I up-loaded). It is not difficult to install, although can be a little tricky when torque down the screws. I'm glad to have this on my car.<br /><br />As for the installation part, the holes already exist on the beams in the car, therefore no need to drill holes to install. I spent only about 5 minutes to attach the whole thing to the car, but almost an hour to torque down the screws to the spec. Here are the steps for your information:<br /><br />1. remove the bumper cover at where the hitch receiver is.<br /><br />2. remove the exhaust pipe's rubber insulators<br />so you can lower down the pipe for easy access to the pre-drilled holes for installation. There are 2 rubber insulators for each pipe, one at each side of the pipe. They can be removed by hand by simply pushing (apply some grease on the rail helps greatly)<br /><br />3. I had to use the 2 bolts for the back bean under the lift gate, for there is no pre-welded nuts on my Acadia. The access holes are just a little too small to fit the bolt head, so I had to grind about 1-mm off one side of the bolt head in order to let the bolt go thru the access hole. Use the fishwire provided in the package to set the bolts into the holes.<br /><br />3. Pick up the hitch receiver frame, align with the pre-drilled holes on the car<br />You need to push around a little to get the frame to the pre-drilled holes aligned. Be careful, the whole thing is about 30 pounds. I sat on the ground, raised the whole thing and sat the frame on my legs to do the alignment. My son crawled underneath the car to guide me with the alignment. Once holes are aligned, he helped to finger-tight the screws for me.<br /><br />4. Torque down the screws to the specified values<br />Once the screws are finger-tight in place use a torque wrench to tighten the screws to the torque specified. The screws are not that easily accessible by the big torque wrench. I used extension bars, swivel joints, etc. to get it done. It's not easy to apply heavy-duty torque at an angle. Maybe someone can teach me how to do that easily...?<br /><br />5. Put the exhaust pipes back in place<br />re-install the rubber insulators to put the pipes back in place. Again, it will be a lot easier if some grease applied to the rails.<br /><br />6. Done!ench to tighten the screws to the torque specified.

B0058W7VE8|5|Very good! It was exactly what I  was looking for. I am very pleased with the amount of time and the purchase Thank you.
B00BQS7BJS|1|Plug this fan up and nothing happing. Doesn't even fit my 2 door manual coupe
B0013LH6W0|5|Exactly as advertised, flawless condition and looks better than expected.
B002K6K3RM|3|I bought these bulbs just over one year ago to replace the factory bulbs in my 2008 VW GLI with 72,000 miles on it. One year later, the right bulb has died after just 10,000 miles. I think I will try a Sylvania or Phillips D2S bulb this time around.
B008EX2PQC|5|i got them on time ...perfect size i just love it
B008M5ISGS|5|I have a 1998 Acura GSR. It was idling weird. I had a Skunk2 intake manifold and a stock throttle body. I checked and it didn't have an external vacuum leak that Acura dealer could not figure out my problem. I talked to Skunk2 and they said it was a internal vacuum leak from my throttle body. I put this on and it fixed it plus i feel a slight improvement in performance. Thanks Skunk2 for an awesome product and most importantly the help to fix my idle problem.
B00CMUD8E6|5|Product arrived quickly and fit flawlessly into the filter tray. Takes just a couple of minutes to install. I will definitely order another one when the need arises.
B003NBFMMY|5|We used it for 2000 mile road trip. The cargo bag worked perfectly - although we only had a minor snowfall on the way. It is also good to prevent dust. Very sturdy too.
B0087XOTWW|5|I put these in my high mount brake light on my truck and was actually surprised how bright they are in day and night.
B000E283VC|5|Fit perfectly, excellent quality, made in USA too.
B004J2DHDW|4|Easy to install.
B0016GVKAG|5|I recently used this product to scrape the sleet off my windshield and then used the snow brush to clear the window from what I scraped off the windshield.  I enjoyed being able to clean most of the window with the length the telescopic feature provided  from one side of the windshield, and then being able to walk around the vehicle to complete the rest of job was real handy.  This product seems to be built solid when used at the extended length, and the handle has a comfortable grip with the product in use with gloves on, while you work to clear your windshield or any window that's covered with ice or snow.
B001GLSL0S|5|another tool
